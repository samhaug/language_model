{"1Xt1gZfZ2Rw": "waxing your skis is the best way to protect them and keep them performing at their peak you'll need clean towels rubbing alcohol your favorite wax a plastic scraper a set of brushes and a waxing iron it's best to use a specifically designed waxing iron because the iron you use at home could burn the wax or your base place your skis on your ski vise if you don't have a vise you can use a couple stacks of books to balance your ski be sure to lock your ski breaks up and out of the way you may need a rubber band for this use rubbing alcohol in a clean towel to prepare the base for wax if your bases are visibly dirty brush them off with a wire brush before using the alcohol make sure you brush wax and scrape from tip to tail heat up the iron until it's just warm enough to melt the wax then drip a line of wax down the ski if the wax begins to smoke the iron is too hot let it cool before starting again work the wax into the ski from tip to tail making sure it reaches the edges if it doesn't add more wax keep the iron moving at an even speed you should see a trail of molten wax about three to five inches behind the iron if you move too fast the wax won't fully penetrate into the base if you're too slow it could burn or blister the base material after three or four passes with the iron this skis top sheet should feel warm let the whole ski cool completely back to room temperature this is a great time to wax the other steam once the ski is cooled use a plastic scraper at a 45-degree angle to scrape off the excess wax use long overlapping strokes with firm even pressure you know you're done scraping when you're not getting any more wax shavings you'll want to remove wax from the sidewalls and edges as well make sure to use the short ends of the scraper so you don't dull the scraping ends next comes the brushing the base of the ski has tiny channels called structure which move water out as you ski brushing clears the wax from the structure make several full-length tip-to-tail passes using your nylon brush use good even pressure and keep brushing until you're no longer seen wax dust coming off finish up with a good polish with your horsehair brush the more passes you make the better the result you can't brush too much to recap start with clean skis spread wax thoroughly over the whole base scrape the extra wax off and finish up with your brushes", "bLfBiHgIrjo": "[Music] hi my creative friends its will ever hear from my studio and today I want to introduce you to the new very exciting products either art alchemy matte waxes absolutely new things something that we are introducing on the market and I want to show you what kind of beautiful effects you can get with this antiquing OPAC cousins of the metallic wax you can use them together with gesso or a little bit of sprays or pace you can use them with metallic paint or you can use them with tissue papers you can just let your imagination flow and I hope after the presentation you are going to be as excited as I am I just want to show you six colors of art alchemy matter waxes please join me so here there are there are six colors of art alchemy match boxes they are antiquing a park products which are permanent after drying and they are very similar in the base to our metallic waxes so the consistency the concept of the product is the same but the finish is completely different we've got shiny and very mmm metallic looking waxes and then we've got our Palace and waxes these are flat plain no shimmer at all so these colors as you can see them they are all inspired by the colors of patina and natural dirt or soot or charcoal and then colors of rust they are some kind of a cross between the colors I made for patina sets or rust based set I wanted to create similar finish but without the texture and with the possibilities and advantages of the wax so something that hopefully will make people really happy and the look is going to be the friend so let me show you the colors on the samples I started coloring here you can see I'm using one of my art basics brushes so the first color is rusty brown and I'm just adding that on the top of the element I made in my mold I covered this with clear wax so sorry clear gesture so this is going to be nice matte finish it was resin before so resins they are very slippery that's why it is much better to paint on them or wax them if they are having coat of just on the top now rusty red you can see the colors just don't compare brown and red you can see they're completely completely flat then charcoal black color which is almost a graphite with a little bit of blue in it maybe you can see on my black mat it is more greyish graphite right so it's still going to be visible if you're going to put it on the black gesso mm-hm charcoal black then we've got patina blue the color which is inspired by the aged copper or brass sorry I put too much meat finally patina green [Applause] [Music] and then white and I'm afraid white is not going to be very visible but I hope you're going to just see at least a bit of it you can see because I used the resin which is a little bit yellowish so even now when I'm applying this white it's not very visible but you can see this is easy so once you use the brushes of course there will be questions how to clean them after it's just like any other wax you need to use hot water and some kind of detergent such as dishwashing liquid or soap or shampoo this is going to work these are going to dry permanent but before they will dry you'll have a little bit of the working time and you can try to remove a little bit of that color to get kind of interesting effects you can see I'm wiping that off revealing a bit of the background color which i think is very cool and because they are not exactly the same as the waxes of the metallic effect you may have a bit of the background color showing once you wipe it because there's pigment in it that pigment may also stain your fingers so be careful this is especially true to the red and the brown they have quite strong pigmentation but just look how cool the effects may be if you're going to wipe it quickly okay and then finally the brown the brown is really aggressive color [Music] so this is one of the ideas how you can use them in your projects I will put them here on the side now so they can drive properly and in the meantime I will show you how you can use on the other surfaces I got prepared of course so I've got some of the elements that have a little bit more of texture than the moon's had so I put wings and I painted them with different mediums this is painted with black gesso this one is painted with white gesso so you can see that then I've got wing which is colored with art alchemy metallic wax and I've got two one wing which is colored with our alchemy metallic paint so this acrylic paint and I've got one wing which is painted with art alchemy liquid acrylics which is shiny semi-transparent paint so I want you to see how the colors are going to work on the top so let's start maybe with the white gesso why just would be good to apply some of the darker colors on the top so maybe I will just try a little bit with the red rust and just move my finger I can very easily oh that's some highlight okay that was too much I have to remove more but I'm sure you can see what is happening let's add some of the brown on the top this is going to get some darker tones and this way very quickly you can get antiquing effect so this is one of the options the second would be of course full coverage so you take color on your brush and you go deeper in the colors on the dresser just like we did before this is the full coverage and then if you want to you can take off part of that color and then from the tops it's going to remove the top of the wax remember don't wait too long when it is dry it's permanent and waterproof okay so that just on the white gesso on the block just so let's try the color this is going to be maybe green or blue so you will see how it's going to cover on the color that is quite a dark as you can see with the blue and the green we can get really quick and nice results and of course I could do the same thing as we did of the brush and removing the excess iWatch I can try here still just few minutes of the working time so don't wait too long it's better to apply it and then continue right away of the colors of your choice so that is I'm taking effect on the black gesso I think it's really cool now let's try how is it going to work on the acrylic paints acrylic paints this is a metallic acrylic paint I pick the closest called rustic Brown and I think rustic Brown we can try with something lighter let's see of the white right you can see white is giving you this nice delicate touch of color and of course another good tip you can mix these colors with each other alright so if you think this gray is too grey I would like to have it very light don't be afraid put these two colors together like on the palette and you can get medium gray right for example like this and then you can apply it to the project so they work like paints as long as they are going to be wet after drawing you can layer one color on the top of another so I hope this is giving you some more inspiration to play let's add some of this new gray here on the project mm-hmm why not we tried the white one let's try on the liquid acrylics this is very bright so maybe we will try with something softer again maybe a little bit of white color just tone it down a little bit you can see application is super easy and I'm sure the white one is going to be great add-on for those of you who are more on the shabby-chic side of the mixed-media and you would like to use it for adding this nice velvety matte finish to something because hmm this is giving you a lot of possibilities I just said let's compare this is acrylic paint and this is a chronic pain but this was metallic this was under liquid acrylics finally we've got the wax so we are going to apply I'm sorry wax on wax and let's take maybe this patina colors would be good for that part of the demo so let's imagine this metal is going to get some aged look I think it is very cool and of course it's no problem you can add more than one color and you can put more layers the more dry it is the more you can layer one on the top of another if you'd like to get more of the saturation just wait let it dry a little bit and then you can continue wax on wax how cool is this so we tried it on the dress so we tried it on the acrylic paints and we tried it on the wax we can of course also try it on the top of the same kind of wax we have here the moons you can see what is going to happen it should be dry enough now to play so let's say maybe I would like to make this one a little bit darker with this charcoal color as you can see there's no problem at all to layer one on the top of another if you want to even mix one with another yep and maybe we're going to add some green tones here to this black one charcoal black with green [Music] no problems with application and if you think this is not covering enough probably remove too much of the dress so you just need to put a thicker coat or wait and repeat so if they work with other waxes and they walk or work with just self and with acrylic paints so what is important here because their waxes they don't really they are not really happy to be used before the paints so it's the same style of the metallic waxes they are finishing product they seal themselves they are permanent they don't need any varnishes they will just act as a topcoat by themselves so and this is the last product you usually want to put on your project so this is important to remember that and I hope you are going to have a lot of fun with them so now I will just clean my hands and I will show you some of the finished effects with these boxes so of course I prepared some products to show you how they look after application this is one of the projects that I made as a color swatch this is combination of the acrylic paint and green patina which I and hint of the blue patina these two together and as you can see it really works like the natural patina till that happens on the metal to compare I have one which has more of the bluish tone in it it's absolutely amazing so you can see more into greens and turquoise more into the blue and I did the same thing after application I removed part of the wax with my fingers so you can get look like that very easily with the matte and waxes from art alchemy collection then let's have a look at this sample this is black charcoal I added a little bit of the background colors to make it more interesting they're some liquid acrylics and then he'll black charcoal wax on the top of the Jess ode project very quick and very effective next project this is example of red rust and brown rust colors and again a little bit of the background liquid acrylics white gesso and then we've got our match box doing the antiquing effect you can rub off a little bit to highlight the details and done very very quickly finally this is an example of the white works I picked blue and purple colors and I used them World bit of water for the background as well after that I applied my white old old white matte wax and you can see how nicely the highlights work on the top of my composition so just look at the possibilities finally we've got project which is an example of the finished look this is combination of the waxes there was a bit of the background spraying I wanted to have some color on my tissue paper so there were some a bit of dark dark red and some oranges but all these colors here all these details they were waxed with these three colors of the wax Brown rust red rust and black charcoal after that was dry and after I removed part of it in some spaces I used a bit of the traditional metallic works the one that you know well so I was using aged brass on the top just to pretend all these elements are in fact metal partly metal this one is but other ones there are mul elements or they're cheap boards and they'd really look like metal pieces on my journal cover the moment so absolutely cool effect something that those people who long grunt may want to try so that is so easy to do and I want to show you how you can do it by yourself because making a product like that is very rewarding and I've got my sample ready this is the one that I made already doing Facebook live show and we're going to use similar canvas something that they pre-made and we are going to play with the colors on the top so I hope you are ready so what I want to do I want to play mostly with the black charcoal to add depth to the project and to create a feeling that there is a lot of shadow a lot of grease or dirt in all these cracks of the project and maybe I will introduce some other colors as well and to make it a little bit more interesting I will start with a tiny bit of the permanent paint before so maybe let's get some colors that will be adding some life to the products on shades of green I'm taking liquid acrylics so a bit of green and maybe a bit of blue and turquoise now I'm going to take water and water sprayer because I want the colors to float mix easily and with the brush I'm just going to apply colors in some of the almost like random places so some of the green and some of the darker green as well it's turquoise that's a good start just playing with the colors to have some initial colorful edge and water is going to take it into different parts of the canvas as you can see playing this way is very easy and it's kind of great exercise if you are not able to let go the control over the project because it's hard to predict where the paint are going to go in the background there's a bit of stenciling I did with one of my new stencils and now before I'm going to apply the waxes I will just dry it with the heat gun and the paint is going to turn completely permanent so I can rub it without any fear that something will come off canvas is dry I've got really lovely background all that with just a bit of acrylics and water so the liquid acrylic if you're really strong colors they're very strong and now I can start applying my antiquing waxes I will start with a charcoal black and I will try to go as deep as possible into my project and because it's really hot down on the canvas still I used my heat gun a lot you can say it's almost like melting but no worries is going to get better so remember about not very long working time that's why especially on the canvas I will try to wipe it and blend it in before it is going to be too late and I'm going to wipe it off from some of the details tailed like to see for example top of the star you can see what I'm doing yeah so let me continue let's go here into this big hog and I will take a smaller very old brush if I want to get later with some into some details but now I'm really tempted to introduce another color and I think I'm going to go with a bit of blue so I'm going to add some of the blue and chicken wax as well much waxes are going to be completely permanent after drying so there was no worry that something will rub off when you are going to touch it it naturally maybe some green as well in some parts of that background [Music] so I'm rubbing everything with my baby wipe and my finger and because I got white dressed so under I can reveal part of the details the very very tops of my elements if I want to and then the wax stays only in the bottom part of the project which i think is very very cool what I can do now I can go deeper in the parts they missed with the big brush so there will be no annoying spots and I will add more shadow [Music] remember to use very old brush that you are not going to use for painting anymore it's good to have some of these at home just in case if you're going to have some glue or some wax to put in the selected places this is how it looks after waxing now we can work on a little bit on the highlights one of the options would be using the white wax maybe a little bit on the face will make it lighter maybe on the wing on the tops it's very subtle effect you don't really need to put a lot to highlight and you can feel with your finger exactly where you want to go [Music] and if you feel that this color palette is too boring you can try adding some contrasting colors of course this no problem if you would like to break it with some Browns or with some Reds it will be really cool but my plan is also to add some highlights and I think I'm going to use a tiny bit of the matte metallic wok this is vintage gold this is too yellow maybe some old silver or maybe white gold would be probably the best solution if I can find that yeah it's here Oh perfect so maybe just in some mechanical parts [Music] for example like this so there are many options of finishing that you can work with whatever you like I'm think I'm going to add more white and remember these are permanent so once they are dry you can put more layers on the top and play a little bit more what you like I hope this video is going to help you understand the math waxes and the combinations you can get with them I think they're really inspiring and I'm so excited to have them finally as a part of my line of art alchemy waxes these are really adding something completely new to the range this is the look that you couldn't get with anything else and it's something that it's adding extra depth and this grungy and tiki feeling to your old project thank you for watching let me know what you think don't forget to subscribe to the channel ring the bell to make sure you won't miss any videos I'll stay tuned because there's more video coming soon thank you it is Philip are from my studio and I wish you a wonderful creative time [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "JYLZSu5jn5k": "[Music] hey everybody happy wax on wednesdays i've got a lot of questions lately about fusing the first layers of your board flat so i thought this would be a good week to really just kind of go back to basics and go over how i get the flat base layers before i begin my painting i'm starting out today with a 10 by 10 wood cradle board i've already taped off the sides and i'm just slightly warming the board with my heat gun now if you use a torch this is it's the same just keep your torch away from the wood a little bit you don't want to scorch the wood but just lightly slightly warm the board and you can see i'm putting my hand there to see if i'm just gently warming it i've got it on a very low a low setting right now my heat gun and i would do the same if i had my torch just very low slightly warming the board this is going to help with getting out any air bubbles it's going to help in you can see as i lay it down there it's also going to help to smoothly add that wax because wax of course is going to solidify immediately as soon as it hits a cold surface so by slightly warming your board then you have a little bit more time to get that wax down before it's going to solidify so before your brush starts skipping on you if you've ever had that feeling when you were adding the base layers that your brush is skipping on you it's solidifying it's not letting you lay a nice smooth layer down it's because your surface is very cold and your wax is solidifying very quickly so by slightly warming that board up you have more time and the bigger the piece the bigger your uh your cradle board if you just slightly warm um say that the part that you're working on it'll help ensure a nice smooth layer going down now you can see that i am gently fusing again i've got it on a very low setting here my heat gun and i'm fusing out all of the air bubbles and all of the brush strokes all at the same time this is what i call over fusing and i'm fusing this to basically a liquified puddle and um not to the point where it's just all going to run off the board but it is uh over fusing i won't have to fuse it this much for the rest of the painting this is this first few layers i want to ensure that i get all those air bubbles out i want to ensure that i get all the brush strokes out the lumps the bumps i can always go add texture back in later on purposefully i want to make sure that i have a nice flat base to begin my painting with fusing my second layer in you can see that my wrist is going in small circles all around this board and then i'm not keeping my heat gun in the same place too long and a lot of times when you're first beginning starting out that's the mistake you make is honing in on a certain bubble or bump or lump and the wax if you keep the heat implement whether you're using a torch or a heat gun if you keep it in the same place too long the wax is going to spread right back down to the wood and you're going to end up with a much bigger blemish than the one that you were trying to concentrate on so by going over small circles all around the board and just doing it gently over several minutes and not being too anxious just gently going over the entire board you will liquify each area and all of the air bubbles and the lumps and bumps and brush strokes will come right out now here on this third layer i usually add it depends on the size of the board in this case of a 10 by 10 usually four to six layers of white encaustic paint i add um you don't have to add white encaustic paint you can add any color that you want including clear so it's whatever works the best with your type of painting this is the base layer for any type of encaustic painting so whether you are abstract or still life landscape whatever that year type of encaustic that you're working on this serves for all purposes except for laying a a photograph or a collage down first this is the base layers that you're going to be starting out with so you can start out with any color that you like if you'd like to start out with black if that works for your painting method then start out with black clear white whatever color that you're working on this is the same method that you would use to achieve nice flat base layers especially if you're going to be doing a photo transfer this is very uh very important that you get everything flat with no air bubbles and no brush strokes no lumps no bumps as you go and you can see that i am fusing in between each and every layer that i add i'm making sure that that surface is flat with no air bubbles no lumps no bumps each and every layer so i'm not packing on a bunch of layers and then trying to fuse it all out i'm doing a building as i go and i'm fusing every single layer as i go now right now as you heat and as you begin to add these layers the board is going to remain warm warmer and warmer each layer of wax that you add it's going to remain warm for a longer period of time so it's going to take longer for that wax to solidify the more layers that you add so you can see there i was testing the board with my gloved hand to make sure that the board was cool enough that i could add another way layer of wax each base layer that i add and if i'm adding say six five or six base layers i'm really going to start checking that board and having to wait just a bit longer for that wax to solidify in between layers because the board is going to remain warm and you can test this out by say after you've added your third or fourth layer you can lift your board and feel underneath and feel that that center of the wood is still very very very warm and that's because the wood is retaining this heat it's got several layers of wax of hot wax on it and the wood is now retaining that heat so it's going to take a little bit longer to solidify and you really want to wait until that wax is hardened before you go and add another layer of wax and the reason is if you add another layer too soon you'll just be dragging your brush dragging that wax right off the board again and this is another frustration that a lot of new students get is that they want to add that wax a little bit faster get their layer base layers down a little bit faster and if your board is too warm even though it looks solidified that hot brush with that hot wet wax going back on the board is going to end up dragging off more wax than it's adding because it's immediately liquefying the wax that's on the board so wait just that couple extra minutes and make sure that your wax is solidified all the way through before you go and add your next layer of wax now here i have a case where there's a little bit of debris in my wax so i'm just going to dig it out with tweezers or a toothpick and this is probably some debris from not from filtering the um the encaustic medium it still has a little bit of the forest debris from the damar resin in it so i'm just going to go that didn't get filtered out so i'm just going to go ahead and pick that right out and fuse it right back up it's no big deal now that i've have everything nice and fused flat just picking out a little bit of those bumps is just really easy and it's easy to go back and fuse everything nice and flat again [Music] so of course in this video i'm not showing the 15 minutes or so that i waited between this next layer to before i went and added more wax so know that as i go between these layers i am waiting a few minutes in between each time and i don't want to bore you to death with that but i'm waiting a few minutes in between each layer so as i go maybe between the first and second layer it was maybe five minutes and as i go between the fourth and sixth layer i would say i probably waited about 15 minutes before i went and added the next layer and i check my board i check it on top i check it underneath because i really want to make sure that my wax is solid before i go ahead and add that next layer of wax and you can see here too that i am still going in circles around around the board and my board is nice and warm so i'm not getting all those bubbles that i did in the first layer and that's another thing that you can see as well is that the first layer i added i got a lot of air bubbles um not a tremendous amount because i did warm my board but there are still quite a few there and now on this fourth fifth layer there's not quite as many air bubbles though the board is still warm and and there's not as many to fuse out as there was before and also not as many lumps and bumps and a lot of people will um ask me if they can add the four or five wax layers and then fuse out the bumps and the the lumps and the bumps and the brush strokes and i really would advise against it because it's like a snowball so the more that you wax that you add over that lump or that bump the bigger it's going to get it's like a snowball effect so by fusing each layer nice and flat as you go you're going to make sure that you really have a nice flat board to begin with and it's going to save you a lot of headaches in the end before you begin your painting you can also see that i've changed a little bit in the way that i'm fusing the board and i'm going long strokes up and down and that is because i all the waxes is liquefied and i really want to make sure that everything is flat and sometimes it will tend to bunch up in some areas maybe from the heat gun the air blowing on the heat gun or even the torch the torch will begin to separate the wax and have it lump up so by going back and forth in these long strokes up and down back and forth i'm in also ensuring that that wax is nice and flat and again you didn't see it but i did wait 15 minutes in between this last layer of wax now if you prefer a torch instead of a heat gun this is the exact same process i would put my torch on low and really just take my time and fuse every single layer the exact same way as i do my heat gun i find a lot of times it's beneficial to have a prep day where i'm working on maybe four or five boards at once i like to paint on more than one board at a time so i like to just use a whole day and prep a bunch of these boards and that way when i'm waiting 15 minutes in between 15 20 minutes depending on the size in between each layer when i get further down the line i can just switch off push that board aside and fuse the next board and that way i'm doing a bunch of boards at once and i get a lot of boards done at one time this also works if i'm working on a much larger piece then i'm going to wait even longer in between layers so if i'm working on a much larger larger panel then i can do a bunch of smaller ones in between while i'm waiting for that layer on the larger board to solidify so if i'm working on a much larger piece then i can get a bunch of smaller ones done while i wait [Music] there's also no rule of how many base layers that you have to put down so if i am putting four to six layers on a 10 by 10 that's just my choice and you can put as many base layers down as is needed for your type of painting so this is just my little rule of thumb that works for me and for my painting process but you can certainly put anything any amount of layers down for your base layers that you see fit that's going to to add to your process so it depends on what you're adding to the painting and how you're going what your painting process requires so for me for this size four to six layers works out perfectly now here i am again with the long strokes both up and down and back and forth really making sure that that wax is nice and flat and i do get down get down to eye level of my work table and really make sure that there's no lumps no hills there that everything is nice and flat and i do that between each layer that i add as well just to check myself and make sure that everything is as flat as it looks from overhead so if you're just joining us here on wax on wednesdays i really hope that this video is helpful to you and if also if you're just joining us on the channel there are several places that you can join me for further encaustic instruction and i have a full line called encosticology online workshops on my website at sherryriplogical.com and you can also join me every single week on the patreon channel for where i actually go through just like this step by step through each video and let you know how i go about doing every single painting that's on wax on wednesdays so the links are right below the video if you would like to check any of that out and i hope that you'll subscribe and come back every wednesday to see what we are making here in the wonderful world of encaustic we will see you next wednesday and happy wax on wednesdays [Music] you", "60fMIMdQBAw": "hi this is prema and we are here with an intro 101 video to introduce you to our waxes now these waxes are part of the finna bear mixed-media line and we're going to pretend you've never seen these before and give you the whole write-up on thin of your waxes and what colors are available and how they work in the properties the best ways to apply etcetera so finna bear creates the mixed-media line under the Prima umbrella of designers and you'll find that the art alchemy medley quacks Azhar one of the products that are absolutely amazing to work with so these are metallic beeswax based pace they're very hard um no they're not runny they're not soft they're they're on the harder end like that and they can be applied with a brush or a finger or a stencil brush anything like that now they come in different colors the metalic line is gonna come with eight colors as you can see here old silver brushed iron rose gold vintage gold white gold H brass rich copper and bronze age now there are other waxes vinegar has anti brilliance line and opal magic line a matte wax line as well as trendy fashion colors so there's a variety of waxes so subscribe to the Prima marketing ink YouTube channel so that you get notified when these videos get uploaded and hopefully we'll be able to do an intro video for each line of the waxes alright so now that you know a little bit about these let's go ahead and starts watching them so I created a little diagram here and what I'm going to do is pull one out at a time and we're gonna swatch it on paper white paper black paper and then I'll show you on watercolor paper I've done some ahead so this is what the packaging looks like you can see it's fin of air art alchemy and the metal ii klein is gonna give you a metal finish so it's metal colors and there is a lot in this little tin and we're gonna let's start playing with it the best that way to start applying is to use a stencil brush no I there are a variety of sizes from small medium and large these are my favorites to use they are also in the fin of airline or you can use your finger it just depends on what you're applying it on so let's go ahead and pull out the old silver I've already pre opened mine you can see that one's pretty full now I've had these waxes this might be my second tin but since they've been released they do stay soft enough to apply but they're also created so when they are exposed to air they start to dry in seal so you do not have to seal these waxes they will seal themselves let me just show you a sample real quick so this is a metal lid that I applied waxes over a stencil stick install stencil it does not rub off and I also applied blue wax on the glass again this is my water jar I travel with it so I've used it quite a bit once it's sealed it is permanent so that poses a little bit of a problem when you leave your wax open a lot it can start to harden so just make sure you seal that up and if you have the foam on the inside of the lid don't throw that that actually will help you keep the seal tighter alright but again like any product it is created to dry and seal itself so if it's a full years old and you open it up it might be dry we try to keep it you know walk that fine line between making it easy to use and giving you a long life with the products alright so I'm gonna just take a little bit with the smaller stencil brush this is old silver and I like to just get a little bit off on my brush and then I go into my lid and swirl it around that just helps the product disperse on the brush easier and gives me a more even finish so what can you put the waxes on well you can see I'm just putting it on this is just clean on printer paper there is gonna be a sheen a slight sheen on this and but you can also use metal wax I'm sorry the wax can be applied on multiple surfaces glass metal which I already showed you and paper of course but try wood it can be used on resin chipboard plastic almost any surface you can think of test it first and see how it looks okay so here we have it on there I just want to show you I also applied it on watercolor paper just to show you it's gonna give just a little bit of a different finish on everything you put it on so I think the watercolor paper looks a bit darker compared to the printer paper which is I think very accurate for what it looks like when you apply it like on metal furniture hardware these are really popular in the DIY furniture line and our redesign ambassadors love these so let me try it on just some black paper and look at that that beautiful so I would say the metal week if you're looking at waxes and say which one should I buy first the metal leak is what you should buy first honestly it gives you the nicest variety for adding finish touches to say your molded pieces that's one of my favorite things to use them on no I am cleaning my brush out let me just show you real quickly I just use paper towel and I swirl it around until I get most of that out now I'm gonna go ahead and use the same brush for the next one cuz it's a similar color family so let's we're gonna be jostling our papers around just a little bit so brushed iron is next I would just say this is a bit darker it's a darker silver you can see them next to each other one is a lighter true silver and this is more of a Terkel silver or as they say brushed iron we get the right lid again i'm i just like to swirl this and brush around make sure it's nice and even a pretty book of that right there now you can see the two silvers kind of side by side this and then let's go ahead and add it to black while we're at it again that gives you a really nice look of the difference between the two over always clean your brush out these are created to harden after they've been exposed to air so you don't want to leave them on your brushes you don't have to be super super effective with cleanings I have left a little bit on my brushes before and when I go to pick up more wax I have another color mixed in which is really cool if you like to create your own colors so yeah they can be blended together alright so those are those two colors and then on watercolor paper pretty similar all right so we've done old silver and brushed iron let's get out the golds there are three different gold rose vintage and white and they are very different let me just pop the tops off real quickly there's that little foamy thing I do keep it in in mine as much as I can sometimes when I'm traveling and demoing I lose one but keep it in there it just helps you seal it better so rose vintage and white gold they're very very different let's go ahead and swatch these so we'll start with the rose gold I'm just a little bit out of here I love the rose gold it is so pretty and of all the metals this the only one with you know really kind of a bit of a fashion color that it has a bit of the rose color in there the rest are true well it you know it is a true metal it's just I love it because it's it's such a cool color okay let's do the vintage gold oh I didn't do it on black I have to remember to swatch on black let's go ahead and do the rose gold on black now these black cards are just little ATC type cards Infini bears line their grapes are dying and sampling on so I'd love to pull those out to swatch things alright so the next brush let's do vintage gold look at my chain just a tiny little bit swirl it around do it on black first this time and then maybe I won't forget so you can definitely see this is a true gold it does have a bit of a vintage essence too their goal can be so diverse from brassy to shiny this is a beautiful gold it's really really pretty let's look at that on different surfaces all right we're just gonna keeps watching I'll try to clean my brush in between next up is the white gold and my paper when you're playing with mix media you know how your hands get and your paper cuts it's just gonna get messy that's okay we're just gonna have fun swatching so I'm grabbing a new stencil brush just get a little bit on there we might need a little bit more and it looks like I had stuff on my brush again that just happens white gold is so pretty I would say it is definitely very delicate look at that I this is one of my favorites too I love this color look at that so if you want to see it next to vintage gold there you go you got the vintage gold and the white gold beautiful and your rose gold of course so three different golds all totally different there was the white the vintage and the rose gold and then let me grab our last three all right for our last three we're gonna do aged brass rich copper and bronze age so here we go with the colors let me just show you what the lids open so you get a better view so we have aged brass rich copper and bronze age so you can see they're very very different let's start with aged brass just gonna pick up a little bit there now I think these three are the most usable for Hardware outside of the gold and silver eye these are amazing colors and of course your metal in whether it's in your house or wherever you are working on metal glass etc you can match to what you have in your house and match the metal work or your finishings with these metal waxes so one little tin is gonna go a long way and give you so many options no matter what you're working on like I said you can put it on metal glass you can do it resin so if you're molding pieces with our molds which we have in the fin of airline the memory hardware line our redesign line and some of our paper lines you pop those out and no matter what you make them once you paint them and then touch the accents the details with the waxes and they're just gonna be amazing brilliant so these little waxes the pots lasts quite a long time need one more brush alright bronze is another personal favorite to me did I keep saying that with all the colors I do love it it's just very very beautiful oops here we go let's try it on black look at that alright so we just did bronze rich copper H brass we did it on white and on the black so let me just set this down I know you can't see the whole thing my camera I put it quite zoomed in so that we could get a nice close-up of all the colors so these are the the eight colors that are available for metally quacks --is and I can show you real quickly they were old silver brushed iron and rose gold let's back that up just a little bit then we had vintage gold and white gold aged brass rich copper and bronze age alright so these are the metal eat waxes by Finn aver you can find them at any retailer that sells prima there are eight different colors so go ahead and grab them and then stay tuned for more videos on our introduction to mixed-media line thank you as I said you can definitely apply these with your finger or with your stencil brush you can keep it in the palm of your hand if you want to rub off a little and keep it warm so that you can always go back in and grab it from the palm of your hand it would be nice and warmed up for ease of spreading now when you're putting it on with your finger you are just going to catch the details on the piece with a brush it's gonna give you more coverage so fuller coverage but use your fingers for catching molded so this is simply hot wax or a hot glue molded piece from one of our prima molds our redesigned molds and I just added the white gold wax on top of it and you can see others here this one has aged brass rich copper and old silver again these are all molded pieces from the prima molds they're painted with sparks paints or black gesso and then once that paint dries you add your wax on so they go from something that is you know just cost pennies to a beautiful embellishment and all of them are made possible just by using thin ABARES metal e quacks --is", "kYuuI5-_UpQ": "all right guys we're back we're gonna do a little update and check up on the six waxes i put on my hood i'm gonna show you what it looks like now that i've driven it for about a week through some rain truck dust everything that's on the freeway and then we're going to wash the vehicle i'm going to use actually iron x soap which is a strong cleaning soap here and i'm going to wash the whole vehicle but we're going to put this on the hood and see if it degrades any of the waxes i'm not trying to take them off i'm just going to wash it like normal and see what the results are and let's check it out before we do make sure you hit that like and subscribe button and if you haven't pressed notifications about press them now so you get all the new videos we're putting out let's do it all right guys i want to show you i've been in some rain trucks have been kicking up some stuff and as you can see on the car that we've got a lot of splatter on there but in this area where we have the fuso it's not like the top you see that and over here it's pretty much pelted all the way through and if you say like oh well the bottom is more of the front more air well true but on this side you can see that up here where the turtle wax is they're both turtle wax this is the new graphene one and both sides this is where the tape would be so you can see a difference there but both sides here have less uh dirt and debris than these upper panels where i applied different waxes this is the bright max this is the cullinite and down here is the finished care just a little better view of this at night in a covered parking where you can see the bottom portion of the soft fuso cleaner and the upper portions the middle is very dirty and the two turtle wax products are a lot cleaner so just my observations right off the top all right guys we're going to use the iron x snow soap it's a powerful degreasing type of soap and you can use this in a foam can and you can use it in your bucket like we are it's a one to eight dilution stuff stinks really bad and this is supposed to help get rid of some of the iron uh particles on your car so i'm just gonna pour a little bit in here and i'm gonna put some water and we'll get going on this [Music] all right let's gonna start with the hood here and let's rinse it off as you can see it is dirty as you can see the water runs off pretty good right here is where the tape line was and this is the fuso look at that so would you rather have the fuso or the colonize 845 there is a huge difference all right here we have the bright max and this is the finished care high temp paste wax as you can see it runs off a lot faster with the high temp paste wax but it's not that great on either of them here's the beading this is one week guys this is one week less than a week like five days so here's what the beating looks like all right here we have the two turtle wax products we have the graphene paste wax and the turtle wax [Music] ice so check out those two and very very similar very good products all right now we're gonna wash wash with the iron axe soap [Music] so what do you think it's going to kill uh the bright max the high temp and the 845 [Music] [Music] as you guys see that as you can see it's still slow to sheet off the colonize 845 bright max terrible um high temp care very slow to sheet off the new graphene turtle wax huh it did some damage they're very slow to sheet off so this fuso soft 99 excellent the turtle wax ice excellent guys so you know what i'm thinking fuso turtle wax ice i'll show you guys one more time what it looks like from the side angle here [Music] [Music] so [Music] all right what i want you to see is remember we have the envy car care glass elite and the minutes glass cleaner and look at them they both work wonderfully just a little bit faster to sheet off on the envy car care side but very nice once that minette secures on there look at it excellent [Music] and this is just a simple wash with iron x soap i'm not going to put any toppers or anything on it i want to see what happens to this hood i may go over the sides with some detail spray or something but the hood will stay untouched [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right you guys like the video make sure you hit that subscribe and like button let's get into these review of these waxes here so about five or six days ago i polished the car stripped it down and i applied these six waxes here and i had always heard that the fuso soft 99 is just the longest most durable but a little bit hard to use i have used colonize 845 and you have to melt it down and you know you can get some ghosting if you uh don't use this properly if you put it on too thick that goes for any product really you put it on too thick and it doesn't doesn't work right a lot of people swear by this culinary 845. the bright max i've used it before it gives a nice gloss and shine the high temp paste wax i've used same thing nice gloss and shine good durability then we got the new 75th anniversary of turtle wax this is their ceramic graphene paste wax i i heard this is just really really good and uh i pulled out a brand new canister of turtle wax synthetic ice to see how the new one goes up against the old stuff so would you think who was the best you guys which one performed the best which ones really surprised you i was surprised that um let's start off with the two turtle wax products you know they they worked really really good together uh in keeping off water keeping the panel clean this is 35 this is like 18 all right and i'm not sure of the sizes here but i would go with the 18 turtle wax ice all day over this graphene paste wax it did a good job while it was on the car and holding up but one wash with some iron x snow soap it wasn't a lot of washing it wasn't harsh i didn't throw any of the chemicals on there and this just pretty much came off by about 80 percent this one was barely even touched still performing at uh day one type of level so my choice between these two the turtle wax ice on this on the other side of the car well let's go with the middle in the middle of the car we had bright max vantage on top and the high temp paste wax both of these were very mediocre in performance the they collected dust which in turn when it rained just sat on there and it made dirty water spots and they just i thought this one was was a really good paste in the paste wax in the past but you know after seeing all these side by side this just wakes you up so these two meh [Applause] on the far right or the driver's side we put soft 99 and we put 845 on top everyone loves this 845. this a45 you know it performed like these other two in the middle so i'd put that over there you can see the results in it and the soft 99 fuso soft 99 this stuff is awesome this is got to be one of the top waxes if you want durability you want uh protection on your car it is a little bit harder to apply and remove if you mess up you know you got to put some more on the pad wipe it in and wipe it off real fast that's the secret to this otherwise it is hard to get off so my two choices this is 35 this is 18 and we'll see how long these two perform out on the hood on their own but uh i think for 18 can't beat it and this one i can tell is stronger than this so far the beads everything it's very similar but this one is stronger so you're going to pay about double the price if you have a couple extra bucks in your pocket pick up the fuso if not this will do just fine turtle wax ice you guys very surprised at those results right you guys i hope you like that test play with all your waxes put them on your car see what you like what looks good everything's not always as it seems don't believe what others say until you do it yourself have a good day guys stay tuned for more videos [Music] you", "6FEtssKQFfk": "have you ever gotten into the mood to make three candle kits at once late at night with really good hair and makeup that's strange me too what this is a very spur-of-the-moment video I wanted to do something fun I wanted to do something with smells and I wanted to do things with adorable labels and jars and guess what Brambleberry sent me to count them two of their new candle kits they've rolled out a brand-spanking-new candle collection it's quite luxurious and honestly reminds me a lot of PF candle Co maybe you've seen some of their fabulous candles at Urban Outfitters or online in your feed I follow them because their aesthetic is perfect and this first candle kit totally reminds me of their packaging it's that nice amber jar with the craft label so trendy so delightful this next kid I have here is actually one that I purchased because I love the smell it's the emerald agave smell I believe this is from the green house collection I don't remember but it's really really cute it comes in a candle tin that ought to be fun and finally we have a wax I've never worked with before beeswax never made a beeswax candle there's a first for everything with this lavender beeswax candle kit which one should i do first though I'm voting the emerald agave because I think that'll be the easiest will get progressively harder you'll want to watch me unbox it yes I'm on my knees on the floor so y'all can see my face let me see here so first of all they have all the paperwork in a neat little package I appreciate that looks like I have to cut out the labels myself I don't appreciate that they have a postcard in here that tells you everything that should be in the kit with some more inspirational projects on the back I appreciate that they also have a very comprehensive recipe sheet complete with not only detailed instructions but a helpful tip section I appreciate this as well what a wittle baby Joe how many of these do I get two three five six seven eight well they just keep coming no say nine ten ten baby jars and individual wrappers now I don't think it is necessary to wrap each individual jar in single-use plastic we could improve here mmm the whole reason I bought the kit the Emerald agave fragrance oil ah one moment oh you didn't think I was gonna answer it no I'm just silencing my phone I don't answer my phone in the middle of a conversation with a friend here we have our wicks these are already pre-cut so they're not super long and weird and our eco Sawyer advanced soy wax with everything removed from the box we can now begin the actual candle making first thing they had me do was place all the silver jars into the box the kit came in to keep them warm and snug put a little paper around them and then to keep the wicks from moving you have to play some clothes pins or some straws honestly it's quite tedious and I don't find that to be the most effective way to keep your wicks from moving the best thing to do is to use a wick sticker they look like little round circles you simply place your wick in the middle of one and then place the little sticker part into the middle of your jar it won't move it stays straight and it eliminates the possibility that wick will just get up and float off the bottom after that I dumped all of my so a wax into this white pitcher and heated it up in the microwave on 30 second bursts until it was completely melted it took about five minutes to melt the wax in the microwave and the kid said that once it was between a hundred and thirty to a hundred and forty five degrees I could add the entire bottle of fragrance oil I mixed that in for one to two minutes and then once the wax was at 130 to 135 degrees Fahrenheit it was time to pour into our little candle tins I had to pour some of my wax out from the white picture into this clear pitcher with a long skinny pouring spout because trying to get the wax to be poured perfectly into teeny tiny tins stuck in a boxes quite difficult with all of the candles poured I closed the lid of the box gave it a kiss goodnight patted its wee head and placed it on the counter overnight now I've got to admit that first candle kit pretty freakin easy to do one type of wax one bottle of fragrance oil no measuring anything one pour easy will this second kit thus aridity candle kit be just as easy we'll have to see let's unbox it okay what we got in here okay cool so once again all of our papers are in one tidy little package I appreciate that and once again I have to cut out my own labels I don't appreciate that one as much Oh bendy Crafton stuffing is our fragrance oil bottle I forgot what this one smelled like let's give it a whiff oh man that's so good very fresh very relaxing I can definitely smell like some eucalyptus rosemary something like that and they're very good to have these in the whole time how rude look at these heavy-duty amber glass jars these are quite sturdy little things that got nice weight to them and this lid is very high-quality they are once again all in single-use plastic which I once again find unnecessary but I digress what we got here oh I bet these are our wigs lots of wigs three jars lots of wicks are these multi wick candles huh and we have some soy wax golden wax for 64 so before prepping things and pouring things I noticed once again there are no candle wick stickers but when I was looking on the tips and tricks they said if you like you can keep the wicks along and hold them in place with cut straws or popsicle sticks lots of people like to do that you can also use glue dots to secure them at the bottom of the jar so they're noting yes the dots on the bottom really do help but they still didn't put it in the kit why so for the sake of these turning out perfect I will be using the little dots at the bottom however take note they're not included and also after looking at this entire instructional thing I think it's gonna be easier than the previous kit so just like the Emerald agave kit I snipped the wicks to be the proper size this time I added the wicks occurs to all of the wicks place them in the jars and then place the jars into the box to keep them warm and cozy then I poured all of the wax into my white bucket now they tell you to use a double boiler to heat the wax up and melt it all but you're not dirtying up another dish for no reason and off it goes into the microwave for four to five minutes when the wax was between 175 to 185 degrees so quite a bit hotter than the last kit it was time to pour in one point three ounces of fragrant soil so with this kit you don't just get to dump in the whole bottle you actually have to have a Gayla pour it in you get one point three ounces of fragrant soil in there and then you mix it up with your spatula for one to two minutes until it's fully incorporated and then you have to wait for it to get to a hundred and forty degrees so you have to wait for it to draft forty degrees after what seemed like an eternity the wax was finally at a hundred and forty degrees I am able to do this using my white picture because these jars have really wide mouths which I appreciate also this fragrance is positively captivating and now that I've poured I can see that these little wicks do need a bit oh hell I'm going to clip them right into place and for the second time that night I shut the box lid patted its little head gave it a squeeze and placed it onto the counter to sit overnight now I'm shook but that second kit was even easier than the first one and I have a little bit of fragrance oil and a few weeks left in case I want to do another project so how will this third and final kit hold up I don't know we'll have to see I've heard that beeswax is tricky to work with because it's so hard and a little difficult to melt but who knows maybe I've heard wrong oh yes once again all of our paperwork is in this lovely packet which I do appreciate and look at this our jars are not wrapped in single-use plastic which I also appreciate we have our beeswax here ooh it's crunchy what fragrance oil did they put in here oh it's an essential oil lavender 40:42 and you know what I bet mixed with the beeswax it has a bit of a lavender honey smell and because it's a 100% beeswax with only essential oil for fragrance this is an all natural candle I'm looking at the instructions here and it's that it's basically the same as the other two kits so I won't bore you with the prep and the wit cutting and setting up you guys have seen all that already the one thing I am going to do different is I will be heating up this wax on a stovetop because I know it's gonna take forever to melt I am also going to be adding some wick tabs on the bottom because again Brambleberry didn't include them but I know it is going to Center the wick properly and keep it from swimming away so let's make these all-natural beeswax candles so just like I thought this candle kit was pretty similar to the other two some things of note uh the picture I was heating the wax and was clearly uneven because it kept doing this what is wrong with you now maybe using the double boiler method would have eliminated this but it's so much work especially when you can just keep an eye on it and heat it slowly I was able to dump in all of my lavender essential oil which was nice no measuring required and as far as pouring the actual wax into the candle jars this was a little bit difficult and you had to move really fast my unskilled hands ended up pouring all over the wicks all over the clothes pins and before I could even get to the fifth jar I had to go reheat the wax because it had completely solidified in the pouring pitcher and the silver pitcher it was just a mess I did finally get that fifth candle poured to prep that fifth candle I just removed it from the box and then melted everything down and ran as fast as I could over and tried to pour everything out into that little bitty candle even took the clothespin off then I put the clothespin back on and you can see by the time that I placed it back in the box those other candles were completely solid on top to the point where I could actually remove the clothespin so if you've never worked with beeswax before it sets up really quick like it's two siblings before I close the box reddit's favorite time's story it's origin story gave its little head a pat and set it on the counter with the other two and now I have three candle boxes that will wait for me overnight I have a lot of labels to cut out and I'm just about ready to wrap up my night and I'll come back in the morning to take all the candles out of the boxes put their little labels on and then we'll wrap up the video with our final thoughts conclusions and price breakdowns but until then I have to go to bed so I'll see y'all later it is the next day and I have unboxed all of our wee candles they sure are looking cute and at this point there isn't a lot left to do to them the only thing I really have to do is remove all the clothes pins trim the wicks down to 1/4 of an inch and put on the labels cutting out these round Emerald agave candle stickers is by far the most tedious but I was thinking about last night and maybe they want you to cut out your own stickers because that's part of the handcrafted feel maybe they really wanted you to feel like every bit of this kit is handmade even hand cutting out the labels so I don't know maybe that was a purposeful thing to let you the Creator feel more involved just gonna pop this label right in the centre of this lid that's pretty cute put the lid on one of the jars and put the jar wrapper on this completed look is so adorable the eco soya Advance soy wax looks marvelous and as I've used it in the past I found that it always has such a gloriously smooth top whereas for 64 and other waxes tend to have a little bit of modelling they often aren't as smooth and the tops are just inconsistent soy wax is known for doing that and people who buy soy wax candles don't seem to mind that much but for me personally this is a little more rustic than I prefer so after I put labels on all of the candles I'm going to take a heat gun and I am going to clean up the tops of these candles by applying just a little bit of heat and melting that first layer so that when it hardens again it looks a bit more smooth [Music] so let's talk about what we loves and what we think could be improved first of all the packaging for all three candles is superb I love the different graphics on these bands I love how simple and legible the labels are and I love that it's on trend these don't look like a candle you would find in your grandmother's house they look hip they look young I love the clear easy instructions I love that it's all bundled together in a very giftable box so you could give it to a friend if you wanted and I especially love the fragrances in all three candles so as far as improvements go they should definitely include wick stickers that's a very cheap thing to throw in a box and it's so helpful to makers and if they really wanted to up the game we could add clothes pins these are very inexpensive but they make a world of difference I also don't love that these jars came in single-use plastic so it just seems unnecessary those are really the only three complaints I have for these kids so let's talk about the price all of these kits ship free in the United States which is an added bonus so whatever price you're seeing on the website is the only practice you'll pay the Emerald agave soy wax candle kit is by far the best deal if you broke it down perk handle the Emerald agave candles would be four dollars and 34 cents a piece which for a kit is pretty good especially considering that it is soy wax and these are extremely giftable and professional looking the lavender beeswax candle kit is a lot more expensive its $49.99 or 50 bucks that's $10 per candle the Serenity candle kit though the smell is delightful and I love these jars is the most expensive by a longshot there's only three candles in it and the kit itself is already $8.99 so each candle is $12.99 which is a lot I'm gonna let these candles cure a week before I burn them so you can check back with me on insta to see my burn test results technically you only have to wait 24 to 48 hours but I find if you give soy candles about a week to sit and cure they are so much stronger all in all these are beautiful candles the kids were super fun I had a great time doing it the three that I made today will be listed down in the description box just in case you'd like to pick one up for your next slumber party or maybe to give as a housewarming gift to a friend and if you enjoyed this spur-of-the-moment can't build video please let me know down in the comments below I love doing spur-of-the-moment videos so the ones where I feel

whether that is yeah you know I'm about to mention it going and getting a candle kit from bramble berry no affiliate links not sponsored but they do smell really nice especially these lavender ones or maybe trying out some makeup from your high school days welcome back Marilyn Monroe Kat I you have been missed either way just do something that makes you happy today whatever that may be and I will see you guys on Wednesday so until then bye for now new Shh [Music] if you like to sniff candles put I smell candles down in caps below", "Ez1VsiBRQX0": "[Music] [Music] hi I'm Belinda Carly the director of the Institute of personal care science and I get asked about the different natural waxes that are out there and there are quite a few that you can choose from so in this video I'm going to show you comparisons of the most commonly used natural waxes and I'm also going to show you whether they suit sticks or gels or ointments best so let's take a look now what I've done here is I have arranged these different natural waxes in order of softest right through to hardest I'm gonna start with this one here this is hydrogenated vegetable oil and one not technically a wax I have included it because it's a fantastic gelling agent now this is the material here as a raw material comes as this little granulated waxy material and now I've put this into a bar at 20% just with caprylic cupric triglycerides and then 20% of the hydrogenated vegetable oil as you can see it's very soft very flexible so you could use it in sticks but you would definitely need to use one of the harder waxes I'm gonna talk to you about here I have gelled some caprylic carrot triglycerides with the hydrogenated vegetable oil at 5% and it is a beautiful gelling agent so it's got great applications as a oil gelling agent also great in water in oil creams to help build up viscosity also great in pointment you could also use it in balms pramod's and even stick products about in stick products and even if you wanted a hard balm you would need to combine it with one of these other harder waxes here to get some hardness into the product next I'm going to show you is beeswax now I love beeswax and you're gonna see why when I explain this product in a moment but I just want to point out while it's natural it's not vegan suitable so if you need to make a vegan suitable product you can't use beeswax now beeswax can come in an organic version which has a much yellow color this is a bleached beeswax here it's still natural but it is quite white to begin with so this is the raw material here and this is it here in a bar form now again 20 percent wax 80 percent caprylic corporate triglycerides I did this so that we have an apples for apples comparison across all the different waxes and you can see it is it is quite a flexible wax I can bend that bar it doesn't break now that makes beeswax fantastic in a variety of products I've also made an oily gel here with again 5% beeswax in the 95% caprylic corrector glycerides and it is a beautiful gelling agent it is it has got a higher viscosity in the gel then the hydrogenated vegetable oil that is because it is slightly harder but it is a beautiful gelling material for oily gels so you can use these wax in all of your oil-based products from oily gels your water and oil creams ointments balms pomades even sticks but with a stick product if you want it to be really hard you would need to also add one of the harder waxes in a small proportion but beeswax does give great flexibility you won't break your stick easily if you're using beeswax beeswax interestingly is also a low hlb material so it helps stabilize your water and oil creams and water and oil appointments you can also use these in balm products to add a little bit of water-soluble materials and the beeswax will help stabilize a small percentage of water or water soluble materials around 5% in a balm products because of that low hlb value next is a material called veggie right now this is the product here now in a bar form it has got some flexibility but it does also break so there is a little bit of brittleness a bit of hardness there to it this is the material in its raw form now this is actually a natural alternative to Osaka right and I've got to say it compares extremely well in terms of its flexibility and high and melting point to Osaka right so if you were looking to replace Osaka right in a formula this is a fantastic drop-in replacement it does really achieve what it says it will do as a gelling agent it's okay it's not as good as the beeswax or the hydrogenated vegetable oil but it does still gel effectively there is that flexibility in there - Mina is quite a good gelling agent still so you could use this in oily gels you can use it in water oil creams ointments balms Hammad's and even sticks if you're using it in a stick you will probably want to just add a little bit of a flexibility increasing agent like your beeswax or your hydrogenated vegetable oil just to reduce that risk of brittleness otherwise your stick could break when the user is applying it now we're coming over to the harder waxes first we have the candle Leela wax now this is the actual material here and this is it here in a bar at 20% and you can see it's very brittle it's also very hard though which has its features and benefits of stick products as a gelling agent it's definitely not my favorite while it looks like it's a nicely set gel here if you apply any sort of shear to this it turns liquid thin so you lose your gel structure straight away you could use it as a gelling agent but when you've got better choices over here I simply wouldn't as a stick in a stick products fantastic but again you would want some flexibility agent like your beeswax or your hydrogenated vegetable oil present just so that you don't get sticks breaking easily like that because it is hard but it does have brittleness to it so you can use this in harder bombs you could use this in small portions in pods definitely you can use this in stick products to get that hardness of a stick but remember use a little bit of a flexibility increasing agent so that you don't get breakages in your stick next is rice bran wax now I really like this material I would tend to use the rice bran over the candle ela or karna BER it is a hard wax you can see I have already broken this to test it and it does break and it is brittle one of the things I like about this material though is it helps reduce sanera psious in bombs and sticks so those little drops of sweat that appear on sticks is known as sanera --ss but rice bran if it's also used in the formula can help reduce the potential of that occurring so it's good to help with long term shelf life of a product this is the raw material here as a gelling agent no I'm not going to recommend it it can sit hard but you lose all stability and structure if you share it so it's great if you want to make your bombs harder it's also great in pom adds a little bit in pramod's just to increase the viscosity make the pom hard set well it's fantastic and sticks so I would definitely use this in stick products it's one of my favorites to use for that purpose and finally we have carnauba wax now this is the hardest wax of all and it does have a fair bit of brittleness so it's fantastic in sticks but you need to include a flexibility agent in with this very hard wax otherwise you will get significant breaking of your sticks with only a little bit of pressure so definitely needs a flexibility agent added this is the raw material here so both the candle Lila and the carnauba can add a lot of gloss to your stick products that's actually one of their main applications carnauba wax is very glossy in particular it's no good as a gelling agent and part of that is because of its hardness and its brittleness so fantastic in stick products to make them harder you could use a little bit in BOMs hard bombs or PHA mods to bring up the viscosity and hardness of the product but you definitely do need some flexibility agents added your hydrogenated vegetable oil or beeswax so that you don't get a brittle stick that's just going to break on application the other thing to take note of with the natural waxes is the color okay now we making color cosmetics and you're adding pigment the colors not going to matter but if you're making sticks or bombs where you're not going to add coloring agent of course color is going to matter this material here the veggie riot gives a very interesting sort of appearance it's it's not quite opaque it's got a little bit of translucency to it your bleached beeswax of course is quite white unbleached beeswax is definitely more of the candle allure type color over here and of course your karna burr is a very dark color so this might impact your decision of which works you're going to choose for your formula as well now I'll put all of this into a great little summary table for you which you can see on the screen or contact us if you would like a copy of this summary table [Music] well there you go now as I mentioned there are some other natural waxes out there that you could use as well and you could run a similar test to see how they perform for your application also consider color and how that might impact your choices as well I hope

happy formulating [Music]", "So7N7i-ajec": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hey everybody happy wax on wednesdays today i thought it would be fun to add some additional layers to that cold wax painting that we started last week here on wax on wednesdays so this is a little cold wax medium painting series here in wax on wednesdays and i'm mixing up my colors i mix about a 50 50 ratio of cold wax medium to my paint which i'm using gambling artist colors all of the supplies that i use on each week's video can always be seen on the blog post for that video on sherryriplogical.com so if you go over to there'll be a link belo beneath the video for each uh blog post and you can go over there and see the full blog post for this video as well as all of the uh every all the supplies that i use each week so this week is all about those middle layers in a painting in an abstract painting you have the under painting and you have those middle layers and sometimes those are the most fun layers sometimes they're a little bit of a struggle to find out exactly where that painting is taking you and i'm starting out here just by warming up the entire painting with some indian yellow so this week i really wanted to focus in on what i do in those middle layers to add some excitement back in to the painting so a lot of times can it's easy to get lost in those in those layers i am having fun adding different colors color combinations and really exploring the color and that's part of the fun and the excitement of the middle layers but every once in a while you sort of get stuck and the way i get unstuck is to add some exciting bits and some texture back into the painting so a lot of times i call these middle layers my character layers because they really are what adds in the end the character to the painting so of course not all of this is going to be visible by the end of the painting a lot of the colors and things that i'm adding now will get covered up in the end but a lot of the texture that's added will be visible in one way or another so a lot of times that adds a lot of character and interest to the painting even though you can't see the colors that i added you can really see that texture that is built up on the painting so today i'm going to show you two ways that i add a little bit of texture back into those paintings and that creates a little bit of excitement for me it adds a little bit of interest for me as i'm painting those middle layers and gets me a little bit excited about what's coming up next so for that this week i'm going to just use some scratching techniques with the palette knife you can use whatever tool you have you can use that catalyst tool a wedge a palette knife and also some plastic film some plastic wrap to and that will both pick up the paint it'll transfer it to another spot in the painting once that plastic film starts to get sort of dirty with paint because it's picking up that paint in one area and laying down it the paint in another it also creates some lovely texture as it does it with those wrinkles in the plastic wrap so it's just a fun way of adding a little bit of getting a little bit excitement in those center layers so i hope that you enjoy this painting this unlocks on wednesdays this week if you want to see the full painting video they're always available on the patreon channel i have full voice overs a step-by-step process of each and every wax on wednesday's video so you can check that out over on the patreon channel and we will be wrapping these little paintings up and finishing them up on wax on wednesdays here next week so next week will be the final layers of this painting and this today will just be those fun center layers so i hope you have fun with this and we'll see you next week happy wax on wednesdays [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "xuzjv33SqlY": "spring is probably my favorite season to ride in with the warm temps it's a great time to learn some new tricks and explore some terrain it's also awesome because you could ride around your new favorite hoodie enjoy the Sun and high temps but there are some challenges like why is it my board moving with the right spring wax you can get that boar glide in and spring may become your new favorite season to ride in there are three keys to having a good springtime wax the first one's gonna be graphite which is an additive to your wax the second one is going to be fluoride which is also an additive to your wax and the third one is gonna be just having the right color temperature for that day in the springtime it's usually going to be a warm temple axe but always check the conditions to make sure you have the most optimal wax let's talk about graphite first graphite is great for old snow it repels all the dust and pollen and scum that's in the snow so it doesn't get absorbed into the base of your board the older of the snow the more critical the graphite is to have in your base by old snow I mean snow that's old if it hasn't snowed for a month that snow is old you need graphite in your board next let's talk about the fluoride fluoride repels water and fluoride is typically already added into a hydrocarbon wax and it's gonna be labeled low fluoride or high fluoride in the more water that's in the snow the higher the fluoride content you want new wax also be aware that fluoride does not help you aboard if the snow is not wet if it is dry snow the fluoride could actually slow your board down but if it's a wet snow you're gonna need fluoride the wetter the snow the more fluoride the third one having the right color temperature wax for your board is debatably one of the most important things to have in the springtime you typically will be using a warm wax which is typically a red color wax and if you are trying to stretch your warm wax you only have a limited amount it's okay to mix it with all ten plaques that kind of stretch out your warm wax for bonus points you can have a springtime pattern cut into the base of your board that's like all the little grooves are in the base of your board you can cut pattern that helps the snow move under your board better with a springtime cut typically it's a wider waffle pattern in the base of your board this is not absolutely necessary but take it to your local shop they're gonna know what's best for their Mountain and they can add that cut to your board if you really want to get an optimal shape alright let's get into waxing the board you're gonna need the same things you need for a standard wax gonna need your iron here make sure it's on and hot but not smoking you're gonna need something to wipe the base your board down we're gonna use a clean towel today you could also use a wire brush if you have some problem areas or some citrus cleaner to get out some of that grime if you do have a bunch of grime your board but it's pretty essential to at least just wipe off any big dust particle there anything nasty that's been resting on your board for when you transport it from the mountain or just been skiing on it all day so we're gonna wipe that bad boy off right there next up you're gonna want to melt your wax onto the board this is floor needed wax it's pretty wet where I am right now and we're gonna just go ahead and melt some of that on there well so this is our appropriate color wax which is red which is going to be the warm wax and it also has a fluoride active in it so it's going to help repel that water which we have a lot of in our snow right now so I've got a healthy amount fluoridated wax on there the next step I'm going to take the graphite always a black additive looking thing here I'm just going to put a little bit of this black graphite on here as well our snow is also pretty old we haven't had some snow in a couple of weeks the snow's pretty corned up right now it's got a little pollen in dirt and nasty stuff in it so definitely need it some graphite to the base of this board so I've got my hydrocarbon wax in the appropriate color I've got the graphite and I've got the fluorination in there and we just made a big soup and we're gonna just mix it all into the base of the board and get it as evenly distributed as possible and once it's in there you're just going to wax it how you back your your normal board get it in there real good you can check out other videos on how to just wax a snowboard but we've got it all souped up pretty evenly distributed and then we're just gonna go ahead and embed the wax into the base of this board alright so we just waxed our board up and then we let it cool down definitely give it a ample time to cool down so the wax could get embedded into the pores and next up becomes a scraping you want to make sure you got a sharp scraper if you don't have a sharp scraper you can take it to your local shop asking the shark ran up for you we call I got one of these little guys I'll get it nice and sharp while the run on the belt for you now the scraping does get a little controversial when it comes to scraping your spring gear a lot of people like to go with the no scrape just because the spring condition will just rip the wax off your board usually faster than you can upkeep it so today we're going to definitely go with like a light scrape I'm not gonna do the full-on no scrape I'm just gonna kind of get any like big chunk off of the board and try to get it as flush as possible but definitely leave excess wax on there there's nothing wrong with taking all the excess off and buffing it out and making it you know as perfect as you can but the spring is just gonna rip that wax off super fast so I recommend just a light scrape when it's uh when it's a springtime and the warmer it is and whether it is the less of a scrape you can do and if you're expecting like a firmer springtime condition maybe then I would scrape all the excess off and maybe buff out my base so we're gonna go ahead looking good here that simple like I said I'm gonna leave the majority of the excess on there and it's gonna get it flush and that's gonna quit your springtime wax go ahead and play around with how much grass by how much fluoride what color hydrocarbon wax is best for your spring day mess around with all that finding the right ratios to your wax soup getting it all dialed you learn a lot playing with this type of stuff and I encourage you to get creative with it you can like quark in the graphite and maybe even get like a fluoride paste to put that on the base too but what we did here today with the graphite the fluoride and having the appropriate wax temperature I think we're really gonna be moving on the mountain in fact I know we are so it's gonna be a good time we're gonna be able to make all the jump landings today and keep up with all your buddies probably pass all your buddies all right guys if you like this video leave a like subscribe the channel let us know down below in the comments what type of wax you're putting on your spring board do you scrape do you not scrape let us know if you have any questions we're happy to answer them and thanks for tuning in today's video", "AvpteP4iIMM": "[Music] I've been using the tree Tech's range of hardbacks oils for years now on my furniture products I don't even know why I started using it I've tried a few others and I just really liked it it's got a great range of colors and other things so I was really pleased that timber kind of started selling it cuz means I can just get it a whole lot easier but I thought I'd go through some of the benefits of hard wax oil maybe you've used it before maybe you haven't I'll have some tips that might help you along the way or if you're just starting out some useful information to get your best bang for your buck and get a really good finish on your on your furniture that you're making it's good to kind of know what a hard wax is and you know where it comes from I mean obviously it is a wax product so that's got it in the name it's a combination of natural oils and natural waxes and the way it kind of works is the oil component really soaks into the timber penetrates in protects it carries some of that wax in with it and the wax and the rest of the finish actually leaves a really nice hard finish on the surface of the timber and it's a finish that actually hardens over time it kind of stemmed from really traditional finishes where woodworkers would first apply linseed oil that would penetrate into the timber and then they'd apply beeswax over the top and try and get a really nice Sheen but the beeswax was really soft and I it was just a tricky two-part process and this kind of puts it all together into one really useful product I really like hard wax oil for a number of reasons over some of the other products I mean I also use something like Danish Oil quite a lot if I want a really really soft finish that doesn't actually leave a lot of coat on the surface of the timber at all hard wax on the other hand does build up a bit of surface which means you've got much greater timber protection than you would from a penetrating oil like Danish oil so if I'm doing dining tables bathroom vanities anywhere that's gonna have a lot of water exposure or possibly risk of staining from food and wine and stuff hard wax is 100% the way to go because it resists those stains better than something like a softer finish like a Danish oil might do on the other hand really really protective finishes like poly or and varnish they actually leave a much thicker sometimes harder coat on the surface of the timber and for some applications that can be good it's not the kind of finish that I tend to lean towards one of the reasons is that that really hard coat on the surface of the timber doesn't actually bond as well to the timber as something like a hard wax does because a polyurethane or a varnish it's not really penetrating very far into the timber and not creating that really strong bond so sometimes in like a wet area application like a bathroom if you've got a really nice polyurethane finish and some things happen to leave some raw timber exposed wall will get under there and it will damage the bond between the surface and the timber itself and you'll end up lifting that finish which will look terrible water will get under there it'll stay in the timber and then to fix it you've got to sound it all completely back to bare timber and that's where something like this is really good because it's way less scary it's a it's a finish that actually does allow a little bit of moisture and air to pass through the finish it's porous in that way but because it's truly bonded to the timber and penetrates in there's no way that tip that water can kind of sneak but beneath there and lift that finish up so it means that if it does get really stained which is pretty hard to do but if something happens to it or you get a big scratch you can actually just apply a little bit more without having to fully sand it back to bare timber and start again another really important thing about hard wax oil especially this tree Tech's one is it's a really natural product so it's a blend of a whole bunch of natural oils and waxes and they're actually blended in with like a medical grade alcohol solution so it's really safe to use on all kinds of surfaces that you might have food or where your kids are playing it's not gonna be off gassing a whole bunch of turpentine because that's not in the mix at all it doesn't smell strong when you apply it and another really fantastic thing about this newest the evolution product of the tree Tech's range which is kind of their latest product is it's completely non flammable so again that's safer also makes transport safer but ultimately it just makes it less harmful to apply and a really safe product to use on really pieces of furniture for your family so the actual hard work soil product that I'm using today is called evolution by wittle waxes so waterworks is an Australian company that started bringing in hard wax oils into Australia was one of the first companies that ever did and the first hard work saw that they brought in as far as I know was the treat X product which is made by a factory in Germany now the treat X Factory has also started making this evolution product for wittle waxes and it has a few differences from the original treat X range as I've mentioned earlier the main difference between this and the original treat X product is this is non-flammable a couple of the other things that is different between these two products you get a higher coverage with the evolution than you did with treat X so treat X was roughly 20 square meters per liter this is roughly 30 so it's a lot more coverage which means it's a more economical product to use it also does penetrate a little bit deeper into the timber which is really good in terms of the Bhandar that you're creating it also means that you get a slightly lower level of of our film build on the timber which means a more natural less thick finish as a result so that's just something to keep in mind less like a polyurethane and yeah really good penetration so the evolution comes in 14 levels generally the one I like the best is called luster it's kind of just up from Matt and then there's a glossy one and I think this one at the moment is a satin the satin is it's really mild it's not a high gloss at all and the luster is just a little bit lower than that it also has all these great colors which I've done a whole bunch of demos here and we'll talk about some of the tips and tricks for applying these colors and getting really good results applying this stuff is really easy you can use almost anything so a brush or a roller or a rag I've actually really been enjoying using these um little non-scratch scouring pads especially for the first coat what they do is they hold a small amount of product like a paintbrush will but cuz you can drag them over the surface with some pressure it allows you to leave a really nice even but thin film traditionally when I would apply something like Danish oil I'll apply it to the timber and then I've wiped it all off and then whatever's left on the cloth is just wastage and with a slightly more expensive product like this I'm reluctant to waste a whole bunch of product on the cloth and using a product like this scarer means that the you're not actually wasting a whole bunch of hard work soil in in the application because you can then transfer that over to the next piece of timber after you've applied your first coat you need to make sure to let that coat dry I normally leave 24 hours and that way I know that it's really nice and dry and then I give it a really light sand before I put on the next coat so if I'm using sandpaper I'll use 220 240 grit or higher something like that and it's just a really light sand we're only trying to just barely knock off any little dust particles or anything that might have settled on the surface otherwise you can use non scratch white scotch brite also works pretty well just to take down any imperfections before you apply the second coat I like to apply the second coat with a nice brush gives me a really nice finish but if I'm doing a huge table or something I'll usually just apply it with a roller and that works fine the evolution range also has a whole bunch of stains think there's about 10 colors plus two more natural colors now you don't mix these in with your first or second coat of hard wax you actually apply these first now these are actually just the same hard wax with some pigment added but the reason that you don't tend to mix them into your later coats is that if you have this color right on the surface of the timber and then you apply two coats of hard wax on top of that it's really setting that color and protecting it whereas if you're adding this color into your actual hard wax layers over time as that lay as those hard wax layers might get warned for instance if it was a floor the color would go with it whereas if this is underneath those two layers it really protects that color which means you'll get a more consistent color over your piece of furniture or your floor for a longer period of time applying these is pretty simple you want to make sure that you've got really good coverage work it into the timber and then wipe all excess off so you know with a nice clean cloth buff it off until you've got a really nice even coverage but you're not leaving a whole bunch of wet spots of stain behind you let that dry just like you would a normal coat of hardware soil and then you can apply your first and second coat of actual Hardware Xfinity on top of that don't do any sanding after your first color coat because you don't want to knock any of that color back so you can sand between your first and second actual Hardware coats but not on your first color coat some other really important tips when using this this color range to get a really good consistent finish is about how you sand now the temptation when doing this is to sound really nice and fine so you have a perfectly smooth piece before you apply any finish but in this case if you sand any finer than about a hundred and fifty it tends to close off the pores of the timber too much and you don't get a really nice consistent color adhesion to the wood so I found that a 120 grit on my random orbital sander gave a pretty good even result but if I wanted a really strong color adhesion a 120 grit hand sanded with the grain actually open those pores up a little bit more and gave me a much more even finish and also a much deeper color another thing to consider is if you're looking for an even deeper color than that hand sand with 120 with the grain get rid of some of that dust then get a damp cloth and wipe it over the surface of the timber what the water does is actually opens up the pores in the timber again let that dry and then you apply your finish and you'll get a much deeper set of that color across the whole range so that's really important to know if you are if you're trying to get more from these stains if you're trying to get a really really subtle effect then just sound normally don't worry about opening up those pores using water and don't worry about hand sanding for a you know a slightly rougher finish than you might get from your random orbital sander [Music] the last two products in this color range is this natural stain Andross stain light and what these actually are is a it's a lightening stain but it's very very mild and it's used to apply to Timber especially lighter timbers like American oak or via cache that you want it to retain a natural feel you don't want the the darkening effect that a applying any sort of hard wax or varnish does has on the timber so you use these in the same way that you'd use any of these other finishes so you know sand to 120 and apply and then wipe off but it doesn't actually leave very much pigment on there at all the effect that it has is that when you then apply the hard wax oil over that you don't get that timber darkening that you would if you hadn't applied these these two natural stains are very similar so there's natural and raw light the only difference is the natural has a little bit more coverage so it is has a little bit more white pigment essentially it has more pigmentation on the timber so the light is just a just a less intense version of that and they both work really well so it's worth experimenting with those if you're looking for the kind of finish where you'd like your American oak table to look like it hasn't really had anything applied to it at all just like a really nice subtle finish so when that's used in conjunction with to say I'm at evolution hard wax it almost looks like there's nothing on there at all but the timber is really well protected and it will stay that same color and it won't get stained yeah just a really nice effect it's got a whole bunch of samples here I will just go through some of the colors and the effects of different sanding methods and popping the ground with water like I talked about I want to start by talking about these these little waxes raw stains and the real light stain that I mentioned earlier so this piece here is a piece of American oak which has had just two coats of standard evolution applied to it with no color at all and then this one here has had the raw light applied to it before those two coats of evolution so you can see that it is a lighter color it's very mild so it's not a really deep effect but if you can compare this one to the actual unstained side of the American oak you'll notice that they're much more similar so the evolution range by itself does darken the timber slightly but by using these this raw light it has maintained that more natural color of the American oak you can see exactly the same thing with the Vic ash this piece here has had two coats of just standard whittle wax evolution hard wax oil and then this piece here has had the raw light stain added before those two coats and again you can see that this piece here looks actually more similar to the untreated piece of Vic ash than the treated one so it's a really useful effect to be able to just maintain that natural look on a whole range of lighted Timbers these two pieces of American oak have both had it had the evolution white stain added to them they call it an aurochs white same timber same stain but you'll notice that they look quite different the reason for that is this one here which is a lot whiter was for one thing it was hand sanded to 120 with the grain just slightly roughen the surface and the second thing was I added a damp cloth afterwards to pop that grain open those pores out so that it will absorb a little bit more of that white stain now if you're looking for that even white effect but you want it a little bit less white and this goes for all of these stains by evolution you can actually dilute them with the evolution product itself so if you wanted to use you know one of their reds or one of their Browns but you finding it too intense you can dilute it a little bit with this traditional hard wax oil here's another piece of American oak and I added the black stain to this on one side on this first side I hand sanded and opened the grain paws using our water and you'll see it's quite dark and even on this other side I just sanded with a random orbital sander and you'll see that you've got really dark lines where the softer groans absorb the stain but the harder more dense areas haven't as much so that's the advantage of knowing what the effects of sanding and opening the grain have on the actual absorption of the stain in order to get the best result for what you're trying to achieve I actually really enjoyed doing all of these and seeing the effect that had on the on the timber you can get really good results just and do some test pieces first for the timber that you're using experiment with different sanding techniques and whether or not you're opening the grain out with water make sure you're wiping up all the excess let it dry add the rest of your evolution hard wax oil on and you'll get a great finish I've been using the Whittle wax hard wax for a long time now and so I was really pleased to get to demonstrate this evolution product the newest product that they're bringing it making I think it's well worth it it costs a little bit more than maybe something like a Danish oil or a cheap varnish but you get such a good result it's really easy to apply the range of colors are great you know you've spent a lot of time making a nice piece of furniture and there's no point skimping on cheap finish that isn't gonna really showcase the piece that you've made there'll be a link below pick it up Tim makan on their website otherwise I'd jump on and like this video and subscribe to the channel and there'll be a whole bunch more of these coming along [Music]", "UjoShsiQSGQ": "so down and away and i'll begin to get a little layer coming off like so and then up here on the shovel sometimes you get a little build up just a little tlc up there it doesn't hurt hey cal from pine mountain sports here um tonight we're talking about ski waxing and why you might want to be waxing your skis now that it's december winter is upon us here in bend oregon so this ski here in front of us tonight that we have to get hot waxed is a ski that definitely has been thirsty for rocks for a little bit you can see that dry chalky look at the base basically tells me the skier's been going out getting some days in but over time that friction wears down the wax and the ski starts to lose its glide so applying that wax will bring the sheen back to the ski and then look some something similar to this ski right here that has that shiny look to the base this process we're talking about does apply to alpine at snowboard skate and of course metal edge nordic skis my general rule of thumb is is for hot waxing is about three to eight outings depending on the skier the reason being it's so broad again is because some people are skiing just quick meissner in the morning some people are going to bachelor all day when we're hot waxing ski here at the shop we will be cleaning the base out brushing the ski using base cleaner if we have to um and then from there once the ski base is clean we can go ahead and apply that temperature specific wax based on current snow conditions so first thing to start out about waxing your skis at home is you're going to need a little bit of equipment one of the most important things to make the waxing process easier is a little bit of a setup on your workbench so i grabbed these tonight for a kind of simple construction idea for y'all at home of something you can craft together to make a solid footing for your skis to sit on while you're waxing that ski big ticket items for waxing at home is a dedicated ski waxing iron a common question we'll get here in the shop is when we're talking about getting that home waxing set up is why would i want to buy a dedicated waxing iron why can't i just use the one that's in the closet um first one being is it can make a mess um for sure also these these ski waxing irons have a better temperature regulator so it's not going to be burning the wax so keeping that wax or that ski iron temperature consistent is very important if you do use those regular clothing irons you can burn the wax also you can burn the plastic ski based material next thing you'll need is some wax to put on the skis here at the store we sell some good swix products for that on them you'll see a temperature range so 25 to 39 then 23 to 14 so that's the actual snow temperature so like on mount bachelor's nordic conditions we'll be updating that snow temperature often so we'll base that off of what ski wax to select for most conditions and also the temperature of the iron so you'll see 130 degrees celsius there and 145 there most of the time at the shop here we're going to be using that swix ch8 sometimes the ch7 for most customers this little guy that switched swix ch6 is reserved for those days when it's super firm snow and cold out there so when you get that that colder snow it's going to be a little bit more abrasive to the bottom of the ski because the crystal structure is is more abrasive to the plastic ski based material so that harder wax ch6 is going to handle those harder snow crystals and colder temperatures much better other things you'll need for that waxing process at home is a nice sharp ski scraper the sharper the scraper the easier job you'll have scraping off that excess wax dedicated ski waxing brush this one for example is that brass brush it's a classic can't go wrong good for cleaning out the base before waxing and also for after wax so these little guys fiber techs they come in a few different roughnesses if you will and you can use them to kind of polish the base after waxing also do some polishing of the base before waxing to clean it off a little bit especially for nordic skiers is a handy groove scraper to clear out that darn channel in the center of the ski when you get your ski at home and you're going to wax it a good thing to do beforehand is to do a quick check to make sure that the base is pretty clean a good way to clean the base of a ski is you can use a base cleaner on it also alternative to that is just wiping the dust off with the rag if it's all dusty and dirty and then just gently brushing the ski with a nice brass brush go tip to tail little overlapping strokes making your way down just clean up that ski a little bit get it ready to accept a fresh wax so now we've gotten we've gone through checked the ski done a quick brush to clean it off a little bit there um first thing to do is that waxing iron so i've already pre plugged this one in i got it set to a good temperature when it comes to applying the wax to the ski it's best to apply the least amount possible so a good way to go is just start with a very small amount and to do that what you'll do is bring your brick of wax to the base of the iron once it's hot and i'll have the corner of the iron pointing down so the wax will drip off the iron onto the ski and i'll walk down the ski stopping where the scales are because we're not going to be waxing the scales with the iron that's for sure so it looks like this we'll put that on there let it warm up we'll get a drip going to do a little wiggle do a little wiggle we'll come down let it drip and then from there wax sets aside that should be plenty of wax we'll set this iron on here and slowly move back and forth spreading that wax always keeping the iron moving never letting it sit still too long and we'll see that nice layer of molten wax behind the iron that's iron heating up the plastic opening up those pores in the base material and that wax is going to settle in and cool all right it's easy to apply too much wax if you haven't really waxed skis very much before so again applying just a little bit and then spreading it out with that iron and a nice thin layer on there move up to the tip of the ski and put a quick layer up top there again just a little bit goes a long way the less we put on now the less we have to scrape off later spreading that nice just like that so once we've got our hot wax applied to the ski um that hot wax does need to cool off a little bit so it varies based on temperature where you're at but usually about 10 20 minutes or so minimum is good another good thing to feel is just that the ski is not warm anymore so right now especially put your fingertips on there you can really feel that temperature these still are warm if you're in a rush to scrape your skis the trick in the winter is to put them outside in a colder environment and they'll cool off quicker this ski has been cooled off since sitting for at least 30 minutes cool to the touch good to go to scrape that ski dedicated ski waxing scraper just plastic really nice sharp edge on it and with that scraping process we're always going to start up at the tip up here on the ski up on the shovel and then work our way down i'll grab my scraper and i'll be pushing down with my with my hand but also pushing away from me as well so i'll push down and also away and then from there i get one scrape there's a little bit off but there's even more to go so we have to keep going until we're not getting any more wax off that ski and again we're going tip to tail direction and travel with that scraper is the best habit and then up here on the shovel sometimes you get a little build up just a little tlc up there doesn't hurt but again direction of travel tips tail boom you pretty much go until not much wax is coming off the scraper um minimal not really any left there so now that we've scraped the ski with our ski scraper um we're going to need to scrape the groove because this is a nordic ski after all so we'll have our dedicated groove scraper to get in there simply you can push down and then get the groove and then boom like so so another tip if you don't have a groove scraper is you can use the back side of a good bic ballpoint pen that pretty much fits right in that groove on most nordic skis and i most adults have those lying around at the house so i'll continue down here on the tail of the ski with that scraper again going tip to tail direction to travel slowly working my way down pushing down and away from me and i'll rotate my scraper around as i go because the edges do dull out is a good habit and then again we're going to be looking at that groove we got a nice metal edge in order ski here tonight come into the groove push down and gently and boop just like that the next thing to do is going to be buff out that base so recommended brush for general use is that brass brush from swix so i'll grab my brass shot brush here and then again we're going tip to tail nice and gentle don't need to push too hard on this guy nice smooth stroke and that's okay there and then we'll come down the tail same thing nice and smooth don't need to push too hard then from there those swix fiber text pads really nice because you can use that to kind of clean off that edge of the ski that some of that wax builds up onto when you're heating up the ski so a little a little rubbing along the edges there will help clean the edges off polish them up a little bit and also you can use that to clean off some of that extra wax and polish that base on nordic is you don't really need to hot wax this section you'll just make a big old mess trying to get hot wax on there so for applying wax here you have there is some paste waxes and topical waxes you can rub on to the scaled portion of the ski last thing to do is just to put a little bit of paste wax on that scaled portion of the ski just a little dab will do you there just a thin layer thin layer is usually pretty good just to keep the glide up and keep that base saturated and then once it's dried out a little bit you can go back in there with your buffing pad buff it in a little bit more alternatively to the buffing pad you can use one of those nice fiber text pads to buff that out and rub it in the base a little more with the scale portion of the ski if you're just watching the tip and tail and never touching the scales that plastic base material will dry out and over time you're going to get a lot of friction from that area of the ski so it is important to apply a little bit of paste wax on that scaled portion to maintain good glide and also avoiding any ice or glopping buildup especially in variable snow conditions if you're having one of those days where your skis are just sticking or your buddy's keys are sticking and you happen to be carrying a thing of paste wax in your pocket that can definitely help you out um when we're finishing up a wax here at the shop of course want to make it look good for the customers so make sure there's no excess wax on the tail or along those edges of the ski wiping that clean all right so those are a few things that we're running over tonight in relation to what you can do to keep your skis gliding smoothly for the whole winter to have some good outings out there when springtime comes and we're putting the skis away for the year it is a very good practice to put a little bit of storage wax on your skis what storage wax is is it's basically just half of the hot wax all we're doing in storage wax is putting a thick layer of wax on that tip and tail of the ski to prevent it from getting uh dried out and the ski can delaminate over time just trying to take care of that plastic base material so it's ready for you when the winter comes again storage wax pretty easy to do at home just put a nice thick layer on in the tip section the thicker the better really because if you're getting a nice thick coat on there you'll get some good dripping coming off the edges and those drippings can kind of help keep the edges in good shape as well for any sort of moisture or corrosion that can happen over time in long-term storage in the summer cal here from pine mountain sports i hope this video was helpful for you all obviously with the current reality we are all living in we're not able to really host these wax clinics here at the shop um if this wax clinic was helpful to you that's awesome but if you have more questions do give us a call stop by we're here seven days a week to help you all out this ski is ready to rip yeah that's pretty much it waxing iron yada you", "4aRWAg_9fRg": "[Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "3CwDKqfMX3o": "you're

below so be sure to check it out if you are wanting to purchase these or if you want more information and all have various places where they are available so the other day when I posted on Instagram that I got them a lot of you wanted me to make a project with them I just haven't had the time to make a project so I decided just to show you guys the different colors and I will swatch them out for you guys on some black gesso at the end of the video but first if you haven't done so already please give this video a thumbs up I really do appreciate it and it helps me out so much also leave me a comment down below letting me know if you got your hands on the new finna bear waxes yet or if you want to and let's see I'm going to show you the stamps first so these are two by three clear stamps and I apologize for the glare I mounted my lights on my ceiling so I'm going to have to kind of play around with placement where they need to be so I apologize for the really bad glares but I will get the hang of it eventually alright this one is old receipt this one has some script on there and some like this little bird some lines it's really really neat and again these are two by three really nice size for like adding a little bit of mixed-media or texture to your projects it is super windy outside I don't know if you guys can hear the wind wow alright this one is secret notes oh I think that's the recycled rug being so loud anyways alright this one is secret notes this one has really nice font on there and to get into the waxes alright so I'm going to show you the colors and then again like I said before I will swatch them out on some black gesso so you guys can see them let's do this one is mint sparkle it's like Oh a nice green and there is no difference in the formulation or formula of the waxes just different colors some of you had asked whether or what the difference was between these waxes and the old waxes just new colors new colors to play around with so that we can create more gorgeous things with these waxes these waxes if you haven't played around with them I highly recommend them they have lasted me for years I haven't had any issues with them drying out one person had said that they got mold on it I think that might be the only person that I've heard I've had mine for years and I haven't had any issues so they definitely last for a long time and you can definitely make some really gorgeous things with them alright so the first one was mint sparkle this one is Heather Hills which is super super gorgeous can't wait to use this one if you guys don't know I love purple purple is my favorite color there's that one and then we got peacock which is another one of my favorites super pretty color and the packaging changed too so that's another thing but just more colors to play around with and who doesn't want more colors right this one is electric violet this one is old denim which is another really really pretty color come on camera this one is Blue Lagoon this one is Indian pink which is probably my favorite color it's so so pretty can same with this one as well Firebird like a orangie color it's really really pretty and this one is sweet rose so this one's more of a muted color there we go alright so I am going to get the paper so that I can swatch them out for you guys alright so I took them all out of the package and I noticed that these circular things that the wax go in you can probably use these for a shaker card or something because they have a little lip on them they attach really nicely although you know of course they would be really bulky but just an idea or you can use them to mix like the art stones or something in them as well so don't throw the packaging away alright I am going to start off with peacock I'm going to zoom in a tad there we go and you definitely want to keep the the foam on top that's going to keep them nice mmm they smell so good alright I know I'm weird but they smell really good some people don't like the smell but I do all right so this is peacock and that is it on white so it's a little bit greener on black bluer on white to get a little wipe here so I can semi-clean my hands in between alright this one is old denim this is gonna grab some from the top here this one's pretty much the same between black and white that one is really really dark blue well not really really dark but it's a darker blue this one is Firebird oh my goodness look at that one all right let's see all right so really orange on the black and it has like a reddish more of like a reddish pinkish tint on the white that one's really nice and we have sweet rose this is darker that I had thought it would be because the packaging looks so light there we go it's a really nice light pink alright next is Heather Hills which I'm so excited about I'll show you guys that one there these two colors would be really pretty together to create more of a make a shabby shabby look really pretty purple alright and next is electric violet holy moly look at that color Wow whoa that is definitely electric I don't know if I see myself using this color very often it's very like bright like I don't know how to explain it alright next is just kind of trying to clean my finger a little bit this one is Blue Lagoon I love how vibrant they are on the white as well I know some of the other colors in the past well especially the Opel magic and things like that were a little bit more muted kind of there we go all right this one I'm really excited to see as well this one's Indian pink holy moly look at that I think that's like the concentrated color on top wow that is crazy color right that's way too much whoa this is really pretty actually good see that that one's really really pretty so so far though oh well this one this one and that one are the ones that are a little bit different between the white and the black all right this one is last one and it is mint sparkle these ones are a little bit more like squishy I don't know how to explain it okay there's another one that is a little bit different between the white and the black really really pretty color alright so that is it I will definitely be doing a video on a project using these I think well you let me know down below in that in the comment section letting me know which colors you want me to do the project with and I will try to make that happen again if you liked this video please give it a thumbs up it really helps me out tremendously and you can also share this video on social media also be sure to check out my website I have a

alright again I want to thank you guys so much for watching and I'll catch you guys later bye", "HSQ0CVdoqXU": "hi i'm todd carroll winner's tiger product manager today we're going to talk about our new wintersiger high performance ski and snowboard wax we're going to cover usage and application of this petroleum free high performance product made for us by wendwax works designed for superior performance and to protect the environment and the mountains that we all love so we're going to talk about three different methods of application the first or basic method is going to be a very simple very easy rub on buff out application for that we need wax appropriate to the temperature and a buffing pad all that we're going to do with this is rub our wax on you can do this in the lodge on tailgate in a hotel room it's low mess easy application it has the least longevity and durability for your skis this will get you through a couple hours of skiing at most rub on making sure we get good coverage tip to tail we use our buffing pad and just buff everything out nicely and we're ready to go our next method of application the more advanced method is going to involve using an iron to drip wax onto the ski iron it in let it cool scrape it and buff it out this is a more advanced more durable application that will last longer it's important that you have the right tools here we need to add in a waxing specific iron that doesn't have holes for steam so you're not going to ruin your clothes going back and forth but it's also much more consistent in the temperature it delivers so you're not worried about burning your bases or smoking yourself out of your ski room we start with our iron bring it up to the appropriate temperature for our wax and then drip our wax on the ski once we have wax dripped on we use our iron to go back and forth always keeping the iron moving we don't want to pause and end up burning the ski and then finish with one long medium fast pass that's going to keep everything nice and smooth this makes it really easy to scrape the wax after it's cooled our bonus or expert application tip involves going to a shop that uses a watercider wax future tool this is an infrared lamp that will take the wax that's put on the ski and really cook it in for maximum durability it's robotic so all the shop needs to do is set up the cycle the way that's appropriate for the ski and the wax being used push a button and let it do its thing it's going to heat the wax thoroughly let it really saturate the base and give you maximum durability and performance out of your wax so with our wax ironed in and cooled we're ready to scrape we're going to use a nice sharp plastic scraper we're going to be really careful here to let the tool do the work we're going to remove the excess wax from the ski base one more tip i get asked all the time whether it matters pushing versus pulling the short answer is it doesn't use your preference but make sure that whatever you're doing you're not using too much pressure it's really easy when you're pushing to bend the scraper the same thing can happen when you're pulling and the end result is we want to let the tool do the work so it doesn't require a lot of push down to get to get it to do that [Music] once we have all the wax scraped off we're going to use our buffing pad and just give this ski a light buff we're ready to go enjoy our day on the hill thanks for joining us and learning about different methods of applying our new winter styler retail petroleum free wax please come back again and see us soon for more tips on how to get the most out of your equipment every day you go skiing or snowboarding", "vkw2ilv9pSg": "hey y'all trevor here with ready leaf and today we're gonna be diving into blend crafts indica blend wax you guys i'm really interested to see how this product is gonna do and how the overall flavor and effects are gonna be being a blend based concentrate you never quite know what to expect when you're diving into something like this so i'm looking to see that it's something tasty and something heavy hitting but the only way we're going to find out you guys is by cracking into it and checking it out so that's exactly what we're going to do right now let's pull up the website and get this information going so we can dive into this review y'all i'll see you on the other side of the intro welcome back everyone so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into blend crafts indica blend wax you guys i am really curious to see how this is going to do so this package is only a half gram container so any of the information around the price you do have to be aware that this is only a half of a gram and it came in right around the 35 range for the half gram so it's not outrageous but it is still a little bit on the pricey side the thc content for this sucker is going to be 72.6 percent we've got a cbd total of 0.89 and a package date of september 26 2020. we do have the decibel website pulled up which is going to be kind of the over lapping company for quest blendcraft uh what other brands do they have prairie records and general admission oh general mission is decibel so that would be that's actually really good to know that's really really good to know so craft blended is going to be the base information that they give us here and then blend carb blend craft keeps it simple with indica blend sativa blend and hybrid blend created only created using only flour and trichrome coated sugar leaf from quest collection of superior cultivars small batch grown in bc the strains are hand selected based on aroma flavor and effect then blended for a smooth smoking experience that is all the information that they have right now for it which is a little bit disappointing but it means that we don't have to wait any longer to dive in and start smoking we're going to crack this package open take a look at how it's packaged before we go into our first reviewable smoke and that's going to be through the puffco that sucker come on don't be dead on me already don't be dead on me don't i think the puffco might be dead on me you guys let's uh plug it in and make sure that we can smoke through this sucker for the review i'll see you guys on the other side of the urban scale we're diving in to the puffco cheers [Music] okay guys so we're gonna give that puffco a little bit of uh time to charge up i think we're just gonna have to leave it and let it get nice and fully charged before we do the next one of these reviews but for now we'll just get it charged up enough for us to be able to dive in and take our first dab of this blendcraft wax so right on there you got a thc sticker and opening this up you're getting a lot more of a kind oh you're getting a lot more of a sugared like sugared shatter concentrate here you guys stuck pretty well together and it's held its consistency really well you're getting a really sweet sticky s not not syrupy a kind of a sweet berry blend for the overall aroma oh honestly you guys it's quite exciting and uh quite a rich sweet sticky kind of a smell i am very excited to see how this is gonna taste and to really see how it's gonna melt down and break as we uh vaporize it and we run it through the different temperatures and the different ways of of dabbing you guys oh it just smells so sweet and it's got a little bit of a kind of a gassy gassy tone in there that i'm not minding i'm enjoying actually quite a bit you guys so let's turn the puffco on let's get that sucker set to the right temperature ah yeah i know that thing's good that thing's gonna take a while so you know what we're gonna do the same thing that we did last time we're gonna run it through the glass first give it a lot of time to charge up and then we'll come back to the puffco so the way we're gonna run through our glasses we have three different temperatures we will be trying this wax out at you guys so the first one will be a cold start through our hydros banger here and that's going to allow us to really taste um all the variants in flavors and just overall experience with this wax because we're gonna be able to start tasting and experiencing the vapor at the lowest temperature because we are starting it from cold all the way up to the highest temperature because we'll boil it off right until there's there's nothing left you guys so we've got a good little scoop in there you're not gonna be able to see it too well because my bangers are starting to get chased and i definitely need to pick up some new ones but we're gonna start her out with a nice cold start bubble dab of this indica blend wax and we're gonna see how it does you guys i'm hoping that it stays with that really rich sticky fruity flavor because if it does i'm going to be enjoying myself all the way through this review so we're just waiting for it to start melting down and start bubbling there we go we've got it now take our first haul and see how this is you guys cheers it is very sweet you guys let's give this a little bit more heat try and encourage a little bit more intensity cheers okay guys before we actually move into scoring this i thought i would uh hit you up with a little bit of a reach out that i want to say thank you uh the couple you that reached out in the last video and were thinking that i might have been a little bit too soft with uh with the scoring so we're gonna make a little bit of an adjustment and we're gonna start scoring with this video kind of being the tester and friday being the full commitment to the transition for that sativa review we've uh adjusted the way the scores are going to be so one through two is just going to be non-smokable you guys like it is barely able to get it down if it's getting a three out of a four it's harsh like it's making you cough a lot it's just not enjoyable the flavor's not quite there that five to six is going to be tolerable the six is where the flavors are going to start playing factor where you can enjoy it the seven to eight is the enjoyable side of it where you're actually looking forward to smoking that and then the 9 to 10 well that is gonna be pristine experience and smoking flavor you guys we uh we're gonna start having a little bit of a harder ranking and harder hitting scale but uh let's go ahead and hit up the evan shorebanger with its warm up we've got 50 seconds on that before we give it a minute cool down and we're back taking another dab for the low camp experience you guys i'm looking forward to it i hope you are as well i'll see you on the other side okay guys so we're gonna end up giving the cold start a six out of a ten it was enjoyable it had a decent flavor to it where we could definitely come back and smoke it like that again but it just really didn't have the heavy flavor experience that i'm looking for with my concentrates because there really are the more dessert style of my smoking but this sucker is almost at its minute cool down let's dive into it and see how the uh low temp dab taste before we rock it on the high one rip rip it not reap it but rip it through the puffco then the email before we wrap the sucker up but let's dive into it on a low temp dab cheers hey guys so i'm going to give the low temp a 5 out of a 10. it was just not memorable very bland very light in the overall um like the overall experience for the flavor and just didn't really have anything there that i'd be looking to taste or experience when i'm dabbing this for flavor you guys it's smooth it's really enjoyable that way to smoke but the flavor is really lackluster and with for me my concentrates being the dessert i want them to be quite tasty and potent for the flavor you guys so we're gonna warm up our uh cheap chyna banger for the hot dab because i've chased my good ones up already enough there's no reason to do it anymore so i'll see you guys in a little bit when we're dropping a hat hat dab to try this ending blend wax out from blended craft [ __ ] show okay guys so with our high temp dabs what we do is we heat the nail up and then we let it cool for 30 seconds and then we drop our dab into it so it's been 30 seconds cheers okay guys so the high temps are only going to get a 4 out of a 10. it was really harsh like outright disappointing kind of a harsh um hit to it it didn't have any of that flavor but it had that burn to the back your throat that just wasn't quite enjoyable there are some concentrates that i find smooth at that higher temp not overly flavorful but smooth and uh still relatively enjoyable but we've got a puffco ready we've got that sucker warming up and i'm just curious to see how this wax is going to melt down in here because uh usually you get some pretty big bubbles with anything that's gonna be really flavorful i found with my puffco i don't know if it's just a personal thing or uh anything like that but this one's right down the middle so let's see if the flavors down the middle too cheers y'all and uh we'll be right back with the score sometimes you need to go okay guys so we got the email ready here and the uh puffcoat's only gonna get a four out of a ten it's definitely the strongest tasting experience i've had so far and it tasted like strictly burning terps like it just was a raw burnt flavor similar to what i get when i press some hash rosin with some really old keef where it just it hits heavy and it hits with an extreme intensity but it's it doesn't taste very good at all so that's a little bit disappointing but we've got our email here i decided to set it a little bit lower than typical we've got it at 500 degrees so i'm curious to see how uh how this wax is gonna do in the email and at this temperature you guys so let's drop her in there and uh let's try it out and see see how she is cheers okay guys so the email's gonna end up getting a 5 out of a 10. it's not bad it had a decent flavor hint in there like it was very light kind of peppermint hint in there with a little bit of a spice rack medley and it's overall quite nice quite light in the experience so it's only getting that 5 out of a 10 just because it's not really all that exciting you guys it's just kind of that the old 7 it's gonna be the new five you guys and that's that's really all we're doing for shifting this course it's just making it a little bit tougher to get into that beautiful garbage curve because some of you some of you have noticed that we've been given a lot of the higher numbers i i've been thinking that myself but with the 5 out of 10 for the e-nail we've got a high at it with a 6 out of a 10. it's not bad it's got a decent enjoyment to it a really heavy mental drift to it like my mind's already focusing on the next three things that i want to get done today and tackle and it's just overall not not a bad experience for this strain but it it's got a headache that came in right after the second dab and that that was quite disappointing you guys and that really is the reason why i've knocked quite so many points off but we end up getting an overall with a nice mid-range 30 out of 60 down the middle um so honestly this is called straight had just a lack of flavor with a decent high to it it it's it's something that'll serve a purpose it'll get you baked but it's not really overly flavorful you guys and that's disappointing for me and that's that's really all all i can say about it i wish there was more flavor to it i'm curious to see if the hybrid or the sativa blend does have more flavor but we won't we won't find out about that until they come into stock but for the time being i'm just gonna say probably not gonna buy another half gram of this i'll finish this one up and i'll be content but uh hope you guys enjoyed this review if you guys did definitely leave a like down below let me know what you think of the new more uh a little harder praised based review yes new scoring system let me know what you think because we'll adjust it to where more where it it kind of balances out my appreciation for the bud as well as what you guys are actually looking for in a review because that's part of the reason why i'm doing it is to one to be able to experience as many different strays as i can which is a benefit for myself and as i take as kind of a little bit of a selfish benefit to doing these reviews and then the the other part is being able to provide them for you guys which i love doing and i don't think i don't think my uh my interest in smoking as many different strains outweighs the fact of wanting to get these reviews out for you guys so you guys can pick and enjoy the strains that you actually want to smoke but um for for this wax mid-range score for kind of a mid-range experience hope you guys enjoyed when the end card slides in all you got to do is hover over my logo to be able to click that subscribe button and the bell

we'll dive into a little bit of the 4x4 grow tent with the uh seed drops that we had in there and a little progress up to how they're doing today but we're gonna have all that and more this week i'll see you guys in the next one cheers y'all back later with some more content you", "8bl3gGoUSp8": "hi I'm Kevin and we're here in the shop today we're going to talk to you a little bit about waxing to you tell you the differences between the waxes what they're used for and how to apply it we'll start off with the basic stuff f4 or like rub on waxes glide waxes stuff like that they're really simple basic you can put them on on the hill or at the base or in your garage just very easy it doesn't require an iron or anything like that it's just go on a plug-and-play stuff a couple different types of f4 Zoar rub on waxes first it's gonna be like a solid like this this you can actually iron on or you can just rub it on you just heat it up a little bit you rub it on the face and then you'll use a fork to rub it in and polish it before you do this you do want to make sure your bases are clean so you can get some base cleaner clean off the bases and make sure you let that dry and then you put on the wax on top of that next it's gonna be another robot type this has got a sponge applicator this is a new thing I'm also gonna use swing so access today to demonstrate with because they're the most popular type of wax but this is just a sponge applicator again make sure base sir clean you squeeze it sponge it on let it dry for you know one or two minutes and then you just polish it off with some cork or something the other type of sponge applicator is one like this this one's been around for a while again you just squeeze dab it on and then you're good to go and then there's also a paste one and this comes with a little applicator where you just dab it on rub it in the skis let it dry and polish it off now we're going to talk about CH waxes are all your net waxes are now waxes are a little more technical they're going acquire a little more of investment than the f-for the rub on wax and we're talking about before you want it iron and you want a wax in there not a clothing or clothing irons I have the coals on them they're gonna fly up with wax they don't regulate they regulate the temperature very well so they're gonna burn up the waxes these waxes especially today's waxes are very temperature specific as far as to what snow conditions they want to be used on and also to what iron temperatures they need to be set at in order to be used if you have it like a clothing iron it's not gonna regulate the temperature and it's gonna destroy the makeup that chemical makeup with a wax it's also a require scraper and some brushes to brush out the wax so it's a little more of an investment you also may need a vise and a table in order to secure the skis but it's definitely worth it your skis are gonna perform much much better so we'll start off with the simple of the basics you've got Universal fire now axes they come in like usually two or three different temperature ranges like an all-encompassing one that's gonna be from you know say like 40 degrees Fahrenheit down to 20 degrees Fahrenheit these are snow temps so attempts are usually a couple degrees higher than air temps you've got like a cold one that's gonna go from like zero degrees to like 20 and they've got a warmer one that's gonna be like you know twenty-two there are like 30 to 50 so a couple different ones there again these are iron-on applications and they're universal so a little more specific max types where you get better performance at the base level is going to be that your hydrocarbon or like for Swick's they call it the CH waxes these are gonna more temperature specific at the bottom end of the temperature range you've got ch4 which is a negative 26 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit snow temp so this is a very hard cold temperature wax so it is gonna see I can't scrape this with my fingernail so it's very hard as the snow gets colder the crystals get sharper and they kind of dig into your base so you want that hard wax to help harden up the base of the ski next is going to be a CH 6 this is going to be a 10 to 21 degrees Fahrenheit snow temp this one's a little softer as you can see I can scrape the wax actually here so but it's still relatively hard to compare to some of the other ones so this one's a little more commonly used than the CH for the most popular one because it's covered as the broadest temperature range in the most common temperature range that most people ski or snowboard in is CH 7 this is a 18 to 28 degree Fahrenheit so temp so again Lisa that's the conditions that most people are going skiing most the time so this is by far the most popular temperature range of Wax you can see this one's softer I can actually you know scrape this one pretty easily but it's still gonna add some hardness to the base because you know at 18 degrees to snuff to be still pretty cold another popular one is CH 8 this is 25 to 34 degrees snow temp this one's definitely softer as you can see I can easily scrape my finger into this one I can take a chunk out with no problem this is gonna fling me for warmer conditions you know maybe spring early season skiing this is also good as a prep wax or even be adding moisture into the base because it is a soft wax it does get into the base very easily and penetrates the base and adds a lot of moisture in the base the more most you have any base the faster you're gonna go and the Easter you're gonna glide at the warmer side of the spectrum you've got ch 10 this is 30 to 250 degrees so this is for when snow is melting when it's slushy out spring skiing for sure this is the type of wax you want it's very soft again this is good for base prep I mean easily dig my nail into this one take a chunk out it's a very soft very porous wax it's going to be very easily absorbed into the base this skis going from there you get into like the next step up it's going to be in ofx LFO access Kim and the same temperature ranges as the CHS the difference is is here against a low fluorocarbon so this is going to be much faster better gliding wax you can use this as a single overlay so but if you want to perform its best we're gonna use a CH wax underneath it and then put it L off on top the CHS are gonna penetrate into the base butter the elif's are gonna be give you a nice good glide the fluorocarbons are naturally with the moisture way so it's glides very easily get along the snow and again these come the same temperature ranges as the CHS they just are going to be a little more expensive and they're gonna glide much much better step up from there you get into HF wax again these the same temperature ranges as the CH s and LS we just talked about these are really really getting to the high performance that spectrum of the wax it's high floral content for a carbon content here so it's really going to wick that snow away and that fluorocarbon concentrate is what makes the price go up as well it's a very expensive molecule therefore it drives the price up but it's very effective and in wicking the moisture way and like I said this is really really starting to get into your entry level waste race waxes so these are going to be used very sparingly as you can see the packages are much smaller here so it's gonna be an overlay a lot of people to conserve these they'll instead of ironing them in they'll actually rub them on and then to go over it with like a quick iron or a cork brush to get these in to conserve the wax that's spectrum - there's also what they call a BD HF wax or the black wolf these are going to be for dirty or snow news snow where it's a course or snow man-made snow these have additives in them which make them faster in those conditions at the top of the spectrum you get into this year there's a couple different types of stairs there's powder they're solids there's now liquid forms stairs are going to be applied before the start of a race they're very expensive you're using very sparingly and they're applied great before the start of the race because they don't last very long and they just give them really on the top layer at the base but they're very fast very effective for race type conditions there's some other types of wax as well there's also like some powder waxes like in its ch3 or now f3 these are harder than the materials you're not designed to really be used on their own but they're designed to be and it's other layers of wax a lot of times they've come Lea used on the edges of a ski or snowboard to prevent base burn a lot of times you'll see that chalky white material on along the edge of your ski or snowboard that is called base burn and it's from the friction against the snow that causes the base material actually burnt this is a hardy antov that you'll apply to that and it'll actually you iron in and mix it with another wax that'll help harden the edge of that ski or snowboard to prevent from getting base burn there's also some quick easy liquid waxes these are performance liquid wax this is a post like the f-4s that we talked about before they're the same way they're just applied as a rub on you squeeze it sponge it in let it dry for a couple minutes but these are gonna be more temperature specific the f-4s or all company's temperatures these are going to be temperatures for the fixture in a much better performance out of these one other thing that I mentioned earlier is going to be the base prep base prep waxes coming into a couple different kinds the thing with them is is that the you're adding moisture the base they're designed to clean the skis if you're doing a pre wax cleaning or to add moisture to the base like I said before the more moisture you get in the base the faster that users are going to glide a lot of times you'll see with like the World Cup racers you'll look at their bases and they'll be clear but they have a reddish reddish tint or a purplish tint to them that's because they have so much base prax in them one other thing that you can check out if you're just a rack waxer and you'll want to make the investment in a bunch of different kinds of waxes and you just want to test it out is Swiss makes these combi packs and that's where you get basically three different types of wax you get a CH eight or an eighth of seven and six here and the advantage of that is that you get individual bars you can get a couple different waxings out of each one bar and you don't have to make the investment in all the different ones so you can kind of test it out with it get a quickie so okay so that pretty much covers all the different types of waxes like I said we talk more specifically about Suites because that is the most proper typical wax today as a reference points other companies do make some more types of waxes that is very easily relatable hoping this breaks it down for you and answers all your questions you need to know about different types of wax", "yJFTfSZa3MQ": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well make sure you guys go

one is actually the raspberry punch 5 so I heard actually this is one of the most popular flavors that rock garden has to offer a lot of people like this when I bought it the bought the bug I can't even talk the budtender was like yo man I completely because I totally recommend this one cuz this flavor flies and people really like this one it's a indica hybrid 87 percent THC alright and like

move not one bit cheers everybody let's try it out not the band that has a different flavor than the rest of the rock garden I mean you guys can kind of tell what what flavor how raw garden tastes if you guys already tried rock garden it's kind of like it's like kind of like a leaf it's like a length like a lime you know kind of like a lime you taste limey if I can line this one has like a little raspberry kick to it at the very end and it's nothing too major to the point where it's just like okay this is like added flavor it's more of like a natural type taste but you know in my brain into telling me how it's mental you know it's raspberry damn so if you guys don't know me was good I'm the founder of this channel in the cut so it's crazy because one of my favorite brands cartridge wise there's still a lot of cartridges I need to try a lot of different brands but to be honest with you guys when this raw garden one has to be one of the most five cards I've ever tried one card that's coming out pretty soon that you guys probably the see review on I'm soon as I get my hands on it it's gonna be the 7/10 lab cartridges no you guys already know 7/10 last man they got some fire wax they got some fire concentrates you know so I can only imagine them you know dropping a fire has cartridge you know sounds a sight like man to it then everybody nobody lit [ __ ] let me know what you guys are smoking on if you guys are of age again I'm not convincing anybody to smoke or anything like that's just a review people watch the people that come across these videos they're already a cannabis patient put it that way you know let me know what you guys recommend though some stuff um I have tried [ __ ] what brand was it it was like um a rover brand and a Rover Rover something like that you know it was some type of round like that I've tried that one - that one's super [ __ ] fire there's a runt brand I guess Brent's supposedly grunts has their own little thing I don't know because um the time I came across it I did like the whole little check I like you know what and that [ __ ] was cut it was like somewhat clear it was pretty clear no lie and it was just super thick

just nice clean all that stuff keep like the mouthpiece the bottle Pete Pete I can't the bottom piece you see that little magnet right there sometimes that [ __ ] gets a little dirty with like the stuff that the little gunk that your your cartridge gives off at the bottom or either this could be a little dirty too and sometimes it just doesn't connect with each other you know it doesn't fully touch doesn't fully touch and like the metal you know was the worst explanation [ __ ] ever it is it fully connect so the electricity doesn't warm this [ __ ] up so you don't get the hit so you gotta may sometimes you gotta make sure you got to clean that [ __ ] off before you guys throw you where your pen noise somebody told me the comment down below get to rock gardens and hit a blinker I was

like you know little little it's it's like a jewel type thing you know it's like a little pod and I was like two magnets in the bottom once again everybody this is an 18 and educational video I do not condone the usage of this because obviously is not healthy for you I do not sell anything on this channel and I'm not advertising anything all crazy you know earlier today I know this is an indica oh my god I took like [ __ ] I'm not gonna but about like maybe like four or five nice little ribs you know you know you guys know me I don't take fire ribs you know I take little ribs and [ __ ] it took five four or five ribs in the morning and I went to [ __ ] work hey came back home and I was loved and I wake bug I ate real quick and all the high cool I'm gonna start recording I got to start editing I gotta start boom-boom decide that the next hustle starts right [ __ ] I can't even function area now so I'm like you know what I heard what you have to do is you have to take a 20-pot wente minute power nap so I was told my phone I was like I put a 25 minute timer and I was tired tired like so tired to the point where I'm gonna close my eyes and I'm I just cake I laid down I put my [ __ ] boat boom literally woke up like like 16 17 minutes later like I literally passed out like a little you just blacked out and I woke up and I was like oh sure Pelican I was like damn I feel like I took like a two hour nap I looked at the time and it was like like five minutes left and I was like what the [ __ ] damn I got up and I was like damn I literally felt like I took a nap and then you know right before this but right before me recording this video I was just like haha i sat down for a big you know a little AC here and my [ __ ] room so I get a cold as [ __ ] in my room you know cuz this one is hot you know turn that [ __ ] on it was cold as [ __ ] set up the lights you know got everything ready the whole set up and she got cup tea and then I'm like but I feel good you know that [ __ ] little 20 minute partner was fire so you guys try to instead of sleeping for like one or two hours try to take a like a 20 to no more than 30 minutes 20 to 25 minute after that wake up maybe slap someone in your face or take a shower you know what I usually like to do is I like to take a shower and [ __ ] you know because sometimes I'll be waking up like us it's really six but I'd be going to sleep hello late sometimes like 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning because I just be of editing [ __ ] you know for the main channel and all that stuff you know trying to work on [ __ ] [ __ ] anyways y'all holla jogo hope you guys have a good day oh hello Johnny eat this goddamn hello buddy I'm well did it like a blood that's just a game lab tested and then it's 100% cannabis nothing really added to it look at it shout out the shot at the government for allowing us to smoke this for an educational use you know", "-iI8IAgDNhA": "what is going on welcome back to the i smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm back with another entry into our cbd extract review series featuring the goods chatter and wax this time it is sour apple their new flavor that they've just brought out and i wanted to take a look at it right here on the icemoke channel let's get into it sour apple is one of the ever-growing range of flavors on offer from the goods cbd over on their website over the past best part of a year i've been looking at several different flavors we've looked at some of the weed inspired flavours like og kush and girl scout cookies we've looked at some of the beverage inspired flavors like mojito and we've looked at some other newer flavors such as tropical citrus which i've really enjoyed as well today we're looking at sour apple which is a fruity entry into the products lineup this is smelling fantastic i did have a sneak peek of a smell and a dab actually last night dabbed some of the wax before i filmed this video the goods make two forms of cbd extract they are gmp certified so good manufacturing processes and they contain zero 0 thc they're broad spectrum in terms of the cbd wax and cbd isolate in terms of the cbd shatter so this is 99 cbd and this is 80 cbd with broad spectrum which means it also has other minor cannabinoids as well both of these pots of extracts have the same terpene profile so that is the sour apple profile created by the goods as part of their new range that means that this is some unique tasting extract developed specifically for this company it is not following a specific cannabis strain with this in mind it's going to be really nice for people who might not necessarily like the cannabis tastes but want the benefits of cannabidiol we're going to take a look at it let's get into it opening it up then you can see the difference between the extracts i sort of jump about as to which is my favorite form of the goods extract sometimes i prefer the wax because i like that kind of that balance of additional cannabinoids and knowing that it's in there and then sometimes if it's just for the pure flavor i like the shatter as well i see the benefit of both when it comes to cbd you can get the benefits of cbd without the other cannabinoids but the other cannabinoids help not hurt got two forms of consumption method today i've got my dab rig here and i have my lynx ember pen which is also available with the goods products over on the hemphealth website so i'm going to put some into this and we're going to taste it right about now via vaping and dabbing just before i do i want to talk to you about this smell of this extract because it is very aptly named it has the same sort of undertone as like a granny smith apple that kind of the the not the sweet side of apple the sour side of apple actually reminds me of being a kid picking apples from a tree taking them home and my mum being like you can't eat them once is that it's that sort of sour appley sort of aroma you can really smell that that is sour apples i would say that the wax smells more like sour apples than the shatter which still has the same terp profile but is kind of coming through into my nostrils in a slightly different way but both of them smell great so let's dab them and see how they taste super easy to vape the cbd extract using the lynx ember you just need to put some of your extract into the device onto the coil like so and it is ready to turn on and vape so we're going to do that right about now and then i will use some of the wax in the dabrick so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press it twice to put it in session mode and now that's going to melt down that extract and we're going to get an idea of that flavor cheers oh both very smooth and really tasty actually very clean tasting there's less to that than i was expecting as i'm exhaling it's just kind of like a a smooth lightly flavored vapour rather than a sort of turps turps turps in your mouth that is nice coming through you get sort of slight fruity notes but it's not in forms of the sweetness that i was expecting despite the name sour apple it is more kind of just just making my brain aware that there's kind of a fruity perhaps apple aroma coming through a smooth vapor exhalation like a slightly like um flavored nice flavor but slightly flavored vapor taste as you exhale i'm gonna put some into the dab rig with the 80 cbd which looks lovely by the way it looks like a hard-boiled sweet i love the color of it so we're about to dab the sour apple goods cbd wax 80 broad spectrum cannabinoid extract this is gonna be fun join me for this one and i will see you all on the other side [Music] so that was [Music] a proper dabbing experience wowzer so vape that a lovely low temperature in the dabrick as you can see [Music] with the intention of preserving as many of those turps as possible and the sour apple extract did not disappoint what i sensed in the aroma i can now taste at the back of my mouth sort of at the back roof of my mouth but again a lovely sort of exhalation of this vapor like it's not too overpowering it's in fact it's not overpowering we've added turps it's just got a nice hit to it you know which is really really nice when it comes to the cbd wax out of the two which do i prefer i'm not actually sure because they both have a nice flavor i like the broad spectrum from a consumption perspective i prefer to consume it but i recognize that the chatter is a lovely form of extract as well despite being 99 cbd iceland as opposed to the 80 i'm just going to try putting some of the wax into my links ember device it's just melting into its own vapor that that's so cool [Music] yeah the wax has got ever so slightly more of a sort of terpenes to it that could be because i used more wax in this pen than i did chatter really tasty and they're definitely getting nicer as well so that i would say that tropical citrus was one of my favorite goods flavors and now sour apple easily matches it in terms of how nice it is so yeah i really like that i will mainly consume this either in the links ember or in the poda vaporizer that i got from the hemphealth website because they make it super easy to just load in some extract and dab or vape it i've also got my dab rig out so from time to time when i want bigger hits when i want nice chunks of extract i will chuck them onto this heated up banger and vaporize them that way but overall it's a nice form of cannabis extract on the cbd side you can find this on the hemp health website with the discount code i smoke 10 which will get you 10 off effects wise obviously cbd is not psychotropic so it is not changing my mental state to make me more inebriated however it is working on my cb1 and cb2 receptors meaning that it will have potential benefits and impacts in several areas related to endocannabinoid deficiencies or specific um diseases or illnesses that i may or may not have that is the good thing about cbd is that it interacts with the same receptors as thc but has its own set of beneficial properties so really cool stuff i personally noticed becoming more alert more easily able to retain facts when i'm reading and learning and less anxious as a result of my cbd consumption how does cbd help you i want to know leave your comments below telling me how cbd benefits you if you are using it and remember to hit that thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you're enjoying our content to help us grow that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep talking

pauper.\nNot bad for something that we shake, stomp, and hide\nunderground. Now, \"Wine\" on Modern Marvels.\nCaptioning sponsored by A&E TELEVISION NETWORKS\nIt's known simply as \"crush.\" The annual fall harvest of\ngrapes that marks the beginning of California's winemaking\nseason. >> JEFF STEWART: We usually\nstart harvesting grapes in September.\nIt's a time of year where all of our hard work, from an entire\nyear, kind of comes to fruition. It's kind of the Super Bowl for\nus. >> NARRATOR: Every year, in\nwinemaking regions around the world, millions of tons of\ngrapes are gathered, either by hand...\nor by powerful mechanical harvesters that shake the vines\ninto submission. In California alone, more than\nthree million tons of wine grapes are harvested annually.\nBut the decision to machine or handpick is just one of many\nthat every winemaker must make. At Buena Vista Carneros, for\nexample, the harvest is done only by hand, and occurs at\nnight to preserve freshness. >> STEWART: The warmer the\nfruit comes into the winery, usually the less fruit\nintensity you'll have in the final wine.\nSo we're really, really big fans of getting out there when\nit's cold. Get the fruit in here and...\nand take care of it from there. >> NARRATOR: At the winery, the\ngrape clusters are quickly sorted, then they fall into a\nde-stemmer, where a series of beater bars gently knock the\ngrapes from their stems. Once separated and cleaned, the\ngrapes are now ready to become wine.\nGrapevines are among nature's great survivors, and often\nthrive in places where little else will grow.\nInitially divided into red and white, there are literally\nthousands of grape varieties in the world, although only six--\nRiesling, sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Merlot,\nand Cabernet Sauvignon-- account for 80% of all American wine\nsales. >> JIM LaMAR: Each grape imparts\ndifferent flavors into the wine, depending on how juicy the\ngrape is, how thick the skin is. Some of the grapes are very\naromatic, some are not. Some of them have better color,\nmore tannin-- the astringent, puckery flavor that is common to\nwine. >> NARRATOR: But, no matter\ntheir color or variety, all wine grapes will share a common\ndestiny-- fermentation-- one of nature's remarkable processes.\nAs the grapes grow on the vine, they develop sugars within as a\nby-product of photosynthesis. Only the grape's elastic skin\nprotects these sugars from a naturally occurring yeast that\nforms on the grapes' exterior. When the grape skin is broken,\nor \"crushed,\" the yeasts assault the sugars, consuming them in a\nfury that results in alcohol. >> BO BARRETT: If you took these\ngrapes, and we put them in a bucketful in the back of your\ncar, and you stomped them a little bit, about a week\nlater, in your garage, you'd have some wine being made.'d\nThat's pretty amazing. >> NARRATOR: Today, presses of\nall sizes are used to extract the grape juice and begin\nfermentation. To what degree that juice\nremains in contact with the grape skins, and even seeds, is\ncrucial to the character of any wine.\n>> STEWART: With a white grape, we'll separate the juice and\nthe skins immediately, and that juice will ferment by itself.\nWith reds, we actually ferment the skins and the juice all\ntogether, because everything that makes a red wine what it\nis, is in the skins. The juice itself is clear, it's\ncolorless, it doesn't have the true flavor of the varietal, so\nthe character is really in the skin.\n>> NARRATOR: French scientist Louis Pasteur was the first to\nclearly define the biological process of fermentation.\nAlthough the mystery of wine fermentation had taken\ngenerations to solve, its intoxicating effects had been\nknown throughout time. >> LaMAR: Well, they found\nsunken jars in present-day Iran that they dated to about 4,000\nto 5,000 years B.C. >> NARRATOR: Nearly every\ncivilization since has made wine a centerpiece in its religious\nand cultural life. The Greeks and Egyptians spread\nwinemaking throughout the known world, and the Romans became its\nfirst great merchants. But, throughout the ages, no\ncivilization has been more passionately associated with\nwine than France. Beginning in the 11th century\nA.D., French monks were the first to make detailed studies\nof the complex relationship between wine and the soil and\nthe climate in which it grows. Over time, the monks walled off\nparcels of land that consistently produced wines of\ngreater subtlety and flavor-- parcels that today still make\nthe most expensive wines in the world.\nRemarkably, many of those vineyards were located in the\nthin, mineral soils along slopes and ridges, where\ngrowing conditions were harder. This reflected a concept we now\ncall \"stress.\" >> STEWART: It's a concept that\nwinemakers and grape growers come back to because a vine that\nstruggles really does produce wine with more intensity and\nmore... more color and more structure.\nAnd the stress from the rocky soil here-- from the lack of\nwater, from the wind that we see on a... on a ridge top like\nthis-- really adds to the intensity of a wine.\n>> NARRATOR: Buena Vista Carneros is the oldest premier\nwinery in California. But, in the 1990s, a wave of\nthe vine-killing insect phylloxera swept through the\nNapa and Sonoma valleys, forcing Buena Vista to replant 30% of\ntheir vineyards. >> LaMAR: Phylloxera became a\nproblem in California in the early '90s, so they had to end\nup replanting a lot of the vineyards, all at the same\ntime, which was very costly. But it also gave them an\nopportunity to capitalize on the improvements in viticulture\nin the last 20 years of the 20th century.\n>> NARRATOR: One of the most important improvements is\nprecision farming. Hi-tech tools, like digital\naerial photography, gave those at Buena Vista a view of their\nvineyards otherwise invisible to the naked eye.\n>> MELISSA STAID: Our background is actually in remote sensing\nof other planets... so, studying the moon and Mars-- NASA\ntechnology. And so we wanted to apply that\nsame technology to the earth. >> NARRATOR: Using images taken\nat 10,000 feet with a four-band digital camera, companies like\nVine View Imaging create a series of maps based on thermal,\nnear-infrared, and other color spectrums.\nThese maps reveal much about the condition of the vineyards.\nFor example, because of the intense sun, vines must cool\nthemselves or their basic chemical functions begin to\nfail. Healthy vines will evaporate\nwater through their leaves and roots, and appear in this stress\nmap in light green and yellow. Vines that are struggling are\nin the red and brown regions, while the dark green areas are\nunder-stressed, and not working hard enough.\nBringing all the vines into better balance may mean a\nsimple adjustment in irrigation. However, if the pattern\npersists, it may also signal a need to replant the block with\na different type or variety of grape, and what was once a\nsingle vineyard must then be farmed as many.\n>> STEWART: Well, right here today, across the 800 acres that\nare planted, we have 167 different blocks, and each of\nthose blocks, we really farm as an individual vineyard, so we\ndon't think of this as an 800-acre vineyard.\nIt's really 167 little vineyards, and you have to\napproach it that way, because the needs of this block are very\ndifferent from the block next door where you have different\nsoil types, you have different water-holding capacities, and\nthat's really the beauty of what we've done here.\n>> NARRATOR: Construction of each new vineyard block requires\nother hi-tech tools to precisely define their physical layout.\n>> TIM GOETZ: Basically, what I do is I come out to a new\ndevelopment vineyard, or even an established vineyard, and I use\nthe GPS to shoot off the satellites in space to map out\nthe area that they're going to plant the vineyard.\n>> NARRATOR: GPS units lock in where the vine rows are spaced\nand planted, and also position irrigation pipelines, manholes,\nand other practical elements. Once this work is completed,\nall that is needed are the vines themselves.\n>> BOB HERRICK: This is a typical grafted grapevine that\na vineyard here would use to plant for their vineyard.\nAnd it's composed of really two different plants.\nOne, it's the root stock, which is the bottom part here, and\nthen we call the scion wood, bud wood, or we call it\nfruiting wood on the top. >> NARRATOR: When young, these\ntwo independent vines are joined together in a process known as\n\"bench?grafting.\" The new graft is dipped in wax\nfor protection, then raised for one year, in the nursery, until\nit's replanted in the vineyard. >> CRAIG WEAVER: This point\nhere-- here's where the graft was made at Mr. Herrick's\nnursery and, from this point down, obviously, is a root\nstock, and then we grafted a scion, or bud wood, on top of\nthis. In this case, it was Pinot Noir.\n>> NARRATOR: There are 16 distinct root stocks grown at\nHerrick's, each offering the winemaker a potential match for\nthe various soil conditions at his winery.\nThe fruiting wood is chosen both for the type of wine the\nwinemaker wants to produce, as well as for the climate and\nweather of the region where the winery is found.\n>> STEWART: Here in Carneros, it's a very cool region.\nYou can see, today, it's a fairly gray morning.\nWe get a lot of fog. Very, very cool weather,\ntypically, compared to some other growing regions.\nSo that's driven us to really focus on what we consider\ncool-climate varietals. Chardonnay, Pinot Noir are the\nclassic cool-climate varietals around the world.\n>> NARRATOR: But even then, within varieties like Pinot Noir\nor Chardonnay, there exist distinct strains, known as\nclones. In the vineyards at Buena Vista,\nthere are currently 25 different Pinot Noir clones\nplanted. >> STEWART: Each of these clones\nwill have a different characteristic, different\nflavors, maybe a different ripening pattern.\nAnd the whole goal for us is to match up that exact clone on the\nperfect spot. And that's how you make the\nbest wines. >> NARRATOR: Grapevines require\nfour years to bear useable fruit.\nThe first grape buds appear in March.\nFor the next seven months, growers keep a diligent eye\nover every inch of the vineyard, constantly measuring\ngrowth and stress patterns. >> WEAVER: Six inches depth,\nwe have a very, very dry 18% moisture.\n>> NARRATOR: By the fall, each block of grapes has developed\nunique characteristics of flavor, acids, tannins and\ncolor. These blocks are then harvested\nand fermented separately, in order to form the building\nblocks of the wine to come. >> STEWART: Well, by keeping\neach vineyard block, or little section of the vineyard,\nseparate, through the winemaking process, it allows us to put\ndifferent blends together at the end of the year.\nYou might have one section of the vineyard that gives you\nreally great cherry and berry flavors, and you might have\nanother section that gives you really good, kind of earthy,\ncomplex flavors. Well, we can take those wines,\nblend them with all their brothers and sisters, and come\nup with a wine that's more complex, more interesting, and,\nin the end, tastes better in the glass.\n>> NARRATOR: What took the French monks centuries to\ndiscern can now be manipulated and fine-tuned in a matter of\nyears. In less than a decade after the\nphylloxera wave, Buena Vista Carneros is again making\naward-winning wines. But technological innovation\nisn't confined to just the vineyards.\nIt's in the winery, as well. \"Wine\" will return, on Modern\nMarvels, here on the History Channel.\n>> NARRATOR: We now return to \"Wine,\" on Modern Marvels.\nThey're one of the industry's biggest players, yet outside of\nthe wine business, few have heard of them.\n>> BOB STASHAK: This is a 94,000 square foot facility.\nIt houses three bottling lines. Two of the bottling lines run at\n240 bottles per minute, and the latest line we added runs at\nabout 200. So you combine all that\ncapacity, we can kick out 55,000 cases of wine a day.\n>> NARRATOR: Founded in 1974, Bronco Winery produces more than\n20 million cases of wine annually-- a leader in what is\ncalled the value wine business. >> FRED FRANZIA: Good wines\nshould be something you enjoy with good food and you should\nbe able to afford to do it everyday.\nThat's the name of the game. >> NARRATOR: Of Bronco's 40-plus\nlabels, only a few sell for more than ten dollars a bottle.\nTheir most famous brand, Charles Shaw, is popularly known as\n\"Two Buck Chuck.\" That's right-- two dollars a\nbottle, which wine-drinkers enjoy at a rate of 5.5 million\ncases annually. >> LAMAR: It caught the ear of\nthe public, and caught their palate and their pocketbook, and\nso people were buying wine by the case and, and drinking it\nregularly. >> NARRATOR: Less than an hour's\ndrive from Bronco's high- powered bottling facility is one\nof Napa Valley's most historic wineries-- Chateau Montelena,\nfamous for its handcrafted wines.\n>> BARRETT: The wine industry has a nice pyramid and there's\nthe mass, bulk producers that are making lots and lots and\nlots of cases. And that's a part of the\nindustry that's good because it brings wine at a good price to\na lot of people, but what we do is we're making what we consider\nhandcrafted or estate wines. Part of what you're paying for\nis the love and the labor of these people trying to make\nevery single bottle of wine special.\n>> NARRATOR: Together, the value-driven Bronco and\nMontelena's handcrafted vintages reflect the two primary trends\nof not just California wines, but of winemaking around the\nworld. When California State Senator\nAlfred Tubbs founded Chateau Montelena in 1882, he envisioned\na winery in the tradition of the great French estates.\nBy 1896, Montelena was the fourth largest winery in Napa,\nbut Tubbs' legacy was cut short by the advent of Prohibition.\nFor wineries across California, the Temperance Movement meant\nthe end. >> LAMAR: There were over 700\nindividual wineries in operation prior to Prohibition,\nand less than 50 or 60 survived Prohibition.\n>> NARRATOR: But if Prohibition had brought a close to the first\ngreat era of California winemaking, its repeal began\nanother. Science and technology were\napplied to wine-growing as never before, as the wine industry\nsought to regain consumers. Vineyards were planted on a mass\nscale and innovations devised at colleges like the University\nof California at Davis became standard.\nToday, that innovative spirit still echoes in powerhouse\nwineries like Bronco, which owns more than 35,000 acres across\nnine California counties. >> FRANZIA: It's all dealing\nwith today's technology and applying it into the, uh,\nscience of making better products in a more economical\nway to keep those prices down and keep those imports home\nwhere they should be. >> NARRATOR: Here, grapes are\nshaken from the vine via a fleet of 43 mechanical harvesters.\nAt a typical rate of ten tons per hour, 80 men would be needed\nto pick the equivalent of just one harvester on an average day.\nDuring crush, 300 trucks arrive daily at Bronco's winery--\none about every three minutes during the harvest process.\nA series of 30- to 50-ton presses turn the grapes into\njuice. A typical press is a large\ncylindrical container with a rubber membrane affixed to the\ninterior walls. This membrane is steadily\ninflated with air pressure to extract the juice, which flows\ninto circular, perforated drain channels.\nFull pressure is maintained for only a few minutes, before the\nmembrane will deflate and the residue will be removed.\nHigh-powered centrifuges then eliminate nearly all remaining\nsolid waste, enhancing the quality and speed of the wine's\ndevelopment. Fermentation occurs over 12 days\nwithin this sea of 45 to 54-foot tall storage tanks, capable of\nholding more than 80 million gallons of wine.\nOnce ready, the wine is shipped to another Bronco facility,\nwhere it is quality-checked, bottled and then corked.\n>> STASHAK: We call them \"jaws.\" It's like a diaphragm almost--\nin a camera-- because what it will do is, it'll squeeze or\nconstrict around the cork and then it squeezes it smaller than\nthe opening of the bottle, right?\nAnd then a plunger, just a metal rod, comes down and shoves the\ncork into the bottle. >> NARRATOR: When Bronco owner\nFred Franzia's grandfather opened his first winery in the\nSan Joaquin Valley, the hope was to sell a good bottle of wine at\na fair price. Today, Bronco delivers on that\ndream at a rate of 240 bottles per minute.\n>> FRANZIA: I'm a firm believer the consumer is the smartest\nperson out there and he knows what he wants and we've got to\nfind out, as suppliers of the consumer, the products they want\nand what they want to pay for. And if you give 'em good\nquality, a good value, they find it.\n>> NARRATOR: In 1972, lawyer Jim Barrett purchased Chateau\nMontelena and began to revitalize the winery.\nIn only a few years, his efforts would make history.\nIn 1976, a British wine merchant in Paris organized a blind\ntasting test that pitted world- class, historic French wines\nagainst the new wave of American upstarts, including a 1973\nMontelena Chardonnay. Despite a panel of all French\njudges, the Americans won every category.\n>> LAMAR: They beat the French wines, and this was quite a\nstartling thing. >> NARRATOR: Now known as \"The\nJudgment of Paris,\" this single event transformed world\nperception of California wines overnight.\n>> BARRETT: That one event, that tasting in the summer of 1976,\nsuddenly, the barricades to the marketing of handcrafted\nCalifornia wine dropped in one day.\n>> NARRATOR: Today, Montelena's commitment to handcrafting wines\nextends from their exceptional vineyards to the winery.\nNo detail in the process is overlooked.\nWhen fermentation is complete, all of Montelena's wines are\nstored in oak barrels-- whites for eight to nine months, reds\nfor upwards of two years. Many of these barrels are\nhandcrafted at Seguin Moreau, one of the world's historic\ncooperages. No glue or nails are used to\nconstruct them, and the type of oak from which they're made\nwill produce distinct flavors in the wine.\n>> JOHN FORSTER: French oak has quite a bit of tannin that it\nbrings to the wine. It brings a sweetness,\ncomplexity and structure, which are all things that are good for\nbig, red wines or white wines. It gives them longevity.\nIt gives them length in the bottle.\nAmerican oak is known for its aromatic characters-- a lot of\nvanilla and spice, and it sort of is also known... it fills in\nthe middle of a wine very nicely.\n>> NARRATOR: As the wines age in the oak, Barrett and his team\ntaste them constantly. >> Cruising along nicely.\n>> BARRETT: Take a look in December and see what we think.\n>> NARRATOR: Once the wines have reached the desired richness,\nblending begins, a process that takes weeks.\n>> BARRETT: Even if you liked the first blend, you say, \"Man,\nthis is fantastic,\" we still have to go back and make sure\nthat we couldn't do something better.\n>> NARRATOR: Altogether, the creation of a Chateau Montelena\nwine takes a minimum of one year for whites, and two for reds.\nThat commitment to quality is a hallmark for many wines--\nincluding the king of them all, champagne.\n\"Wine\" will return, on Modern Marvels.\n>> NARRATOR: We now return to \"Wine,\" on Modern Marvels.\nChampagne, the king of wines. Born in silent and humid\ncellars, its sparkling character and intoxicating bubbles are\nthe very essence of celebration. >> LAMAR: The carbon dioxide\nthat's formed during the fermentation process, um,\nevaporates, is allowed to escape, but in champagne, it's\ntrapped in the product, and it's only released when the bottle is\nopened. >> NARRATOR: To understand this\nremarkable wine, champagne must be thought of as a place as well\nas a drink... a region of France with its own\nunique geography and history. Throughout the centuries, every\nFrench king maintained vineyards here, and the wines became a\nstaple of their coronation ceremonies.\nBut Champagne is located at a more northern latitude than\nQuebec, Canada, making it one of the coldest wine centers in the\nworld. And because of this northern\nlocale, a unique pause in the wine's development occurred\nduring winter... when the cold stopped fermentation until the\nspring thaw. >> NARRATOR: Once opened,\npressure within the barrels caused the wine to froth, a\nphenomenon that French winemakers, including the fabled\nmonk, Dom Perignon, spent decades trying to reverse.\n>> LAMAR: Dom Perignon was trying to remove the bubbles\nfrom champagne. The English discovered that they\nliked it, and they've always been the best customers for\nchampagne and sparkling wine. And, um, probably without their\ninterest, there wouldn't even be champagne as we know it-- it\nwould be still wine, no bubbles. >> NARRATOR: In 1811, the French\nchampagne house of Perrier-Jouet was founded, born appropriately\nof a marriage between the daughter of a vineyard owner and\na cork maker. They immediately began to export\ntheir champagnes to England. By then, champagne was cellared\nin bottles rather than barrels, which captured the CO2 gasses--\nin essence, carbonating the wine.\nIn less than a generation, Queen Victoria herself had embraced\nPerrier-Jouet, and it has remained a favorite in British\ncircles ever since. >> NARRATOR: Champagne is made\nfrom three varieties: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and\nPinot Meunier. >> NARRATOR: Through two\npressings, fermentation and blending, these remarkable\ngrapes are handled just as they would be for still wines.\nJuice from the first pressing, known as the cuvee, is\nconsidered the finest. In champagne, consistency is\nprized above all else, and the new cuvee is blended with\nwines from previous years to ensure every bottle of\nPerrier-Jouet reflects what is known as the house style.\nOnly after the blend is finished do the bubbles come.\nA second fermentation is induced by the addition of new yeast and\n24 grams of sugar to each bottle.\nThe yeast again consumes the sugar, but unlike in the\nfrothing oak barrels of old, the resulting CO2 remains trapped\ninside the wine. For three years, the dying\nyeasts will continue to impart flavors to the wine.\nDuring the final year, the bottles will be turned and\nelevated eight times a day, in a process known as riddling.\nRiddling encourages the dead yeasts to settle into the neck\nof the bottle. Although not harmful if\nconsumed, the yeast simply isn't very pretty, and so it's\nremoved, in a process known as disgorgement.\nIn traditional disgorgement, a single blow of the winemaker's\ntool causes the cap on the bottle to explode, catapulting\nthe yeast out. To maintain the distinct\nqualities of this remarkable wine, strict laws assert that\nonly those wines grown and made in the Champagne region can bear\nthe name \"Champagne\" on their label.\nAnnual production is also limited, ensuring quality, while\nalso guaranteeing that labels such as Perrier-Jouet will be\nin constant demand. But that hasn't stopped French\nwinemakers from reaching out to other parts of the world, where\ntechnologies now bring new meaning to old methods.\nConsider the advanced automation at Mumm Napa, producers of one\nof America's most popular sparkling wines.\nHere bottles of sparkling wine are filled at a rate of a 120\nbottles per minute. Sophisticated computer programs\noversee state-of-the-art riddling machines that move\nlarge containers of the sparkling wine a fraction of a\nturn at a time. Only six to eight days later,\nthe neck of the bottle is frozen, capturing the yeast in\nplace. When the bottle is mechanically\nopened, the frozen yeast pops out in the form of an ice plug--\none of many remarkable solutions to age-old problems.\n>> NARRATOR: But France isn't the only land steeped in\ntradition, nor where the past and future combine to make a\nworld-class wine. \"Wine\" will return, on Modern\nMarvels. >> NARRATOR: We now return to\n\"Wine,\" on Modern Marvels. They're called \"stairways to\nheaven,\" centuries-old vineyards carved into the steep hillsides\nand rugged canyons of Portugal's Douro Valley.\nRising as high as a thousand meters above the river below,\nthese terraces were built from the very rock and schist that\nmade the Douro one of the most uncompromising landscapes in all\nof Europe. Yet here, in this once remote,\ndefiant place, nature and history have conspired to create\none of the world's most treasured wines: port.\n>> RUPERT SYMINGTON: Well, basically, port is a fortified,\nwhat we call a fortified red wine from this region of the\nDouro Valley of Portugal. The grapes have been crushed,\njust like for a normal table wine, but we've actually stopped\nthe fermentation halfway though, by adding what we call\nbrandy. by adding what we call It's like a 77%-alcohol-by-\nvolume grappa. And by adding brandy, you kill\nthe yeast off, so you end up with a wine having about half\nits natural sugar. So the wine is semi-sweet, with\na slightly higher alcoholic content than standard red wine.\n>> NARRATOR: No one knows who first added brandy to wine-- a\nprocess now called fortification-- but what is\nclear is that the impetus came not from an ancient winemaker's\ncellar but was born of geopolitics, empires and war.\n>> LAMAR: Port was actually invented by the British as much\nas, uh, the Portuguese. >> NARRATOR: Beginning in the\n17th century, perpetual conflict with France led British\nmerchants to seek out alternative sources of wine,\nespecially in Portugal. >> SYMINGTON: Some of the\noriginal port wines were actually wines sourced on the\ncoast of Portugal, and as the market developed, people's\ntastes got more sophisticated, and merchants started coming\nupriver, trying to find better wines.\nAnd the Douro Valley-- which is some 70 or 80 miles from where\nwe are-- to the coast, the wines from this region were considered\nfantastic. The trouble is, the whole trip,\nthe journey downriver, then would have to be shipped a\ncouple of days to England, and the wine, having come that much\nfurther, would spoil. So that's when they started\nadding brandy, and that's what, you know, helped preserve the\nwine and make it famous. >> NARRATOR: The additional\nbrandy ensured that wine shipments from the Douro made\nthe long journey to England. Continued unrest between Britain\nand France spurred demand for port, and led to the rapid\ntransformation of wine production in the Douro, well\ninto the 19th century. Winemakers, for example, began\nto define proper wine-to-brandy ratios... that not only made\nthe port more stable... but also created truly unique flavors and\ncharacter. Wines were no longer transported\nin resin-lined goatskins, but rather in large barrels, known\nas pipes, still the standard measure of port today.\nIn the spring, these pipes were loaded aboad small skiffs\nknown as \"rabelos\" for the dangerous journey from Douro to\nOporto, from where they were shipped to England and abroad.\nToday, a new revolution is underway, led by companies like\nthe Symington Family Estates, the world's leading port\nproducer. The Symington family can trace\ntheir roots in the industry back 13 generations, to the very\nfounding of the port trade in the 1600's.\nThey now oversea 24 \"quintas\" where famous ports like Dows,\nWarre and Grahams are born. >> SYMINGTON: We've got about\nthree million vines now, um, under our management and\nownership. >> NARRATOR: And while they're\nfully aware of port's rich heritage, their focus is very\nmuch on the future. >> SYMINGTON: This is the Quinta\nDos Malvedos Winery. Malvedos is a property that has\nbeen associated with the Graham port brand since 1890, and this,\nthese buildings were where the original port was made from the\nMalvedos estate. Traditionally, port was made by\nfoot-treading and a bunch of people, about 20 people, would\ninto a tank and literally stomp it by foot.\n>> NARRATOR: Foot-treading was first practiced by the\nancient Romans, who recognized that small, thick-skinned\ngrapes, like those grown in the Douro, needed to be crushed\nfirmly quickly, to initiate fermentation and extract the\noptimum flavor and color. Traditional presses simply did\nnot apply the same direct pressure as human feet, which\nground the grapes into the floor of the stone tank known as a\n\"lagar.\" In the 1960s, the Symingtons\ninstalled a auto-vinification system that uses pressure built\nup during fermentation to maximize extraction.\nBut for the finest ports, the system just couldn't match the\njuice tread by foot. And so the family made a\nlong-term commitment: to design and build a robotic lagar.\n>> SYMINGTON: It has four plates that slide over each other\nhydraulically. There are silicon toes on the\nend of the plates and those silicon toes will literally\ngrind the skins against the floor of the tank.\nThe feet themselves are temperature-controlled.\nThey're heated up to 37 degrees centigrade, the same as the\nhuman leg. So you've got a warming effect\nin the feet. They also can work all night, if\nthey have to, whereas the humans would only do it for two or\nthree hours in the late evening. >> NARRATOR: Once fermentation\nhas brought the wine to the desired sugar levels, the\nfermenting wine is drained into a storage vat where the neutral-\nflavored brandy is added. >> SYMINGTON: We add about one\npart of brandy at 77% alcohol by volume, to about four parts\nof must, which is at about 7% alcohol by volume, so if you do\nthe math, it works out a wine about 19-and-a-half, 20% alcohol\nfor the finished blend. >> NARRATOR: Once it is settled,\nthe wine will travel downriver, where it will be judged for\nflavor, clarity and other characteristics.\n>> SYMINGTON: Well, we'll take some of these lots and then\nwe'll put them on the bench and try and put them together in\nsuch a way to make something really great.\nOccasionally, you'll have one individual blend which is great,\nbut we believe, like, you know, two plus two can add up to five\nin our business. You can really put two things\ntogether and make something even better than the sum of the\nparts. >> NARRATOR: In general, port\ncan be divided into two fundamental styles: ruby port is\naged in oak, then bottled after three years and features a\nbright red color and general fruitfulness.\nConversely, tawny ports are aged in oak at least six years,\nduring which time their color and nature transform.\n>> SYMINGTON: The longer you leave it in barrel, the wine\ngoes from that purply red color and it fades into a lovely nutty\nkind of amber-brown color. >> NARRATOR: In rare years, when\nall the conditions are exactly right, port winemakers will\ndeclare a vintage year. These wines spend only two years\nin oak before bottling, where they will be left to mature for\ndecades. Vintages such as the 1970 and\n1955 Grahams are among the most cherished wines in the world,\nnot simply for their flavor, but also for the sense of history\nand place they evoke. And for some, those are\nqualities to be treasured above all else, especially in one of\nthe world's great cellars. \"Wine\" will return, on \"Modern\nMarvels,\" here on the History Channel.\n>> NARRATOR: We now return to \"Wine,\" on Modern Marvels.\nIt's perhaps the world's most famous restaurant: La\nTour d'Argent, located on the Right Bank of Paris in the\nshadow of Notre Dame. Founded in 1582, La Tour was a\nfavorite meeting place of King Henry III, who often stopped by\nafter hunting along the Seine. Legend holds that it was here\nthat he learned to eat with a fork.\nSince then, the restaurant has served the rich and powerful for\ncenturies. Not surprisingly, 30 feet below\nthe restaurant itself, is perhaps the world's finest wine\ncellar, one that dates back to the 1820s, when the restaurant\nwas rebuilt after being burned during the French Revolution.\n>> DAVID RIDGWAY: The oldest wine bottle is an 1845 now.\nUnfortunately, the 1811 comet year from Lafite got broken by\none of my cellar men. We had to get rid of him.\n>> NARRATOR: Currently, the cellar holds upwards of 450,000\nbottles, including all of the most prized vintages in French\nwine history. >> RIDGWAY: An 1868 Grelarose.\nGrelarose is a San Julien Cabernet-based wine, and that\nis, like, amazing to imagine that.\nStill... still with us. >> NARRATOR: The cellar's\ntemperature naturally ranges no higher or lower than 53 to 59\ndegrees, while the humidity stays fixed at an exacting 75%.\nIt's considered the most technically perfect cellar in\nthe City of Lights. Aging is one of wine's greatest\ntraditions. Yet, even today, no one knows\nexactly what happens to wine as it transforms over time.\nSome of have theorized the chemical elements within the\nwine, primarily the tannins, bond with other compounds.\nOthers suggest those same compounds are broken down.\nWhat's clear is that the aromas and flavors become more\nnumerous, layered and sophisticated.\n>> RIDGWAY: Two days ago, we had a bottle of vin Clos du\nChene 1885. And the nose was so pungent.\nYou're talking about a complexity, maybe 50-60\ndifferent aromas and they all come at you slowly and sit.\nIt's so... it's magical. >> NARRATOR: In fact, so prized\nare these complexities, that have been willing to\nrisk their lives for them, including the former owner of\nLa Tour d'Argent, the father of the current owner.\nIn 1940, Claude Terrail was a young French soldier stationed\nsouth of Paris when the Nazis began to march on the French\ncapital. >> RIDGWAY: Just before the\nGermans arrived, he flew into Paris and he, with one of the\nstaff members, one of the cellar men, bricked up about three-\nquarters of the cellar. They covered it with dust and\nmade it look as if it had been here for several centuries.\n>> NARRATOR: Today, only some bits of mortar remain where the\nfake wall once stood and baffled the Germans for more than five\nyears. But the full scope of the\ncourage shown by Monsieur Terrail can still be felt and\nseen and tasted in the rare wines within the collection--\nstill evolving, still a living history.\n>> RIDGWAY: The time and the effort that's been taken to keep\nit this long, um, the wars, the, the the strife, the famines that\nhave gone around it, and it's still here.\nIt's still here today. It's very moving.\n>> NARRATOR: While only a few cellars in the world can boast\nof 1845 vintages, private collectors are building their\nown cellars where wine, technology and personal\nhistories are joined. >> DAVID NIEDERAUER: I had seen\nan article in Wine Spectator about Paul Wyatt and it showed\nsome of his cellars maybe 15 years prior to that, and I'd\nalways had in mind, I said, \"You know, someday, I'm gonna have\nmyself a cellar by that guy.\" >> NARRATOR: For over 30 years,\nPaul Wyatt has been a pioneer in the creation and construction of\nprivate cellars. >> WYATT: There are two kinds of\ncellars: there are cellars that just store wine.\nThey're like shoeboxes. You want to keep shoes in a box,\nthat's fine. People do that.\nThere's lots of people that have them in cheap racks.\nAll the racks on the market work to hold wine, but this is more\nthan just a statement about the person whose cellar it is.\nIt's a statement about the wine collection.\n>> NARRATOR: This cellar is designed to highlight the\nowner's 4,500-bottle collection, including his rare collection of\nChateau d'Yquem, perhaps the most treasured white wine in the\nworld. >> NIEDERAUER: We collaborated\non the design of the cellar, and I wanted to have a place to\nshow the Chateau d'Yquem and the way that it changes color as\nit ages, so we designed this light box.\nIt has a low temperature in there and it's fine for the\nwine, and, at the same time, you can see the beautiful colors as\nthe colors change. >> NARRATOR: Temperature,\nlighting and security are all computer-controlled and no\ndetail has been overlooked. The entire rack system is made\nof redwood and stands more than nine feet tall and nearly\nfour feet deep. Most remarkable of all, it's\nfree-standing and self-supporting; nothing is\nfixed to a wall. >> WYATT: Also, we're deep in\nearthquake country and this whole system is not fixed to the\nroom. It's sitting on the floor and\nit's quite flexible. And it's going to move a lot in\nearthquakes. It's a very live system.\n>> NARRATOR: But even amid all the technology, the real star\nremains the wine itself. >> NIEDERAUER: A lot of people\nhave never heard of the labels that I have.\nUh, that makes it really fun, too, when it comes to\nsharing is that you have something that the other people\nhave never tasted. It is an obsession, a passion.\nI never could believe that I would be hooked so, so deeply on\none particular thing like a crazy little bottle of wine.\n>> NARRATOR: According to a recent study, 90% of all wine is\nconsumed within the first 24 hours of purchase.\nTruth be told, less than five percent of the world's wines are\ndesigned to age more than five years.\nThe rest are meant to be enjoyed much sooner.\nSo, drink up.

ready with me it is gonna be the look that I did in my last video a few of you asked if I could do that look so luckily I remember everything and I'm gonna film that today so I already started and I put on my moisturizer and then afterwards I put on glossy a future due and then I put on the laura geller hydrating moisturizer primer and then next I went in with my foundation it is the l'oreal infallible long we're shaping stick and i really like this foundation stick it i've been using it for a long time i'm actually almost done sadly so i'm just gonna put this food over my face it's really funny before i started filming i felt kind of insecure just because i haven't been barefaced in front of a camera in a long time so I don't know I just felt insecure and I was like okay maybe if I put some hoop earrings like this needs hoop earrings and I'll feel better and I immediately felt better after putting hoop earrings in and I'm gonna blend that in with the Ecotools complexion buffer and I always bring my foundation up into my eyelids just to even out the skin color there cuz I usually have either red eyelids or like eczema eyelids so I just like to cover them up I'm also gonna put some lip balm on this is the berry balm calm by glossier I freaking love this stuff it's so good I was not expecting to like the smell of this just because I thought maybe you would smell too artificial or something but I actually love the scent it smells like gummy bears and or like fruit snacks and I like the little tint that it adds to your lips as well it's very slight but it's cute and then after I went in with my foundation I went into the flower beauty light illusion full coverage concealer this concealer is a slightly dark I feel like for my under eyes so I layered it up with the superstay better skin concealer by Maybelline this one is a tad lighter than the flower Beauty one so I feel like it gives me more of a highlighting effect I guess under the eyes and then I'm blending that in with an it cosmetics airbrush blurring concealer brush [Music] okay and then next I went in with two new products that I have I have the new terracotta tan bronzer by nude sticks and I use this to bronze the face and I blended it with this expert face brush by Real Techniques I feel like you get a little bit better payoff color payoff when you use a denser brush and kind of just stamp it into the skin and then I actually took a second bronzer this is the wet and wild color icon bronzer in Sunset Strip tease [Music] and I'm using the real techniques single multitask brush and then I went in with the poppy girl Newt sticks nudies bloomin blush this is like a red toned pink and I pop that on the apples of my cheeks and with that I used the sheer blush brush by Ecotools and just stippled that into my cheek I feel like this color is a very natural blushed color for me and I think it suits my skin tone really well and I always drag my blush across my face like this and kind of into my bronzer just so it melts pretty well and then I took the nudies glow all of her face highlight and Babli Beibei by nude sticks and I take this on my finger like this when I have foundation on usually because I don't want to pick anything up underneath I'll just tap it on top and then I get my brows and I've been trying to use up this Mac eye brows styler pencil I've had this for a little while now actually got it from the thrift store and okay that sounds gross but hear me out so they are a thrift store that's like above the mole on like the top floor of the mall and they sometimes will receive like overstock or things that didn't get sold at Mac so they were brand new they were just significantly cheaper so that's what we mean by the thrift store okay although actual therse stores do sell makeup that's used and I would not recommend ladies and gentlemen but I've been using this to fill in [Music] not Versailles and it's nice but I don't love it it's like not the right color or something or I don't like the consistency I don't know what it is about it I just don't love [Music] okay and then I went in with the new Patrick top ow soap for your brows clear brow wax and she dirty and I was so excited to get this until I had to open it this packaging I it's like a freakin puzzle I couldn't figure out how to open this for the longest time and I have stubby little nails because I have really bad eczema as some of you may know and I have to keep my nails super short so I can't like do anything like peel things off or pick at things or like anything with my nails so this was so freaking hard to open they're like there's this little space and you got up like that open it I personally think that small portion of the packaging is my arch-nemesis and I hate it but other than that it's very beautiful and functional other than this is a little thing blocking the opening but it's fine I can ignore it so I tried to follow the directions that Patrick recommended for these and he said to take any setting spray so I took this crystal amber color pop setting spray and I actually don't like using this as an actual setting spray so I was like this is perfect for this and I spray it in here [Music] and then I put my spoolie in and I think I put too much last time and I also think I just put too much but then I put it through my brows yeah so I put way too much this time as well I'm thinking maybe I should have I should have learned this from last time but I should have filled my brows in after I did this black stuff because it's getting like it up here but this is some heavy-duty and then you press them down I think that's what you do but look at them [Music] you guys I'm so sorry I forgot to have a zoo me win we'll do that now hello my friends I remember struggling using this for the first time and again I'm struggling now just because I I just like haven't figured it out yet but I'm just gonna wait okay yeah I'm gonna wait a couple of minutes and let that dry and then I'll move on to my eyes for now so I use the nude mood palette so gorgeous right up my alley with colors I'm honestly not gonna I shadow at all like I feel like I'm okay at face makeup but I shadow I like never do it so I don't really know how to do it so I usually just pop one color all over the lid and then put a shimmery shadow and then move on with my life I took the color own natural this one here and I got it on a fluffy brush and I just literally put this all over my lid I creased so bad in my lids but I usually just blend it out when I blend out my eye color and I remember not doing a lot of this so I think that's all I might have done so I think my camera stopped recording but I just put the own a chiral color on my bottom lash line as well and then I took this really pretty sparkly color here I'm always awkward what I hope um this wink-wink color and I placed that as you can see just like kind of all over my lid and then that's what I did with my eyes I not that intricate or anything and I was just looking at my other video for a second and I think that maybe I bronzed up a little more in this one that I did it in the last one I think I'm it have been a bit lighter handed there but let's work on these bristles so I have this little like flat brush and usually when I do my brows and I kind of go overboard up here I'll just take it and like swipe it across I don't even have product on it I just swipe it like that and I feel like it helps clean it up a little bit and I do remember when I did this last time my brows didn't like completely dry and I feel like you can kind of tell maybe not on camera but it's like a little bit gray it looks a little gray my pin opinion at least in person so last time I took a tinted brow gel this is the glossy a boy brow in brown and I just went over it like this to try and get that color not to be as like gray I guess so if you get this and you have darker hair like I do I would recommend the tinted one because I end up having to do that brow gel on top of it anyway and this is a ELF flat eyeliner brush if any of you were wondering but I feel like my brows look really good like they look very feathery and spaced out if that makes sense um yeah so I'm happy with my brows and then I powdered so I use the RCM a no color powder and this is the Ecotools gleaming highlighter brush and I just powder in my t-zone when I do powder because I like to keep all of this Sheen if you will on the outside of my face and then I just tap in the powder gently in the center of my face and I feel like we've pores well I have really bad scarring from acne so it looks like large pores which I think there are large pores there but sometimes I can't tell the difference between my large pores and my acne scars so I feel like it looks a little textured here but that's my skin and I can't do anything about that so it is what it is it is what it is and then I take a little highlighter and I never forget the nose so I just do a little tap tap tap and there's a center so I'm just gonna curl my eyelashes I just feel so creepy when I curl my lashes cuz I get like a so damn close to my eyeball probably not the most sanitary but I need the curly on and I curl my lashes with the Maybelline falsies volume express mascara this is my all-time favorite mascara I think it does a really good job with my really straight lashes that do not hold a curl whatsoever but with this mascara it does keep them up and it keeps them up all day which is really really appreciated being that I hate when my lashes are so like when they're really fly hate that and I really love the brush on this I feel like it does a really good job at separating my lashes and also like lifting them so I can really get to the root of and place that mascara at the roof so those are my lashes and there are two more steps to this look that I did I took the la dia freckle tint and I added some faux Frisch's so I just placed them I don't know where ever I saw fit and with this product I do like to let it sit there for a little while before I go in and tap it because I feel like it adds a little bit more color and doesn't fade as much when I allow it to sit there and kind of settle so I probably waited a little bit too long for that on these ones here on my nose so they're kind of showing up a little dark but what you can do is just take your foundation brush and kind of tap it on top and then it won't make them look as dark I guess but I don't like adding too many I just like adding well I guess that's kind of a lot but I like adding just a handful of them I think it looks really nice and cute my little sister and my older sister both have and get freckles like in the summer time and I got left out so rude they're also really tall and I I'm not so rude also neither of them have eczema like I'm not tall I don't have freckles and I do have eczema pardon deep breaths so the last thing that I did let's put some lipgloss on this is the Bobbie Brown lip gloss in forever chill and I love this lip gloss so and watch so this is the final look I feel like it's pretty natural but then you have a little bit of pizzazz in the eyeball area I hope you enjoy if you have any questions about the products or anything like that please let me know please let me know down below and I will get back to you I love chit-chattin in the comments it's like my favorite thing ever I love being able to talk about makeup with all of you it's so fun but yeah this is the final look I hope you enjoyed I hope you are having a good day or evening and I'll catch you in the next one bye", "RljnDLOJwd8": "hey everybody it's irene lyon here welcome to today's special topics lecture titled anger as medicine and i am uh thrilled to talk about this topic and this is being recorded on a facebook live so if you're watching this live hello uh there's a comment board so tell me uh where you are and of course um just just say hello um have you been here before are you a student are you a 21 day member spsm member let me know if you're on youtube thank you for pressing play after this video goes live sometimes it's a little tougher to get back into these things that are live after the fact i see 17 nervous systems looking at me and i'm just going to make sure so make sure all systems are running here it looks like they are and i can see a comment from janet hello from british columbia canada um and i've got notes today so notes on anger as medicine this is not a new topic for me i wrote an article on this quite a few years ago maybe over four years ago and since then i talk about this a lot i teach this in my programs it is a topic that i have studied through my my studies with dr peter levine and kathy kane and also some of the just colleagues that i am around and with um so i will no doubt reference other resources but i wanted to kind of do uh an everything today anger is medicine everything and i'm seeing more people hop on and uh it's good to see people hello katie from sweden uh terry from florida jackie from pacifica miyoki from holland let's see here another spsm sandra hello so some of you this will be old information for some of you this might be brand new so if you're brand new to me again i'm irene lyon i am a nervous system expert neuroplasticity expert i am trained in the fields of somatic experiencing somatic practice feldenkrais i have a master's in biomedical science and exercise science this has been my my work um for nearly 22 years working with the human system whether through performance through healing through health through rehabilitation healing trauma um all sorts of things so i have got some post-it notes here and uh there's our topic anger as medicine so the first thing i'm gonna do is very um specific just so that i stay on track and we have specific um kind of chapters to this and um oh another fun thing i will share um some of you already know this but i'm in the midst of starting to create and write a book a book outline a book proposal i'm also in the midst of creating a teacher training so these things interest you just wanted to give you a little note that those are happening and this is a topic that will no doubt be an entire chapter and an entire semester within our teacher training when it comes up because it's so important so the first thing is i'm just going to define anger from a real basic sense and anger is an essential emotion you could even say that out loud with me anger is an essential human emotion it's an essential animal emotion mammalian emotion um sometimes it's it's good to imagine animals in the wild think about what it would be like if an animal let's say a mother bear this is like my favorite example if her cubs were at risk from a predator do you think that she would ask herself the question internally or ask her friend you know on the the passion or you know on the field while they're grazing and foraging for berries hey do you think i should get angry at this um coyote that's trying to take my my cups i don't know if a coyote would do that but something trying to prey on our cups just curious would she question that when she feels a threat i'm gonna let that sink in hopefully you know the answer um i know there's some people watching me so feel free to put a comment in the comments i'm just going to pause here uncomfortably and wait until someone tells me what would that mama bear do will she pause and wonder if she should get angry and attack and fight what do you think or would she go into action what would it be what do you think and i know there's a delay on this video so um i'm gonna wait a little bit longer and the other thing is i wait for that answer it's like a pop quiz be sure as you're listening to this lecture while it's cerebral i have a sneaky way of getting this information into your physiology and into your cells so take care of yourselves i've got my water and some tea and even some coffee here um just because i like to keep my throat wet for so for yourself you know if you need to get up if you need to move if you need to pause if you're sensing even a little bit of extra stimulation and activation don't push through this because if this is new information for you if this is stuff that really hits close to home you don't want to override anything and just you know stomach it and power through to get all the information this is being recorded you can watch it after the fact so i see some some answers coming in here so we have got this is to the question what would a mother bear do if her baby cubs and they're so cute so of course she's going to want to protect them she'd attack without hesitation immediate action action she must do she must rage instant protection there'd be no pause automatically react action of course and so we kind of just know this naturally especially those who are parents or who who are carers of other um living creatures right we are going to protect because it is our survival mechanisms our physiology it's not just the brain it's the entire something called the autonomic nervous system i've talked a lot about that um that's pretty much everything i talk about but differing viewpoints and bandages she's going to go into full fight and with no shame no apologies no questioning it is an animal impulse instinct and so anger is a natural essential mammalian animal human emotion along with joy and sadness and disgust and surprise we need these and they're part of us and i've talked in the past about emotions being neutral by design doesn't mean that they don't have big energy but our biology and i'm setting this up for future uh post-it note notes that i have here that will remind me of what i want to talk about today these emotions are there because our biology built them in they're in our dna they're in our sensations and if we don't get them out when the rising bubbling internal pieces come up um we hide them inside and that's what makes us sick and i'm going to read uh some passages from a book in a second so anger essential it's basic right so survival stress it gets stored now here's what's interesting we as human beings are we're like world-class olympic athletes when it comes to holding this stuff inside and it's nobody's fault and it's everyone's fault i've said this before our culture our our conditioning our school system are ways in which we have thought that this is how you have to raise a human this is how we you know be good don't get mad um and there's so many side notes to that that i won't get into it but we have kind of cultura culturized that's a word and conditioned our young to uh sometimes not let out these emotions and i'm gonna give an example of how we start to hold these things in um and i've done another video about this but i'm going to give just a little snippet it's on the origins of healthy aggression and we will post all these links up as well and so when we are born when little baby comes out of mama and they are small and you know vulnerable there's a lot going on there a lot of people say oh there's nothing going on there they're just a lump of cells and they're not fun until you can play with them the amount of times i've heard parents say that is insane but that little infant is a powerhouse of nervous system wires just firing and imagine you've never seen light you've never smelled you've never heard sound cleanly you've never felt touch so much nuance and so much richness that that little infant is experiencing and then of course the communication with caregivers people etc there comes a point when that little newborn starts to feel their power right his power her power and they start to test it they start to get more strength within their their muscles within their nervous system their somatic motor sensory nervous system and one of the ways that babies start to show this and you know everyone's a little different and of course it's how that little one has been nurtured environment is so key but they'll start to do things um when especially when they're not with mom nursing they'll start to pound they'll start to scratch they'll start to pull her hair they'll start to hit and and it's not because the little one is trying to be an part of my language but it's true they're doing it because their fight impulses the chemicals that that are responsible for what we call healthy aggression and pushing forward in life and saying i am here this is me this is my life for his energy it is starting to come on right and there are a few things that happen sometimes one that little one is met with that with a mother or a character it doesn't have to be a mother it could be a grandma a nanny but they're met with equal energy not fighting back but an energy of oh my goodness look at that strong hand and then the little the little one is played with you start to tug on the fingers and you start to feel oh yeah you know what's that like to feel that power right a little baby isn't going to harm a parent that's older it's just not possible you might get a little scratch because the nails are long but we want to foster that so there might be a scenario where that is being fostered that is helping that new fresh human nervous system being experience their power and get that stuff out sadly what often occurs and this again this goes back to how we've been conditioned and cultured it's seen as bad it's seen as this little and i'll never forget peter levine saying this in one of our lectures with him the mother thinks that their their precious little lovely child is a monster that that little one is trying to hurt her and if she has not worked on her own early traumas and traumas of boundaries and acceptance and her own life force energy she will not know what to do with that big energy because she herself doesn't have that big life force energy so what does she do she shuts it down by either kidding them back punishing and punishing them by putting them down i can't take this this is too much for me how dare you do that and so that my friends is the start of this healthy sympathetic fight life force energy being squashed and we don't want that and so this is when they're infants right and this is where you know and i'm not going to get into childhood development right now in relationship to the nervous system but when we don't get that at the outset it kind of sets up this cascade of that caregiver not knowing how to attune and connect to the little one true story i gotta tell the story one of my girlfriends um has a child he's older now but when he was an infant he started to scratch and hit and and do these aggressive things she's like irene what do i do with that i said well what do you what do you think and she said well i googled it and google said that if if my infant hits me hit him back and i was like what no and i think what's unfortunate is that a lot of people are going to see those things and just be like oh well google must have said it then this is this must be true right we know that's not the case um and so i said well when you do that and i explained her what i just explained to you that's their energy coming up wanting to meet you and say hey mom i am strong look at me and look at how how amazing i am and here you are and i want to share this energy with you imagine as an adult if one of your best friends or your husband or your spouse said to you i've got this exciting news i want to show you this new dance move or i want to show you something it doesn't matter what it what is and you say ah no that sucks stop it stop it go into the room shut the door i don't want to see it that is the kind of message that's coming through to that little one so what this mother did and i said when he does that take his fists in a gentle but firmware and play play drums on your chest be playful with that energy the way a mother in the wild a mama bear will rough and tumble with her kids with her cubs and so my friend did this played with him when that energy was there guess what happened they never did it again they never punched they never scratched scratched again that doesn't mean that her her actions suppress that energy it got matched the wires got built and then he moved on right and so that is one little example of um emotion the emotion anger why it's so important for us to understand it and healthy aggression they're of the same in the same spectrum the word aggression comes from the latin agree which means to push forward to move forward it isn't just about attacking and i will get into attacking and what that means soon so wanted to give you that little vignette of what healthy aggression is we have another video that my assistant crystal has just popped up if you're on the facebook live if you're on youtube it'll be in the show more section i'm going to grab some water hello everyone from coming on i see a lot of familiar names a lot of students from 21 days and sbsm um great to see everyone okay so next thing how does anger get stored right and how can it turn into disease so i'm going to read a portion from when the body says no gabor mate this is like a bible in terms of how stress held emotions not being who we are not expressing our life force energy how that can if we're not working on it actively to get that stuff out how it makes us sick and by sick i mean chronic illness cancer heart disease autoimmune all the autoimmune pieces rheumatoid ms als we know and he doesn't get so much into it in this book but other books such as bessel vander cult's book when the body keeps the score another book of his on addiction etc when we are not able to access all of the human emotions what our biology has gifted us in our dna when we suppress and stunt them and only reserve certain things for certain times that makes us sick and so this is from a chapter at the end of the book and i've quoted this many times on many quotes and instagram posts and in my articles but it's so good i got to read it so this is uh the chapter called the seven days of healing and this is the third a is anger and so he he says he's quoting the a movie where woody allen says i never get angry or maybe it's just what woody allen said i never get angry a woody allen character says in one of his movies so it was a movie i never get angry i grow a tumor instead and then he says throughout this book we have seen the truth of that dark troll remark droll remark in numerous studies of cancer patients cancer is a huge thing right now the the last i heard at least here in canada the the numbers are going up staggeringly children are getting cancers left right and center and it's just not right in my opinion and of course there's environmental pieces there's our diet there's our our food supply our relationships but a lot of it when you get into this research is about emotional repression so he says we have also seen that the repression of anger is a major risk factor for disease because it increases physiological stress on the organism so the repression of anger keeping it inside that puts stress on the organism right there's this thought that anger expressing anger puts stress but there's a distinction in here that i'm going to unpack today so not only does the repression of anger predispose to disease but the experience of anger has been shown to promote healing i'm going to say that one more time but the experience not the expression so much but the experience of anger has been shown to promote healing or at least to prolong survival people with cancer who have been able to muster anger at their physicians for example have lived longer than their placid counterparts i'm going to read that one more time because it's so powerful people with cancer and we can insert chronic illness also to that who have been able to muster anger at their physicians for example have lived longer than their more placid counterparts in animal experiments the expression of anger has been found to be less physiological stressful than the suppression of it in rats who fight others when caged together so rats who fight others when caged together cage together they slow the growth of tumors and they then the more docile rats so the rats that are being like that bear who's fighting their their you know fighting to protect the cubs those rats are are not getting as sick right they're they're they're staving away the cancer growth all that research is in this book if you want to dig it up get the book it's a great book so what this is saying is that this concept that we've kind of been raised with to not be angry to button it up the stiff british upper lip which has you know transferred to so many places throughout the entire world even though it originated you know with that high level of aristocracy it's making us sick and we need to stop this we need to learn the importance of these emotions and not explode and go around killing everyone which sadly is kind of what we've seen happen in our human society and harming others and destroying our world and all these things i know it's really morbid isn't it um we've kind of gone to the other end of this we've got this stored anger inside and rather than working with it in a way that is healing we express it and act it out in a way that is harmful right so instead of working with it in a way that is healing we express it in a way that is harmful not only to us but to others now the reason why i think i'm just making sure i'm on track with my notes so again that was gabor mate's book when the body says no i'm going to read one more thing and then we'll move on the reason why i think it's so tricky to work with is because we've been brainwashed by so from so little so again that example of that baby who is not cognitively online yet you have to understand when that little infant starts to feel that healthy aggression the burgeoning of that emotion anger they're not questioning it it's just full you know fifth gear let it out and then it gets stopped right and so it starts to come out we need to be able to honor it now of course the question might be well irene how do i work with that when i know that that's probably what happened or maybe i don't even know that that happened um but i'm pretty sure it happened and it comes down to first of all learning this education which you're doing right now um and then starting to really learn how to listen to all emotions not just anger so if we suppress tears if we suppress joy if we don't allow ourselves to feel grossed out or disgusted at things disgust is another primal emotion mammalian emotion when we stop any of the emotions when we stop ourselves from being who we truly are it's hard to get that anger out and often you'll see these workshops and these very cathartic you know weekend intensives where it's like come get your anger out and you're given a bat and you're given a pillow and you have to hit or you're you go into some kind of boxing situation and you're just getting all that frustration out the trouble with that is that if we just go in to the heading if we go into the screaming but we don't do it organically and with context the system isn't going to know how to process it so the goal is to eventually get to this point where we're so tuned to our biology and our body and we build its capacity to feel safe to feel feel connected to feel supported then when we get those pieces on board these anger healthy aggression emotions and all the other emotions they start to visit and bubble up naturally on their own and then when they do come up because we've done the prep work and the groundwork there isn't this confusion or fear most people that i work with they stay away from working with anger and expressing it because they're afraid that they're going to kill someone or hurt themselves or cause more damage and that's possible it's possible that if we don't do this in a titrated it's a very somatic experiencing term in a step-by-step slow way that is what might occur and so i'll get to that in a little bit the other reason why i think it's so tricky and confusing is that we just haven't seen it used for the most part successfully in society and we see it in ways that are harmful or we see it in ways that actually harm some people meaning we get a person might get walked all over you know not usually literally but emotionally because they don't know how to set boundaries they don't know how to say no and if we think about um abuse and people being attacked and harmed there's an interesting play in there and so i'm going to speak to that real quickly right now someone is being harmed say physically attacked and they know that they are not going to be able to fight because the person is too skilled is too big this is very common with children who are being either physically or sexually attacked and abused by people bigger than them their physiology knows i can't fight this and i can't get out so i'm going to shut down right this is kind of like nervous system basics 101 we have fight we have flight we have freeze if we can't flee first of all if we can't connect and engage and de-escalate the situation which usually with little ones it's pretty hard because the big person is trying to overpower the little person if we can't fight if we can't flee we will shut down however in that shutdown what is under that shutdown is all the fight and fight and flight survival stress it gets stored in the physiology and that gets stored in our tissues and we keep it there forever unless we actively work with it this is a very important part because a lot of times there's this misunderstanding is like oh i feel fine yeah i feel great yeah everything's great i'm kind of acting right now oh yeah i'm totally i'm really calm yep just this like but it's this it's a frozen calm we call this functional freeze i did another video about that very important video to follow up with this one so be sure to watch that afterwards if you haven't already or review it if you already have so under that i'm great i'm calm i'm really okay you can tell you can almost see the tension in a person's face in the bracing of their body you can even see this in body types in terms of armoring barreled chest right this we see this in a lot of men and women these chests and shoulders that are like literal armor right they might as well just be wearing a suit of armor because their muscles and their structure is so armored there's no flow and usually it's there for good reason because they've had to protect all the crappy stuff that they have seen and witnessed and not known how to stomach and not know how to fight and flee and so it's trapped inside this goes back to what matte talked about in this book in regards to how basically when we have this it's not just chronic stress it's survival stress right right now as i'm talking to you there's a little bit of stress in my system i'm i'm looking at my notes i'm making sure this is still going i see there's 104 people that's a lot of people so this is stressful for me but it's not dysregulating hope that makes sense there's a little bit of stress if i was so calm you wouldn't hang around because i'd be absolutely boring to listen to you know it just would be monotone so the person the people the way society is when we've had all these hurts and harms and it doesn't have to be just big physical abuse and sexual abuse and that kind of thing it can be micro traumas of you know hearing mom and dad fight every night at the dinner table maybe they're not directing it to us but they hate each other and they're not splitting up because that's not what you do but that energy that little one inside their blood is boiling wanting to leave wanting to scream at them say stop it get divorced what are you doing you're hurting me but they won't do it because a child has to save face they have to stay protected and they have to stay in that environment and here's the thing so we might go go through life and not realize all the times we held in what we wanted to say we wanted to cry we wanted to scream we wanted to say stop stomp our feet and and yet we didn't and so that's a little snippet into how fight and flight can get wrapped under and under that freeze response and usually within those fight flights because think fight anger there's the emotion anger and so part of us part of the tricky nature with this is everybody wants a quick fix hopefully if you're here watching you're starting to understand while this work isn't a quick fix it actually does work and so when we work at these biological physiological levels learning how to be with our physiology we start to build a different base we start to connect to these emotions not so much even from an emotional point of view through what's going on in the limbic system but how we feel it in our body right that gut sense those butterflies in our stomach the tightness in our throat that tells us we're holding back our words the blood boiling in our hands it just wants to say stop all these things are important medicine so again this idea of anger is medicine when we can learn to work with these things and understand what they are and why they're stuck it starts to become medicinal so i'm just going to look at the comments here and then i'm going to go into a little bit more and another example a story about just to make a contextual shift as to why again it's kind of this elusive topic um hey everyone hi hi hey kaley you say i feel triggered about the cancer thing as i have family members and i would never want them to blame themselves for the repressed anger i guess i feel angry about it laugh out loud you say because it's sometimes just bad freaking luck well here's here's what we really know at least from what i've learned when you start to get into the research you start to really watch and study people like gabor mate's work and he worked in palliative care he was the head of palliative care at vancouver general general hospital for a long time usually i'm going to be really bold here you guys so don't hate me unless it's like nuclear fallout or a person is living think of remember the movie erin brockovich where people were getting sick because their water supply was chemically ridden with just waste so there are certain pieces certain cancers which just doesn't make sense or there is a real environmental risk that is putting a cascade into the system but many and most of the ones we're seeing are a result of the person not taking care of themselves it's just the way it's been and i believe that we can really shift that i really believe that we can shift how people take care of themselves because we are forming these cells these bad cells in our bodies all the time right we're being bombarded by it but a human system that has balance and and good flow and good circulation and elimination and assimilation and all the things that make a healthy human just good flow in all the systems the immune system and all the systems will take care of those bad cells they will kill them through something called aptosis but when we don't have enough of that things start to shift it's just it's autoimmune right and so it does suck but it also we also know through a lot of the research um i can't stress it enough that we have more control over this than we think gabor mate has said i i love him so i quote him so much he has said and i've tried to find this this talk so if anybody knows where this talk is please let me know because his talks are all over the internet but he said something along the lines in the talk we don't need any more research when it comes to cancer and heart disease and autoimmune conditions like we do not need to research anymore because we actually know what's causing these things the a study the adverse childhood experiences study again i'm not going to get into all of that i did a soundcloud episode on that many years ago listen to that if you want to learn a bit more about the ace study without diving into all the scientific papers it has made a very strong connection between early adversity and early life stress and a whole list of ailments and diseases addiction you name it it's almost too depressing to look at that list and it can be very triggering for some when they see that list because no doubt you will know people who have many of those things you yourself might have them and so this is where we have to i believe become adults real mature responsible people for taking care of our system right just like we're supposed to take care of our environment outside we need to take care of our environment inside and sadly for the most part we haven't done a very good job at it it's why we have such a sick population right now so um elizabeth just wrote peter levine says if you don't deal with the trauma it will take 20 years off your life that's what happened to my sister yes human beings by default of just biological process we're supposed to live 120 to 140 years most animals in the kingdom animal kingdom they live 10 to 12 times longer than the age in which they can reproduce think about that we're the only human we're the only animal that dies before that mark and a lot of it has to do if not most of it to this society that we've created this culture of not really nurturing ourselves and taking care of ourselves so yes be sure to understand the a study this will test and push some buttons without a doubt because it's saying to us this is actually our responsibility it's not a fate that we are given a script even if we have a genetic marker the field of epigenetics has shown us that that does not mean that it will express it's the environment in which we live in that will facilitate the expression of that gene right so very very important to understand these connections i'm going to read one more thing i'm going to have a little sip of water here how is everyone doing jackie says i was very angry frustrated child yet was otherwise extremely shy and introverted this is helping me understand more of why yes the obvious traumas but also how things were handled in the 80s for kids yeah in the 80s for kids in the 70s and the 60s and the 50s you know you know i think when kids were you know my if i think of my parents generations in the 40s and 30s kids were left a little more alone to like you know deek it out and fight it out and play and just get into trouble in different ways and now they're there's this micromanaging that isn't allowing their true essence to come out some sometimes but a lot of the time a lot of this gets stifled and and pushed down um another person said yeah how does the baby boomers address these issues with the previous generation my mother is completely frozen yeah i would say that there's completely frozen and there's functional freeze and for the most part i have not met many individuals unless they've done a lot of this work doesn't matter what age who have a robust balanced flowing emotional physiological relationship with what is coming up and out from their bodies so one of the things is a little nugget of how to start you know if you're brand new here and this is like what you're crazy irene you're talking you're telling me that all these things like we have control over yes we do when we learn how to be with our physiology one of the more common things that um that i find is so interesting is people don't have a connection with their internal physiology specifically their digestion and specifically their excretion whether it's peeing you know urinating or defecating having a poop however you want to call it it doesn't matter um we need to start to listen to those basic physiological impulses this might seem really remedial and some of my students here might be able to back me up on this but one of the first things we learn and i really stress upon when i'm working in my programs is something called following your impulse specifically following your biological impulse because until we can listen to those internal signals it'll be hard to trust a big violent expression that isn't going to harm us or someone else in the face of this idea of anger so while this might seem like two opposing topics one way to start to build capacity is to listen to when you have to go to the bathroom and actually go start to feel the pressure in the bladder the pressure in the rectum if there's gas in your colon is there holding back is there a shame if there is a gas that comes up from the stomach to be you know burped out belched out is there a holding back is there a there is there a shame an excuse that oh i'm sorry that kind of thing again these are how we these are these these very simple things to start to let our biology move again and move in a way that brings more flow to the system and so while that might seem like a very strong uh exit from well i just want to get rid of my anger i just want to scream actually who here watched the karate kid remember daniel wanted to learn karate and what did mr miyagi do he had him paint the fence and wax on wax off and sand the deck and all these crazy things that had nothing to do with karate but it was building up capacity it was building up foundation so that when the actual fight came and the strikes and the blocks he had that strength and tone and memory in his muscles it's kind of exactly the same thing if we can't if we can't um comfortably let out a big belch and not you know he he laugh or feel ashamed or let a big bunch of gas out of our out of our rectum and anus i mean very descriptive but if we have trouble with that it's going to be very hard to get true organic anger the anger that if we hold inside makes us sick it's going to be hard to get that stuff out and so that's why um we stay and we stick with these basics for quite a few weeks um okay gonna get back to i want to read something another another little story time this is from a book i've got so many post-it notes on this um some of you know i've been talking a lot more about a man by the name of edgar casey he's long past he died in 1945 i think he was kind of the the father of holistic medicine um lived in the united states and this is a little excerpt from his talks and this is one on anger so another example is casey's repeated admonition of just how important it is to be able to get angry anger is an emotion directly related to saying no of course he isn't saying we need to run around blowing our stacks every day but he did emphasize the need to express anger the right way he then says be angry but sin not he was a very religious man so sounds kind of like bible talk but be angry but sin not that basically means be angry but do not harm others do not harm yourself do not harm the stuff around you for that he for he that it's hard to read this kind of prose i'll say i'll start again be angry but sin not for he that never is angry is worth little that's pretty powerful for he that is never angry is worth little but then this is the author speaking but then casey adds how important it is to have a container for that anger he then goes on to say this is casey now but he that is angry and controlleth it not is worthless so in other words if our angry is being violent if it's being abusive if it's harming others then we're missing the point note here that control does not mean suppression but proper direction it is a crucial distinction we could write a whole book just on that that that small paragraph and remember how i was saying at the beginning healthy aggression the word aggression the root is agri which is latin which is to move forward to push through we need to direct the anger out the aggression out but in a way that is contained isn't violent and actually goes out in somewhere so we're gonna get into that um okay so wanted to read that again that was edgar casey he's long past he was the father of holistic medicine really really recommend looking him up if you want a fun um historical account of someone who is brilliant brilliant at his work um so i'm going to get into a few more things here i'm just going to come back to the comments just to see how we're doing here maureen says the impact of war on humans probably has been at the root of difficulties in taking care of ourselves yes oh hey elizabeth elizabeth is one of our sbsm students she said i came off thyroid medication with this work this year throughout working working on irene's program so yes it's important to understand again i wish i could tell you everything i know in one hour but i can't so if this is the first time you're here please stick around go through my videos watch things read things uh watch some more of these q and a's at the beginning of this work it's one of the toughest things to understand is that at the root of so much of our health if not all of it also our relational health we connect with the environment how we connect with everything even our soul and spirit if you believe in that it's rooted in these survival responses so if we are in survival stress and if we are holding in these old fight flight patterns with our with our very crafty freeze response our system is in not a good place i i i was thinking the other day i'm calling this con immunity you know there's pros and cons con immunity we're constantly in survival stress con immunity whereas pro immunity is something i heard the other day from a brilliant doctor named zach bush look him up if you haven't crystal can pop his website up there pro-immunity is being proactive in our healing pro-immunity proactive pro-healing pro-for ourselves right and the thing with human beings is we tend to wait until things are a disaster until something is is making us not be able to do what we need to do and then we might if we're lucky look at something um so very very important to understand the connections of the autonomic nervous system with the entire system i want to talk about the human system so this is another post-it note i had i want to bridge the gap between our mammalian cortex here or sorry our human cortex and our mammalian body so this goes back to the first example i gave you about the bear right and i know some people have have gotten on since we've started um so you'll have to go back to the beginning but again imagine that mama bear predator is trying to get her cubs no no thinking no you know worry she's just gonna act and she's just gonna she's gonna defend she's gonna hit she's gonna growl she's gonna swat et cetera that is biology right and we have that in our bodies and then this human person that we have this human system we've got this higher brain this prefrontal cortex which makes us so so complex and unique and it separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom it's why we have this technology here in the way we do right the bears didn't create these computers and planes and and and boats and everything it was us so that shows you the level of complexity we're working with when it comes to keeping our biology well we're working across purposes because this higher brain doesn't want to not be in a situation that isn't good it is going to protect us from things that aren't normal so for example if our culture has taught us anger bad or anger is only for boys sadness is only for girls it's like a common theme we used to hear we will imprint that in our higher brain and then it will influence our physiology so we're working with not just our physiology but all of the meaning and all of the historical artifact that we've stored in memory in cognitive memory that says we shouldn't do that or we should do this etc and so we're working we're working with these two systems and so this is why education is important to understand yes we want the emotion anger and listening to our physiology so that we can honor what it is and what it what it needs and what it wants i always am talking about the importance of building capacity and titrating so um if you have a few questions at all on building this let me know but i'll do a quick sweep so if we know if you know that there has been stored anger within your system i'm going to make a very wide generalizing guess that everybody here depending on where we're at either used to have a lot of anger in their system or there's a lot in there and we just don't know how to get it out so somewhere along the spectrum we want to start to again as i said education understanding what this is so you're doing that here with me today the second thing is to start to listen to these biological impulses to start to really tune in to all of these basic elements of our body and i mentioned going to the bathroom but also when you're hungry when you're full when you're thirsty even working with those basic pieces will build your capacity to be with all the other elements the emotional elements so be very cauti cautious be very interested and connected to hunger cues cues of fullness because that is being driven also by parts of our nervous system thirst fatigue um impulses of i think i'm going to walk down this street today i don't know why i always walk to the grocery store that way but something's telling me to just go this other way go with that impulse same if you're driving listen to the impulses being able to listen to those impulses and act with them granted of course that there's they're safe to do so it starts to build that capacity that muscle to listen to our biology another key one and i i teach this in my drop-in classes i've got one coming up on saturday also my programs and i've got some articles and videos on the importance of orienting so crystal can pop up one of those again on the comments or youtube in the show more section when we are living in a lot of survival stress if we were that kiddo that had a very scary environment bad things happen to us we're going to disconnect from our or orientation to the world one of the key pieces to rebuild capacity and rebuild back the ability to have these emotions like anger come up and out is to reorient to the here and now and really know where we are see where we are and connect with our body in to that space if we don't do these pieces at the beginning what happens is if we have an anger piece come out and i'm going to use one example so definitely somewhere in history a parent has screamed at their child a parent has hit their child right we know this is true i've seen it happen myself at the end of the day i i think we can vouch no one wants to hurt their their their children they don't but there is a survival element coming up where that adult loses focus on the here and now they come out of their social engagement brain they go into their autonomic nervous system fight brain and before they know it they're smacking their kid they're smacking their smouth spouse they're smacking their dog they're yelling at the child whatever whatever whatever they're going into this behavior without even realizing it's happening so part of us working with this explosive violent expression of anger is to learn how to be connected to the here and out and pause one could say this is why mindfulness is important in meditation but the problem with that just classic mindfulness meditation practice is if there's a lot of that survival energy inside and the body the brain doesn't know how to deal with it you might go into that practice and it's going to feel terrible so this is why some of these basic practices again listening to the biology being able to feel things like thirst hunger the need to rest etc following our impulses walking down the street when we're driving and then also being able to connect to the environment and you can even do it right now while i'm talking right and babbling a lot um what's it like to feel your pelvis on the chair that you're on or your feet on the ground and really look away see look away from the screen move the head consciously actively ask the movements to come and you might notice and some of you can comment if you feel this if you just do a little experiment right now you may notice a breath that comes you may notice a sigh that comes you may notice that you're sitting in a funny way so these are ways that we can build capacity so that we can form and lay the groundwork so that we can start to work on these emotions that have been stored these physiological sensations that were there for a reason at some point but then they got stamped on and basically got sucked inside and suppressed um all right so next thing i wanted to talk about the importance of knowing that when we get to higher levels of this work when we built that capacity when we're in the here and now when we're being formed more mindful with our environment when we're listening to our physiology things that start to bubble up might surprise us we might start to be frustrated so frustration irritation ah that's pissing me off those are baby steps to being able to work with the bigger bigger pieces of stored anger energy so again sometimes people will feel a frustration and that we've been trained we've been conditioned like dogs just take a deep breath just calm it down go to the happy place don't act up don't stomp your fists whatever again granted it's safe you're not around your kiddos you're not somewhere where you're going to harm someone if you're feeling a little frustration connect with the here and now feel that frustration inside and then move with it let it come out it might come might might need to come out in a sound maybe a stomp of the feet maybe a squeezing of the of the wrists maybe there is a hitting of a pillow don't punch any walls right that's the classic thing that people do in movies that's an example of catharsis i'm i'm mad and from zero to ten poof right but there's no nuance there's no connection here i am i feel this energy i feel this anger holy cow this is big this could kill someone and i'm not gonna kill anyone but i'm gonna feel it i'm gonna feel the energy i'm gonna work at getting it out in small doses now very important to understand what i just told you for some people it might take months to get to that point of feeling comfortable going right and having it be this organic response when i've worked with people in my private practice i can't say to someone i want you to just take your fists and start pounding them many people will be like that's not safe i'm not going to do that i feel embarrassed there's no way i'm going to do that no or okay okay i'm gonna do it and you can see that they don't want to do it when we are starting to work with the emotion anger and it and it and it comes out in a way that it will be healing that it will be pro-immunity kind of what i what gabor mate said when i read that passage in the book the human being will have no hesitation just like that mama bear i mentioned the very beginning at the top of the hour right there will be no hesitation there will be no oh i don't know if i should do this in front of my therapist oh what if what if my neighbor hears or what if i hurt my wrists if we have any of that this is again this comes back to the complexity of this higher brain that higher brain is saying whoa that means that your system isn't quite ready to get those big anger impulses out and that's okay trust me it's there and it will come out spontaneously kind of like when you plant a a seed in the ground you're not going to get an oak tree in a day it's going to take time but if it's given the right soil water sun worms microbes all the things that make you know a seed start to do the things that a seed does to hatch and and start to grow and sprout it will happen right and so anger is medicine this concept it's about restoring regulation back to the nervous system that's kind of what we're at right now restoring regulation back to the nervous system so that these impulses start to come up and we like them right when i've worked with again my clients my students and it starts to bubble up and it's done organically it feels good and there's a connection with the sensation it's not just emotion sensation that bubbling in the stomach that heat and then it comes out there's a here i am i'm not i'm not disconnecting i'm not dissociating i'm staying in the present moment it's september whatever it is today 2020 and oh i feel this and this is getting out and this is exciting and this is exhilarating it's like that little baby that i mentioned who all of a sudden discovers they have fists and they want to punch right you've got to meet yourself the way that that that secure safe caregiver would when the baby starts to express the healthy aggression that's how you have to meet yourself so it's a in a way it is parenting yourself in the way that maybe you never got the final thing i'm going to say um is some of the things that i've heard in the past where people are like this is a common thing i hear i don't think i could do that because i actually might kill someone right my trauma was so big i'm afraid that if i actually started to process this anger i will harm i will kill that person right and here's the thing yes that energy is in there just like that mama bear wants to kill that predator trying to get her cute little baby cubs that she's just gestated and cared for that kill energy is real and there's this thing that's been happening in the mind body world and the self-help you know non-violent communication world which is that's not nice you don't want to have that that image that that that expression so here's what i'm going to be very clear no killing of anybody do not kill anyone for real okay i hope that's again but the energy the it's called annihilation energy the desire to see your perpetrator die and be harmed and hurt the way they hurt you that is a hundred percent valid this is more advanced work this is work that i do with people that i do with clients that i've done myself imagining the person that hurt you or the group of people that have hurt you it doesn't have to be one person allowing yourself to get to the point working on yourself building capacity so you get to the point where this annihilation kill fight energy can come out and up right and this isn't just something i'm making up i've learned this through peter levine through my mentors and peers and and working with it with people it is so freeing when that desire to get that really sadistic energy out comes out now there are two articles that i'm going to mention right now if you want to dive into this of course we work with anger and healthy aggression in my program smart body smart mind but if you want to start to learn a bit more of course i can only say so much in an hour there are two articles written by my husband seth crystal can pop them up and we'll also pop them up down in the show more section one is called how to unfrustrate frustration and the other one is on annihilation energy and and i think even has it's like i want to kill that rabbit it's like a cartoon reference and in those articles especially the one in annihilation he states very clearly this is advanced work right so if you haven't done the groundwork to start to climb up the everest mountain i'm making a metaphor here guys then don't plop yourself at the top and go for a jog right to work with this big big annihilation kill energy means doing the groundwork doing the primary work getting those emotions back in the body learning how to listen to your bladder listen to that impulse take care of yourselves so um that's all i wanted to say today i know it's kind of like i've got a little bit of bits of things going all over the place um the kill energy is is so important and i know that this is going to be controversial in some lines of of study and mind-body work but trust me when i say i've watched the top notches of my world like peter levine guide people who have been harmed so badly into imagining stabbing their perpetrator over and over again obliterating them until they're like superman has taken them into the universe and poofed them in as stardust and so when we do that level of work it isn't about vengeance necessarily it's about completion okay i'm gonna go into the comments here and um there's some construction happening outside of my door so you can hear this crystal let me know and i'll probably uh uh end pretty quickly here so you don't hear these that that uh that drill we just opened them up so one of them is called healthy aggression how to uns unfrustrate frustration and the other one is this is okay this is when it is okay to annihilate someone those are the two articles i kind of just gave you a rundown bullet point thesis of it um tina says i'm just going to read some of your comments thanks for your comments you guys i'm so proud of i am where i am right now and continuing to grow into this new phase um can you please recommend a word or phrase i can use to help my partner's nervous system as i learn this as a process as i process anger near him or my son i'm tina i wish i could give you a word um i kind of don't understand your question if you want to pop that question into our healthy nervous system revolution facebook group i forgot to mention that um we have a facebook group not this facebook page it's called healthy nervous system revolution in that there is a general question thread so maybe pop that in there because i i don't i'm not exactly sure what you mean by a word or a phrase um i'm not someone that tends to give people prescriptive things to say or do because it changes based on circumstance environment etc i'm going to look through a few more comments hey jackie uh oh thanks so when i asked you to start to orient you said that your breathing started to get deeper and slower a hundred percent very very very good um you also share thanks for your share um i recently got out of a very toxic living situation and i would sing songs about toxic masculinity when trying to deal with anger surrounding the situation and people involved but there's so but there was so much that it was not enough yeah so you know we will do what we can in the circumstance we are in to basically stay as safe as we can but here's the thing when we are living in an environment that is not safe if our partner is functionally frozen and doesn't know how to burp and fart and let their expressions out and cry in a movie when they're afraid you know teary it's going to be hard to work at this level because you need to have someone just like i'll go back to that mother fostering healthy aggression with her newborn there needs to be that fostering so if you're angry and stomping around the house if you have a partner that says stop doing that like that's not nice i don't like it when you do that there's going to be a problem because then that throws us back into that early conditioning of oh it's not okay to show and express myself so um working with anger the reason i say we need to titrate and build capacity and foundation is it needs to occur and it only will occur it will only come out in in pure organic form when there is a hundred percent safety around us it will be stifled and stunted if not okay thanks for your comment there morgan says i just went through psych med withdrawal and i definitely have the kill energy in me i bet you do morgan so let that kill energy go through read some of these articles get into my resources if you haven't yet consider taking my 21 day nervous system tune up to build these foundations because it's also very important you know it can be really attractive to be like oh i'm just going to go and do that annihilation work right now but my example don't you would never want to be plopped onto the top of everest to go for a jog right that will heart like you will go hypoxic you might not survive i'm not saying that that's going to happen if you do annihilation work too soon but be treat it like real medicine right there's a reason why i call this anger as medicine sometimes when we're taking a medicine we need to just take a little bit to make sure our body responds okay right so be very very cautious and curious about this work uh jean says what about stretching tight muscles and anger when i stretch after a walk i get angry and then a headache how do i reduce this so gene the great question so here's the thing stretching is not my favorite thing because movement is functional movement right range of motion where we're moving and getting our skeleton aligned but when there is tension stored in the muscles because it's emotional repression we can't stretch those out we actually have to allow the system to move the stored traumatic memories that are in those muscle tensions out there's something called procedural memory i'm not going to get into this right now i teach this in my programs like the 21 day nervous system tune-up but um basically if we have been wronged if we couldn't fight back if we were held down during a surgery when we were young if we didn't get to scream at our parents stop being so stupid or take care of me and we've got all this frustration or if we have a spouse or a partner who's just not listening who isn't connecting to us that fight energy that flight energy it's going to get stored in our hips in our arms because we want to like maybe ring someone's neck or we want to just strike them but we don't because we're not supposed to do that and we shouldn't but then there's this tension right and so if we try to stretch as you said and then the anger is there chances are there's some energy in there coupled into the muscles and then the headache is can be a sign that the energy hasn't moved out right so again i talked about catharsis and just hitting a pillow with a baseball bat for the sake of hitting it that anger actually isn't going to organically process and heal it's going to get stuck and so if we have something like tight muscles and we're trying to move that energy out but we're doing it with a movement like stretching that isn't organic that's forcing we're stopping the flow in the physiology and it's getting it's like a dam and then that's how we can get things like pressure headaches because the the system wants it to flow out but you're not allowing it to flow out in the way that it wants to flow out ah yeah stretching is a is a very controversial thing too um my training in feldenkrais work and movement and of course this is the work i teach when i'm doing my in-person work in-person workshops we really do want to learn how to move our body properly so that our muscles aren't over working and underworking unless that's a whole other conversation um okay so terry asks procedural what so procedural memories so again these are these are topics that are so important to get into in a deeper way um but quickly i'll explain it in one example if somebody again i use the example of a child being struck at being hit they if they're old enough they will want to fight back they will want to hit back but they maybe won't because they're too small or they're afraid their nervous system is wanting to hit and some children will they'll start to hit and then they'll get smacked even more and it's just this terrible situation procedural memory is the body the nervous system the physiology the muscles writing the procedure hit back hit back or run get the way or cover the eyes or cover the ears it's this automatic autonomic nervous system procedure to protect and if we can't get that out that procedure goes back into our body and it's stored forever until we start to work at this level this is why i often say um this work doesn't trauma does not heal with time it's a misnomer a cut might will heal with time right when you get a cut on your hand or i burned myself the other day on something um lightly like it's better it's completely healed now that heals with time right these things these traumatic events these survival stresses they don't heal with time because it goes back to that post-it note that i had bridging the gap between the mammalian body and the higher brain human cortex our human cortex is what keeps these things stored inside our culture we've been caged essentially as human adults to not express to not be who we want to be and that's what keeps these traumas stuck and stuck inside of us all right i'm going to end it for today we've been going for about an hour and 15. again remember topic today was anger as medicine i wanted to hit a few key points these are key points that i've written about extensively over the last four years i have um will post some of those articles if you're on youtube that i've just mentioned if you're here on facebook obviously they're all beneath this video if you have follow-up questions please ask them in our healthy nervous system revolution facebook group um that is where my team are in there almost almost every day but definitely every few days answering questions there's a general question thread i will post this video once it's processed in that group so if you have follow-up questions to this video please ask them do not be shy oh morgan has one quick question i'm not going to answer the question morgan but there's an article for you does trey help heal it um my kind of overall arching answer to that is it will not completely because again it's enforcing something into the system that is not arising organically my husband has written an article on that called why exercise does not heal trauma so crystal can pop that up um cool thank you you're welcome glad this was illuminating um so final housekeeping notes again i'm irene i do these once a month um we have a drop-in class coming up this saturday it's an hour-long class where i guide you through the basics and we're also going to focus on uh breath as a theme today this theme on saturday not today saturday uh breath we're going to focus on breath but it's not breath work so again breath work is a is an example of something that's trying to control and in some ways manipulate the physiology we're not going to do that we're going to follow it we're going to track it we're going to work with intention and breath as opposed to trying to force it into a certain way um another thing that's happening is not this saturday but the next on the 26th i am doing a up and down virtual class co-teaching with my friend and teaching partner elia marach if you don't know what up and down is it quick note it's a movement qigong feldenkrais tai chi dance social engagement beautiful experience that we normally teach in person if in another universe parallel to this one we are currently in sweden in stockholm teaching that workshop we were supposed to be there right now this year but of course we had to cancel so we're doing a virtual class next saturday the 26th will not be a replica of the in-person because that's impossible but if you'd like to do a little more work with me get a little bit more into movement i will be teaching some feldenkrais lessons in that specific class on the 26th if you haven't yet checked out my programs my website irenelyon.com if you haven't started the 21 day tune-up nervous system tune-up please do so we need education but we need to practice this is not stuff that we we were born with this capacity but then conditioning bleached it out of us so what we're having to do right now is relearn and unlearn a lot of the things we were taught around human healing health and how to be with our bodies um super grateful for all of you who have showed up today and i'm going to sign off now thank you to crystal my assistant for popping in links as we go along thanks crystal and thanks to all my students also who have showed up today to keep learning and keep reviewing i think that's a sign that this work is kind of a a love affair when we get into it it's a way of life to everyone new if you're here for the first time thanks again and don't be a stranger and start getting into those impulses and following them and orienting and learning and just getting those emotions up and out so they can be medicine as opposed to toxins to your body all

archives and history overseeing the grand village of the natchez indians and historic jefferson college i'm honored to introduce dr tammy greer as she presents yakni achookma okla achievement healthy land healthy people dr tammy greer is a member of the united health nation and an associate professor of psychology specializing in quantitative psychology and director of the center for american indian research and studies at the university of southern mississippi she has collaborated on numerous endeavors with tribal nations and members that have led to the formation of the center the building of the 1 000 square foot medicine wheel garden on the southern miss campus while also providing workshops and talks on southeastern american indians she is currently funded by mississippi idea network of biomedical research excellence and works in conjunction with the telenutrition center at southern miss to address health disparities in southeastern indian country before i hand it over please note that we will monitor the comments section throughout our time for any questions or we will be addressed at the end of the presentation now sit back and enjoy and please welcome my friend dr tammy greer thank you lance i'm going to try to share screen i think i can do it [Music] thank you so much for having me and i want to start by acknowledging the original inhabitants of the land upon which the hattiesburg and gulf park southern miss campuses are built i want to honor the unnamed ancestors who were the first to walk the pine hills and gulf coastal plain and those whose origin and migration stories medicine and plant knowledge are of this place i offer my respect to the living descendants of those people and to those who still occupy this territory as a sovereign nation the mississippi ban of choctaw indians and i want to tell you a story in 2005 joe bohannon was he's right there on the right was a graduate student at southern miss he was from oklahoma and a member of the choctaw nation and those oklahoma relatives they powwow and so he started a yearly powwow at southern miss he also formed a native focused student group and they named themselves the golden eagles in a tribal society and that is joe dressed out as a straight dancer for a powwow and that's my little street dancer colleek and one day i got a call from joe asking whether i wanted to be a co-faculty advisor to the student group he said being a faculty advisor is a lot of work and he needed help but i think he realized that he was graduating he was going to move on he didn't say anything about that and leave me with the whole shebang but i said sure i'll help out and so he asked what i wanted to bring to the group like i had been thinking about that i was just like okay i'll help out because i hadn't been thinking about that at all but i did recall to him that i had heard a conversation or actually several conversations by elders about how we are forgetting our plant names about who these plants are what they're about about our understandings of their medicines and i told joe i eventually became dr bohannon that we needed a permanent place on campus for native folks to come so that we could realize that this place the southern miss campus was friendly to us natives and i powered when i was a kid so i love powwows too but powwows come powwows go and i thought we needed something year-round and he asked what that might be and i said well maybe a native plant garden a garden filled with plants that our ancestors used for housing food drink dyes tools clothing weapons basket materials and on and on like that so that our elders could come with the youth and pass their knowledge of these plants onto our youth and joe found a book called medicinal gardens and we both really loved that idea for the shape of the garden so we set about looking for garden funding i found siva which is a grassroots organization and i wrote for a garden when we got funded just a couple of thousand dollars we needed a campus space and i was sure that we could get some kind of space because we have space like out in the woods and research park and all but i thought they would give us some really small space somewhere out in the middle of nowhere but i thought better than nothing it's a start but i also actually knew the cfo at the time greg lassen and that's him with my little girl kyla and so i asked him for a garden space within a few days he took me around campus and he was pointing out places and much to my surprise he offered up this space that you see right here this space is kind of central on campus it's behind the international building behind the dance building behind the liberal arts building and it's near a parking lot it's also near campus food place so it's really central and it's easy to access and it was way better than i hoped for the catch was that the already overworked physical plant folks would not have to have anything to do with the garden what they did not know at the time was that i was no kind of gardener i did not know anything about native plants the proposition was totally overwhelming to me but in our native communities we're often asked to do things that are totally outside of our lanes and that's because there's just a few of us there's only we're only two percent of the us population our tribes are small we don't have a lot of people a lot of the people we do have are kids or people who are working all the time and so all of us kind of have to wear numerous hats and learn on the job so even though we felt inadequate for the task we agree we agree that we should attend we would build and we would tend this garden siva gave us enough money to buy top soil and rocks to form i'm going to go back for one second there we go siva gave us enough money to buy topsoil and rocks to form the outline of the wheels so in the summer of 2005 faculty from biology and psychology and social work in english and tribal members from the mississippi band of choctaw indians they all came and we created a medicine wheel outlined with rocks and we put down top soil to ready the space for plants i put out an all call and folks like would go home to arkansas and bring me more rocks from their rivers up there because we ran out of money and we still needed to fill the path paths of the rocks i knew that people bought plants from walmart and lowe's and home depots so i went looking for native plants there first they don't have any native plants there turns out that most natives are thought of as weeds like jopan holly is thought of as a trash plant by lots of folks although you can buy your pon holly bushes in stores but most folks want to get rid of the plants that i was looking to put in our garden and i had no idea how to get the plants i wanted in there plants that our ancestors use for housing food drink dyes like that we let folks adopt areas just to fill the space so that we could save the space for native plants when we ever figured out how to get them in there and i never forgot the intention that we wanted a native plant garden and so when i went to recruitment events like the choctaw indian fair or even our events on campus for student group members when i went to powwows i would put up a trifle like a really nice trifold that i borrowed from the dean's office and never gave back and it had a photo of the garden in the very center of the trifold and when people would ask what that was i would tell them about our medicine wheel garden and how it isn't exactly like we want because what we really want is a garden of native plants that my ancestors used for housing food and on and on and sometimes once in a while some person or another would bring a plant a native plant or sometimes two or three and i would plant those and i would think okay we're inching closer to the goal of a real plant native a real native plant medicinal garden and i always kept that intention and i always kept that photo front and center of what we wanted that garden to be in 2009 i went to the choctaw indian fair to recruit students and i brought all my brochures and i brought some little candy to give away and i brought that dean's office trifold and i had a photo of the garden in the middle of the trifle and an elderly couple passed by my area going to the restroom and the woman came out before the man and she asked about the photo of the garden and i went through my spiel about how we're saving space for native plants and that we want plants that our ancestors used as housing and food and like that and she said that she had heard of the medicinal garden and when her husband came out she showed him the photo of the garden and they talked for a while and they asked me lots of questions and in the end before they left she said you know she thought that they could help me with the garden with the native plants and i thought awesome probably four or five more plants and will be four or five more plants closer to the goal and all the while we were hosting events at the garden native events at the garden this is dennis banks who is one of the founders of the american indian movement who has passed since this time he brought i can't remember when this was maybe 2007 or something he because we did it twice but he brought his longest walk folks to our garden on his way walking from san francisco to washington d.c in august of 2009 that couple from the choctaw indian fair joe and merrill willis call and asked if they could come down to bring some native plants to the garden they showed up on a friday evening with their toyota sequoia full of buckets of native plants probably about 50 plants and they were pulling a trailer behind them with another 500 native plants on that and so over the weekend i called everybody i knew we planted plants and that medicine wheel became a native plant garden with plants that our ancestors used for housing food drink dyes tools clothing weapons basket basket materials and like that not only that but they helped me or really did it for me that got me in touch with tate triphali from desoto national forest who got us a permit to dig in the forest for native plants to populate this educational indigenous garden and they had a permit to dig in holly springs national forest for plants as well and so we made signs for the plants with grave markers that joe and merrill obtained we had access then to our own walmart lowe's and home depot native plant selection right there in the forest a group from england came to southern miss as part of an exchange program they worked in our garden pretty much everybody if you're at southern you possibly might be working in my garden my all my statistics students work in my garden every my garden our garden every semester so when my friend sonya monk asked if we could have a native american center on campus she and ken york from the mississippi band and i had a meeting with the southern miss administration and asked them to open a center for american indian research and studies and they suggested a minor as well so we had a program and we had a garden and bad things happen even in gardens i just heard about just recently the lsu mounds being desecrated by folks who can't imagine the sacredness of that space and i know about that my two kids discovered this situation and reported it to me with in just minutes of the vandalism i thought i'm not lying i thought a tornado had touched down because it was so disorganized and so um torn up the garden was so torn up but as i surveyed the area i noticed that it was just the garden that was torn up and it was i didn't know what to do it was hard to stay calm i didn't know you know what i wanted to call i did call the cops i tried to talk to people in the area who may have seen what had happened it turns out that some students who were on a scavenger hunt went looking for their treasure in our garden and they made a huge mess of our sacred space the rocks were tossed about much of the cardboard and pine straw that was around the plants forming a weed barrier and moisture retainer for the plants was pulled out and strewn all around the garden plants were trampled some were pulled up my little girl who worked in the garden every week pulling weeds labeling plants she was angry and sad and finally she said mom this is going to take forever to fix but even as she was saying it people were arriving who had the idea of what had happened and were there to fix it the dean of students dr eddie holloway showed up his assistant was there the president of the student government association other members of the student government body showed up first one then another began asking what they could do we worked late into the night relocating the rocks replacing cardboard and covering and replanting the plants putting down more pine straw and by about 10 p.m the garden looked a lot better the following day the dean of students in the student government association made donations for the garden that actually enabled us to purchase several hundred pounds of large beautiful river rock that i had been wanting to finish up the garden wheel so student volunteers then came and returned several times to help lay the rocks down um leland lewis who has since passed from choctaw came and we had blessing ceremony for the garden the president of the student government association and i together spread tobacco into the garden and the garden was even better and i learned something that the students they didn't really mean to harm our garden these students went looking for their treasure and they didn't recognize that they were standing in ours and because i thought about it that we don't really know what may be someone else's treasure i'm guessing that the students saw a grassy area that's what it is or a grassy area with some rocks or a grassy area with some rocks and plants to many of us though that medicinal garden is a treasure and there are other treasures like that that maybe lots of folks don't recognize like the gulf of mexico is a treasure not the oil in the gulf but the waterways that provide a livelihood the land that provides shelter the plants that provide healing it's where houma ancestors are buried and it's a treasure and where some people might see just a pile of dirt some pottery shards interesting arrowheads old bones other people see in the very place where the first people of their kind emerged into the outer world where they as a people were born for some people nanawaya their mother mound it's their treasure so i decided or i've realized that you know we have a lot of young minds in college and some of the lessons we teach are math and english and history and physics and art and music and others are about how to be respectful of one another and of our differences of our treasures others are about how to make right what we've wronged about how to go beyond just reparations and make improvements and i think when these students are in college all of that all of those are important lessons for them [Music] but i've learned from my southeastern native american ancestors that we have to be resilient our ancestors really had to be resilient they lived on the edge and we had to stay in relationship with our natural world our provider our mother we did have a stewardship relationship with the earth but it is it always has been and it always will be the earth who stewards us because who's the steward anyway isn't it the one who takes care of us provides for us provides for all our needs isn't it the earth who does that for us and shouldn't we use her children help her out when she needs us be respectful of her appreciate her and all that she does for us and when we get out of relationship with the earth with our own mother when we try to dominate her by creating environments that serve us without regard for how those changes affect our provider we reap the consequences of that kind of a mistake there's another paradigm though in a paradigm of co-creation the earth and all of her inhabitants the trees the plants the animals the rocks the humans they're all participants in the process of creating and changing the environment to serve all of us all our needs so that we all can survive and thrive on this earth and we make space for one another even those who are really different from us when we consider even the bugs even the weeds even the bugs and the weeds that will be here seven generations from now when we consider their function their ways and we make room for them we're co-creating with the other communities on this earth our ancestors had to live this way our communities when you're constantly changing streams creeks bayous rivers gulfs and oceans because of this whole because this whole southeastern area is diverse and extensive in its plants our ancestors depended on forest foods like nuts black walnuts acorns pecans pine nuts and hickory nuts to eat but also to make flour and to make dye from the holes so we wanted for our nuts to stay around we depended on berries like blackberries blueberries mulberries strawberries and fruits like persimmons plums pop holes and muscadines and we use those for bread and dumplings we depended on root crops like sweet potato cattails smilax nut grass and medicines like purple coneflower to build our immune system bone set to reduce fevers prairie willow and black willow the natural aspirin and we create a beauty in the world with our dyes like goldenrod flowers for golden yellows and pokeweed berries for pinks and black walnut holes for browns and dark root for the most beautiful burnt orange our ancestors cultivated gourds stump wheat goose foot sunflower knotweed little barley and may grass and later on corn beans and pumpkins the three sisters because eventually they had an agriculture that sustained them all year our native americans southeastern ancestors lived in houses made of mutter clay with wood post and swamp cane or palmetto roofs we needed those plants for our homes their lives depended on their responses to changing seasons vegetation productivity animal and seafood availability we have evidence that our ancestors adapted these environments to increase productivity and sustainability in their communities sometimes by burning the forests sometimes by building mounds my ancestors traded resources all over the u.s with evidence of that of the caffeinated leaves of that coastal yeopan holly traded as far north as cahokia mound complex in missouri but probably all the way up to the headwaters of the mississippi and they moved whole communities in response to resource depletion changing rivers and european encroachment we had games like chunky to practice skills and stickball the little brother of war to solve problems and we still play those games and we had ceremonies i want you to listen to this let me see if i can get it to play this is stomp dancing at mountainville with choctaw and chickasaw folks dancing together stomp dancing was an important part of our green corn ceremony down here and it still is for some tribes during the green corn ceremony males drank the black drink as it was called by europeans for its dark color the drink was based on that oh yaupon holly plant the leaves the ones with caffeine in them and if you mix those leaves with other plants that concoction can induce ritualized vomiting for purification purposes so our ancestors would bathe in the river and they would vomit so that they could be clean inside and out and pure in that way folks would re-establish their social relationships and the societies at large forgave all crimes except murder after the world had figuratively and literally been made new with the re-lighting of the sacred fire the villagers enjoyed a huge feast centered on the first corn and they danced the green corn ceremony has a uh holds a key to being resilient the ceremony speaks about how to live together how to empty yourself of real and imagined grudges how to get along and this getting along this had to happen for the sake and the sustainability of the community we lived but we also still live in a world where community is necessary for survival these southeastern native plants are necessary for our survival as well and for the survival of our traditional material cultures and they too are resilient they can adapt slowly over time to these environmental changes by altering their growing low and squat in colder climates but tall and lean in warmer climates by forming shallow or deeper roots and by moving further north or south in subsequent generations our native plants can with care thrive along with us as our companions on this journey they are undisputedly necessary for the survival of our southeastern indian material cultures our palmetto huts with willow frames supple jack vine basket handles palmetto swamp king coral honeysuckle and longleaf pine baskets arcane and elderberry blowguns our hickory rabbit sticks and stickball sticks they are the jewel weed of our poison ivy treatment the elderberry of our antivirals and the butterfly weed of our pleurisy root and some of them have already been used in previous pandemics to treat many of the same symptoms that we see today with covanitine and they still have much to teach us about being human and about how to live in community i'm reminded of all this and often so as i attend the southern miss medicinal garden the wax myrtle and the swamp cane teach me how to set boundaries for my own sake and for the sake of others who need protection or who need room to grow but wax myrtle root pounded into a warm poultice is a topical treatment for inflammation and swamp cane well it is used for many different things like blow guns baskets housing add-ons knives arrows and the young shoots can be eaten and the swamp came lining our rivers and creeks set their own boundaries they protect the land by preventing erosion caused by waves i learn about respecting other bound other people's boundaries as well when i get too close and i'm not careful near spanish dagger and blackberry bushes i've lost blood over those lessons but then again blackberry bushes provide nutritious food great tasting tea and helpful medicine for coals and coughs spanish dagger is very useful for keeping critters large and small away from protected areas and also the root is soap for cleansing and the dagger-shaped leaves are both the needle and the thread the cordage for binding i have friends like those plants who on the one hand have personalities that jab and poke so that i have to be careful around them but on the other hand they have great qualities like fierceness and honesty and loyalty most all plants live in communities preferring the company of specific species some plants like the very medicinal and antibiotic while ginger and also partridge berries rely on the shade of others just to survive and they remind us that community is necessary and that our communities down here can be quite diverse our ancestors taught us that native plants truly are our brothers and sisters our relatives and our friends and we need to bring that our whole selves into this relationship with our earth our rock and plant and animal brothers and sisters turns out that we are the last to be created so we are literally the little brothers and sisters amongst all our relatives we have to learn from them and turns out we have lots to learn when we asked physical plant to pave the paths to make the garden handicap accessible they indicated that they would place one sidewalk from east to west straight through like i-55 but i asked if i could tell them a little bit about the garden and i asked if we could talk about the paving of the paths i told them that i wanted for the garden to be a destination and not a highway and i explained a little bit about how life is a circle and i told them that we wanted the garden to inform us inspire us teaches in every aspect of her being including her shape her plants and her paths and i don't know why they listened probably to shut me up but they did listen we had students faculty and of course my children drawing in shapes ancient shapes putting leaves pressing leaves into the concrete calling the choctaw kids were calling their poke knees and asking you know what's the word for red what's the word for bear what's the word for muscadine and how do you spell it we had someone donate concrete stain to color the directions joe and meryl got that for us and here it is here's our medicinal garden it has only one entrance coming off the sidewalk facing east so we enter the garden on the yellow path the yellow path is where the sun rises in the east that's where everything comes into existence the eastern direction is where stars mountains trees civilizations babies new projects manuscripts building plans paintings musical scores dance routines scientific studies and all relationships are born we come into the world and our spiritual selves grow and are tended in the east when we orient ourselves towards what is eternal towards who we are why we're here how we are to behave when we focus on what all of the great spiritual teachings call us toward kindness we are being respectful to that eastern direction the eastern direction also represents the season of the year that is spring and the asian tribes of the earth from the east we head south along the red path it is in the south that we experience our youth we're not babies anymore in the south we grow as young planets trees rocks nations and children scores and dance routines are practiced in the south papers and books are written and rewritten here it's also in the south that we develop our emotional selves emotion regulation is developed here when we need to put emotion into a project or a relationship we do that important work in the south and we make sure to stay healthy in our relationships and find relationships that are supportive when we find our passion and take care of our emotional selves we are being respectful to the southern direction the southern direction also represents the season of the year that is summer and all of the indigenous tribes of the americas as we leave the southern direction we head down the black path and to the west it's in the west that we grow and as mature beings musical scores ballets movies operas are fully developed and performed in the west papers are published and laws are adopted here as well the west is where we develop our physical selves when we eat healthy stay active take care about how we treat our bodies we tend to the physical aspect of others to the earth and all of its beings we are respecting the western direction and the western direction also represents the season of the year that is fall and all of the african tribes of the earth and when we leave the west and we have to leave the west we have to keep moving we enter the white path and head north the north is where the elders among us reside our own elders who may not even reach 100 years elder tortoises bowhead whales and oak trees who may reach several hundred years bristlecone pines who may reach several thousand years the cretaceous gravels of tuscaloosan formation who have just now reached 100 million years and the methuselah star who is 14 billion years of age are all represented in the north the north as well is where we grow and tend our mental selves when we grow in knowledge and understanding we give respect to the northern direction it's also in the north that we all of us plants animals rocks mountains planets ideas grow into old age and pass away it's in the north that projects relationships buildings but also bad habits outdated ideas destructive social systems and useless laws and even when an income endings come though even when your whole world has toppled you have to take heart and stay on the wheel because even as these important and beloved members of our universe communities and parts of ourselves pass new relationships new projects new ideas and brand new stars are just literally around the corner being born the northern direction also represents the season of the year that is winter and all of the caucasian tribes of the earth so everything is in our garden and the southern miss wet medicine wheel garden is a mama she gave rise to this garden the little medicine garden in the houma village on the islands museum grounds in saint bernard that's in louisiana and there's an israhuma or an itihuma red pole in the center our southern mess medicinal garden provided seeds and plants for this baby garden there's another medicinal garden at longleaf elementary school in hattiesburg where their fourth graders come to native ways school days and you've seen some photographs of that already in this presentation and mama and her babies are doing just fine and now we have a group of indigenous women working with we can the women's earth and climate action network and we are building greenhouses all along our traditional trade routes so that we can help one another with this and other tribal folks with their indigenous gardens this one was built in my backyard just a couple of weeks ago so that i can take all of these seeds from the mama garden and grow them out to give to people or sell or trade to support our gardens food sovereignty is important to tribal folks and our plants are a really important part of that you know before the delta blues before we knew the term delta even there were choctaw chickasaw and tunica and biloxi and natchez and caddo and pascagoula chitta matcha koshata songs sung across the southeast before that blues trail there were trade routes forged by bison that zigged and zagged across this state and joined our state with most of the rest of the entire americas before fried chicken greens and barbecue and apple pie there was deer jerky and harmony and banaja and fruit dumplings made from animals and plants that were natives to this area with corn and beans and pumpkins planted as the three sisters and some flowers as the fourth sister before morticians and funeral homes and cemeteries there were bone pickers bone huts burial mounds with our ancestors continuing to be as much a part of this world as the moon and the stars just out of reach before doctors pills and shots there were healers herbs and prayers and before there were city councils there were tribal councils blue veiled women war chiefs and peace chiefs who presided over those councils where issues as important as life and death were decided you know the people of the southeast the people of these tribes and others with their traditional knowledge of how to live how to be co-creators with our mother the earth how to make room and be respectful for all of the beings here they have lots to teach us and we are still here as are the ancient ones of this place still here because they're in us and with us and wherever we're gathered and i want to recognize them and i want to thank you for having us here thank you tammy uh i was enthralled for your entire uh presentation uh as i'm sure many others were we actually do have some questions here if you got a moment to answer them so one question uh this you would like to know if uh you or your organizations in southern miss host any events at the medicine wheel on campus do i have wait say it again uh the question is uh they want to know if you or your organizations at southern miss hosts any event at the medicine wheel on campus okay here's we we do um we have nativeway school day at the camp at the medicine wool on campus we have had story times at the medicine wheel on campus i haven't done it lately because the covid stuff we also host um hey if you want to help us out like clean up and really take out things that we don't want in there like the non-natives we host like days where we um clean the garden you know and do the rocks and put down pine straw and things like that and other people use the space because i mean it is a native plant garden so the biologists students come through there and you know learn how to recognize those native plants and things and the dance students sometimes do dance choreography in there one beautiful one that i saw was they call it the healing garden and they danced like came in like a sick person and left a well person from our garden so that was pretty cool so yes but hey if you have ideas about things that i could be doing that i'm not doing and you want to help me with that come on well in the vein of uh of helping and everything um you mentioned in your talk uh the mother garden on campus and then expanding uh to some other locations as well so one of the questions is how difficult would it be to expand or take the medicine will garden to other either educational institutions or other sacred sites and how would they go about doing that well you heard how i did it and i would not recommend that path right there i mean learn from me if you don't know nothing about nothing find somebody who knows something about something but the truth of the matter is even with the lack of experience and the lack of knowledge that i had we did it because because a university campus has so many knowledgeable people on it so you know i'm hitting up mac alford you know and mike davis and you know other people all you know regularly when i don't know something and and they've given tours in the garden as well so university campus is the perfect place to bring a medicine will garden because if that's what you want to do because there's a lot of knowledgeable people there so what i would do is find the space first and then you can plan for how much you're going to need to build the space there are grassroots organizations and lots of gardening organizations that support developing gardens especially with native plants especially right now because it's a the thing to do my gar the medicinal garden needs no water i mean i will bring a new plant in if i bring a baby plant in or you know a you know a toddler i'll bring it in i'll plant it i'll water it for about a week and then i'll leave that plant alone and i'm like good luck to you buddy and walk away and you saw it busting out of the seams i mean most everything especially if you bring it from nearby the woods the forest or something like that i mean it knows it's home it's just home down the street you know it's like at the neighbor's house and and and the plant does perfectly fine so i would say get a space figure out the size of the space um start getting people involved because the thing that it does require especially early early on and actually really throughout is a lot of tending but i get students to help me do that i teach well i shouldn't even say this but i will i teach statistics and you know they will do anything literally and but fisher the guy who developed like the anova and all of these like really commonly used statistics he was an agricultural person so we get out there and i'll have him planting you know different rows and we'll do different things to him and do just what fisher did when he developed a nova so so yeah you can pretty much get anybody involved in a garden is what i'm saying very good so i have a personal question and that is uh what is your favorite traditional meal and uh if you have any insights to share about how it's prepared i'd love to hear that too i like vanaha have you ever had that i've not i've had similar dishes but not but naha so i take blue corn blue corn meal because that's healthy for you i take blue corn meal and you mix it with a little bit of water and you make like a paste out of it and i cook like black eyed peas because i like black eyed peas with like onions and some seasoning in them and sometimes maybe a little bit of chicken or something anyway you make a little paste out of the banana out of the blue corn like a little kind of like a a patty maybe and then i put that um black eyed peas on top of that uh you have to boil or at least soften some um corn husks and you slap that into a corn husk kind of fold it over tie it take one corn husk and rip it into like little shoestrings you tie it with that and drop it in some boiling water and it's sort of um some it's sort of get some kind of like a tamale really but not with them all that meat in there but kind of like a tamale consistency but i like the blue corn because it has a good consistency or i find it does and i know it's healthy so i like that now on that blue corn uh are you grinding that and making that cornmeal yourself or is it available commercially oh yeah it's available commercially but you can grind it and make it yourself too um i act it's available commercially it's all over the place that's the easy way good well very good well i won't come to come to your house for dinner as soon as kova is over you can do it he can do it very good well i think that's all the questions we have so uh i want to say thank you for being a part of the natchez literary and cinema celebration and i'm going to hand it over to emily to wrap us up yes i just want to say thank you as well um i know i feel inspired i kind of want to go get my hands dirty now so that was great thank you so much tammy um thank you again lance for helping us out today and um if you have any more questions and we didn't get to them you can let me know and i'll facilitate that with tammy or if you're interested in helping out um if you would please don't forget that we do have surveys circulating and don't forget that uh we have another presentation coming up this afternoon and then continuing through saturday and i thank you for joining us and hope you will be back all right thank you", "siy9TCA5g4M": "[Music] so welcome to Sadiq Academy myself I

parents and join immediately thank you so much [Music]", "cdJ2CglpWkg": "we unfortunately do you know have invasive species that come from the us into other countries as well um so but invasive species are a real economic and ecological concern um again this lack of natural enemies for insects specifically allows these populations to grow exponentially you know we've heard a lot about exponential growth in the last six months um and so insects will do the same thing without their natural enemies uh where we get exponential growth and you know our management strategies try and dampen the the impact that they have so can you go to the next slide now so spotted lanternfly is uh one of our more gregarious and um obvious invasive species of of late in terms of insects it is beautifully colored it is not a moth most people see this picture that it's been crowded by the department of agriculture with its wings spread and you can see these bright red warning colorations on its hind wings but more often when you see it those wings are folded over and is what we call a plant hopper which is in the full gorid family and it is related to other true bugs as i have shown here on the right of your screen on the top is another lanternfly which maybe you can see why they are considered to be they're called lanternflies because they have this enlarged area at the top of their head and it's thought to glow in some cultures they're also related to leaf hoppers and other tree hoppers as well as aphids and cicadas so they have these  mouth parts that can look like a very sharp needle but they cannot bite humans or animals next slide so the general life cycle of spotted lanternfly is not actually that complex right now we are in the um kind of in the middle between of our adults and we are just starting to see egg laying so they the adults will lay eggs starting around now um through the first frost when the adults are generally killed off and the life stage that spends the winter is the egg stage the females ladies egg masses which look like a big swatch of mud on pretty much any flat surface or flat-ish surface there's about 30 to 50 eggs in a mass and they're covered in a waxy surface fortunately this makes it look a lot like a big splotch of mud um and so it can be difficult to determine distinguish between a spa lanternfly egg mass and other biological materials sometimes these uh the waxy layer helps protect the eggs from freezing and they can survive freezing weather if you just pop the egg masses in the freezer and then bring them out they will likely still hatch and then we see a hatch into the the one of the first of the four instars and the instar is also another name for a nymph so this is the the immature stage or the young stage they go into this first instar we saw a hatch in new jersey uh in mid-may this year um and then they go through they're black with white polka dots and they are black with white polka dots for the first second and third in stars they can jump in these stages as well and especially during the first instar they will be clustered on plants so they will be kind of congregated in larger numbers on those host plants in the fourth and final instar before the adult stage they will turn brightly colored their brightly colored markings and it's thought that they are accumulating plant toxins during the nimple in stars and then they are showing it as a warning coloration during that fourth and final instar and so they are they have been shown to be distasteful to many bird species um they're not poisonous um to humans but they are probably very distasteful to most animal species that fourth instar again is not a flying stage they will hop and walk and they will then molt to the adult stage beginning the end of july early august now there's considerable overlap in all of these life stages so we've seen first in stars at the same time we've seen third instars in the field and that's just because depending on where the egg is laid if it's in a more protected area it may not experience the environmental conditions needed for egg hatch as fast as some of the other ones so we get a lot of overlap and there's a bit of a delay now fortunately for us there is a delay between the time that the adults become adults and the time they become reproductively mature that's at least about six weeks um so the adults that we were seeing up in northern new jersey where we have our most significant populations were adults in early august and they just started laying they just started mating last week expect to see egg laying if it hasn't already happened in the next week or so and these adults will lay eggs until the frost occurs hard frost on the right is a picture of a few spy lanternflies on a grapevine in a commercial vineyard next slide so the egg mass so right now we have two main life stages those are the adults which are brightly colored although surprisingly camouflaged when their wings are folded that gray polka dot coloration can actually make it a little difficult to see on the bark of a tree i had taken my son out to help me sample during the summer and he remarked that they were what they were climbing up a walnut black walnut tree and he remarked that they were a lot harder to see than he had expected them to be before being so brightly colored and you know this is a kid who sees bugs all the time because especially during kova they live at my house um so this is the egg stage here i don't think you guys can see my cursor but there's actually two egg masses in this picture the first is a freshly laid egg mass and that's the one that's gray and a little bit shiny the one behind it hatched in the previous year and we often see this with overlapping egg masses laid on the same bark surface so those are the types of life stages that we would be seeing right now and egg masses are very concerning because they're easily transported to non-quarantine areas they will lay them on paving stones they'll lay them on lawn furniture they'll lay them on playground equipment telephone poles christmas trees pretty much any type of inner material that we have so they only have one generation per year though which is a really big benefit next slide so the in stars or the nymphs are are they again they go through four nimble in star stages um they're black with the white polka dots and they will jump um and they develop these red patches they can climb pretty fast and we believe that they climb up the same trees or up new trees almost every single day because they while they can cling on to the trees they're easily disturbed and so we've used this kind of climbing behavior as a monitoring method as well as i don't want to call it a management method but the general public is using it as a management tool by wrapping these sticky bands around tree trunks to try and intercept the bugs as they crawl up so in this picture here we have a yellow band um that is covered with spotted lanternfly nymphs and if you look at the direction of it you can see that most of these nymphs are coming from the bottom of the sticky band and climbing up the ones that are on top probably just crawled over their little brothers and sisters backs to get to the top of the of the sticky band um and so they can climb about 16 feet in 15-minute spans so they can climb pretty fast as well now nymphs are we often say that they will eat everything um as was said earlier this is true and it's not um they have a narrower host range than say brown marmorate stink bug which has over um 170 different host plants spotted lanternfly has a host range of 70 host plants and that's wide during the nymphal stages and it narrows as they become as they become adults we do seem to find them on more distasteful or toxic plants we found them on milkweed we find them on cucumber pretty frequently a tree of heaven which is a major host plant is has a lot of plant defensive compounds that make it distasteful black walnut is another one so they tend to feed on these plants that aren't very uh tasteful to us or to predator species and in fact my student has been doing some studies where we've been caging nymphs on different host plants and they don't survive well on host plants that are not defended like red maple which is a really popular host plant for the adult stages those nymphs are not they don't do well they don't survive well on the red maple whereas they survive really well on black walnut and tree of heaven next slide caitlyn can you advance the slide there you go okay so our problem with spotted lanternfly is um has multiple layers with this so spawn lanternfly is our main problem up here at the top and we have two main stakeholders we have you the general public as well as our agricultural stakeholders the stakeholders there are farmers primarily the impact to them is different as well to our agricultural industry our farmers and our growers they have immediate economic losses and this can come in the sense of increased pesticide use uh crop losses um as well as um the approach and to kind of sustain this um help dampen this agricultural impact is being performed by the new jersey department of agriculture with their quarantine efforts now to the general public uh the impact is a little different obviously i think many of you are concerned about the impact to agriculture and the environment but the immediate concern is the amount of honeydew that is produced by these bugs as well as the nuisance of having these bugs in your property this has led to a couple different approaches primarily a squash and scrape approach where you squash the adults or the nymphs and you scrape the egg masses off of the trees this is a very time consuming task and if you really are interested in it there's plenty of social media groups inspired lanternfly that provide a good bit of humor in terms of squashing methods if you can go to the next slide so i mentioned that the honeydew is a big problem fly during all of its life stages are flow and feeders so they have a very strong proboscis or or piercing sucking mouth part that they can insert into the plant tissue through the bark of a tree and they feed on the sugar the plant phloem or the sugar sap unfortunately this is not a very nutritious host food source for for insects and so they have to feed lots and lots and lots and lots on this phloem and what happens is they then excrete all the extra sugary substance which is what we call honeydew now aphids do the same type of thing you notice if you have aphids or scales on a house plant or a plant in your garden you will get a lot of sticky underneath those underneath the plant that's what we call honeydew and it's just excess sugar that's excreted now when this happens it can turn black with city mold so in this picture here we have an adult that's adult female that is feeding on well she's not feeding right this second but she's on a branch that's black that is not um is black with city mold so that whole plant was just covered in honeydew and it um sodium mold grew as a result of that next slide and this honeydew and city mold growth can cover the ground underneath trees that are infested with um with a spine lanternfly oftentimes what we're seeing especially lower um areas where there's lower populations like in south jersey um you can see one or two slide lanternflies but if you look up at the tops of the trees in the canopy the canopy will be almost black with city mold as well as many of the plants underneath whether it's raspberry uh poison ivy or just you know spice bush any any understory plant becomes black with this honey with a mold and honeydew mixture and it can create um it can really lead to the decline of those plants next slide now this honeydew can also cover patio equipment it can cover playground equipment so it becomes a really big nuisance problem to the homeowners it will also create these fungal mats so these are some tree of heaven trees here where you can probably if you look closely you can see spa and lanternfly on not on the sticky cards but on the right above and below those sticky bands on those trees and all that black material underneath with is city mold and a fungal mat that's been growing from all the feeding up in the tree canopy this can also attract ants and yellow jackets and and bees so and it doesn't smell too pleasant next slide all right can you click on this video yep so when we talk about spy lanternfly being a problem this is what we're really talking about and i apologize for the quality of the video but the shock value is pretty good this is a tree in pennsylvania that's just coated with spotted lanternfly and the homeowner went up to it and just started brushing the spine lanternfly off the trees there's at some point in some populations that is how many spotted lanternfly are present on a single property now they will have this congregation behavior where they congregate on single trees and from a management perspective and even an eradication perspective that's a really um useful behavior that we can use we can exploit for their management next slide now spotted lanternfly has kind of captured the public's interest um and possibly fear more than um most recent insect invaders so you know gary larson wasn't drawing here about spotted lanternfly but the idea of i'm not going to panic you know there's there's spawn lanternfly in my yard but i'm not going to panic it's something we really need to keep in mind while we need to balance managing spy lanternfly we really don't want to incite a panic among homeowners um there's plenty of videos going around of you know kids stomping on spot lanternfly and you know killing them with flyswatters um but you know we and then there's other um kind of visual graphics that are going around saying only you can stop this invader um so i think that you know is a little exaggerated in the sense that you know we have concerted efforts by researchers at universities and we also have coordinated efforts with our department local department of agriculture that are really working on more of a broad scale to manage this pest but if you have it in your yard and you're in your garden and certainly you know there are management recommendations that you can use to help help us in this fight against this invasive species next slide so but because of this kind of capturing the public's attention we've been able to use citizen science reporting to track help us track and determine where spine lanternfly is uh in the northeast mid-atlantic region so this is a map that's produced by the new york state ipm center and all the blue areas surrounded with red are the areas that are currently under quarantine for spotted lanternfly if they're just blue it just means that there's spot lanternfly present in those areas not every state has established a quarantine if we zoom in to new jersey we can see that we have an eight county quarantine area in the state that was established initially it was three counties in 2018 it was expanded to eight counties all of those pretty much bordering pennsylvania um and expanded to those in 2019. they have not expanded the quarantine this year although we do know we have a lot of news news reports including cape may county um we're getting reports in union county now um probably due to the staten island fine we get reports and every spod lanternfly has been reported by homeowners in every single county in new jersey now it's just whether or not the state is calling that a infestation or not and they have their own regulations for for doing so next state that slide there's been a lot of research using different climate matching models to predict where spy lanternfly will um establish in the united states and and here's an example of one that shows a pretty widespread distribution of lanternfly in the u.s the areas that are red are the ones where spot lanternfly is most likely to establish and thrive whereas the ones that are white are unsuitable now this may be linked to suitable host habitat as well as other landscape factors so it may not do as well let's say in the midwest as predicted now there's another model out there as well that predicts a very limited distribution that's not that much bigger than what it is it currently is um so there's a lot of varying factors out there one important thing about spod lanternfly is this is typical with a lot of invasive species is that we don't know very much about it in its country of origin which is china it is invasive in korea and so we have a little bit more information that comes out of korea but because invasive species to us usually have predators and the natural ecosystem balance in their country of origin they're not as big of a pest and therefore they're not as they're not studied as much in their country of origin so our we're usually starting at a pretty low level of knowledge when we're starting off with these invasive species now spawn lanternfly first invaded in to pennsylvania in 2014 it was invaded in new jersey in 2018 or at least that's when it was detected so we're really very early on in the infestation if you compare that to something like brown marmalade stink bug which invaded in 1996 we didn't have that population outbreak until 2010 and we were working on it starting in 2003. so there's a there's a big uh we're kind of ahead of the game in a lot of senses for spotted lanternfly in terms of our research and we can learn what's been uh we can utilize what's been learned by penn state and work we're working very closely with penn state researchers to uh for coordinated research projects as well uh next slide so what we've been doing in new jersey is i mentioned already we established the new jersey department of agriculture has established quarantine and the quarantine basically um tries to limit um sorry it doesn't limit it requires a self-inspection of your vehicles and and materials that you're moving uh between when you move in and out of the quarantine zone now new jersey department of agriculture has been tracking the insect they've moved to just tracking it on the farms and we've been doing through rutgers and our new jersey agricultural experiment station we've been putting out fact sheets and bulletins for our growing grower community and our county agents are also recording all calls as well can you advance but one thing that we did when we when we first had the infestation of brown marmorate stink bug is we started a reporting email system and that worked really really well for brown mermaid stink bug because they also they go into houses and so they caused that homeowner nuisance and so we built upon the system that we created for spot for a brown marmorate stink bug and we applied it to spotted lanternfly and so we have a reporting website sorry reporting email which is s lanternfly at njaes.rutgers.edu that allows the general public to submit a photo um with their address or township and that will help us track this insect as it moves um we're also tracking it with a phenology study using different traps we're using edna and we're looking at management in wine grapes as well next slide so our reporting method now our reports are not robust it's the department of agriculture but it gives us a good idea of where where the bug is located in terms of and it kind of just depends on who reports it whereas how they find out about the web reporting email so if you can see these little red dots here on our state map you can see that in 2018 our reports were primarily in hunterton warren and mercer county next slide oh okay so in 2019 you can see that the population increased now you can go ahead it's all right in 2020 our reports have really skyrocketed i think back in july comparing 2020 july to 2019 july we saw a 1300 1300 percent increase in the number of reports that we were getting now that's only for the nymphal stages that are present which aren't as apparent in the landscape as the adults so the general public is very knowledgeable that this is a problem and they're reporting it i mean that's really good and we like having this information so that we can kind of track its spread now people were also home a bit more in 2020 uh so maybe that contributed to more increased reports but based off of what we're seeing in traps uh throughout the state as well as on our commercial farms i think this this population increase that we've seen is is very valid next slide i want to point out though that those are only our um confirmed reports so how does fine lanternfly survive so well uh the egg masses i've mentioned already are very easily transported because they're hard to detect we do see kind of a relationship with egg masses being laid along railroad ties lines and because the adults are just flying off of that there's few natural enemies and they're distasteful to birds now i mentioned earlier when we were just chatting that they're not very strong flyers but they are good hitchhikers and if you look closely at this photo of this red tail hawk you can see on the bottom left leg that a spot in lanternfly had crawled up that post and was on is now on the hawks leg go to the next slide and as that hawk took off so did the spine lanternfly um so they have other means of transport than just kind of drifting along the air currents and um getting passed along with the egg masses we we have estimated that we see a spread of about 17 kilometers a year um in uh in our current area they also have this wide host range as i mentioned earlier and that does help you know our generalist plant feeders having a wide host range does help them survive because they can choose multiple hosts to survive on next slide so they have a list of preferred host plants and then they also have a list of host plants that they can complete development on tree of heaven is a preferred host plant now this is also an invasive species and it's you can see it very readily along disturbed areas it grows in clumps along highways for instance black walnut which is a native species is another preferred host plant both wild and cultivated grape are host plants and red maple river birch willow and sycamore are really important host plants as well now we do know that tree of heaven black walnut china berry tulip poplar salt tooth oak hops bittersweet and butternut can support complete development of spot lanternfly so not all of these host plants for instance red maple cannot they red maple cannot support development throughout its entire life cycle so they have to move between different hose plants but these other host plants on the right can support development and that's really important from the management perspective as well next slide so here's a couple pictures from i don't know last month i think um in north jersey here is tree of heaven and you can see this this plant had thousands on them but um on the leaf they were just kind of every single um growing shoot on that tree of heaven had spotted lanternfly adults feeding on it and the picture on the right is a sycamore tree that my student took last week in north jersey and you can see that there it is coated and there are thousands of spot lanternflies on that tree so we we definitely have high populations in new jersey we have breeding populations in new jersey and they are at the levels that we need to initiate management in in many areas next slide so when we when we monitor in the first steps of an invasive species for an insect one of the things that we first try and figure out is its life cycle its seasonality when do the eggs hatch when do the nymphs show up and how do we monitor for it so that we can then initiate management tactics so we monitor the egg hatches by just finding the egg masses out in the landscape and and monitoring them we've done separate studies in the laboratory where we can where we've been able to determine the temperature and the number of degree days required for egg hatch but it's a pretty uh i think the minimum temperature threshold is 7 degrees celsius to hatch we use sticky traps as i showed you earlier these are problematic though as you can see here my summer intern last year was using sticky traps you can see an adult right above it and on these sticky traps we get a lot of non-target species which make just counting the bugs hard but we also get a lot of non-targets we don't want like birds and there's been reports of bats as well as um lizards and things like that so the the current recommendation for homeowners if they're using these sticky cards is to put chicken wire or some sort of mesh over top of it um so the lanternflies can get caught but that our our non-target species especially our bird friends don't don't get targeted i'm sorry been caught by these sticky cards um so now we have a trap that encompasses the the um it's a mesh trap that encompasses the tree trunk with a collection chamber on top and as the bugs are crawling up the trap trap it intercepts their movement um however there is no lore or attractant for spod lanternfly and this is um kind of a big misconception i think a lot of times when the public thinks of an attractant for an insect they think of something like japanese beetle which is an aggregation pheromone plus a host plant volatile and it tracks it in mass and that's that's sometimes what we want to use and it's most of the time not what we actually use but there is no lore for spotted lanternfly so none of these traps that we're using um are attracting spot lanternfly more than they are any other insect that's crawling up these trees there is some research that's going on to try and identify species-specific attractants but there are no um plant hoppers that have any sort of pheromone that's known as of right now again because they're a pretty understudied group in general we do know using this kind of technique though that they will follow host plant senescence so they prefer these plants with really high sugars and they also prefer post plants that are chemically defended we see them on grape we see them on ailanthus or tree of heaven throughout the growing season but we see them on grape in june they they do seem to prefer black walnut in july going into august and then the populations will increase on tree of heaven in september late august and early september and they will be in grape we need to update this this is from last year but they will be on grape for most of the summer but with the most populations in june when those egg masses are hatching uh the nymphs will kind of feed for a little bit and then leave a vineyard but then they'll come back in large numbers in september and october um and we've been seeing them in vineyards in very large numbers since the end mid and end of august early september next slide so our primary risk here is uh spread to additional host plants uh sorry spread to additional states we are under quarantine in our in our state and we also don't want it to be you can go ahead and play that video um and we want to prevent spread to additional counties now another concern especially from both a homeowner concern as well as an agricultural concern is this production of honeydew this is a video taken um by a student at penn state and you can't see it yet but the top of this this this one bug next to the on the top right hand of this one great cluster it'll start shooting out honeydew um and you can also see it kind of glinting off on the top left corner screen um can you see it in this video could earlier um but the as they're feeding you can there's there's some coming out now um as they're feeding they're shooting out this honeydew and then that creates that city mold um which is a is a concern from an agricultural perspective though our primary concern is that this feeding we believe blocks the flow of phloem as the plants are senescing and so it impairs the plant's ability to store sugars for the winter and it causes vine death in grapevines next slide so we we have seen in pennsylvania a couple of different vineyards that um have a hundred percent loss um and it's attributed to spy lanternfly feeding i think there's a lot of others going on but we do know that feeding by spotted lanternfly during the september months uh will decrease the ability of the plant to overwinter by one and a half degrees celsius and so in these winters where we have and we've had a couple of these and you'll probably hear about them next week when um dr robinson speaks but when we have these really harsh winters um or warm winters that then have a couple really hard freezes sorry um that can prevent the plant from being able to survive the winter and so then the the the grower can experience complete crop loss in the following year we have not seen that yet to occur in new jersey um but we do have a couple vineyards that have thousands of them um in in a single you know within basically they have over 100 per vine um so you know they're they're under very high pressure in some areas of northern new jersey next slide so well you can hit it again um so while spine lanternfly can be multiple crops like soybean even cucumbers um even some apples and peaches to date we don't have any spot lanternfly that are reported uh have caused economic injury in any agricultural commodity other than grapes so our focus right now from a research and management perspective is is on the wine grape industry and protecting them next slide okay so we've been trying to monitor spot lanternfly through the sticky camp cards as well as the um circle traps and and just visual accounts and and the general public and those are great but usually you there's kind of an error there right you have to know where they are you have to know um you have to know what you're looking for and you know you usually don't see the insects in large numbers until they're in sorry until they're at large numbers so we've been deploying another type of method which is uh edna and i think some of you are familiar with this already edna is environmental dna it's essentially the little bits that are left behind when an insect feeds on on a plant or molts in the area and luckily since spod lanternfly feeds on this phloem and they're producing all this extra phloem uh we can actually pick that up from a host plant using either the spray method in the middle or using a roller aggregation where we literally take a wet paint roller and roll it on a host plant to pick up any honeydew that's there we then use a very specific segment of dna and run it through a qpcr which is a very sensitive um technique for analyzing dna segments and then we can determine whether or not we have a positive hit for a spine lanternfly or a negative hit so go to the next slide please one so what we did last year and remember spot lanternfly had only been present in new jersey for one growing season that we knew about we did a survey with edna at 12 participating vineyards in the state all represented by these pins and what we could see we did two different rounds one in september and one in october and there's a couple sites up north or we knew that they had we had spot lanternfly and a bunch of other sites where we had never detected spot lanternfly um so what we found is that the sp the edna is about 25 more sensitive than our visual samples so we're four times more likely to find a spot lanternfly with the edna than we are with the visual samples and so we detect this fine lanternfly at um i think 12 of these farms with edna where we only collected them with uh visual surveys six times um and that was even a starker difference in the early part of the season when we detected it at seven farms and only one of those we had a positive result with so we know that this edna technique is we can use it as a bios um to kind of detect the population before it's there and that allows our growers to be better prepared uh the next year and and know where to look in their vineyard next slide okay so management i'm gonna stop here for one second and see if anybody has any questions before we go into the management part i'm not seeing any in the chat or the question and answer but i just wanted to take a break and ask yeah sure no problem um so if anyone does have a question for anne um so far uh you can place it in the chat that video in the beginning and was like i'm glad i took my video off because the face i was making when the guy put his hand on the tree and they all just fell off was that was pretty gross yeah they um they are unpleasant they smell pretty bad too yeah that's that's definitely a good shock value um like this is why we care about this bug um so so one question real fast i guess um so i mean i know i saw um wine like grape vineyards and it looked like hops as well could be at risk for i think you said in like the later stages so so i know in new jersey right now a lot of things that are hot you know popping up our wineries breweries are they doing anything in advance uh to kind of protect their business protect their crops um right now um because it is you know a huge economic um uh loss i know a lot of people are buying local getting full food and drink and all of that so um do you know what's going on right now in terms of that yes so um the hops part we're still trying to figure out so initial reports out of pennsylvania were saying that they were feeding on hot plants and i think definitely causing city mold on in the hops um we have not yet seen that in new jersey uh and we have a research farm that's pretty much in the heart of pop um of spotlight flight infestation and then there's hops being grown there we're not seeing that yet um so we're the i think whether or not hops are an important host plant or or at risk is still really up in the air in terms of our vineyards and our wineries we have been doing extension talks to them um to our to those stakeholders for the past couple years three years i think i think my first talk was in 2016 to the wine grape and nursery industry in new jersey so they are very well aware of this pest however they can't really they can't technically buy the label spray for spy lanternfly until they have it um so you know but the the one part this is kind of a double-edged sword here one thing is that there's a lot of different insecticides that kill spot lanternfly and a lot of those are currently labeled for grapes and they're currently used by our wine grape growers for other pests so if they're they're spraying for japanese beetle for instance uh in the mid-summer if they use um almost every material that they would be using to control japanese beetle in their normal production practices are going to target are going to kill any spot and lanternfly mimps that are present in the vineyard at that time what our grape growers don't normally do however is spray for any insect pests close to harvest nor after harvest and that big movement to grapes that occurs in mid-september or sorry early september happened a little earlier this year um that is making our growers have to spray every five to seven days in the areas that they are where we have infestations and that's not something that they're used to it's a big economic loss for them so they're trying to you know figure out how to save their vines and still have an economic you know come out in about not red right the other growers that are don't have the population or the pest yet they're just being vigilant they're you know inspecting anything before it comes into the vineyard um to prevent uh a population from starting they are um and you know they they know what it looks like the adults are about one inch long by the way i see rhonda's question there so they're pretty obvious to see and these growers they're smart they know what they're looking for they're out there they've informed all their workers as to what to look for and to be on the lookout so you know they they're looking is i think the best way that they can do they they can use to protect their vineyards right now gotcha so there's a question on whether or not it's dangerous to trap all caterpillars and other beneficial insects with sticky tapes um that was a problem with gypsy moth um in that case so you were trying to trap the the caterpillars um so we're not getting a lot of caterpillars on these trees uh there's a difference between the host plants that gypsy moth uses which tend to towards the oaks versus lanternfly um so we're not seeing a lot of cat of caterpillars and we're getting some beneficial insects sorry i have a little thing in my throat here um the it is a problem though um and that's why we're trying to create a lore we're an attractant and we're trying to use trapping methods like our circle trap that is not a sticky tape um but you know when we first had this bug there's no other method to control them or to monitor them you know we kind of went through the what have we done for other invasive species we use sticky tape for gypsy law so we kind of go back to what we know has worked in the past but that's we're um conscious now of of you know all the other players and all of our beneficial insects in the system so the next question is about tree of heaven and i'm gonna get to that in a couple slides um but if you have any more questions on that steve um you know we can uh talk about it at the end too so if i didn't answer those questions okay so managing lanternfly is um i would say it's essential so we're we're still at the very early stages of our infestation and the state is still in eradication mode so we want to stop this invasive species not only to protect our homeowners from this nuisance and our native trees like black walnut and red maple but also just to kind of protect our agricultural industry you know we are the garden state we have a really important agricultural industry here um and you know we we need to protect our farmers livelihoods and the more we can do to control spa lanternfly the less environmental impact we can have later on so when we talk about management from an insect perspective we're kind of talking about a lot of different steps here we first talk about containment for an invasive species which includes quarantine or self-inspection next step is physical control and for spawn lanternfly that includes physical removal and host plant removal hence the tree of heaven the next part is biological control with both exotic and endemic or native species and then finally pesticides now unfortunately we kind of tend to jump immediately to pesticides and sometimes within invasive species that's that's necessary um and we we do have pesticides that are effective against spot lanternfly next slide okay so physical control for spine lanternfly includes basically two things one is egg scraping now egg scraping is what was first recommended by the pennsylvania department of agriculture and it's been recommended by the new jersey department of agriculture and that's great any egg mass you see is going to contain 30 to 50 eggs if you can remove that you have to actually dunk it into hand sanitizer or alcohol to kill it and you'll you know you'll have a tiny little impact on the population however one thing to keep in mind is you are you know maybe you can go up to six seven feet tall most of this wild lanternfly are laying eggs in the very tops of those trees and you're not going to get to them so and a lot of spider lanternfly such as shown in this picture uh this this is a picture taken from the woods behind a vineyard in new jersey where spine lantern fly had just been detected that year there are probably about 10 different egg masses or more in these two pictures each these are all on the underside of dead peeling bark so those females will find a way to to hide to lay their eggs in any protected space possible um luckily my labs are pretty good at finding these things but if you have dead peeling bark i'd peel it back and look for spawn lanternfly eggs and just throw the whole thing in the fire so removing egg masses will help but it's one of it's a drop in the bucket next slide another tactic homeowners are using are the sticky bands um again make sure you protect them with some sort of mesh um that's not shown in this picture um to you know to and you can buy you can make them out of duct tape that you reverse you know you can buy sticky tape for trees at home improvement stores there's a lot of different innovations you can use some people are 3d printing uh traps that are more like the circle trap that we use but the sticky bands will you know they'll remove a few thousand bugs from the trees as they uh move up and down on the right is not what i would recommend i would not recommend climbing up on a pool ladder and trying to kill spotted lanternfly with a homemade solution with a spray bottle um i think you're at more risk to harm yourself than you are to kill the spot lantern fly there are reports of people going to the hospital because they climbed up on ladders and fell trying to kill lanternflies um now homeowners in the public are coming up with all sorts of really great solutions you know lots of soapy water and alcohol mixtures and they're spraying them up into the trees with you know modified hoses and backpack sprayers you know the more we can kill the better but you have to do it in a safe method um so and i i would not recommend what the gentleman in the right is doing um so um you know also using a spray bottle is probably not going to get very good coverage and again there are the tops of those trees and you can you know there are hundreds probably in the tops of the trees that you're not going to get with a spray bottle next slide so there's also some estimates that all these um squashing campaigns and fly swatters um although this lanternfly kills scoreboard that i pulled off of facebook is really impressive in terms of how many this family or community um killed um you know it's a family bonding activity perhaps um but um there's some estimates that this is only probably having an impact on about one percent of the spot lanternfly population both the squatting and the trapping and and the egg scraping so we really need to make sure we need to find other solutions um to this as well next slide so this goes to uh the question about uh tree of heaven now tree of heaven is a primary host plant of spy lanternfly they do not need it to complete development but they do a lot better when they have access to feeding on it so they develop faster and they survive better when they feed on tree of heaven that tree of heaven is also an invasive species so don't feel bad about killing it um it it can be identified because it has compound leaves and at the base of each of those leaves they have one or two lobes um or teeth at the base of each leaflet um it's a very smooth leaf margin unlike sumac sumac is a has a serrated edge along the edge along the leaf margin sorry and black walnut does not have those um teeth at the base so those are two ways to distinguish it from those other host plants which are commonly found around tree of heaven now tree of heaven also has a um rotten peanut butter odor when crushed um i have a truck full of tree of heaven uh leaf samples in my in my vehicle right now and it has a very distinctive unpleasant odor so you know these trees can get very large they will also tend to grow in clusters and only the females produce seeds next slide now the bark of tree of heaven um the this is the description that helped me the most is that it looks like the a cantaloupe rind um maybe that doesn't work for you but um this is a picture in the top top right corner of the tree of heaven bark and to me that does look like some cantaloupe rind um maybe differently colored but it's distinct from like black walnut or sumac um and it does have these compound leaves here um and the females produce these big huge clusters of samaras with where are or seeds with a single tree producing up to 3 000 different seeds so it's really important to get rid of those female trees specifically now management tree of heaven is something that's been recommended by pennsylvania and new jersey state department of agriculture now this is information coming from the penn state website but our own [Music] weed scientists recommend the same thing you want to do management after july 1st and that's because at that time the tree starts condensing its carbohydrates and sending it to the roots and so insecticides are more sorry herbicides are more effective at that time because they're translocated down to the root tissue they are not recommending to cut the stump and then spray an herbicide on it anymore um that was the initial recommendation and they say that that just causes the new shoots to come up and we see this time and time again uh where spiderman not spiral lanternfly tree of heaven has been cut down and applied herbicide and then we just shoot some you know within a year those shoots can be four feet uh three feet tall um and covered in spelled lanternfly so the two recommendations uh that are currently being made by penn state are foliar treatment and a basal bark treatment the foliar treatment is a glyphosate and trichlor trichloropure um treatment um to the foliage the basal bark treatment is for trees that are less than six inches in diameter and there you're also using trichloropure and you spray it from the ground up to 18 inches now usually these require more than one application a year and maybe even a follow-up in the second year the other method for a larger tree is a hack and squirt method which from what i understand is where you make cuts along the bark tissue but you have to make sure you leave um branches in between that and then you apply these uh your your foliar basal bark treatments uh with the idea that it will it will help penetrate into the the um cambium tissue a little bit more so those that's the current recommendation and there's videos um on how to do this available through the penn state extension cooperative extension website if you google tree of heaven and penn state the video is one of the first hits that will come up and it shows you their recommendation for how to control tree of heaven after july 1st so you'd have to wait a little bit if you want to do that for next year next slide now we in terms of the next stage of management is biological control which is uh where another organism is feeding on another one you know organism one is feeding on organism too now we see lots of our native natural enemies are our jumping spiders our orb weaving spiders praying mantids assassin bugs all of these will feed on spot lanternfly they are not going to feed on spawn lanternfly to the point they will control or make a dent in the population it's fun to watch um as uh praying meant to be had a spot um a uh a spot lanternfly um but this is you know they're just doing their thing they're not going to make a significant debt in the population in terms of biological control these are all generalist predators so they will feed on whatever the next insect comes available next slide there is a lot of research right now going on specifically by usda aphis and usda ars looking for biological control agents in the form of other insects specifically egg parasitoids and a few nymphal parasitoids this is being done in two different ways one they us a group of researchers have gone to china and in all of the places here shown in with the yellow little dot they've collected parasitoids from spy lanternfly eggs or nymphs and have brought them back and are currently looking at them under quarantine facilities these if if these are successful and they go through a very rigorous screening process to make sure that they are specie specific they they could be released in the future now this takes years and years to happen um for instance with brad mermaid stinkbug they still have not released the parasitoid it got here on its own but they haven't released the parasitoid yet there has been some surveys where we've detected enocertis for instance which is a tiny egg parasitoid shown here with the arrow in the bottom picture this is a parasitoid so it's a tiny stainless wasp that lays its eggs inside of other other eggs another insect egg this is actually a gypsy moth parasitoid that is a switching host to spelled lanternfly so it's kind of encouraging it was um you know released for for gypsy moth and now is um being found on spot lanternfly however very we're still at very very low levels of this popular these parasitoid populations so this will take some time for those populations to build up to the point that they have an impact as well next slide um so we do have a l i've mentioned a couple times that we do have a lot of insecticides that are effective against spotted lanternfly now this is a table that we share with our growers there are insecticides that are available for homeowners such as seven or carbaryl is is available for homeowners and that's a very effective material for uh killing spawn lanternfly but most of our pyrethroids and our neonicotinoids are going to be effective against spa lanternfly and they have advantages and disadvantages the pyrethroids are going to be effective at killing the bugs immediately whereas the neonicotinoids are going to be taken up by the um the plants and i know there's a lot of bad press about neonicotinoids right now with their bee toxicity and there's there's some guidance about how to use those as well for spot lanternfly but for instance if you were to if you had a black walnut tree or tree of heaven in your yard you can use a product called dinotour furion um and you can spray that it's taken up by the tree so it can get to the insecticide is carried up the tree to the top where the spot lanternfly are and it will not be present in the tree at the following spring when uh the bees would be foraging on this on the pollen so you know there are good insecticides not good insecticide sorry there are selective insecticides that you can use that have um that will not have as much environmental toxicity and you can also contract with local landscaping companies to do those pesticide applications and that that is actually what i would recommend to do but we do have materials that our growers are able to use and they're able to use them to control spot lanternfly next slide we also have identified a couple species of beneficial fungus or what we call entomopathogenic fungi on the uh left is bavaria bastiana and that is actually available as botana guard commercially it takes about one to two weeks to kill the bugs um and they turn into these white little cotton ball puffy looking things um and we've been looking at this as a management tool in grapes earlier in the season and then penn state's also looking at applying this to forest wood edges where there's all really high levels of spot lanternfly to control the nymphs with minimal impact to the surrounding beneficial insects the other one is what we call batcoa major um and it is one of these fungi that uh affects the behavior you can see that it we also call it like the white bearded one and it it causes the lanternfly to climb up to the you know climb up and then attach itself to the tree so that then it will sporulate and rain down more fungal particles impacting more populations so years ago we had really high outbreaks of these um we're really encouraged but we've had drier falls since then um and so these fungi because they are soil dwelling fungus do need really humid conditions and while we have very humid conditions in new jersey um we're not really seeing really high populations of this yet next slide okay so um we're wrapping things up here and i just wanted to know i wanted you to know that some of the key information here is that um spinal infant fly causes a homeowner nuisance um the impact of scraping egg masses and swatting adults is unknown um they do have one generation per year and our greatest risk is for grapes and landscape ornamentals rutgers is doing a whole host of research on it including some fun stuff we did last week where we fluorescently marked a bunch of bugs and uh watched where they went in a vineyard so it's a fun nighttime activity watch the glowing bugs go and i think that's it if you want to see if there's one more slide i think it's just the um this is i put this slide in here state vehicle to kind of emphasize this bug was killed before i left um but they are really good hitchhikers so if you're in an area where spy lanternfly is make sure you're inspecting your vehicle before you move around so that's all i have um and i'm sorry i went a little bit over time but we kind of had some issues in the beginning dogs being trained to sniff out egg masses for commercial hire um i don't know we've done that with bed bugs and we've done that with stink bug i don't know the status of that for five lanternfly but that's that's a really good question yeah any other questions uh for anne go ahead and put them in the chat box nancy said thank you so much for the information great presentation thank you nancy um yeah so that was amazing um i learned i learned a lot because again my knowledge was sort of fuzzy i knew that they were um starting to come into new jersey and impacted plans to what extent what's that i said they're here by the thousands oh man but sounds like you know you guys are doing a lot of great work to help better um understand this uh new critter and and help manage it so thank you for all the work that you're doing and it's it's really important um so yeah i'll just give another few seconds for anyone else that wants to put something uh in the chat box before we sign off for today let me see if there's anything else in the q a too it's really interesting working with this bug because it's under quarantine so we're restricted in where we can work with it um and um we need the populations to work with it which you know it we don't want to encourage populations because it's a bad um it's a bad test uh so the dog training was on tv so that's that's cool that's cool that's probably more to do at airports is usually where they've used that um the the you know kind of beagles or the dogs for hire um it's at the airports to prevent more from coming in but sometimes they rent them out too they're fun they're fun to watch in the field and this probably goes with like emerald ash borer and maybe some other critters of like for example no moving of firewood from county to county would you recommend that's a good practice i would recommend that that's a it's a practice that's been established for asian longhorn beetle and emerald ash borer and i would just stick to it yep stick to it sounds good all right so um if there's any other sightings uh you can go again to s lanternfly njaes.ruckers.edu if you see anything uh where you live um is there a website or somewhere they can go if they also want to reference other um spotted lanternfly information i think there's some information on rutgers yeah rutgers has some we're still building our work um most of it there's not really only one or two fact sheets up there right now um and penn state has a lot of information penn state penn state was able to get a lot of uh grants early on for extension and public education so they've really just been able to to do some exceptional work with us perfect great well um thank you so much again ann and if you guys have any other questions about tonight's program or any other upcoming programs uh there's my email feel free to reach out um thank you again ann for hanging in there with the tech troubles in the beginning we appreciate it honey yeah that's totally fine um and uh thanks everybody and we'll see you hopefully at the next talk keep uh an eye out for those upcoming programs for um october too all right all right thank you yep thank you anne and take care everybody thanks for joining bye bye", "th8-iJjmdq0": "[Music] hi hello

the highest raff to me I'll ever go near interval in all diary before news 24/7 in the Minori monarchy [Music] [Music]", "GtWrKJ_T-Dk": "hi everyone is Karen here and I'm here at the FEMA booth you can see it all behind me there is Frank in the background and I'm really excited to sit through a little bit of a demo using the new thing of our collection first I want to show you the amazing stencil that she has there is this one which is called dandelion how cool is that then this is one of my favorites is called Minds ears then there is this one which is called read my letter read my letter then we have gothic I'm just looking at the names in the back and we painted wallpaper because it does look then we have ornate world we have this one is the laurels and the last one is floral net so very very cool patterns and I can't wait to use them in all my projects we also have she also has some new than wax in there they're really really nice their math and very creamy and I want to show you all of them so I'm gonna kind of bring down my my camera here so you can see them I also want I'm going to be working on a couple of pieces that were made by Frank Garcia with his new molds with charges utterly amazing I'm really excited to use them and I want to show you how these waxes work on them so the nice thing about these waxes that they're mat and you they can be used on any almost anything and they give you a really nice patina effect from there waxes we have the rustic Brown rusty Brown and it's just a beautiful color comes also in the rusty red two together are very similar to the recipes that we have but they're just creamier than the rest pen paste from phenobarb and not as two ingredients them so it's more acts like a wax than then as a paste so then you have the patina green and then you have the patina blues which is very similar to the second set for the colors are similar to that work together with them then we have the old white which is the first time I've seen a white wax and it's utterly amazing you can use it to be pilots which I'm going to show you and then you have the charcoal black now what's cool about it is that you can use them on any type of surface you don't even have to use them on a black surface but you can and you can use it with many different applicators so you can use it with a different tool so I want to show you how I'm going to address this is one of the Frank Garcia pieces my black one I'm just going to basically cover the a piece and the details are just beautiful they're amazing so what I like about this is that it's not as dark as you think it is it actually is more like chocolatey brown and the reason why I add this first is because I want to create kind of a shadow in the background with these so I always thought the dark one first you don't have to do that but I like there is a lot and if you want to you can definitely add I like Jess you do this or black gesso and it works perfectly so there is that and I cannot go in with a little bit combine it together because that will give it that a rusty look and if you don't want to use your brushes you can also use your fingers this paste is so creamy and it's there it is with the brown and the red together I should have put my gloves on and then I'm going to use a little bit of this patina just to give it that really cool patina effect that and I did it in that 36 or what I like about this is that it's really quick and easy to use you can also then go by with some of the boxes from a favorite vintage gold I just want to show you a little bit you can add a little bit of nice highlights again I'm losing my finger but you don't we can go back and forth with the patina we are happy with the result and I want to show you the other there is no solution give you this for example this is another I want to show you how to alter this one but instead of using the patina when I use a bit charcoal a charcoal black this gives a really nice coverage to the background in its vanilla bit like that rusty the non metallic look so it almost looks like metal but it but you could add definitely a silver to this or any other color and that would look really cool because you would have like that charcoal affected there underneath and then silver on top I'm just going to cover it about it giving it like a nun Kiki I'm keeping a beta what you see it's kind of like an antique III the mix and look so I'm going to show you now like look how cool that is see and but then what I really want to show you is the new light Gamzee where because really quick [Music] basically showing I couldn't eat they really quick I did this one with the patina the patina effect yeah so you can really create some really neat and taking effect that almost feels like an antiquing cream you can also use them with a stencil so all the stencils that I showed you can use them and basically run them through a stencil and create these really cool effects so that's really neat as well so there's lots of things that you can do with another piece that I'm thinking that we do the patina and the blue together first there's so many different options that you can do it and just use patina with a little bit of wood without any Browns or anything just having it all the scene I know but and I'm going to use a little bit of the rule yes is really really nice pretty and just what's the main so there's no probably so many different combinations that can be done with this and I'm just really excited that there is new ways of antiquing things and they've been using so many different surfaces but I saw like I said things with stenciling probably so many different things so thank you everyone for joining me today at the Prima business if you like this video

the end go ahead and test the chat function now please by typing in what motivated you to join the webinar today whether you live within the quarantine area or you're in a neighboring state and you're concerned about spider and Lantern fly or you're interested in forest health more generally so go ahead and type in your answers and the chat function now I will mount the Society of American foresters has approved this webinar for one category one continuing forestry education credit and I'll be sending out a follow-up email after the webinar to collect details from anyone interested in in receiving a CFP we also offered CFPs for the webinar last week on beach leek disease and I will be sending out another email for that as well we've been dealing with some technical issues with the webinar video from last week but we'll have it up by the end of tomorrow hopefully I'll now say just a little bit about natural areas association as an organization and highlight a few upcoming events and then I'll hand the webinar over to Sarah where's mark where's Parker our presenter today so the natural areas association is the organization that connects supports educates and advocates for natural for the national community of natural areas professionals we're a 501c3 were over 40 years old we provide up-to-date scientific information for natural areas management through webinars like this one the natural areas journal which is a peer-reviewed quarterly publication regional workshops and our annual natural areas conference we have a couple of upcoming events this fall November third will be hosting another webinar with dr. Vanessa be each Amnon levy leaf basket grass so stay tuned for details about that we also have our conference coming up in October in Pittsburgh if you haven't registered for the conference you'll want to check out the conference program at our website natural areas org you can also keep an eye out for the webinar announcements on the website as well if you're not a member of the natural areas association yet I encourage you to check us out talk to a colleague who's a member and learn more about what we can do for you and your professional development so now I'll just handle handle webinar over excuse error worse pucker she's a Penn State Forestry Extension educator based in Williamsport Pennsylvania and she's with us to share information on spotted lantern fly a non-native invasive insect infesting forests in the northeastern United States so Sarah what why don't you go ahead and share your screen and take it from here okay you should be able to see the first slide can everyone see the content well and can you hear me all right yeah everything's showing up as it should and I can definitely hear you Sarah excellent I'll try to keep an eye on the chat pod but if I miss questions I'll mostly take them at the end so if there's quick things feel free to jump in and I'll try to address them right away thank you for introducing me Sarah my name is Sarah where's Becker as he said I work with Penn State Extension and Penn State extensions mission is really to be a link between research and practice and provide science-based information to practitioners not just in agriculture but in the broader economy in Pennsylvania and beyond spotted lantern fly is something that first showed up in Pennsylvania in the United States and really extension as well as the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture have been leading the charge on trying to mitigate the effects of this past and prevent its spread it's something that like many invasive insects is something that we're just gonna have to learn to live with and deal with and try our very best to prevent any any further damage and further risk factors associated with it so it looks like most of you have some based on what you've said in the chat pod have some familiarity with this insect so hopefully I can kind of reinforce some of what you know and introduce a few new concepts all right so spotted lantern fly is a new invasive insect was first discovered in Berks County Pennsylvania in 2014 but based on the condition of some of the egg masses that were found there it's likely that it arrived sometime in 2012 it's native to parts of Asia and it's currently acting as an invasive species in some other parts of Asia including Japan and South Korea in fact a lot of the early information that we had in terms of how we put Lavinia tried to form its its response to spotted London flight came from what we've learned from the Korean literature the PA Department of Agriculture likes to use this slide to show that Pennsylvania is kind of right there within the the latitude ranges of spotted lantern flies native range and areas where it's currently invasive so it's known distribution now is beyond southeastern Pennsylvania like I said it started in Berks County but it's expanded quite a bit its range so what you see in this map are a couple of different pieces of information the any of the areas that appear in blue here again centered on southeastern Pennsylvania but inclusive of some other states as well as one little satellite area here in Virginia is an established infestation of spotted lantern fly we know it's there and there's likely you know people are dealing with it every day anywhere on this map that you see yellow in some of these satellite counties and a number of different states there have been individuals discovered but not a really well developed infestation so likely what's happened in some of those states have been someone has positively identified a dead adult in the many cases and the Department of Ag or USDA has gone in and done a thorough investigation and not found a well-developed infestation there so it's not considered part of the current distribution even though observations have been have happened in those areas the other important piece of information on this map is this these red lines and anywhere you see our red line on this map indicates a current regulatory quarantine associated with this insect and so there are regulatory implications dependent on the state for what that quarantine really means and we'll talk a little bit in more detail about quarantine information as we go on here so in Pennsylvania the distribution - just to zoom in again on that same blue area of the map that we just looked at I like this map a little bit better because it gives you a sense of what kinds of cities and transportation corridors and commerce and huge population centers are within the range of spotted lantern fly and wherever people are moving invasive species also tend to move so that's why it's kind of a you know all all-hands-on-deck type situation to try to deal with this insect because there's a lot of people moving in and out of this area and our attempts are really to try to educate the public and practitioners about not moving this thing around what you see on the left side there is a list of currently quarantined areas or areas where management is taking place so since I work in Pennsylvania and we work closely with the Department of Ag which I'll probably refer to as PDA throughout this presentation this is the current quarantine in 14 counties in Pennsylvania right now so let's dig into the lifecycle of this insect the most important thing to remember with this insect in the way that we manage it the way we deal with it it's one generation per year so we don't have overwintering adults instead the adults will focus and around this starting this time of year but into December on laying eggs egg masses which will then overwinter and hatch out these individuals will move through a couple of different life stages called in star nymphs and they look very similar they just mold and get larger in these first three life stages where they're kind of a little they look like little leaf hoppers that's in fact exactly what they are they're black with little white spots they get larger as they molt through the year and then the fourth instar is very showy with red and a little bit of yellow coloration but it retains those white spots and that's a bit larger until finally it advances into adulthood and then can fly so these are all hoppers these can hop around as well but they are also fliers which then they commence with egg-laying and that's the that's the long and short of the lifecycle so let's drill down a little bit into the individual life stages so this is a close-up of what that first 2/3 instars really look like again they're just they're kind of cute there are little hoppers and in these these distinctive white dots on their backer are really easy to identify there's a lot of a very high positive I've done education rate for spotted lantern fly because even in the NIP stages because it's a very distinctive insect and this is what that fourth instar looks like pretty close up again this is going to be larger than the previous end stars and it's going to be really showy you're probably if you're in the quarantine right now you're probably still seeing some of these but most of them are starting to to move on into the adult life stage now but this is kind of the time of year when people really start to notice them because how can you not notice them they're they're very showy so the adults again from July to December you might see multiple life stages at one time that's important to note the adults are the most I would say that the most obvious in terms of positive identification so when they're at rest there they're about an inch inch long inch and a half wide when at rest the wings are kind of a mauve semi translucent color so you can see some of the red wings underneath that over wing there with this kind of like really elegant lattice pattern here at the back and these spots all along the wings and just that look once you start to look at one or two of these you get a sense of what the shape of the insect is and kind of where you look for it how it moves around and so this is really kind of pretty textbook for what it's going to look like when they're alarmed or when they're flying though the unfurl their wings and you can see this red patterning at the back which is very very distinctive so very very easy to identify the adults in the late season during egg-laying time and mating behaviors you will likely see very large numbers of this insect at one time certainly where there are high densities of nymphs you know you'll you'll see a lot of them in one place but this kind of characteristic swarming behavior where you see tons and tons of them on one tree those are often the pictures that you might see in media or shared on Facebook or shared from you know from invasive species councils and PDA this is really the key kind of late season behavior that adults engage in and so the egg-laying female will will congregate on stems and and lay wrote vertical rows of eggs here I'm pointing at my screen you can see vertical rows of eggs here and then cover it with a waxy substance that protects it from the elements sometimes they're not so great at covering them up so you'll see some exposed egg lines lines of eggs and some with that waxy coating over them but it's important to note that when this is fresh it has a very different appearance than when it starts to kind of crack and dry and overwinter so when it's very fresh it's kind of a whitish substance which kind of dulls to gray and then eventually cracks and looks almost like mud splatter so this is what a line of these egg masses looks like so a pregnant female can have up to 200 eggs in a year we initially thought it was one female one egg mass but it looks like more like it's she's certainly capable of multiple egg masses per year something we've learned in the early years of infestation so a female male a thirty to fifty eggs in one egg mass and again she's laying multiple egg masses per year it's important to note that when we think about egg masses we often really think about where they appear on trees or in forests but these egg masses are that they'll lay eggs anywhere they seem to really like rusty metal they like dead wood they like picnic tables they like plastic so anywhere that there is a solid surface stone for example they will lay eggs there and when you do see them on trees it can be anywhere on the tree so here you see them congregated at the base of the stem but they may also be in the high parts of the canopy as well so this is kind of a good visualization of first of all the fact that not all of these eggs got covered so only some of this egg mass was successfully covered by that waxy coating and this is what that fresh appearance looks like in November and then after overwintering and this is still before they've hatched out likely I'm not sure with this precise location geographically but it's very likely these haven't hatched out yet it doesn't look like they have from the picture this is the appearance of it in March so certainly egg masses are easier to identify at some parts of the year than it then others because this looks like boy that could be anything it looks like a mud splatter and that's often really a really challenging part of a mitigation this is positive identification of an egg mass infestation so so that kind of reviews the lifecycle again it's one generation per year in terms of the behavior of this insect the key issue with spotted Lantern fly in the way that it behaves and everything that it's life is about is about sap-sucking it's not a biting or stinging insect and even though it does kind of swarm and it's a nuisance species in that way if there's not it's not harmful to human health and that's it's an important thing people really want to know so the key thing here is this piercing sucking mouth part this proboscis so it'll hop on to a stem kind of punch that in like a straw and feed through the living tissue of the plant on the plant sugars why this is important because it's a SAP sucking insect it well not because it's a SAP cut sucking insect but along with being a SAP sucking insect it's also a feedstock agnostic insect so it will feed on a very wide range of species we know of about seventy or more plants that it will feed on you've probably if you've heard of spotted Lantern fly you've also heard of Ailanthus altissima or Tree of Heaven it's an invasive tree that it seems to really really love to feed on but it's not it doesn't only feed on that one stem so this is the first kind of misconception that I think a lot of people have about spotted Lantern fly it will feed on almost any of these seventy species but some of the ones that it tends to really like that are not Atlantis include black walnut grape so wild grape and also cultivated grape hops apple trees maple other fruit bearing trees birch sycamore willow stock horn sumac there's a very very long list I would say just observational e I'm seeing it a lot more on maple than I used to or maybe I'm just hearing more about it and there's more positive IDs so it's it's really kind of going for a lot of different things it's important to to note that the feed for feeding for instance of this insect change depending on its lifecycle so in the very early season we see nymphs focusing more on tender stems and often a lot of a lot of the vines with higher higher turgor pressure there's you know more we have a sense that maybe they may be more passive feeders so they depend on the pressure in the plant to kind of help them drink SAP and also treat you know tree if haven't in grape it'll go to those any time of year but toward the end of the year they they will gravitate more toward the larger stems willow river birch maples and in the late season we see a very strong preference for Tree of Heaven as well so it's just important to note and this is kinda there's a lot more work ongoing on this something you'll hear me say a lot during this presentation is that there's a lot of unanswered questions and we're still doing as much research as we can to try to answer that I see a note porcelain very absolutely yeah so there's a there's a very long long list of options here of China berry is another quite important one so when these insects are feeding on the sap from the SEM they are actually not very efficient users of that sugar and so what you end up with is a huge amount of production of something called euphemistically called honeydew but really is just sugary rich insect poop basically so I want you to watch a very short video here of the feeding behavior of spotted lantern fly in a vineyard so whoops okay here we go so what you should be able to see are if it's moving you'll see insects kind of moving around on this plant and if you focus kind of up here you'll see a little bit of kind of dripping stuff going on in this individual right there is currently excreting honeydew in the video progress something I want you to note you know where are these on the stem are they feeding on the grapes themselves they're not they're feeding on the stem and they're there they're going after again the the plant phloem so they're they're not really going to go munch on all of these lovely grapes but what they are going to do is produce this honey that will get sticky SAP all over these grapes why is that problematic why does that cause yield losses in grape it's really just a superficial issue well when that sticky SAP is deposited it's the perfect growth medium for mold so the mold will grow on that crop of grapes or apples or whatever and those are now non-marketable non-viable that crop is lost so there are demonstrated yield losses in grape and apples due to the city-- mold deposition and also just the fact that any kind of feeding behavior like that is going to stress the plant so those are kind of the two mechanisms by which we see damage and yield loss this sodium all deposition is not important not just for how it impacts plants but how it impacts quality of life issues for people so this photo here on the right shows somebody's front steps and they've pressure washed this bottom step after a lot of deposition of honeydew and subsequent mold growth and they haven't pressure wash these other ones so you can kind of get a sense of just how bothersome that would be for you if this was your front steps you would have to deal with that all the time and even after pressure washing they didn't even quite get all of that sitting hold off so it really kind of underscores the quality-of-life issue to that this insect presents so in terms of damage and risk what you'll see on stems are weeping wounds where those that proboscis has gone in to drink SAP like a straw which caused some like oozing along the stem their stress response of the tree you might see leaf leaf curl and I've seen some branch die back on black walnut some wilting and overall signs of tree stress anytime we talk about trees being stressed anything that stresses a new tree or stresses a tree that is a new stressor or as a significant stress or may also kind of unlock or unleash other stressors that are already latent in the stem or in the environment so you may see mortality that may not be directly related to spotted Lantern fly but it's a contributing factor and again there's yield losses in apple and grape and I don't have estimates on that right now today but that's an ongoing subjective study there's some concern about the possibility of transmission of pathogens either directly being brought from the lantern fly from tree to tree or just through that open wound that using weeping wound and of course we're mold is being deposited there is a decreased photosynthesis on that stem which is an additional stressor on top of the feeding behavior from an economic perspective you know I don't have to underline just how valuable a lot of the things that are currently being attacked by spotted lantern fly are grape apple peach industries nursery and landscape stuff forest products so Pennsylvania is the the number one exporter of hardwoods in the United States so you know it's pretty obvious like it's it's something we got to think about and worry about and for those of you who work more on the business side of things and you may care just as much as for the ecological issues as for the economic issue of the the possibility that if we don't really institute some some pretty robust biosecurity practices trade may be shut down with states that have spotted Lantern flying infestations and and that really decreases the opportunities for cross state and international trade so I mentioned that in the late season spotted Lantern fly really tends to show preference for for certain areas and I hinted at this kind of swarming behavior so just to underline that what's at risk for a lot of these commodity crops and in fact our focus has very much been on on apples and grapes and and those types of crop issues these spotted Lantern fly were not present at this site in the morning when this orchard grower walked out and looked at his his his trees and thought wow I've got a really wonderful crop of apples this year looks pretty good and that afternoon he went out and found this and had to go call up a PD a plant inspector back and say you got to come back here and look for it again because it wasn't there when you were here this morning but it's there now so that's kind of how quickly they can descend on an area and the impact that they can have so in the later season this kind of swarming behavior tends to happen much more strongly and we see this really strong preference for certain host species again Atlantis is one grape is another apples maples in some cases so what we have here you'll see this kind of like huge army of lantern fly kind of suddenly appeared in one place these are some dead Lantern fly that have fallen down someone's chimney they're just there in really high abundance I'm gonna show you a couple of videos that will really gross you out so this gentleman just walked up to a tree near an airport and just kind of again they're not a stinging or biting insects so they're not going to hurt this guy but boy it's pretty gross and then here this is that same apple orchard where we saw the swarming behavior in that previous photo that I mentioned and they're there they go so you know they're there all over that and they tend to kind of choose some stems that they really prefer over others even of the same species even at the same site so it's we don't know exactly why that happens but it does and so this this kind of surgeon surge of late season movement is reflected too and we have a call center on on hey what the heck is this thing I think this is spotted lantern fly and we see this huge peak right around now actually I'm starting in this late season that people are going online and looking for information or calling us to say what the heck is going on so that's just kind of a funny little little piece of data this late season movement too is reflected in some of the field data for attempts to to target this individual through systemic insecticide applications really high spikes again at that critical time of year the the days when these data are showing that it's low abundance it was just raining that day and they weren't very active so again like their behavior from day to day can be drastically different which is a management challenge for us to consider here we see the observation of the number of red we slf on red maple trees Peaks really high on this one day after you know a number of days of yeah we're seeing some but boy a bunch of them showed up that day and so on these red maples can see the incidence of egg masses there and just just how many visited so when we think about the management challenge of spotted lantern fly we have to try to you know blunt-force instrument of just smash them when you see them is always great but to try to do this a little more systemically and a little bit more elegantly we have to try to think about what its life cycle is what its behavior is and kind of hack those in order to come up with a really good strategy so it's kind of a five part system here number one thing to do is to try to stop the spread of the insect so the the main way that this is being done is through a regulatory quarantine in Pennsylvania what the Department of Agriculture's quarantine means is that no one may intentionally move any viable life stage of spotted Lantern fly and the places that we we tell people to look for these are on on items that are stored outdoors vehicles equipment especially like horse trailers where you have open areas right so they can come in and lay egg masses on the inside or on hard goods firewood nursery stock these are all issues right but the think about this vehicles too because the egg masses don't have to be on on plant material egg masses can be on it on the side of a train they can be on some rocks that you're moving around right or in the under undercarriage of your your car this is why it's so challenging the regulatory quarantine has different implications for businesses versus individuals but everyone should be focusing on these kind of high-risk areas it's always a concern to move a living life stage of spotted lantern fly around they can kind of hop on to vehicles like this and and you know you're never going to be sure that you got all of them off of this tire before you move it to a new site so that's that's a challenging situation right there but the I would say that the largest danger is unintentionally moving egg masses these egg masses again can kind of be anywhere and if you if you don't see them you can move them without knowing and again if you're not familiar with spud Atlanta fly you wouldn't even necessarily know that that's an egg mass and not just a splatter of something so a lot of the biosecurity practices are like you know don't park under a bunch of Ailanthus trees or on the tree line or leave your windows shut when you're parked inside the quarantine so you're not accidentally getting a hitchhiker checking your your clothing before getting in the car they where they're swarming they can kind of fly up into your clothing so in that swarming behavior it's just a really challenging environment so the kid they look before you leave campaign is to try to get people to think consciously about searching for these insects if they are moving either within or BR across quarantine boundaries and it's probably good idea to do even if you live slightly outside the quarantine so for residents this resource is available on our site as well as PD a site it gives you like a little checklist if you know you're gonna be moving across quarantine boundaries or within the quarantine you can kind of do a thorough search for individuals and for egg masses if you're a business though there's a permit that is required to operate within the quarantine or across quarantine boundaries and increasingly even if you are if you have anything to do with the quarantine area if you're moving things across state lines it's really quite important and there are checkpoints sometimes at the state line or sometimes within the states to make sure that your a permit holder so this is a free thing to do it takes a couple of hours and by doing this webinar you probably already know most of the stuff that's in that there's a very quick test and then you're issued a permit this is again for Pennsylvania and some other states have other other trainings and and other requirements but but this is a good example of one for you working in natural areas if you're a landowner or if you're a manager of a Natural Area this is something to consider for the practitioners that you work with for technical service providers who might be doing business in other parts of the state insist that their permit and permitted and trained so they're not unintentionally moving something onto your site so the other thing is to deal with those egg masses how do we do that the number one thing to do is to simply scrape them off so taking a stick or credit card or something and scraping that egg mess from the top down so starting at the top here and you can see the eggs kind of getting smooshed out of this drop it into some sort of receptacle with with alcohol in it so hand sanitizer or whatever and then you can dispose of this by throwing it away or I suppose you could burn it but it's it's an alcohol that they're non viable you can also just smash the egg masses if you're dealing with tons and tons of them and scraping them individually is too daunting a task but anything you can do to make those eggs non-viable it sounds futile it sounds like a blunt instrument to scrape 30 eggs at one time but even a short effort doing this can have a large impact on private land when your management options might be more limited so if you consider if you want to work for half an hour and you scrape an egg mass every five seconds you've killed 15,000 spotted lantern fly so this is actually I think a really interesting volunteer program idea and on on natural areas this is a you have a good opportunity to do this right so the other key thing to remember about egg masses is you don't have to hurry up and do this like as they're being laid you have all winter to do egg mass mitigation there's not going to be no new egg masses laid after the adults have died you just want to make sure you get to these before they're hatching out so you have a lot of time to do this and conversely for biosecurity if you're doing an inspection on a vehicle or something and you do one really thorough inspection in January let's say that that vehicle is good you don't have to re-inspect it in February there's not going to be new egg masses there so again when you're scraping eggs you want to look not just on trees or on Deadwood but you want to look on hard stuff so stone you know I already gave you that list that could be almost anywhere you want to look under the car all that kind of stuff Department of Ag has has found that chipping to one inch will successfully disrupt egg masses so chipped material is safe to move and they recommend chipping Deadwood but this is where my to put my Forrester hat back on and say please don't chip all the dead wood in your natural areas consider the function of dead wood features and the value of retention on the landscape so you know in this picture these coarse woody debris features have really important habitat implications they're acting as structure in the in the forest and they're also acting a structure in this stream so consider again way your your risks and your benefits in terms of weather reducing coarse woody debris is really a good idea or not you know this this picture kind of underlines the fact that yes egg egg masses can be laid under bark but that flaking bark is also really important wildlife structure so consider your objectives before you take take on any of those types of actions the other non-chemical option he would consider is tree banding so this this PDA is kind of recommending doing this in the spring because banding tends to be much more effective against at catching nymphs some of the bands aren't enough to capture adults there's varying levels of stickiness and there are some DIY options that you can do in terms of banding again those resources are available on our website to tell you how you're going to want to check those frequently especially if you are in an area with a high infestation because they'll just fill up basically what this is kind of tapping into is the behavior of the nymphs to walk up and down the stems of trees and they'll just be captured on those two key bands this is a really good another really good volunteer program idea and works fairly well on private lands where we're more broadly things right so I see one quick question about banding can you trick do we band only Tree of Heaven or are more trees I would say if you're seeing a lot of nymphs on any stem bandit the banding won't harm the tree one issue that some people have identified with banding is that bycatch is possible so yep someone you just asked about that so bycatch is possible but rare there are some non target organisms mostly insects that will be captured on bands but I know of a few cases of birds at least one case of a bat which is really sad and at least one case of a very unfortunate squirrel so again these those are rare instances and if you're doing a large-scale banding program some of these sort of covering options might not be as far as reasonable to consider but if you're just banding a few stems or doing volunteer programs there are different options for how to how to alter your bands or do shorter smaller bands and by sort of cutting them lengthwise and breaking them up on the stem so they're much less likely to catch larger individuals non target individuals and again you just want to weigh the risk of bycatch against the benefits of doing banding and the risk of further spotted Lantern fly invasion or impact the main thing that we want to do is really focus in on tree of heaven as I said tree of heaven is a preferred host species it's not the only host species but especially in that late season they show a really strong preference for it so the this is the preferred host and it requires herbicide for effective removal I know that may be a controversial thing to say but it absolutely requires herbicide in the absence of other health issues like virtus illa there's a certain verticillium wilt that will affect it but if you're just dealing with a ton of tree of heaven you really need to use herbicide to get rid of it identifying it is quite easy this bark looks kind of like a cantaloupe in the late season and in over the winter it will retain these clusters of Samarra on the female trees there are both male and female trees that are very very easy to pick out the inner the pith is kind of this dark peanutbutter color and in fact kind of smells like rancid peanut butter that's what it says in the literature and it's very true and the main thing is that on these large compound leaves they're smooth margins but they have a little kind of tooth at the bottom here so that's very easy to differentiate from black walnut and sumac and things that are fine to keep around for a moving Tree of Heaven again I can't stress enough how important it is to use an herbicide if you don't use an herb site it will respray very aggressively from the base cut stump herbicide treatments are also not effective for Tree of Heaven what you need is the retranslate aiding behavior of the stem to move that chemical underground and into the root system to kill the entire tree not just what's above-ground so if it's a smaller stem you could consider a foliar application of glyphosate or tri clip here or a combination thereof but first and for small stems that are a bit larger and out of reach for a foliar application you could do a basal bark treatment or for really large stems hack and squirt where you're directly introducing chemical into the the growing tissue of the plant in a very targeted and precise way for the most part our recommendations are to use tri clip here for this one thing else i want to mention is once you kill it once you introduce herbicide to that stem wait until it's dead before you cut it because otherwise you remove the mechanism for it to move the chemical down into its system so at least wait 30 days but if it's in the woods or if it's away from structures and you don't mind it falling down just just leave it okay so a trap tree strategy this is probably the most elegant integrated pest management option we have right now for spotted lantern fly as I said spotted Lander fly tend to show preference for four Tree of Heaven in the late season and for individual stems within a community of Tree of Heaven in lay season so if this was your property and these were all Tree of Heaven trees what you would do is kind of look at the stems that were a male trees and not producing tons and tons of samaras and two trees that show that for which these Lantern fly really showed preference so then you would reduce the population of tree of heaven by using those herbicide recommendations like I said and removing the non-preferred trees as well as the female trees and retaining maybe 10 to 15% of the along the stems on the landscape in the late season then treating this trap tree with a systemic pesticide lie decloak ina tough urine and then these lantern fly would congregate at that tree feed on this tree ingest the insecticide and die this is a proven to be a very very effective strategy this is an image taken very shortly after these Lantern fly found a treated trap tree the gret the best part about this strategy is that there are very very few native or non-target insects that will also feed on Tree of Heaven so it's a very targeted way to focus on just spotted Lantern fly so this is for those of you who have larger properties and havel anthis this is actually a really good option contact insecticides there's a very long list of recommendations and I'm going to kind of let you peruse these resources online at your leisure I won't go through all of them but there's a lot of recommendations that we have we've been trying to do a lot more trials effectivity trials for homeowners all of these are accessible to homeowners and they're in this resource entitled spotted lantern fly management for homeowners which also talks a bit about banding but we also have a more more technical resource for land landscape professionals and many of you will probably be in this situation where you would make more sense of this information which talks a bit about toxicity levels application methods and recommended timing of applications as well so when I think about the key issues for forests and natural areas you know we're seeing some branch die back and we're seeing some stress I kind of focus on the following issues first of all city mall deposition where we have large amounts of spotted linden fly in forests and and green space that sodium all deposition on the understory in mid canopy is really really important anyone who's dealing with deer or other forest health issues knows that the quality of your regeneration is everything when you're thinking about sustainable forestry and future options for management in the stand so anything that's going to stress that understory vegetation and specifically desirable regeneration is huge problematic regenerating trees can take less stress than established overstory trees so that continued Saudi mold deposition is going to be an issue for decreasing photosynthetic capacity of understory stems which are already usually very shaded slf as an additional stressor as I said when trees are stressed and any one thing kills a tree it's not always that last thing that hit me you know who cares what the actual final blow was from the fact is there's usually a complex of stressors that are impacting a tree by the time it is killed by something so here on the bottom right are a few photos of road streetside maples that are currently undergoing stress from a verticillium wilt not the same one that affects Atlantis but a different one so this will was probably present in the tree it's probably not a huge deal but these this stress from the verticillium only showed up after very heavy feeding by slf so one stressor makes a plant susceptible to the next stressor and I think that that's really kind of the critical place that spotter Lantern Flight has in terms of forest management the we have to consider to what its preferences are so if it's targeting certain species that we really like for timber value like black walnut for for a wildlife value like wild grape a lot of foresters don't like wild grape but wildlife biologists love this stuff because it's an excellent wildlife species for soft mass and again those understory conditions - if they're hitting understory trees they may be reducing the overall diversity of stems and then that area you may be losing things like witch hazel or dogwood or something like that quality of life - this is really important to me and probably those of you who work in natural areas because people don't need any more reasons not to go in the woods you know I talked to a lot of people who say oh I just don't want to go in the woods anymore because of ticks I don't want to go any in the woods anymore because of X Y Z and it's you're in a forest that is infested by spot and Lantern fly they're flying into your face and they're excreting honeydew onto your head and it's not a pleasant place to walk around so I consider that a quite an important issue and of course all of the unanswered questions we have are the the weeping wounds a secondary infection site for other forest health issues will they cause wood quality problems in the future we simply don't know the answers to those questions a lot of the forests in the southeastern part of the state are quite invaded and not contiguous and highly fragmented so it's hard to look at them as a representative of what the rest of the state or the rest of the region might be facing but some of the research is is focusing very much on these stressors to try to answer those questions but we still a lot of unanswered questions so I'm gonna zero in on just a few of the ongoing research projects and a lot of these are kind of preliminary but I think it's important for people to know what's being worked on there's a you can read faster than I can talk but there's quite a long list of issues that folks at Penn State in the USDA at PDA and in other states are really focusing on so I'm going to talk about just a few of these in terms of a trapping potential so we know that but these Lantern fly have a preference for certain stems over others even of the same species even at the same site so are they being attracted to something using a lure we found really no effect of a lure on adults or nymphs in reading and then adults again at another trial in Winchester Virginia so as far they stopped emisn in terms of using a lure type trap for this insect to me the biggest question that people ask us is does Lantern fire require Atlantis so I said that it was a preferred host not the only host but we still do not know whether Atlantis is required for the full lifecycle development of the insect here's the study that happened last year last season so there were two enclosures one that had willow red maple black walnut river birch and one that had all of the same plus Atlantis and into those two cages replicated of course spotted Lantern fly were were released so on day two we started with 84 names in each cage this is a really interesting project that was headed up by Kelly Hoover at Penn State so if we look at the enclosures that had a Lantis and the enclosures that did not have a LAN --this we saw very similar patterns of survivorship for all of the the fin stars the nymphs and in stars right so but then change has happened for adults so the maximum number of adults was 56 with a lambda switch began to decline on August 14th and without a LAN --this the maximum of forty three adults began to decline around August 12 so that decline happened at the same time of year and the final live adult lived till November 22nd in the Atlantis enclosure and they'll find a live adult that died on died on October 6th without Olympus so that you might think to yourself well that really indicates that probably you know these adults are dying more quickly they really needle anthis and they're stressed without it what I read from that is I'm sorry it's amazing that that survivorship lasted that long without a LAN 'this and when we look at the number of egg masses laid we see that you know the egg masses were really focused in late October so because we lost individuals from the the non Atlantis enclosures maybe they didn't have an opportunity to lay those egg masses just because they died and that may happen because of the lack of Atlantis but that may have also happened because these stems were small stems they were potted plants and again like I said they may be passive feeders this turgor pressure and the SAP flow of these plants is quite important so we can't definitively say from this research project that Atlantis is required for reproductive success in this insect instead what we need is a larger scale trial so the next steps by this group of researchers was this happened this year and of course it's it's still early days because we have to wait for the full lifecycle to go through November December but we have larger enclosures larger trees and hopefully we can we can answer those questions so predators this is kind of the thing that's getting a lot of press these days what's gonna eat this stuff right there are generalist predators that will affect spotted lantern fly but it's very unlikely to control the population assassin bugs spiders praying mantids they're they're low levels of predation we actually see you know chickens eat anything chickens will take one bite of a spotted lemon fly and spit it on the ground it's not it's not preferred it's not being eaten by birds it's not something people like that chickens like more people I suppose parasitoids so the the Keith there are a few key parasitoids that we're interested in endemically this parasitoid wasp that affects gypsy moth here in Pennsylvania in the region does parasitize egg masses but only about 7% and only attacks about 20% of the egg masses that it encounters so there is some level of parasitism from this native species but not at very high levels and it's highly localized where it's having an impact researchers are looking abroad for parasitoids for foreign parasitoids in the native range of spotted lantern fly in China with higher although more variable rates of parasitism so this one is one that affects eggs egg pair it's an egg parasitoid and another that attacks second and third in stars and so and again 40% parasitism that's higher than been a lot of what we're seeing right but for both of these because they are also non-native species very reluctant to just release them right so they're in quarantine and under research and so those are others options are out there but they need a lot more study before we're prepared to release them this is the big ticket item that everyone's been hearing about in the news the fungal pathogens affecting spotted lantern fly so the two that are currently observed to kill spider lantern fly are of bavaria species and about Khoa species so the Bavaria species is is usually is this one here it just this is what it looks like and the backhoe species ends up looking like this these ones the back KOA basically has it climbed the tree like a zombie and then the it's for you lates and and the the fungal pathogen can can move in the landscape these ones they usually fall to the ground and die there are four the back KOA the observational trial showed high mortality but it's really at just one site that we found this so it's very hard to say what the what the implications for management are going to be at this point right now the back koa can't really be cultivated in a lab to be released there are commercial formulations of the bavaria fungus and they in the trials that are happening at penn state are using air blast handguns and field trials and they're seeing mortality especially in third and fourth in stars so far this year again adults are it's kind of happening now and it's reduced populations but there are some non target organisms and it's hard to say kind of what what the implications for control are going to be what we know now is that it's there it's in the landscape but the the implications for management and the promise for this as a broad scale control are probably that's probably a little bit too optimistic right now based on what we know so the best thing is really vigilance to at any given time you know what the life stages are you know when they're going to be appearing sometimes simultaneously if you see one take a photo of it or capture the individual and report it so if you're in Pennsylvania to report a sighting a spotted Lantern fly you can go to this extension site or contact the hotline and though you'll be talked through the process it's very important to report them outside of the quarantine if you're in the quarantine PDA knows it's there but this website here too has a lot of the resources that I mentioned tree of heaven control banding implications landowner and landscape professional recommendations for contact and pesticides pretty much everything I talked about and much much more is available there so this is my contact information if you want to reach out to me I'm sort of a foot soldier I'm not in the vanguard of the researchers but I can certainly get you in touch with someone if you have a very specific question or if it's more on the general side of things and absolutely I can I can answer those questions so I'm happy to take your questions now I'll leave this up because I think this is probably the most important resource I can share with you so let's hit some questions thanks Sarah for a great presentation and let's let's start with some some of the natural some more natural history questions we had a question on how high in a tree egg masses are deposited you know a canopy so we've observed them at all all canopy Heights even into the crown okay and are there any native species whose egg masses could be easily confused with spotter and lantern flies if we're you know when we're encouraging people go out and scrape egg masses is there a concern that they're gonna be destroying egg masses of desirable or beneficial or native species good question I think the closest thing that looks similar to a lantern fly egg mass is probably a gypsy moth egg mass and I would say just go ahead and kill that too but gypsy moths egg masses are have a woolly er appearance well spotted wonderful I have a more of a cracked appearance so I know probably some people on in the chat our entomologist themselves and they can chime in but I'm not aware of a beneficial native species that has quite the same that waxy coating with those vertical structures and also if you're seeing a lot of egg messes you probably already saw the insect and so it's you're very likely to know what it is okay great and so you mentioned that spiral engine fan fly is really a concern for some agricultural products and also for the forestry industry are we seeing stations happening in intact forest areas natural areas or most of the infestations happening in more human disturbed areas agricultural areas farms vineyards orchards I think the focus has certainly from an identification and regulatory standpoint has certainly been more on agricultural areas and edge habitats but we absolutely see infestations and contiguous forest I've observed it myself they're there they move very effectively up the canopy even as small nymphs and yeah they're they're certainly very capable of moving around in contiguous forest again the problem is - in that area of Pennsylvania there's a huge amount of fragmentation so it's hard to kind of chart a course and look at the spread over a large swath of forest but but absolutely we see them in contiguous forest and are there any climatological constraints that would suggest that spotter and Lantern fly is is limited in its potential range you know as there is sort of a lower temperature wintertime temperature limit limit that the egg masses can tolerate that's a good question I think that is currently under research to look at egg mass temperature I guess persistence and I'm not sure the correct word to use there but what I can say is that I let's see let me let me think a bit about some what some of the researchers have told me and I'm not sure about a threshold temperature I don't know if that's well-established lento fly tend to again lay eggs I don't know if I said this but in more sheltered locations so you may have kind of a micro habitat where it's it's not reaching a critically low temperature certainly some percentage of the eggs don't hatch out in a given year but I don't have an answer for what that threshold temperature is in terms of other climatological factors there is an issue around latitude where the number of growing degree days does kind of dictate how long it takes for the in hatching out and then how far they can get in their lifecycle but again because you have sort of micro refugia across the landscape differences in elevation differences in temperature around urban areas or again if it's a thought and more of its preferred food source maybe it lives longer in the ER than somewhere else we're not sure about that yet I think that there's a very wide range of error margin of error for making those delineations geographically - okay and then for treatment where can folks actually purchase the banding materials it's not available at a hardware store is that something that people would have yeah the banding materials are widely available and on that banding resource that I mentioned on this website it'll kind of outline the different options that you have and you can also make your own bands you know you could even use something like duct tape but but duct tape will get less sticky if it rains so that's why it's sometimes better to go with a commercial option or using like a petroleum jelly I think is one of the one of the options that they offer there so there are some DIY options but certainly the commercial bands work a little bit better Oh quick there's one thing I also want to mention in terms of contact pesticides it's very important not to try home remedies for contact insecticides you don't really know what the effects are going to be on that insect or non targets or in the environment it's very important to kind of stick to the official recommendation so continue and what what are the odds would you say on being able to totally eradicate spider and Lantern fly this also relates to a question of funding whether there's federal funding like Asian longhorn beetle eradication in Massachusetts or or sufficient state funding to continue the quarantine effort and and the control efforts that are that are happening yeah there is support from a variety of levels including federal and state levels in Pennsylvania right now that's focusing not just on enforcing the quarantine but also on education some like I think banding programs were also funded at one point and a lot of the research is funded through through those agencies to and through a lot of these cooperative efforts right so there there is certainly a lot of funding support what was the first part of your question just in terms of the expanse of eradication right so that question is way above my pay grade what I can say is that the language has changed from eradication among regulatory agents toward mitigation and preventive spread which is I think I think I read that as an appropriate use of language now it's out there on the landscape and but through the actions that we take we can mitigate its impact and we can prevent its spread so those two things are certainly within human power to do I don't know whether eradication is really if there's hope for eradication or not but people that would be able to say that are the regulator's that make those decisions and not sure well Sarah thank you for a great presentation today members of the ions if we didn't get to your question I'll be sending Sarah text copies of the questions so we'll try to answer them and get them up on a slide at the end of the webinar video we will try to get the video posted by the end of the day tomorrow so it'll be up on our the natural areas Association website with a link to the YouTube video thanks everybody for attending have a great afternoon and thank you Sarah for a great informative presentation thank you all for participating", "cnwATrpknD4": "we have a special event today we continue our series of events indicated to the current presidential election in America and today we will discuss the very interesting topics namely LGBT issues and elections something which seems like a very tiny thing but I hope we'll see that it's not actually so tiny that we can we can say many things but and very important so please being as you listen to our guest speaking with those questions in the immigration and lively discussion I all introduce our guest now we have mrs. Pamela wells and mr. O'Dwyer Robinson just by using their names you already know that they're Americans who live in bowlin for time already and they both you could say practitioners because they're both LGBT activists so there are people who deal with those issues and databases and they're both most of our interest in politics and moose appeal we're about to hear a very interesting talk at first and then and then discussion so without further ado please join me in welcoming Turkish for this event today so maybe just a small person first of all when we got here and forget I said you know demia do you need you have powerpoint slides and immediately thought oh no we don't have we don't have visual aids so we just like a naked or just here having a casual talk with you but hopefully you know we will be um maybe maybe you'd like to hear just two or three sentences about Paul and about myself you know that we've been in Poland you know that were algae activists but oh what you are even three sentences oh well I'm i bet i was a nice evening for a while ago about four years ago broke through television and i make video games and I try to help out the community around the world so that's basically why I'm okay how do i do not live in states I haven't been in all the states i think since 2006 as last time I currently live there although I am a good American I go back with leather for thanksgiving important you lie and all that keep very much in tune with what's going on my coma so good American expat yeah I'm the bad American and I haven't lived in the States for 25 years I do go back but usually every two years companies all still there I used to be an artist and when I retired and now I learned in finance so I also as much as I can before I I've worked with doing financial stuff but with NGOs organization and whenever I can I sometimes write for replica magazine and I'm pretty regularly involved although less than I used to be in a lot of feminist activities and demonstrations okay so so work poll is going to try not to go into too much detail because he's a good American he knows everything about politics and he just automatically knows his stuff so he's going to try not to go too much into detail I and I'm going to try not to embarrass myself by how much I don't know but if we're talking about something that you completely you know we're going off on a tangent or we start talking about a person that you have no idea what we're saying just somebody raise your hand I'm with your stomp or explain it okay I'm some and 20 years ago if a Republican was talking about some of the LGBT which doesn't just be called gay then probably the word that could be used as sodomy right the Democrats weren't a lot better went to thing like 23 years ago in 1993 is when Don't Ask Don't Tell was proposed for the American is Harry which was considered to be a kind of compromise it was supposed to be a way to allow every citizen to serve by allowing them to not be asked if you're gay if we don't if you if you don't say that you're gay we won't ask that your day and that way you can stay in the military Paul can talk a lot more about this if we want to like you know that was 25 years ago 23 years ago that that was instituted and it was repealed in 2010 20 20 years ago 1996 DOMA was Institute the Defense of Marriage Act and again this is kind of considered to be a compromise because in 1993 what what timer was is it allowed the states to refuse to recognize same-sex same-sex marriages and this came about then this is a federal things as you know like each state gets to do what they want but then if there's a federal law that everybody has to follow this 1993 there was a case in Hawaii where it didn't actually say that same-sex marriages were ok but it had some information in there that was like a precedent saying the state should have a very good reason why it doesn't allow same-sex marriages this isn't Hawaii and everyone across the state started panicking especially people who opposed same-sex marriages because there's also something in the Constitution that says it's the Full Faith and Credit Clause which says if you have a document from one state especially like legal document to do share a document then all the other states have to recognize so you know if you're born in New York and you go while me you're still born right you get married in one state you go to another state and they have to abide by this so the defense of marriage act in 1996 was kind of a federal panic button where they wanted to make sure that if somebody got married in Hawaii whenever whichever first state said it's okay get married that they couldn't move to another state or try and get federal benefits or feather-like on on a full nationwide so that's kind of background that's 25 years ago that those were the kind of situations and that was those were both enacted under Bill Clinton right so we got Hillary Clinton running now Bill Clinton I hope considered to be you know like the oven guard and was like years of LGBT rights but that was the situation 20 25 so now it's really really different the LGBT population hasn't drastically changed we still have my statistically five to ten percent of the population that is LGBT but it seems like the movable middle has moved and what I mean by the movable middle is that like you always have people that are pro or very pro something and people who are a common or very you know against we're very against something but there's always this big group of people in the middle who kind of well this one of my business or I don't really care and it's those people that maybe 20 25 years ago we're like I don't care but no and now they're kind of I don't care but everyone should have rights so just as a background to where we are today like how did that mean we had we go from that kind of situation to now we're in the last 10 years we've had amazing amazing changes in the kind of rights for LGBT people that most people wouldn't have really imagined like five or ten you know glad 20 years ago just even though the Clintons now I'm particularly hilarious saying that she was for the defense of marriage act as a kind of compromise to kind of protect things no matter what people thought personally the political situation was really like a no-go area for LGBT rights so now we have 2015 and Obama is the first president ever on the cover of a magazine up magazine he was named ally of the year and but even for him in 2004 and he was running for the Senate he saw the marriage is something that's should be between another woman so we kind of have to consider when we're thinking about lbc candidates now or together this candidates for the election now that all of them probably in the length of their career have as all politicians do change my mind take a different stance and there's some kind of history so or you tap today is introduced the campus five main candidates talk about not to talk about everything the kind of scene I just I'm pulse gonna started raining right so full disclosure I've been falling for any Sanders a lot longer than this presidential candidacy Bernie Sanders started out as a dark horse most definitely it was a social justice movement obviously but one of the interesting things I find about Bernie Sanders especially where his connection and his time to the LGBT community stems from is it wasn't always a big supporter of the LGBT community especially when it came to marriage rites of marriage equality but also when we're speaking of that middle ground wasn't necessarily against it he did a stand against America rights for a long time but he did change his stance about 10 years ago as Vermont itself is a free progressive state and he was a pretty progressive candidate and then collected too soon so so he has shifted gradually towards that movement but what I find out interesting about him especially now he's right now the election he's full-on on supporting he's far to the left of LGBT rights right now and I think a lot of that has to do on personal level of Bernie I met him twice in my life teste was Rachel Maddow this is an American talk show host and probably one of the team of influential lesbians in media in America right now especially in the political sphere and she did moreover the eight years that Obama in particular has been president to sort of give him front and center as a a viable candidate also is one that reached out to me the LGBT community in America because he was pretty much always known as a financial warrior and the economy warrior guy that was you know these passable guy challenge everyone in the Senate on his social democratic approach to income equality but it was pretty much on them to the LGBT community and he's still relatively unknown to most communities of color in the States well he eats he or not so that's kind of where he is so right now he's probably right about the almost made in half to me the votes ilias for advance of all the other Kennedy's in terms of popular votes but he does have a chance to actually especially as the super delegates from allowed to come get the nomination now part of this is all politics until the Polish politics is crazy so is America public you know in America right now if you started out very much i hate the super delegates now he's looking at the math going well ABI don't hate them so much because they can get me the nomination which is just the nature political piece back home but but with birdie and one of the things we said is regardless of whether he's won enough for special economic issues and social justice issues he has changed the conversation not just America globally all of my friends and year all of my friends and asian I talked to a lot of them know more about journey who is the considered dark horse candidate in the States than they do about the other candidates of the Trump be no more talk about that that's one tablet but rather than Trump bernie is probably far more recognized globally as a presidential candidate Hillary obviously been around her various roles secretary of state but I think that's kind of in relation to the LGBT community kind of where he is but like all politicians if I guess controversially still serve parsing this Vatican visit with pro quo Francis didn't eat them or was it a Kim Davis thing we're still figuring that one out that that's kind of him as that show look more to say about unless I know which is you know mama history all right like their own 70s deaths of more or less stuff he has been dogged be consistent i will say was with politics with that consistency has been kind of translated the policy one of the downsides is very much an active as kind of guy but his policy record relative to the other senators and congressmen have been has been pretty slim for 23 years so pronounced don't even have any specific questions about learning okay I'm moving on to Hillary is um okay so that our boys does boys girls no no I just like know the candidates that we're covering are the two Democratic the two that are fighting for the Democratic nomination which is Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton the three that are fighting for the Republican nomination which is Ted Cruz Donald Trump and John I want to pronounce it John Kasich I was a posse okay and then there's two independent character so so wonder if the Democrats is going to get in it's going to be on the ticket one of the Republicans and then there's also gary johnson and jill stein maybe two i'm looking forward to oh yeah yeah I know Donald Trump is it is a complete like crazy day so so yes one of them will be on the ticket as a Republican candidate the other one who knows I'm sorry so Hillary Clinton I think you know most people know she was Secretary of State she was Senator New York she was quite a visible part of lil Clinton to to come to presidencies presences and she according big day they do these kind of liberal or conservative poles can according to these poles she's less liberal than Bernie like Bernie gets a gift a standing of 8.2 and she only gets a 6.5 but really her track record on supporting LGBT rights and women's rights is really long she's she's definitely in professional politicians and she's definitely been in a lot of messes but in terms of LGBT rights and she really goes back quite away most of the you know that there's a couple i can say just in the last year let's say in June last year you know she was very very vocal about supporting when the organ fell over a morgue Rafael and versus Hodges this is the case that overturned the Defense of Marriage Act and made so that same-sex marriage is legal and why the recognized in all across America so she was he a very very outspoken but you know most of the nation was by the time it was very hip you know even the White House term rainbow in July 2015 then she she was endorsing the Quality Act and which is still in progress this is an expansion of the 1964 Civil Rights um at which is looking to add the LGBT people as part of the anti-discrimination protection so and this is Jim she's she's kind of course this in 2015 in October then she you know even though she was involved in the Clinton administration when Don't Ask Don't Tell was in dog was in putting into action and also in defense of marriage then she's actually since then worked a lot to try and repeal these and said okay that was a mistake let's stop this so she's arguing in October than about 14,000 soldiers that were forced to leave the military because of their sexual orientation should have the record sir visit service records updated and say no they should be honored so she's working fun l3t veterans right in December then you know she she's it's not the only incidents but there's like scenes from speeches where she's always like has been repeating you know gay rights are human rights so she's very outspoken in a public way in the last year and a half which is not so surprising since she wants to be President but not including law in most of the kind of proclaims and statements is the fact that as long ago as 1991 25 years ago then you know she and her husband were doing a lot about HIV and AIDS awareness and she was really really a big supporter and putting money towards this and in 1991 then there was someone that she she knew very close who was involved in LA sante prop a project in Los Angeles who died she was us as because memorial and she did so even you know 25 years ago then she was involved not just in some of the more popular issues because now it's becoming kind of hip to be pro marriage equality but marriage equality is not the only issue on the table either still hiv/aids is an issue there's a lot stuff about about transgender bullying about bathroom laws about you know a lot of other companies of things so in October advocate magazine which is a gay magazine LGBT magazine interview your end and for them they said she was like tablet Z tolerance so so you know a lot of times she comes across as a very professional politician but still I think I think in terms of the community then you can say that the community space the community if there is such a thing he's caused splits over there kind of support Bernie or Hillary she's really love some people said she's the kind of you know political share that you know a lot of people see in her the fact that she she's really strong and gets a lot of stuff thrown at her and she stands up to it you know so there's something that they could have recognized that she really gets a tough time like people have dedicated their entire working life to destroying mountains and they're so sandy she's still there you know she should get someone to much drawn in her and still she's like I don't care I'm here so I think because of that the nuts one thing that the LGBT community and especially I would say the you know women less may be economically powerful the there there is a little bit of a divine maybe you can say between the supporters or who she stands up she's got them for everybody but maybe she's more popular with with enough white up so so yeah she she has lots of peanut loss which has several gay stuff who's gay people understand her campaign manager Romney look is is a she also has a dedicated LGBT outreach um that's my program as part of her campaign that steps are cited by someone by this guy nominee global she she announced her candidacy with a video that included not one but two gay couples and she has unearthed related packs political action committees she she has a kind of LOL pac which is quite a power groups a lesbian power group that are longing for her so she has a lot of a lot of people that are working with her and on her team that are not only looking for LGBT rights but in the kick so I think I you know of course she she rented with me tweets about about stuff she's you know all of them are big into and so making sure that they are seeing publicly as opposing something or or supporting something so actually was the first of April there is in Indiana there's like Arkansas past yeah they did press it it has something similar to Indiana's religious freedom act and you know so of course she kind of yeah so I mean you guys all the religious freedom acts meaning that they're free to discriminate so so that's the latest Ted Cruz senator Ted Cruz full disclosure I said a lot of mainly so so one of the things all of these in sports I met Ted Cruz maybe 12 13 years ago I had the great honor of interviewing for another magazine govern and Richards defenses it was probably the greatest governor texts that hasn't passed 50 years she was great great great home and was also very much in support of LGBT lttp issues from back the day just to sort of bring the connection why I was talking and meeting all these politicians when I got out of the military I actually was in and they call it queer vets back in the day a group challenging Don't Ask Don't Tell as doing a lot of activism writing for this Ellie magazine called frontiers and profess who are getting in trouble and didn't pick out because of the mascot help because even though it was a compromised position with the first time in history of US military where there was a codified law that that a commanding officer could use to kick people out military whether orientation before the reason that usually happen is if you sign on your form I have and the form was very ridiculous it didn't ask if you're gay or lesbian or whatever asked about what your sex was with someone of the same sex if they determine that you lied on your entry form then that was the reason that they could kick you out total orientation if you ever saw the movie velocity lose Don't Ask Don't Tell actually made a law that was you see you could you tilt I got hand Richards defending trying to share this airman that was about to get kicked out of the air national guard who was in la la biet some of the groups yeah she wasn't a governor but she was supporting veterans in the sense in struggling under felt Ask Don't Tell I look now the Texas to meet her I had misfortune of reasoning young congressional aide Ted Cruz who spoke to both of us old cafe near the Statehouse in Austin about how people are going to hell so key to my friend status has been very consistent with his views um he came into his office on that wave of anger after Obama was elected came and not vibrate margin but a sliver and it has basically been running for the Presidency ever since he was elected to the Texas Senate as Jason threat time he has run entire he's passed less than ten not actual initiate any laws in the Senate he's passed and signed I think about 18 with a lot of riders all of them associated with his stance on a LGBT issues isn't nearly as as his hands on women's reproductive rights which is where I have the biggest issue with guys that in 2010 2014 very much you know should be illegal all cases and very recently took it to the next level including great so find his life in him had working with that another PT issues he was very much against between the twenty twelve election marriage equality was actually a lot more front and center it is this current election cycle everybody was a tennis eye on it and he was one of the frontrunners was Huckabee on you know it's between an animal he's kind of backed off with that once the Supreme Court case no one wanted to touch that on the GOP side and now it's fully focused on under the seductive right support up so his voting record on that and Texas was pretty pretty aggressive a lot of fundraising two years ago to bring down to bring in a new governor of Texas so they could start to since you're trying to Parenthood and pose allow the abortion clinics they're very successfully we're going to move down for down ticket candidates especially from currently though he like Bernie Sanders business was a dark horse you know he's not very much like to understand because he as disagreeable to the rank-and-file Republicans as he is to the Democrats everyone I think of the planet knows he shut down but the movement shut down the US government in 2011 push across to the brink of what they called the nuclear option of the country without the throat and say we just aren't going to spend a pee buy anything so I guess it's this kind of trip to but but in his favor and I can't believe I'm saying that in his favor he is if he got elected to be the first Hispanic human / origin his father who is also great evangelical both of them have all the course of their life done a lot of the Christian activist reporter the poor a lot of Christian activism for sort of things you would expect charities to feed a charity to help college homeless all that sort of stuff and they have been very consistent because he is a politician to be sure but I you know I can respect the guy because yet we believe what he's saying and I think the reason that he / say mark Rubio or over Huckabee's and even over Santorum they were all the primaries I think he stood out with that crowd a lot more you know it's kind of a distasteful guy because he has had a very very very consistent present kind of get ok any questions I guess about covering it tempers his views on LGBT are less controversial than his other views so that's one thing some say he's the most liberal of the Republican candidates on LGBT mostly that's because he has to change his mind and say whatever he feels like at that moment for me just a quick video as compared to the say Ted Cruz who you know thanks well evil eye jump you know just isn't quite sure so yeah hey you gotta wait you don't mean that lady gaga ok i knowi know it right okay finance Trump University to Medina um so we still his views definitely are not inclusive we could never say that he's actually inclusive he still has been pretty much he's a kind of mantra against being against gay marriage I mean having said that he's been you can now say the traumas consistent about anything but but he's he's criticized other Republican candidates for taking money from from lgb from philanthropists that are better supporting LGBT rights and and saying that he's never made any campaign promises around LGBT stuff however when he does Republican room called log cabin log of the Republicans yeah which is which is a group that that hacks that are activists trying to get Republicans to be inclusive of LGBT the Log Cabin Republicans looked at his 2002 tax returns and found out that he actually donated $20,000 ten thousand dollars to to LGBT organizations galcen which is the gay lesbian and straight Education Network and also to GMHC which is in New York it's like the fur the world's first and the leading provider of HIV and AIDS prevention he didn't you know he didn't actually directly it's kind of like like he didn't directly give the money to him it was through a TV program called celebrity apprentice it was a TV show and the person on the TV show like chooses the charity of their choice but still that person chose it and then actually the check came from trunk so you know again like everything he tends to kind of change his mind whenever it's convenient or he just doesn't remember what he says he doesn't care really I mean like like I think that's the defining feature of childhood he doesn't really care about a new Advent trunk you know he really doesn't so so in any given moment and I didn't even issue it's hard to say that he's actually pro or against it's just kind of like what's good for Donald right in two thousand two thousand because he was considering running on the reform for me ticket and he was interviewed by advocate magazine this is LGBT magazine and he at that point he said that he supported amending the 1964 Civil Rights Act so this is like also 15 years ago he was in favor of adding LGBT people and aunt Agatha shouldn't discriminate against so that's the thing is that sometimes he will in a strange moment say something and mostly it's because he doesn't care right it's like that doesn't concern me I don't care sure let's not joining against them again not to be confused with actual support but it's better than being against so you know lately he's not really been asked publicly that I know of you know about these comments that he made 15 years ago but before he even said you know he's he's really good for making code so i haven't conclude tonight but but he said no that's then he he feels that gay people should have the same protection than everyone else in America should it's only fair and he thought it domestic partnership should be okay and I don't know if it's just because he was talking to an LGBT magazine that he was just like yeah sure it's fine whatever and then he just left the room you know what he don't record is saying what else lately like then we look again at the kind of what what specifically is from seventh on in the last year year and a half last June then he was interviewed on CNN's State of Union and he was asked she's come an odd question actually was asked how his three marriages fit into the definition of traditional marriage saying I'm for traditional marriage and his you know a typical chunk responsible that's a good point right so how do you know he was trying they were trying to ask him he said yes I was my fault and everything but he was there trying to ask him what he would say to a gay person about this you know the saying like your opposing gay marriage and sayings to the student traditional and what you've been in three marriages and his answer was I don't say anything I'm just for traditional marriage so this is like a typical Trump response to a direct question he sort of says like some strange September 2005 then you know Kim Davis who was the clerk who refused to issue marriage license after it became federally legal to have same-sex marriage and Kim Davis refused to went to jail she had became a little bit of celebrity so when he was asked about those in Kentucky when he was asked about this then again they have control boys at oh that's a messy situation he's very good not really saying anything um you know he said he said I I hated it but she's out now and you know we're a land of laws and I think she should get a different job and let the clerk's do that kind of job so so again he kind of was in favor of the fact that sort of sounded like he was a holding the decision and that she should do her job but it's really messy and I am raised both I embrace both sides of the argument and he said accounting for the sides of an argument so and very true in november 2003 talking about about gay marriage then he said he thinks he's evolving since I that's also very hot very a very popular thing you know it's like one was talking about I'm evolving so did Donald Trump now says he's bombing and he says he thinks he's a very fair person but I have them for traditional marriage I am for traditional marriage and I still think this so but the same time I've been in 2011 a couple years before that he very openly said to you know this is in Des Moines in Indiana to a nonentity publication then he just says they shouldn't be allowed to marry or did same benefits as heterosexual couples so I would however when um when when he's been specifically aspect okay would you in your administration have an LGBT person and his house which ad against its portable we even mrs. strange because he would see you just said I would want the best of the brightest sexual orientation would be meaningless so that's the best you got Trump is that he says I don't care he said that but in that sense it's interesting you know at your side I'm looking for brains and experience if the best person for the job happens to be gay when he was asked about whether company should be able to fire employees just because a guy then he he doesn't think that it should be a reason so that's kind of positive and you know the human rights campaign you know says he is very unclear on the issues then there are LGBT people who come up in support of him was one guy who tried to buy the domain name gays for drunk and it was already taken so that's and next one Xfinity person would you say the if Trump gets elected then can't you be a threat for LGBT community I mean because Trump is very flexible and it depends on the popular opinion right what he does and in a situation where the majority of in Congress is Republican do you think that he can you know make any harm flora LGBT people oh yeah you're like your neck go ahead of the GOP candidates I could release threatening to the status quo Trump Trump if he was elected president a I think he would get bored with a job and whoever's VP was going to be running the country anyway um but but trumpet is the kind of guy that would impose of what Congress wants just to oppose the GOP is not going to be that's why they're afraid of them because if he became president I'm not going to be a Republican president can be Trump president we like you know these Larry White House's being Donald Trump all the time 24 70 but even though you know he has been very flexible issue I mean once upon a time that was Democrat there's a nice image on interviews with a stinking Saturday Night Live bald man talking about you know two guys getting married and only the sort of good wages crazy people are you know the ones afraid of it so his opponents in charge especially early on especially in 2012 trying to kidnap support his liberal background but the truth is he's an old 60 something-year-old I once the top job so don't say what he needs to say but I still think would be dangerous president pletely different LGBT would be like the lease those are problems yeah again chump only cares of Trump so I think that's why at least the Republicans were probably more scared of them junkies so like Cruz County case gives current uh he's a governor and he's going the traditional path once upon a time there was could only be a into the White House if you were governor of another state it's like being any president Kasich is he's loved and hated it hot I was very much a career politician he has recently I was career not clear logic um he does have that strong evangelical Christian background it comes from the Midwest Ohio the Bible Belt area but he is generally a centrist in all issues but LGBT trying his ass in Phest economically speaking of the census foreign policy uses a centrist on economic issues in terms of helping the poor with social programs but he's got a blogger that he has had an entire career by Thomas 82 women's reproductive rights which like Ted Cruz he is very American groans as he's he's just spearheaded a bill to shut down all that is can Poole io is very much under all circumstances not good very much against LGBT rights he's you know one of the problems with American politics is because it is an indirect democracy local government often has a greater effect on people's personal lives of the Federal Elections of people tend to turn out less for local elections he's done the launch ology to fight bills for anti-discrimination laws is very much in support of a freedom of religion act and he was considered that you know someone who is going to be out of the process if he hadn't if you want a high of big and he's kind of getting up a resurgent because the rank-and-file GOP with in kc boy why do we get the high end sooner because the GOP doesn't really want Ted Cruz Oregon but in my opinion he's actually in that class of Ted Cruz's being God you 50 more hard to amend and LGBT rights man trouble for the other guys the downswing the guys combined is very much a true believer ok any questions yeah yeah yeah we'd be victims purse I next Tuesday um so Gary Thompson I don't know so basically maybe maybe now's a good time so we talked about the two nominees for Democratic position I'm one of them are going to get it and right now right now according to the delegates it's extremely close um but again the delegates who are more dedicated elegance promised delegates even they don't actually have to vote for who they know before and then there's these super delegates that out of about four thousand seven hundred delegates then seven hundred of them about seven and seven fifty are what are called super-delegates which are not really attached to anybody today when they have the Democratic nomination they get seated first and they can know who they want Democratic I mean theoretically the Democratic Party came up with this idea of the super delegates to try and be fair to grassroots activists so that the other delegates like if there were a bunch of elected officials then they wouldn't automatically on the delegates but yeah it just sounds like like so so basically right now even though the according to the delegates then Clinton and Sanders are really really close and the kind of you know getting closer and closer instead june to convention line then then still it's really unsure who's gonna be the nomination nominee out of the republicans again we have three cabinet and whoever whoever loses goes on right more or less I hope you know maybe someone else will pay up there will pick up their votes sometimes you know if you are a democratic Democrat now during the primaries then you're you're lucky you know socially for Bernie or staunchly for Hillary but as soon as one of them becomes the candid and a lot of democrats democrats will say okay i'll just go for whoever's democrats because the third party candidates tends to be so small that they're not really seen as realistic and you know if you're really Democrat then voting for a Republican cry often just seems so out of the three Democratic for the three Republican candidates that are still on the table then it's not quite clear because because Chomp has very publicly and loudly said that if he does not win the nomination and he's going to run as an independent which could bring yeah and we break the party because because he would you know he says that at least he's done some recent polls at least sixty percent sixty-eight percent of his his supporters would come with him so that would make it almost impossible for any for him or any of the Republican to win so in that sense tenets interesting time but in terms of the delegates I forgot like right now in there also really kind of split like who who is winning in the primaries but in many election cycles it's very obvious like like in February you know who's going to be the candidate and then it just sort of rubber stamping it and here not only is it not obvious but I think it's a lot of people are pretty nervous if he's saying look if you don't if you don't under my delicates I'm going to party Hillary is ahead by quite a margin in terms of delegate count apartment now but here party nomination his camp whereas it health as big concern that the Sanders got Bernie group all Trump or or possibly to like Joe Saunders whose green party or something so so again if you if you have like the idea that is it the big brothers of the Democratic Party are just still worried then what is it sounded before I mean planet realizes yeah to wax to America but you know if if Ralph Nader had fooled those that delicate pocket approach w bush probably with the pad two successive Wars one go for with Afghanistan war on the situation yeah so these little you know in some circles d'ivoire view that Ralph Nader that's green party candidate from that election did cocoa-touch account be concrete counters 492 Al Gore Bush 419 people and went to count to recount report and floor to the states presidential candidates brothers governing doesn't sound like you in addition there might was that was like out but but those small numbers have big effects of Trump tools and here's like the complete nightmare scenario going on right now if Trump tools you know a way to an occasion and there's no actual majority vote denden concert what guitar venturi system in America because no one has an actual majority that are hungry and actually take the president for a long time and words that Paul Ryan do now we're worried that the Romney with you guys Congress pic all of which are nightmare scenarios for all 7 billion people on the planet so our last two candidates are independent candidates which for some people in America they say either just independent candidates they don't even know who they are they're not really important but again the fact that sometimes even if they steal a couple of percentages of the votes then it can actually make a difference so uncharitable he's a libertarian which more or less means he believes in no government nice i think no government but his basic the basic stance of all libertarians is that the less government of the better yeah yeah yet again it's the kind of theoretical position of libertarian is no taxes and as little bit like literally as a minimal government as possible he was Garrett Johnson was the governor of New Mexico for two charms so again he said whose humanness Libertarian candidate 2012 he got it one percent of the vote doesn't sound like a lot but it was over a million votes in general in the states to be a third-party candidate it's really really hard because you have they have to fight it on the ballot in all the saints and in order to be in the debates that they have to pull over fifteen percent which is quite a lot and if they don't if they don't get in for tolls don't say that they are fifteen percent popular then they just are not flying any kind of going platinum because Americans don't read anything they just watch TV that if you're not on speed and no one even knows what your face looks like and something nose and you're you know we are really really unlikely to get elected it so it's almost impossible so for example Gary Johnson along with the next candidate Jill sign meter which is screenwriting than they were even working together now to try and change these rules so that maybe the next time then some high-def everybody could be involved in the debates to have a different kind of voice so so Gary Johnson you know ran last election cycle and lost but he you know he's been doing it again because for him you know he has no delusions of grandeur guessing he's going to win he's hoping that he this time he gets five percent and just has a platform to like tell everyone about the libertarian position right so that he could induce his party beef he announced his candidacy in January and at that time he stepped down from his as the director instantly home of a marijuana marketing company and which you know it's illegal in a number of states but just when i read i was like okay but you know if this is a kind of typical kind of position was like there shouldn't be any rules nothing to be illegal the free market should rule everything so just in a general way that's that's very human believes in February he just interpreting called Trump he said that which is just like that you know again it's more actually moving relating to gender or something but still it when I think I when I heard that I was like okay that kind of tells you what kind of guy views but it was relation you know he's he's a mountaineer he's a marathoner he's a pretty tough athletic guy and you know but he hit twice he was like not only called Trump a on a public interview but then later when he was explaining is that yeah I whole chunk  so and harm is you know in general the libertarians believe that you know human whether whether it's about gun control or women's rights or anything that the government should warn us not regulate anything in terms of LGBT rights he did in 2013 when the proposition 8 which is from California which was kind of part of the backstory to the Defense of Marriage Act part of it being overturned then he along with some other people then he he was signing something saying that he did you know believe it ain't denying marriage to people in California same-sex people in California shouldn't be at home on the books in 2008 then when there was another proposition before that that defines marriage I was a former california school so he he was white his comments in the south behind property they were yeah yeah yeah so um so yes so he's going to come out against against that and 2011 he kind of reluctantly said that that gay marriage is okay he he said that you know religious basically and again from a libertarian point of view he said religion some people of faith shouldn't have the government interfering with them so it's less of a really an endorsement than saying again kind of like drunk it's none of my business and usually able to do you want and instead but also saying that all Americans should have the same protections you know if we're going to put if we're going to have a lot like it shouldn't be fair so that's at least okay but even in 2010 so six years ago he wrote an authentic piece for the huffington post about advocating for the end of Don't Ask Don't Tell so he was saying that you know wall virtually all other significant military powers in the world have lived in their band days without anything drastic happening than America's come to the kind of times you know there's not the combat outside in the eye that I found specifically about LGBT but more or less he he seems like he's not the type i would try to overturn the marriage equality he he doesn't seem like he's basically pro but he seems like a safe neutral Caracappa did that we just keep his hands off cuz that's very libertarian the thing about period on stuff does the Libertarian Party their their patron saints are Ron and Rand Paul who what ronalyn rainbow before any ball was Kentucky Senator Rand Paul he was an actual record registered Republican and Ron Paul was always considered kind of a libertarian by definition publicly there was a ship i capable libertarian party around 2007-2008 when grandpa actually pivoted against sort of the LGBT community not necessarily for any other reason that item C because he also pivoted kind of against racial issues at the time as well but he made that occasion and it seemed like blueberry party kinda frac should have been because Jesse mature used to be a libertarian until they move bit too far consider the right so I think I think Gary Johnson right now is traveling back to the heart of what Libertarian Party is which is small government everything should be no one should pay taxes let the roads ballpark it's all kind of like you stuck me but at least he's a bit of a purist and Jill Stein he's she's great party and and she what the panel was saying i would say that they're been to my lifetime the chief candidates their party candidates that really got a lot of press one was before anyone in this room was probably board which was Anderson from of the Carter his their party candidate during Jimmy Carter and I feel his first name at the problem break we got a lot press because he was kind of libertarian look more on the left side libertarian and of course the biggest one was a trois bro he basically just financed his billionaire he just bought all the Aragon he wanted and he was the first that actually got on the debate stage by another field day was making fun so so third parties and then the third one of course we didn't make a debate with certain kind of attention was Ralph Nader because Ralph Nader was really with no regrets time al Jill Stein who is the same part is David Green Party I actually like her a lot if she were Bible she probably would be my candidate because she has she's a few doctors practicing out position and she deals with internal medicine very much women's rights cases from a grassroots level forever from the very very beginning especially during her to building three men days when hiv/aids was happening she was there until in terms of all her other policies economics foreign policy those who sort of pale to what his mind a tissue next LGBT which is green energy and she is running like your Johnson you're no illusion that she will get a nomination but her platform is basically rebuilding infrastructure new new from sort of modified version of the yellow problem post impression period of PR and renewable energy settle she's a very much consistent on that message she ran before 2012 and 400 committee to run this time but she actually got more votes to the highest number moves for candidacy during that period rendering candidates michelle bachman all the others she got half a million goes and reading party itself actually does have built so if she gets enough under tension enough attention they they have their own convention they have their own belly now she could theoretically and as Ralph Nader be a viable third-party Kennedy right now she's got the majority of their there who won't you actually do I eternai green right and he's running and she is number one there's an insurgency guy has come about it he's got maybe two of the four or five of the delegates she got like 15 so so I actually am I can be her campaign okay i just realized that i forgot to say something but it makes me if when I hurt was reading this about other than it made me curious what Hal Berney stands on it and I magically both as both an epidemic reddish candidates they probably both would agree to this but it was just what i was looking at what what hillary was promising you know it's like when i became president I will and she she said that she or shall not only signing the Quality Act but that she would cut off federal funding for adoption agencies that refused same-sex couples that she would address the crisis transphobic volatile ins and to cap expenses for HIV and AIDS drugs and the reason why that's think because a lot of the other discussion especially about the Republican candidates is just the discussion focuses on gay marriage you know whether your a4a whether you are against it but you want to change it and it just seemed like at least for Hillary then and then she hasn't much more kind of comprehensive it's not only looking at marriage rights as the end-all and be-all to everything she's looking an adoption rights just looking at transfer the trends transphobia and transgender rights and also at kind of hiv/aids awareness treatment and I mean is it similar creatures also that's such partition with market right now so for me in terms of his and he's very possible especially like last game in your country his focus has been on Strictly as in defense of marriage marriage equality he hasn't dealt into health care until recently I he was an action to what Hilary's plan was because he tied it to complete restructuring of Obamacare to single-payer but he is 19 it\u00eds best illegitimate weakness against you not have he doesn't have a specific rifle back platform on Bourbon terminada Germany no plans like Dover done so she is reality is in rehab trafford far as all the other characters this theatrical production costs interment resident boy probably Hillary message it has shown dr. normal which her record is discovers actual legitimate policy that she's trying to put forth for including falls yeah okay those are the candidates um three how many any questions or hot items um so so okay we've got candidates so now what is the current situation for LGBT motors and organizations for me I was being Miss America three three basic issues one is that kind of relates to everybody but I thought we talked about it a little bit is looking at at kind of voter suppression and and how does this or how does this affect LGBT community also kind of looking at which relates to voter turnout so maybe we can just started that so in relationship reporters person for so can you can you more or less explain what we talked about for talking about birds person well one of the results of this is gone back to for Obama 2004 election Jim Carrey was running for president there's a lot of congressional redistricting union you see the result of a Congress that has very small communities represented by special interests of the far right but in terms of popularity popularity Padma growth is that really supported the past 25 years of the party districting change that now to fight you also to support this new district a lot of states have changed quotables sean so right registrations if all these ridiculous some qualifications that needs you to vote especially in the southern and Rust Belt states in terms of identity all in the mena fighting for fraud really exist as probable cause major problem by the people wanted to get any laws in place right now so Jill Stein is going to be in South Carolina this month in South Carolina North Carolina this is something news doesn't talk about it is creating a problem for LGBT for transgender people transitional color because they don't have a proper ID or what they were playing really give naive his knee is their primary identity because people forget me as I tell you that because I eagle because another segue voter suppression right basically what it is is a way to keep sort of traditionally democratic voting blocs I didn't from having easy access to vote and a lot of this happened when unfortunately under Obama cracked 2014 election a lot of these laws are changed summer still can the state level or federal level but others are Puckett up in Texas will be healthy little suppression volatile successfully challenged first North Carolina South Carolina Pennsylvania which is a dark horse date a lot of them okay so and so it used to be easier to register to vote and now because they're demanding like more robust documentation then there's a lot of people again particularly for transgender community where it's very difficult so and then so so maybe this is particularly affecting transgender community people who color people important two moons will not automatically have the driver's license and the other southern states do hit the hardest because you know you've been retired for 40 years to drive during that time versus it was a lot of people over the age of 72 don't have a driver's license or social security card with three documents in North Carolina North Carolina he used to be the developers metal loggers up to get a state ID right so so half how do you think that is going to organ how would that affect voter turnout emissivity able to give me how to be to go to like a combination between the voter suppression but also the situation that's going on now with the candidates doing this is going to bring more people out or are people fighting to register or are they just giving up a nice table well two things in North Carolina few things are some particular in North Carolina amongst black use to the black middle class why elderly the turnout is actually higher because of the traditional method of Senator black voter registration was the Baptist Church very much at one time your mommy's other people I ought to is that that is not translated to homeless young kids especially not with the Raleigh strawberry letter more out the smaller community Greensboro and ash world which are kind of like shut up  the tiny places those communities so how about all the way you would call that kind of voting age population so so in general I don't know if you guys know about how many people folks like them in the last last decade usually the turnout is about fifty percent and during the 60s it rose to 70 the sixty percent and in the night the highest usually it was was in the 1890s where it was seventy-five percent but no probably globally there's a whole thing with you know panic voter apathy and people not coming out promotions so I just wonder if it's still you have like your according to the census why can say you're voting age population but then even out of the out of that voting age population there's only a certain number of people who can or want to register the moment because you have to be registered to vote before they don't certain time before voting you can't just at the last minute I'm going to go fold so do you think in in this election maybe is the one issue about what people turning out spoke is is whether they can or not but the other issues whether they want to or not do you think that that now because of Bernie or Hillary doing that because o we have marriage equality so there's no reason to go turn out to vote do you think there's any issues or any candidates that are going to either make people say for many people I think it's actually think this will be a robust turnout because this is the 16 campaign is actually my life I actually too nervous about because candidates are so far apart on so many issues they're very version of Santa social justice there's Hillary's the religious movement there's me we're just angry and we're going to vote for Trump moving so so I think a lot of these smaller grassroot groups are galvanized LGBT community in particular I'm here discussing the other night my sense is this the first time you have a better this provided on a candidate and it is a big divide as a divided young social life gender lines and identification lines and it's very very very obvious to our LGBT people Hillary 25 education all behind my wife LD friends like Bernie my presence of color husband Prince friends are all behind the assistant read my facebook feed you know why are you yeah but it's a pretty and it's not just within the LGBT it's just the community at large that graphic is pretty start on the Democratic side and on the one there is a separate people were really rallied behind Trump taste of Erica back Miami woman an old Jewish guy in the White House go back to the old ways or it's recognizable strong fighter that you are going to you in care of us the ones who are yelling fighting it and they will turn up turn out so i actually think because of the passion and because so much is in motion a estate this is one of many things about the selection so us got humanity social issues are acting level words approaching stability but the feelings was in the country are so divided and was so angry about everything I think the motor out will be better people but to me people with their emotions of the day so I work I don't want a bunch of anger guys after seeing from hotel to divide before going to be okay um I guess we have many like 10 minutes um so talking about about about where the current situation is with ltp voters who might both like if it's possible i'll be organizations particularly in the last election cycle they were very very very vocal and now they seem to have kind of quite a doubt the human rights campaign even before the primary server when the university Hillary shiny which is very unusual but apart from users there's some and she does have some endorsements but apart from that some of the more one thing hardcore activist groups they just seem like they've kind of gone on on silent do you have like what do you think about that or for why dangerous Enid behind feature see I think I think your rights commission did campaign behind are actually silence though because they got vilified by Bernie Sanders after supporter they came up to her they were called sellout celebrities talk about the lively think reaction to their support her silenced a lot of developers making out very girly we need support her but their detractors came out very strong and I felt you know this kind of don't know if any was actually trying to state up and do we think I think there is a sort of come here with traditional supporters of the classes and because of that there was a time the smaller especially with what it was all about and Vince acquired pro and con were always there what's the first time not that I I'm so how about legendary cool um apart from the parking LGBT organizations there also are some kind of order just for example gays for Trump I think you also said that there's an African Americans for trouble you just yet but stuff like you know Caitlyn Jenner again given Jenner is come up for Ted Cruz um way cool yeah yeah I mean it's hard to imagine you but still um I mean I guess I'm just saying the question with thinking about possibility that there can be you know the lesbian attack group that's behind Hillary comes in and the gays for Trump is this just like another another thing that's showing how to buy the community is or or has it always been divided and now it's just getting more publicity and people are are are seeing more why don't we talk about it what a lovable below the surface if you were awake mantis fighting vicarage unified as any other but traditionally when it came time these organizations got behind they hate to get behind always era compromise we fight this what we want five another round this time I think tons their big-ticket items obvious about it residential level the danger in behind the wrong person has sort of made some of the other organizations that would traditionally be there so I said okay and you push you suspect on the log cabin is still football can be Republicans think about that remember how I said then behind blush 12 radians yeah well because they're Republicans that they believe that Republicans should be inclusive of LGBT so in Caitlyn Jenner it is a member of the Log Cabin Republicans person and they're very very happy is it racist their disability 100,000% so the last areas like paper talk to the candidates more or less talked about kind of voters may be where they where they might be turning out or or who they're supporting but actually looking at the current political situation one is actually at stake in this election cycle for LGBT people how to get here and where are we going can you talk a bit about the kind of going backwards is looking at the midterm election and how what happened in the midterm elections could affect have affected LGBT issues for example some of the treatments that's had a knock-on effect but freedom of religion x-trans bathroom laws well yes like I said this reference always help Thomas terms that are all texts local and and this is very true nature and you like your governor is you and your state representatives there are people that are affected from august to make a lot of it affects every day LA LGBT issues it's really a religion for economic issues and south offers you know fight against the michigan governor she goes completely disbanding local governments that's why we have this putt Michigan water situation local authority aventis got the home test I think the more i think about LGBT issues women and trans issues particularly I think this election has probably greater effective is more stable especially because of the women's health issues and the trans issues and my fear is that because those are sort of like secondary issues specialist valency community at large it will have an adverse effect on all the communities that are there outfit like like trans bullying is not something that should be an issue but because of all these local elections of these laws have been changed because of the low turnout during the terms and because of the wrong pathetic of the people of many states it's becoming an issue and that's kind of you know it's the thing that that bothers me a lot about this election American continuous out of here because of those 2014 elections you know the economic issues have a lot further if gotten more load new democratic oppressive government so it is an issue kind of to be fine on us look into polish politics that's why you're here up here you know how many people stay home the people who didn't get out there oh I know especially more soggy and some people like what the hell is going on how could this have happened the number of people who drove it in factored in the Georgian code is awesome George of the country okay Jerry of the words long so you know governance America's likes to build with some fun active participation participated in four presidential campaigns you know twice for Clinton one time I was in service and precarious participated I was volunteering for me to run a 2008 so I left keep going back and forth between here and there so you know I think politics include specification pretty seriously it does affect or not okay so I'm looking looking at the next four years let's assume that these third party cannons are not going to win and then we let you know the possibility that Trump would be viable for party candidate or if it's just again normally it's between Democrats and Republicans back what kinds of apart from the candidates kind of putting into action their plan what other kinds of bigger issues is the president of the next four years going to be dealing with in terms of LGBT issues particularly thinking about you know if you talk a little bit about about Supreme Court and the Equality the Equality Act well now justice on the Supreme Court so they don't get Obama this guy on the Supreme Court was pretty conservative god well thanks to the next presidential is going to get you sitting Supreme Court's life life is it get someone who's like Scalia like that all these cases right now and before Supreme Court that affect transgender LGBT women's rights marriage equality get tax adoption or a whole list of kind of quiet LGBT issues back watch Supreme Court that could have that affects again its first all that stuff that's very much that's very much at stake for the LGBT community something that is very dirty under-represented is refugees days LGBT people people are being the Syrian or grin or give the Middle Eastern groups are being vilified and what your LGBT it's even worse those issues also might be things affected by the next city president so there's a lot of stuff at stake but its own dirty nuts and bolts politics it's not sexy big money how much yes yeah but but those are the things actually that the day-to-day life people okay um you guys are very patient with an hour and a half and a hot room doesn't anybody have is for me um and we have any questions comments is that giving me to put you to sleep or we covered everything I'd like to say Hillary Clinton he thinks that the doomsday scenario is going to happen where where no no candidate gets and I mean to say that like you said you had to go back this guy dreams the Constitution just to make sure he knows on a daily basis what is that so we have to read the Constitution again to to check what would happen if nobody gets enough votes once again in most other countries you know Poland England oh um you know Italy a latke musics like it's representational problem call its experience you know winner takes all but what happens if you have no wall and so that's the kind of situation talk about is that there is this there is actually a strong possibility that no one would win and what happens if no one wins what happens is and that President does not have to be one of the candidates it would be then and that's why right now the speaker the house could say I'm going to be the president and that's why he actually came out of Tober because it I definitely definitely definitely definitely definitely probably not like you yeah so you think you know and someone suddenly comes out because i'm totally not interested in a position to thank you worried sorry there's no other questions thank you very much", "r9lSIzMD1GA": "mead is the oldest beverage known to alcoholic beverage known to man there are different stories that have been used to describe its origin probably some some people in Africa walking around found a hollowed-out tree with some with some honey that after a rain and maybe they decided to get a drink and they got a little a little hammered on it and figure out hey I love this stuff you know then you know through the through the ages honey was a more rare commodity a lot of times that was used as a sweetener for nobility you know through the Middle Ages and that kind of thing today we purposely farm and move these around and that kind of thing so that we get particular varietal honey's", "oH9O2OfQ2lY": "[Music] my name is Hugh in this video I'll be showing you how to make code which is also called shoemakers hand wax the recipe we're using today is one for white wax which uses a mixture of rosin beeswax and teller combine the wax and rosin in the bowl and meld it in the oven at 150 degrees for about 30 minutes check on the mix every 10 minutes or so and once it's melted take it out of the element and to that I'm adding the tip of the spoon worth of tallow it's all a bit sticky from the earlier batch I don't have the Taliban I'm putting it in the oven because it's at such a low melting point that it will just do a straight through and then we're gonna stir this to make sure it's mixed then pour it into a bucket of water which my version of lukewarm is 30 degrees just measured it with the thermometer before we started videoing we're basically knead it until it's cool enough and then that is the hand wax that we use for our true making and purse making in things so I think we're ready to pour [Music] and now it's essentially molten in the middle but it'll harden on the outside as it cools and slightly warmer than the last batch I think it's sticking to me a little more so it'll stick to your bedroom if it's too hot it'll stick to your lots and then as it cools and they keep wetting your hands to cool them I call them enough so it doesn't stick that's what doesn't burn so I want to be trying to need it but also trying to not have it stick to me which can be tricky I like to need it between my arms because it helps to feel where there might be crystals forming and squish them out [Music] so I'm just gonna keep doing this and it's gonna get more and more yellow as it gets cooler eventually the whole thing will be in less uniform like the yellow color and it won't have any of the tiny little lumps that you can kind of see forming in there because as it's cooling I'm gonna keep squashing them out between my palms until it's uniform and fully cool at that point you're breaking into some lumps and then that is our code so it's probably another three or four minutes of doing this [Music] [Music]", "f68Ocw_RedI": "on Willard Rankine on vulajin onboarding

protonic pressure", "zKLame2khFE": "okay welcome Alejandro good morning everyone when Ozias excited to be here I meant a contemptuous Erica yeah let's talk about bugs and how do I like to use the word managed because people who say how can I kill it and the idea is that remember bugs are being here on earth millions of years before us so they know how to survive like there is the Couture woman hear me Alejandro co-movement are generally mean are los insectos he requests okay siempre I get an error in cuenta que tous he said to be near on primero que nosotros he's having como como sobre here so yeah I'm ready to share the screen if possible or something like that yes you can do it alright for this so thanks for the invitation I am on the handle the poster among entomology entomologist by training so I work for University of California I'm located in the salad bowl of the world and I primarily work with lettuce and cold crops but IPM is something that I'm passionate about when OSI years ago me numbers 100 postage oh so you mean tomorrow insectos story in Salinas in salah el mundo y este trajo rectum ethically Chua eco cruciferous he most of them I'm anything there are a class porque soon Asuna system with the muy interesante game you chop up goes well not it's really good to talk about IPM so let's jump it so i titled my my presentation as IBM our Garnon so from concept to action so super monster management there are plans through Hardeen there's a rune of concept hasta run meant a hacer lo and I want to know that that this is I borrowed this presentation from from caring he's at UC IPM program and I added some slice as well but this is a really good presentation and and I think you guys can we we can spark some discussion so it's they pull a carry the parameter IPM them at the meet in less time a per-person esta present us yummy Johanna que podamos the cootie receptor IPM flower commerce the present assume so plan damage what we concerned about bugs and pests and let's call it pass something that II it make a worry about so we'll worry about the pass why because we're losing money our products it's awful or it is something that we consider it's it's bad but it's just as a human perspective okay so the no plan sorry okay LOL k un concepto del hombre crayon repent econ\u00f3mico odet Emma del medio ambiente donde \u00e9l siempre vemos supuestamente womb una pelea in Australian arrow or in most ability to act upon a Muslim Holly so what happened is that though the pass will go after our crops our you know roses our bushes or whatever we have in the car and and but they're gonna do this damaged so the the something that is visually that we're gonna recognize that it's something that we're losing or something that is that we don't it's not intended to me so the ideas is they're living organisms like insects rodents microbes and even snails and slugs they're gonna eat you know they're gonna damage our plants in our garden and there is also nonliving what we call abiotic factors like when you over water and you know you got to stress the plan there is there is some lack of nutrients there's some toxicities and with fertilizers and things like that or herbicides or if you are chopping or mowing something and you do the mechanical here so there's two big does this to be groups about what be  call damage so instead from the realm

on your mechanical system in equator ok there mrs. Olav grupos guessing yes is there is only there is this these two big groups of organisms that will go after damaged our plants so what can we find in our garden we again will talk about pathogens in vertebrates will be the bugs the vertebrates will be the rodents in in in the weeds will be also present as well and they can be considered as living forms so no Suhani vamos a Matar comida hemo no Pato she knows Lawson vertebras como los insectos los vertebra horas y la Miles's o la mala here VA's Tammy bajas eleven Ostrow in a socially so BB sometimes you're gonna get thrown off about well let me back up what happened is now that we have some damage because something happened we would like to know what is going on so the first thing the we and this is one of the pillars for IPM is that you want to know the culprit so see tenemos see the memo son Daniel what was the pasando que no estoy esperando Hardeen simply the Democrat que lo que so good partly in a they are the management in our planner says he kept our demos open our mass importantes in the agnostic oh so education okay stock okay locusts Amazon but the problem is that some of it most of the times the the damage will look alike so you can have fertilizer burn herbicide damage and even a pathogen damage that looks kind of like similar so that's gonna complicate ourselves to do this I need but we have to because if not you're gonna treat the fertilize burn as a plant pathogen and it never is gonna get better so then no por ejemplo see can see this is a camera it's a gotta go comfort isn't known for its on the net

forest you do huh so I say it's the state line you carry motion a photo play set us up for a field possess all poor poor information suppose it cuts output it is yes it does this they mimic a starter consciente him okay edu car quiet little problema what is it reasonably so we have to actually go back in in and take a look and see what see what's there what who's the culprit so I can I already said that and it's it's good to reinforce eyes this but diagnosing the problem it could be difficult you know it's it I mean you don't need a bunch of books you just need to know what are the available resources in the ideas that you want to get fancy get a specialized and get another species level but I think knowing what it what is it in terms of groups in terms of you know within those groups if they're a living or abiotic I think you're in the right track so there's no way most cannot know saying solo quiero saber colony pace across a very specific emetic question polemic encontrado OPM ostomy internal clara de que mucho free course of the eponymous he whose RS offer courses por lo menos aware see you soon daniel casaba room organic move evo Osasuna casa offer for mechanical so again poor cultural practices water pruning who will credit predisposed the plans you get infested with with with would pass you know and the damage can be due for several causes so sometimes you the tree get injured and then the pests will come so if you treat the injure the mechanical injured the parents will start phasing out and then the idea is that oh no the pests are here you see they're eating mind or they're feeding on my tree well but it might be something there might be an underlying condition like the stress that it's making that tree really really likable in the eyes of the and then we have to confirm it this is important we have to confirm what is the cost so what's the primary origin origin before doing any tree so the level in difficulty is division pero like there cases in Paso necesario para para ser el tratamiento hey record RK nani seriamente por que vemos insect o seminar Baldwin una planta me chuga me roses is it significant okay an insect or separate probably meant a I owned on your physical wire only straight for poor Mucha agua que est\u00e1 siendo que la planta say uh a pretty similar policy centers so about diagnosing damaged by insects so we have this new group of insects so one they have the chewing mouthparts and the other they have piercing sucking we're going to talk about Chuy Mars pearl first Chumash / basically they have this mandibles and what they're gonna do with the mandibles like us they're gonna you know basically do holes on the leaves and you can see in the picture on the second picture at the bar and you see all this like cutting through the leaves and things like so Wow what could be a chewing what would be an insect that has a treemap part like beetles in general all caterpillars grasshoppers earwigs so it's important because if you see these holes you can start recognize and say oh okay it might be a chewing an insect that has a chewing mouth part so the helper a common sort of problem and diagnostic oh they lost daniels the name was Dora poison centers los que tienen este mastica or but it's a vaca Kong common Ebola case uh mastica horas or no suction ahora solo que tienen como ha

the second portion of the of the insects that give they came managed to do some damage on your on your on your garden is the piercing sucking mouthparts so basically they have this needle-like mouth part they're all gonna stick it into so I call them little vampires and they're basically gonna take out the blood of the plan and they're gonna scream basically everything that it's not nutritious and guess what everything that is not the Tricia's from the planets the sugars so in examples of those guys will be a fits leafhoppers mealybugs scales true bugs and white flies in it's a photo group

here with my pointer this is the caterpillar one them you might have seen in the past this a wig and this is a weevil eating and chewing you know sometimes in the roses underneath in the soil there could be the grubs there the caterpillars for well they're not technically caterpillars are grub but if you can say that it is a similar between caterpillars and this guys as well and they've got the grasshoppers gonna chew it up and make some calls at your and any find that you have enough in the murder so the Nostromo so poco lo siento como esta hablando de arriba con me con con este camino stay

here are the aphids on the top left scales we call it armor because they're a little bit tougher they have this protection and soft gales there they don't have that protection so it's basically what they cover with that's the difference between armor and soft mealybugs they're really prefer and why dish and then why flash the beautiful white flies and leaf hoppers as well and remember all these have the piercing sucking mouth part that's Segundo grupo algunos ejemplos con estos star fotos de Muro Safi osaka in particular la says the commissary Estella's comas no commas stay Doris's kamaswami

our by our homes and the corners and we have so ants ants will go after the sugar that the scales and the mealybugs would worry street so they guard they protect them because they harvest answered really smart so they know that they are getting this benefit from from this soft body piercing sucking insects so they harvest the sugar and they they they bring it back to that's why if you have a lemon tree and it has scales and a bunch other you know mealybugs they would be also ants and what happened with ants and i think we want to talk about that but ants also protect this past from being attacked by parasitoids by beneficials so it's our land eau de las familias owe me a cinnamon roll muy importante he has protecting a lot of spaces they pop Lando's esta esta Clara's cake a pinnings

should the the the the answer here you see the street the ends and you keep treating the ants in your lemon tree and you never pay attention to the scales and in the melee bugs in the ants will come and will come and will come and it will be a never-ending process but if you treat the scales if you treat the mealy bugs in when I'm when I when I mean by treating it's pruning power washing using detergents in a bottle there's things that are really soft and beneficial I mean mal as handful in our environment you're gonna see the hands going to somewhere else because the actual organisms that produced the sugar are not there anymore so you see them sometimes there's two different causes or different causes that you need to be aware in order to manage something that it could be you know

sometimes you can find so many things oh my god I cannot tell you so many things they'll say that you can use to manage pests you have to please I encourage you to trust science we as a scientist our

advisors a que nuestro trabajo es ayudar a la cama Nia a probe a resting for Monsieur so let's talk about IPM okay we got all this yeah sure IPM IPA might be on sustainable agriculture but sure IPM is one of the most used terms right now and let's let's get fancy and define it so IPM integrated pest management based on the National Coalition a type ent this guys got together at the national level they sit down and say let's come up with the concept of our IP n so in 94 this group of people researchers to stakeholders they did they get together and they come up with this and I really like that because I've been exposed to probably what 10 15 concepts of of IBM and you can find it if you google right now IPM you're gonna have so many but this is the one that I like and I want to read it I'll read aloud to you IPM is a sustainable approach sustainable the means is gonna this is for the long run this is now for tomorrow now for the day after tomorrow this is for our grandkids for four generations to come and the approach is to manage impasse and I should have highlight this should have underlined this combining biological cultural physical and chemical I'm not being bought by Monsanto I'm not being bought by Syngenta I'm not being bald but anybody nobody pays me anything but the true IPM and this is what I'd like to stress to everybody you can disagree with me you can harm right now and leave the training that's right but IPM is that combination the combination of biological cultural and physical and chemical controls if you just do biological you're not doing a true IPM because you are missing how doing cultural physical control and maybe if you need to you they're assuming so chemic up and look at the order the order is important because what happen is chemical is your last resource so you have to deploy everything before you get to pull the trigger and say I have to spray something in my crop and also so expensive so you have to think about that and what comes next it's what put the cherry on top of the ash wave then minimize it Konami comes first because if we are in agriculture and we don't think I'm culture is a business why we do in agriculture sure somebody will tell me you know security you guys were talking about that food security and things like that shorter I understand that but agriculture is a business and in some of the other countries it will be for self-sustained it's it's also considered a business so because you've done a locust grasshopper if infestation comes in why powered you're an African farmer do you depend on that your economic being impacted sure you're not selling things to Costco or Walmart because that's for you but it's an economic impact when you lost your crop so in day and after that will be the health in the environment so I really like this one I just wanna live in it there you we can spot some discussion after that we can go back and forth but I like to do it that and then profit professor Perry go back in 96 he ambition I know I a towel under my neck we take our plan us like they say que quiero poner el concepto Eliseo nacional de magie from grupo de Mesilla horas un grupo de de Abril

have this is the pest losses river and you build the IPM program in your garden in your in your crop you have all these different key stones and different pillars basically key stones are the information the research that we have and in the pillars are the tactics that we don't implement so professor Peggy go in Iowa tomorrow mula bandha sido VCO noil in manifest error class como

apologize sir I got excited and I've been drawing some lines in there and I don't know how to make them disappear but it's okay alright so a colleague of mine in university California proposed this beautiful comprehensive concept above IPM I'm not gonna talk about it because if we talk about this uh we're gonna spend some oh that's not mean maybe it's somebody else because another line just appeared okay maybe I'm being hijacked that's alright and in this is a bit it is a beautiful concept about IPM and the idea is that IPM it's it's it's a more comprehensive so here you can see the environmental safety as one of the Rings within IPM consumer perspective the seller the producer the economic viability and the social aspect about IPM that hasn't been talked about we talked about yeah combining combining combining and using different approaches but there is more to IPM that we really need to understand so my colleague Surendra Dhara he was able to conceptualize this and I encourage you to find that out he has really good blogs about this and talk about all these concepts and nevermind I think there are plus is no person it's not one more list he goes I'll go okay Katina muchos conceptus so she also said to traditional can Emma Streisand a combination manejo be logic Oh cultural fisico key my code oh pero el mucho m\u00e1s detr\u00e1s de tous consoles me Mike

Unidos al concept otra vez non je parlais concept Ollie's RSO again just to recap what it's IPM everything you start with correct pest identification correct based identification it's a key you can combine several different types as I said before cocoa tree practices biological control mechanical physical control and also use the pesticides and basically hopefully the ideas that you gonna use the least toxic if necessary again right so and you want to protect people passing in the wildlife and so now kasemir their plan us but our resume in a lock or rectification Delap lava is SNP Lamas important solo que para comenzar a Sartoris Rio la combination this year the diferentes stay people say money hole is important at I mean when man Hobart oral manifold Akiko they because when I hope mechanical is a necesita that means a new so they keep me cousin PCCs este pensando simple o menos toxic of protection and they understand my kotas here may be a determined so the idea is that you can check regularly in the landscape for pass in this case will be your partner right you want to check you know what the common areas that you garden has maybe under the shade of the tree or by you know the corners of your elevated beds or things like that so this is an example like around the house what happened you try to find those or your challenging spots and then you can see what the problems are so you know by the side of the house and then underneath the tree and by the bushes the roses and then under the mulch and maybe on the front of your house it is close by tough the front wall and then your tree over there so you really want to you know know your environment around your gardener around your house or around wherever you are that you wanted to do an integrated pest management approach so there's no like this idiotic a window say a consciente be in control estos is the area problematic --is independent a case en la casa I mean I went to went to stay in to par Solano reacted to persevere SI tiene problemas de Casas and now surah la casa is the mulch is dying Rosa so a lot of all kissed and frankly those are Mustafa some focus of podium namely friend el problema Cesar is problematical para ciertos incentive the flowers a cave on a seated position it will be revealed a we have some knowledge when we go and buy some of this plants that we might ask about resistance so some of these varieties some bushes on you know ornamentals they might have some buy already already built in in to us as a planet so the ideas that if we can if we can have that that will be amazing because what it creates is that these are not as palatable to the insect to the pests as a regular variety and and again these are not GMOs these are basically made like conventional read varieties that you can find it and for example a good shout out for the native plants in California would have a sweet array of native plants and you're thinking about putting some of the corners and do some about that think about natives because they are really resilient they're really they're adapted to here and it will be able to support and overcome any pest issues you know in the numbers okay ciertas but here is a plant a saying a monumentally for example o kb n ng akan resistencia ciertas SEL taught classes here toes toes insect overseer que estan di pony blaze poder Prem you teri prover comprar

poner a Mon Akina Marvolo you are gusto poor Volvo Sierra deputies arrest a plaintiff ateva California love Katie Lockhart so again go through practices a good example is long I mean the the grass so prep proper fertilization proper irrigation improper mowing height will actually help you to produce the amount of weeds the amount of you know grubs and things like that so this is a really good example about doing physical improper control helps you to avoid spraying chemicals and ptosis one example or the Monica cultura listen o la oferta Lisa lo depandi agua de la Movida correcta este lo Corte al al Torah correcta si de que renew cos la cantidad a insecto caca stem present a socket into past o y por conciliate Amos Otis our menos pesty CEA's paruppu LED are co-hosting so a hello or gonna throw it Caracas here comer este lado pruning pruning is also important I mean sure you can say I just cut I just got it in toss amount well sometimes you better read a little bit about it when to prune how to prune how to do the cut I'm not an expert on that but I encourage you to go and find out those resources there planing about that because basically if you I'm not doing the pruning in the in the ideal conditions you're gonna be you know basically attracting you know pathogens and pests to your tree or your brush they know Nepal muy importante para hacer la I'm AmeriCorps vechta que saber cuando Poddar como poder el tipo el corte po por que todo ESO influye to pay a volver we attract IVA el \u00e1rbol o lr gusto este para que venga informaci\u00f3n so cosas que puede you have to our early problems all there go through practices and this is the most question I also serve the community in the Salinas Valley and like you guys I got so many citizens that call me and say Alejandro I have this beetle how can I kill it why should i spray and I'll say oh wait a minute have you considered to pick it up by hand have you considered to use power washes where you hoe or using a power wash have you consider users shop vacuum mbaku mana before you spray anything and a hundred percent of the people so far tell me I told me oh no I haven't considered that I was thinking about going to hook Lowe's and Home Depot buy something at spray I and I encourage them to use something different not chemical wise and this is the this is one of the the slides that I want to emphasize so ena will garner well if you have a hundred acres that will be difficult right but even in 100 acres now the growers are creating this vacuum mounted in tractors that they can suck up all the bugs they're in there so they're doing physical control before a spray and believe it or not that's how some of the strawberries him and some of the coke crops are being used right now industrial vacuums that we have in the side I don't have a picture about it but you can I mean you can go away or you can find some pictures in the web for sure so again I'll let it's a mink the first question is how can I spray this yes and now I know I'm really trying on understand the caterpillars and oh yeah I found this this frame is spray I'll say okay all right sure you can spray but can you pick it up by hand okay you power wash with detergents can you use a shop vacuum is buggy man up is it it possible so I'll leave you that idea there I think that's the best way to manage pests and I highly recommend it before pulling the trigger practical delicate your element is siempre my comiendo cava QC Rolla likely until when I loss unless you are now saying by a California anybody a Salinas he told mundo Miyama epidemic on frozen alejandro que puedo aplicar quiero un kimiko para matar esto yo si le preguntan lo puedes lo puedo hair con la mano puede es la bar to plantas con Alta presion yomu no detergent a

nice it is here in la cosa and then on top of that we have IOU for guys I love this guy's a promoting biological control the Salinas Valley right now in letters we use these guys in our favor to reduce pest population so basically what happened is predators and parasitoids go after the pass and then reduce their populations and you have several examples on that slide but basically bass guys are the good guys and we have to promote this guy so the idea is that we should be aware of them in their press control you don't go as soon as I started coming my bus you know a stunt that used to

in lace wings they'll need polling they need nectar to survive so thinking about inter planning insectary plants so flowering plants that provides these flowers who a nectar and pollen will give you better chances to attract so it's like you putting the airport for this guy's to land into your property to land into your honor so it's a good practice this is what I talk to the growers that if you put this plants the good guys woke up right and and and the the bottom message is if you have to use insecticide please there's a lot of research to say which ones are though you know they're the toxicity is the lowest to the beneficial so combining that information helps you get the best decision make the best decision so then our line is protocol is to still system unit really knows no bueno

if you have to use the pesticides if you see you went through all that list of tactics that we discuss and you decided to use a pesticide please consider that there is something really really toxic to

hear me okay all right good hi guys this is Carlo with little mess of our day I hope everyone's doing well and enjoyed the presentation so far so I'm going to go over a really quick recipe that you can do that home to do a spray for your garden so this is not a pesticide but more of a repellant spray that you can use before you start going into chemical pesticides always try to do the least harmful one first if you can so I'm going to go over the ingredients and tools that you need and oneth escuchas Odyssey my kitchen hey I'm sorry so lucky conductor you can do a km look give a bleep I that composite una pregunta es su casa some principalmente un repellant insecto algo que vai uri we are killing an insect dose or impure Halloween sector piece M IND to her the insect okay son you know someone over at Atlanta to save a moi Posada without allowing very entail Obama means you know okay so I'm gonna go over some of the tools and ingredients will do it so one second oh so first you need a container or the solution that you're making we need an empty spray bottle a small strainer a spoon a funnel and then the ingredients that you need are some water a little bit of biodegradable soap onions garlic and pepper powder or any hot pepper powder you can even use flakes if you want to entonces lo que Carlos tastic and okay so la da Mientus primero o el contenido or un Rossi adore a color or UNM Budo una pajara un cuchillo lillahi ingredients assume Ajo Savoia although the Chile picante have on the same year they gravely eat our okay so we're gonna begin cutting up some ingredients so all these ingredients are stuffed you can easily get from the market or you may already have at home so usually I would recommend doing small amounts of everything and diluting this solution that way it's not too strong and it won't harm your plants as easily so with this onion it's pretty large so I'm going to go ahead and cut it in half and I'm probably gonna use about a quarter of this so I'm going to cut this in half too I'm cutting it in pretty small pieces don't sail okay Carla come in tava Iraqi simple recomienda comments are proceeding toast em then no poniendo

add that no messy okay so I add about half a spoon of cayenne pepper Carlos tarragon dole Lomita de una cuchara they el polvo a Chile picante Elementor I also cut a little bit of the biodegradable soap so you only need to put a spoon or two into the solution are you 30 handles have one beer they gravely nobody how on in silicon and minotaurs reconnect Anthea I gotcha Rito silicone bonus the soap actually helps the solution stick to the leaves and it'll also help suffocate any of the bad insects that you may have you know you're just going to add some water oh now you can share me yes I'm

Palin is a pagan no second peg ellos la casa you a are you a mucho a kilo insectos safe am allowed so once you have everything mixed I would cover it really well and you can put it in your fridge or at room temperature either or is fine but I would leave it soaking for about a day or so or overnight and then after you're done soaking you just need to use your funnel for your bottle and then a strainer and you're just gonna strain the liquid so cuddle oh look at that you can do it it came we don't play the high definitely feel a lot a COC element of the Halloween de cuatro de Cali yup we will start a annum Bowie Alcoa wood but a porn in low and what the ETA spray so this is the spray with the spray you can actually use it over multiple days long as you refrigerate it in between uses and I would recommend every other day using this I'm gonna show you how you apply it to your plants so kind of look a secular point Anelka shall impart ideas easy locating a few got into plant Allah be upon me o Allah o Allah mananas or letter P so you underneath the leaves as well just because most pests actually lay their eggs underneath the leaf so that's the easiest way to find them so

you can do a fresh batch or you can use it multiple days by refrigerating and that's it that's one solution that you can try other pesticides that we've used in the past is also spinosad and neem oil they're both organic sorry insecticides that you can use in your garden just make sure you follow the directions on the bottles and dilute it's necessary okay so kinda left a comment and OH que esto

have question about this you have a few minutes to make question oh and just just a little reminder remember to always test any if you're going to try any kind of sprays make sure you test on your plants verse on a small part so can locate a record of a delectable flowers jana together we will know a new now those nope or even into a la planta porque su place every also see no program you know kita uh kita says pervy so Samantha Navy OS Monty nevian Lopez Seguin applicant withwith of course our unit Brunton in check a sec when doe displays a crowbar cannot come on a plantain cellphone Ella plant a second IE por cuanto tiempo so after trying out the plan and seeing that it doesn't burn the plants how long and you sprayed or how long do you leave it on there so you can spray it every other day usually at in the afternoon is a little bit better than doing it earlier and a that way your plants they'll get sunburned the same thing when it comes to watering you don't want to water earlier in the middle of the day because they can burn your plants in the Sun so with the soap you there's some with the start with the spray you don't really have to wash it off but if you notice that you're washing it off while watering which you shouldn't be doing you don't want too much moisture on your plant leaves then you may have to reapply it a little bit more frequently usually just apply it until the pest is gone if you find that it's not effective after a couple of days of using it then I would try all their methods so we click on local party afore aka COC aplicaciones inlet are they upon well cannot see past it ambien una la posada VI por medio' a civic you know not in effect on the points are all of via pero por su point that we made our okay so not a commando to plan

YouTube in al canal de youtube get an amoeba Mexican Park in the silly not at all getting a moon fin de semana hi everyone you", "HItVxRqunio": "as I was talking the other day in my wild edible lecture often poof's three openly youths get confused for three heart-shaped leaves he can't really see these because they're tiny but they're on the end here both edible plants clovers of course to the good blood purifiers wood sorrel really good for hepatitis tons of iron good for any kind of urinary tract infections sorrel tastes slightly lemony so I invite you to notice that it has 3 ripe shaped leaves and it tastes like lemon that's enough of a characteristic yeah so you're walking through the woods let's do the bushes all right and you see three heart-shaped leaves off a little bit in your mouth and if it's our 100% sorrel now those leaves are really tiny Sansom what if you walk through the woods and you see kind of harsh leaves threes heart-shaped leaves at the top of a long stem we do the same thing put it in your mouth see you can sour and if it's our it's our Oh so sore lives in the dock family and the dock family is huge so all Sorrels our docks vice versa you can use that interchangeably well we'll look at that down the line so clovers do not taste sour they have 3 oval leaves we have tiny little crescent shapes on some of the leaves for what what did I tell you to do next time you saw clover anybody remember look for the little serrations right so when you come over into clover I want you to pick up a lead and look for the tiny little spikes on the edges of the leaf yeah you're gonna look right over there firstly is a ground cover so sometimes we don't just look at the leaves right or the way the plant grows I mean that's good but also the relationship of the plants the ground some plants grow straight up some plants sprawl along the ground and and Prince Liam does just that this is called pigweed also sprawls along the ground it has red stems kinda has the lambs quarters of the Fathead thing going on where it's slightly waxy on the bottoms of the leaves if you taste this it kind of has a slightly lemony but more slimy taste he's very nice so y'all get to like try little peas dandelions literally come in all shapes and sizes although this shape is pretty similar the size anyway but there's over 300 varieties of dandelions and all of them are edible there's no poisonous dandelions no poisonous look-alikes some of them have these really toothy leaves and red stems some of them have white stems and aren't toothy at all of course if there wasn't fall here we'd see little flowers that's the easiest way to identify the endl ends or their little puff balls but most people raise your hand if you're kind of familiar with the shape of the leaves of a dandelion good there's something you may not know all true dandelions have a really smooth stem so if you flip over the leaf and run your finger along the stem it's really smooth versus this which kind of looks like a dandelion I call this cat's ears but if you run your finger along the stem it's hairy yeah and in fact dandelions when you break their their stems there's that white milky sap in them yeah cat's ears doesn't have it I don't know where that came from but the white milky sap is not poisonous those really good bitters that come from dandelion which is essentially the SAP really good for cleansing your inner organs and we need that better taste in our diet you know as we get softer and eyes will be kind of degrade as a society we don't like the taste of bitter anymore unless it's bitter chocolate but the bitters stimulate all kinds of saliva they help digestion and we need a certain amount of bitterness in our diet one way to get rid of the bitter is to eat the smaller leaves the smaller the leaves the less bitter they are you can also process them with a little bit of fat which means blend their look a little bit of nuts or eat them with avocado or maybe eat them in a salad with a little bit of oil it's one way to do it for this reason I often make a dandelion test over I'd use some pine nuts and some basil and some panda lines or just even skip the basil it's good with just the dandelion or if you don't want to do the nut sort of the back green smoothie boom and over time you'll notice if it's over overly bitter over time that you ease into it you'll slowly start adding more and more and more and over time to just let's make it like I can eat dandelion straight down it's bitter but I enjoy it a seer is not actually the same as dandelions it looks very similar it has the same kind of rosette at the base it even has flowers that look really similar they're yellow dandelions have one stock in one flower per stock whereas cat's ears have a more fibrous stock and they have numerous flower and first off it's still edible yeah this is you know a lot of people steam this it's a pretty good herb for soups generally people don't eat it raw because you'll feel it's really fuzzy sometimes it kind of creeps down your throat and it's like what just happened put in smoothies it's really good and then the last dandelion look-alike that I was able to find it's called soap thistle you'll notice that these stems are kind of smooth because it's a baby but as it matures it'll actually start developing spines or hairs and the other key thing that tells me that it's it's not a dandelion there's like how unique the leaves are yeah it's got this big lobe to like little ears and eventually the stem will keep growing and the leaves will grow around the stem and kind of curl almost this also has milky sap it's really good for you this is the origin of lettuce so thousands of years ago this is what we called lettuce or cause remember my story when I was talking about how somebody was walking around perhaps and really tired and could eat bitter stuff and then found a sweeter version of this took the seeds planted it over and over again so from this we now have romaine lettuce and red leaf ingredient so we talked about chickpeas quite a bit this morning is the one with the hairline might be a little bit difficult to see because it's muy stand the hairs are really delicate so when it's wet they stick to the stem but as it dries you'll see tiny little hairs and if you look at the main stem they start alternating routes that plant has the tiny white flowers chickweed comes in different shapes and sizes there's many different types of tick weeds somebody was pointing out that on my app it didn't quite look like the picture but again there's if I wanted to make an app that was like covered everything it'd probably take 10 years and it would be overwhelming because you'd click on something like chickweed and you get a hundred different photos but the characteristics are all there if it has the alternating hairline a leaf pattern where they grow from the same point in the stem right so like a symmetrical leaf pattern right some plants have a stem that grows and a leaf Jets out and it alternates whereas chickweed has leaves that come off from the same spot on opposite direction with them does that make sense and then chickweed also grows kind of like this like really close to the ground and patches so I had some awesome helpers today meticulously picked it for you guys but you can you just literally come with scissors and just snip it off and then it goes pretty quickly so definitely try that guy it couldn't be more earthy but it's really really good for you when you starting put these what I would do is religiously if I'm trying a new plant I never make a smoothie out of it I always try it first but when I get to the smoothie part depending on the green like dandelions are really bitter so maybe I put a little bit chickweed is really mild so I'll just put keeps and heaps in clovers probably on the medium side it could be too strong if you throw a lot in clovers are kind of the pea family yeah we have a bunch of different grass here all of it is edible if you don't believe me you hate it in your smoothie yesterday we've blended up something grassy you ate it all so I'm guessing you enjoyed it we'll look at some different grass and I'll teach you how to eat it raw because it is pretty fibrous and if you just chew it up and swallow it it might be hard to digest so you can actually get in here and actually look at some of the tender parts tendrils and kind of pick it apart and it's pretty pinky eating but in a pinch and I'll actually nourish you we have two awesome plants this is cultivated amaranth and this is fresh green wild Ameren green emirate so you can see what happens from this to this yeah and humans are time kind of engineered this to produce way more seeds because that's what they're after and no doubt the seeds are nutritionists they have a lot of omega threes but this little guy is going to pack way more of a plant this whole week we've been seeing the benefits of green smoothies we've been doing we've been using really good organic greens but not wild edibles we started a green smoothie class with wild edible greens I don't even know what would happen we'd probably just transcend another question I had yesterday was like you know how do I know how big it is or maybe in your app you should put a ruler C scale and I think I'm going to actually do that for some plants but it's difficult to say for others because this is how it starts and then it gets taller than me you know says you really just got to learn what to look for and study it for yourself and then use books and apps or whatever as kind of a reference for your memory it has generally reddish-purple stems and if you look really closely they all must have like grain in there like a grain grain wood grain I shouldn't say that greedy in rent it does have kind of a poisonous look-alike and they're usually the nightshade family we kind of look like tomato leaves sometimes when they're babies the leaves look almost identical but nightshades have one huge characters their difference there Carrie Carrie nightshade deadly nightshade poisonous berry you can tell right away the flowers are generally purple and they have what looks like a small little tomato they have really horrible names like deadly nightshade they're not actually that poisonous if you can eat something you might feel a little bit nauseous but it's not going to kill you but just to be aware also amaranth has these seeds that you can actually you know this is your magnified version of this look at where the seeds grow they kind of grow at the top and then perf under the leaves they start getting so bountiful that they'll actually start hanging a little bit this is a sweet potato mine this kind of a new one for me I didn't really know that you can eat sweet potatoes until I talked to the farmer lady they're very delicious very tasty you have to kind of be careful with vines make sure you know what they're doing but generally if you're on a farm like if I saw this out of nature I might not go out there and eat the vine just because at this point I don't really feel comfortable identifying it but I just wanted to bring it and show it to you guys how it grows it's great to consult the farmers because they're like wild edible experts without knowing it because they're out there 12 hours a day weeding so maybe even connect with some local farmers and say hey you know kind of couldn't help you weed some thing a little did they know you're actually going to school we got some racket well I don't eat the leaves the leaves are pretty fibrous they have a lot of you definitely don't want to eat the leaves basically a lot of people cook with them but cooking with them depletes their nutrition as well as the toxin each day the parts of herbs that you eat are the little fiddleheads in springtime they shoot out of the ground and when they're still curled and not hairy that's what you eat a lot of Asian cultures use them if you're gonna eat turns wrong I advise that you don't do it every day so what we're talking about with Alko alkaloid poisoning we're accumulating apple woods that are not a healthy degree it happens much quicker with ferns so if I were just out walking around and I found some ferns I would hire mitts there a minute I have a nice dinner you can marinate them in a salad or I'm gonna put a little bit in a smoothie but then I would take a few days break I wouldn't do it every single day so it's something to be done sparingly the other part of ferns of edible is like the tubers the roots and most of the roots of these plants are edible but I generally don't go there because a they're not as nutritious B they're usually not as delicious C they require a lot more preparation indeed they kill the plant and I kind of feel like I'd rather just take a little bit from here take a look here and keep going to let the plant either share its off with other features or just keep growing you will see that the leaves are round right so this kind of grows up as one stomp and all the leaves are traveled up and it looks just like a fiddlehead we have some dock over here which is also if we called Sorrell and dark is a common characteristic is that the leaves will start curling at the edges kind of like amaranth the dock will also develop seeds at the top of the plant and they look actually pretty similar those seeds are really high in omega threes as well I've often want to make flaxseed crackers like from the from our recipes I take the lazy man's alternative where I don't even husk the seeds of wild edibles I just throw in like a handful in the toilet passion I feel like you know I'm just getting the extra fiber and then we have daisies all daisies are part of the sunflower family all sunflowers were edible no poisonous ones the flowers are edible the stems are edible these leaves of basil daisies are kind of I consider them to be like wild rockets yeah they kind of have a little bit of a nice bite to them certain daisies more than others but anybody one of those in your mouth family wins have a squared stamp we're aware of that and so notice this step this is it doesn't smell like mint because there's a lot of different types of it when you come over here notice how square this stem is and also notice that growth pattern you got the two leaves that are growing off the same exact place we've got the little flowers in between that and you've got these tiny little they called them sepals that are like the capsules that the flower grows out of there the green leaf under the flower petals so we're Stan alternating the sepals flowers that's kind of good to know because there's literally hundreds if not thousands of different mints up there all of them are edible the last thing I want to say before we go on a little walk is that wild edibles also present us with a wonderful opportunity to slow down if you just look out there you're like I don't see any food but look at how much that I found and I didn't I this is like an hour's worth of scavenging but if I just if I live here and took a day or a week I bet I could find three times as much complete I went to this wild edible workshop one time in the States and the lady was like you picked clover her salad and it was kind of a desert environment there was some green grass brown but it was like where do you expect me to get it she's like I'll go find it and I was just so frustrated I walked around for 45 minutes and I had no idea Erin where the hell is clover we're not eating salad and she said here she says slow down maybe get down crouch down and really look I want to make myself slow down and I crouch down and it looks at the grass there's a chameleon over there just right there the whole time hiding I'm not really hiding there the whole time this wasn't noticing so to me well that opposed present the awesome opportunity to really look at what's happening like my microscopic air it's scaled and it's like you know why do we appreciate art so much because an art well one reason in my opinion an artist looks at a parent paints it and he lets us see what that point he saw after three hundred hours of looking in a pair now who in their right mind who which one of us would look at their pair for 300 hours but we could see in his painting or her painting what that looks like so while that apples gonna give us that same thank you hey guys so these are cat tails and how do we know pop quiz yeah because they have those this seed pod that's a dead giveaway that they're cattails yeah yeah before this part turns brown it's green it's really delicious it's like corn on the cob you can marinate it and it actually comes on the cob already because the spike is very firm and you can just eat it right off the spike now this you don't really want to eat it's really cottony but if you're ever cold you can stuff it in your clothes or in your sleeping bag and it's really good insulation when when is it go green is that can you eat that cut me stuff we already know how that cottony head yeah and that's one great way you'll never confuse them if they don't have a cottony head they could look like water irises and water irises I hesitate again to sleep are poisonous but aren't recommended for food the distinction is that cattails grow like an onion they kind of grow around each other whereas irises fan out so you kind of has that that circular thing meaning that it the leaves are growing like an onion around each other if you take it off long enough you'll actually get to a nice tender part then you just chop this up into a salad it's really delicious really nutritious high in calories in this day and age we don't really think that's a good idea or a good thing but when we lived in nature we had to conserve our calories we really didn't want to chase anything down if we thought we were gonna lose because that could literally be the end of us we deplete all our calories and then we're done this is a really good viable source for calories so good energy food and these of course make really good fibers they make amazing baskets out of them you kind of have to peel more than you think but at the very bottom there's a super duper tender part these are kind of small you want to look for the really big thick ones it's really slimy that slime is like aloe gel if you're ever sunburned it's really good for your skin it like tones it alleviates burns Nick's cuts also has antiseptic properties so you can disinfect with it", "qlR9hSaDWjY": "hi I'm Nathan Schultz I'm the founder of Boulder Nordic sport I'm here in Boulder Colorado and in this segment today we're going to talk about kick election we're going to start with preparing the base with sandpaper we usually like to use between 80 and 120 grit sandpaper that will prepare the base and allow the kick wax to adhere to the base really well once we have sanded the base we're going to move to actually applying the wax and we start with a base wax whether that is a specific base binder which would really give a lot of durability to the wax job or just a cold or wax like a green or a blue we're gonna start with that kick wax so we'll need some sort of a binder wax and then we'll actually need the wax of the day which will layer on top of that so what we'll need the binder wax and the kick wax will need a quart to smooth out the layers between applications and then we'll also need an iron or some other heat source like a heat gun or a propane torch to heat the base layer into base we're going to start with a clean base so this base has been scraped off all excess wax it's been cleaning with the wax remover chemical wax remover and it allowed to dry so what we have is raw base here we're going to start by preparing the base with sandpaper what this does this roughs up the base and allows the wax you have durability so it really sticks to the ski base the ski base is generally very slippery and that's great for sliding on snow but for the grip wax in the center of the ski we want to have durability so we need to scrape this this top layer off and rough it up so that we have some durability on the base wax a key element of this is knowing your kick zones at bold or Nordic sport we have special machines that we map out the kick zones that allow us to know exactly where you want to apply wax for it to be most effective and we're going to stick when we're sanding we want to stick to that kick zone and make sure that we don't go too far outside of it but also right up to the edge of it so that all the wax that we have that we're applying in the middle of the ski for grip is going to stay on there so I'm going to take this sandpaper and again probably between 80 and 120 grit we're going to go back and forth not side to side but we we just want to really get in there and remove any sort of smooth surface here and create a place that the wax and the gear to so pretty simple one thing to watch out for is don't is you want to wrap the sandpaper around a cork don't move this from side to side and round the base we want to have this be flat and smooth and when you're done you'll see that the base is much different color than the glide zone and you'll see about some white areas of where the hairs from the base are sticking up that's when we know that we're ready to go we shouldn't see any of this stone grinding structure left and we want to just have a nice clean base so once we've sanded that we can just brush off any excess fiber that's come out of the of the ski base and then we're going to go to apply our binder wax", "tcK1jD-yMI4": "what's up YouTube it's a DAB ninja here with another review today I got something special in I got some East Coast wreckage from strawberry fields created by devil abstract bad thing is I kept in the refrigerator the whole comment i was done smoking asian are and so buttered up a little bit but i still gotta get to the money shot for you guys yes as you can tell probably the top part well the bottom part is you see now is still shatter wise as a top kind of started buttering up but the man stuff is golden it's beautiful its seed through even the buttered parts are well um you know how I great I graded on taste smell and how medicine effect works I'm just get down with the snow right away because no matter what as soon as I open up the wax paper and smell it smells like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles I had my homeboy over here just smell too and he's like that smells like fruity pebbles so both agree the smell is outrageous as you all know I'll be smoked out around for tello I try to clean them up today but it didn't work so well not have them clean soon soon gotta rock the honey bucket because I would never go back to a nail now as always starts when it comes to flavor we always want to take a little hit so we can taste it make sure that the the buckets not too hot so that it just doesn't turn to smoke like that well doesn't external smoke turns into paper we're using get on it today bring up you beating around the bush on anything honey [ __ ] nice and hot not too hot tasty right hopefully Kate's like a bowl of Fruity Pebbles if it smells like it let's find out I think it goes little harsh you know soon as I and how to tickle the flavor it's really turpie if you guys know what Terps arts when they ass tracked the oil from the bud it loses its turf pics which is flavor and sometimes some companies are able to put it back in to the shatter so it's very extremely turpie tasty it's hard to explain what that taste is uh it's like I don't know you can eat an orange wrapped in oregano maybe you know the flavor is not that good but the smell gets an a on smell looks getting a even buttered up taste you know I'm not a big fan of turkey tastes but now it's time to see the medical effects of this east coast range hopefully the name sticks to it and hopefully I just get wrecked hopefully and it's a pretty good one let's take it I hate coffin in my videos because it makes me look like a [ __ ] and stuff but at the same time I always follow what my woman loves to say cough to get off so I sound like an 80 year old man half a lung out but I feel really good about five minutes so I get this [ __ ] next hot nice and hot so that as soon as it hits just for the vaporizers we give nice ah hope everybody's going okay boom nice hot let's get medicated Emily take long this one was different til my fingers first you know I can feel it working its way up and it's like the funny the hotter it is and the bigger hit I took the less harsh it was you know I still got flavor you know it still can't without the Turk Turk play because it wasn't so low but yeah East Coast wreckage from dabble abstract I would definitely recommend this straighten anybody I mean the flavor and so good but it went everywhere else all across the board except flavor you know I wish I you get the flavor from Agent Orange and put it in this and it would just be phenomenally and then put the smell of this and the Agent Orange and it would just be win-win for everything both strains I got a shatter were phenomenal dabble abstract will definitely be take in you know they got me back in the shed and I have to I love it so I do believe this might be my last video for the week hopefully I'll get one of the view of a different strain next week but to the world everybody have a good day good vibes you want some different comment let me know this is dead ninja everybody have a good day", "GehQ9-kyWU8": "hello everyone welcome to my channel or welcome back um i'm here with my last of the vendor wax um hauls from my october forward of mega box um and this one's a biggie it's a doozy from um empire alchemy wax so it's actually two orders although one of them was a lot smaller than the other um she had a lot of fantastic sense in her september fall i think it was september yeah september sort of fall pre-order um plus a few samplers small samplers like um i think they're only like 750 or something because they're only single cents it's like single um pieces of each cent but really good value so i got all of the samplers a bunch of things and then when she restocked a few things because she kept a few things up um ready to ship all month so i sort of i went back when she restocked a couple of um a couple of cents so lots to get through um got a couple of cards i've already kind of changed wax on them so they're all a bit oily now but a couple of you know cute thank you cards from her um and four samples so um i'll what i'll do is i'll do the samples then i'll do all the big stuff and then i'll go last i'll go into the three little samplers that i got um and depending on how long this video goes i may do the little samplers in a separate video we'll just have to see because even though like wax quantity wise they're only small but it's just lots of sense and pretty much when i'm doing these videos like talking about even though the three samples together probably weigh about as much as a loaf um probably yeah like a loaf um the you know it's 21 cents or something so it takes like a drastically longer amount of time to talk about so first sample i've got is from the non-sampler so this is just the order samples uh blue crush so neroli sea salt water florals vodka and sea i will say empire alchemy is one of my favorite brands for just really artful unique blends and particularly in the fresh aquatic earthy space um i do have i did one of the samples i got is a bakery one but i will say she does do bakery scents they don't tend to fall in my wheelhouse as much as some other vendors but i'm absolutely all about her takes on sort of watery aquatic fresh you know all of those sorts of blends she does fantastically well and this is really really nice yeah i think first off i definitely get the sea salt and the seek help that kind of seaweed-ish note but you do get neroli's a really beautiful floral and you do get that and you do get a bit of a sharp kind of um alcoholic sort of spike from that vodka too so that's really nice so i'm just gonna move this back a bit i was struggling with the placement on it but i've got a few things to do so um come on i don't have the best tripod in the world um so it's not the easiest thing to get my camera in the right place um grapefruit vintage tea laundry and sugared oranges so vintage tea laundry i think is like her own laundry blend so i love grapefruit scents i definitely get that here i feel like a touch more sweetness would really help with this because the vintage tea laundry is making it is kind of playing up on the dry grapefruit like it's not bad but yeah i just feel like the sugar oranges maybe when it melts it might pop a bit more so we'll see about that uh lost in the ether so apparently it's limited discontinued so sea salt downy april fresh type and neroli um so this is not bad i don't know if i'm the biggest fan of like um downy april fresh so my camera is really not wanting to focus today um it's kind of muting down that sea salt in the neroli because i could smell them better in that one but it's still not a bad blend i'm just yeah struggling to get a read on it and then fall apple dumplings is the last sample so hazelnut donuts fresh coffee coffee crisp leaves and dried apple all right this is nice i like this where's my flash being so difficult it's like you definitely get an apple note head she does i don't know how because i have never encountered it from other vendors but a dried blueberry and a dried apple and you really get that dried tone to it because this does smell like dried apple a beautiful hazelnut really nice coffee scent just a bit of leaves this is amazing now i'm sad because i think she did actually have that up on her website i'm gonna have to check if she's got it up at the moment because i want some of that that is really really nice she is a whiz with coffee blends too in that she blends them differently the coffee is never that strong but it just adds a beautiful touch um so yeah i definitely want to get some of that one um i'm gonna have a look on the website after this even though i shouldn't be purchasing so i got two shot cups um one in lavender smoke so this is a lavender clary sage wood smoke clove and patchouli this is really good it's definitely smoky she does i really do enjoy her lavender quite a herbal kind of lavender ah yep it reminds me of lush twilight with smoke and sage it's really really good the patchouli i think in the clove is a bit of a background note there uh vanilla crumb doughnut so house blend donut a hint of cinnamon sugar so this one i think it was available in a bigger size but as i've said her bakery i've just some of her bakery scents and notes they just haven't agreed with me i don't know why because everything else she blends amazingly and i know other people love her bakery so i think it's just more it's more my nose and my preferences than her skills but this is good this is really nice it's definitely not heavy on the cinnamon it's just a more really rich yummy vanilla cake with just a touch of that cinnamon barely any cinnamon but just enough so that's really actually quite good we'll see how it melts um okay so now onto i've got donuts waffles alchemy bags so the smaller bags um the first donut set i have um is the experimental uh called feldspar so the experimentals are just you know blends she's been playing around with sometimes they return sometimes they don't sometimes they return slightly differently they'll be blend she's just tweaking so this is white currant mimosa ozone and swedish dream salt so i got this because i'm intrigued i've been trying to find more sense with that white currant note because i feel like i love it but it's really hard to find but honestly in this it's not i'm not picking up that white currant super strongly i get i get a lot of swedish dream salt sorry my son's talking in his sleep thankfully no the swedish dream salt is not over swedish dream salt is can be very overwhelming to me it's a very clean tart lime scent and in blends it often just takes over i'm definitely getting it strongly here but i'm also getting the mimosa so a bit of that a bit of a sweetness and i think sweetness from the white currant as well so we'll see how it melts up um i do wish the swedish dream salt was a bit lighter but i feel like it's just the nature of swedish dream salt it's always going to be quite strong um gravitas so temple smoke a lot of mystery woodsy amber with the oak amber so i've had this before in the shop cup it is amazing ah so good it really plays up on the the patchouli aspect of lord of mystery which i find you often don't get it's often you get the um the pepper side or you get the sweet side but you really timmy get the patchouli it smells so good just earthy and smoky and mystical and absolutely amazing like if i hadn't been placing such a big order i probably would have got two bags of that gravitas because it's so good and another one of my all-time favorites pasadena that's why this order was so big there were just so many scents of hers that i love um up in up for the month so pasadena being rose parade which is really hard to reach uses such a tiny font but um fresh roses avocado sea salt and a hint of orange sherbet so i've done rose parade before it is nice but with the lime and caramel and the island fresh game that pasadena has it is just next level good i can't even describe it it's just it's fresh and a little bit floral and a bit sweet and so unique and so amazing sorry again another one i would have got more of if i wasn't buying so many things um so next i've got so a couple of a waffle pear and just breathe hint um melon hint of temple smoke rainforest sugarcane fresh peaches i think i've had this before in a short cup and i really enjoyed it i really love rainforest sugarcane you know and you do get it it's quite a complex mix you get a lot of mint you get the rainforest sugarcane i really think the temple smoke is super light and same with the peaches but it's just it's very very very unique and fresh and sort of fruity green and really really nice um rose gold sugar cookies so pink sugar iced vanilla cookies and orange chiffon okay i think i like the smell of this you do get a fair bit of pink sugar but it blends really nicely with that vanilla bakery and you just get a hint of the orange chiffon cake as well like it's not an overwhelming orange so i quite like that i'm sort of starting to dabble with pink sugar bakery i'm more of a blue sugar bakery person i'm more of a blue sugar person in general but starting to get some pink sugar bakeries that i like this was one i actually requested so deep boozy um blue sugar salty sear toasted marshmallows amber and oceanic notes lots of things in there that i love ah smells so good you really get that toasted marshmallow blending with that sort of sweet manly blue sugar tone the amber just adds amber i love the scent smell of amber as long as it doesn't overwhelm so you've got a beautiful sweetness to it so good i'm really happy with that one um wild blackberry lemonade it's a wild berry moose blackberry lemonade and rainbow sugarcane this is the main reason i went back and played the second order because i was like i love blackberry lemonade scents and with rainforest sugarcane that smells like my idea of heaven interestingly it's actually maybe not as good as i thought it'd be it's definitely zesty like with that lemonade i'm maybe not getting as much of a berry tone as i thought so it's still good but i thought it was gonna be amazing and it's just good uh so now i've got empire bags so the first one being the shape so toasted marshmallow rose would vet of a dark amber and carbon steel so because it was all sort of halloween stuff so there's a few cute halloween shapes like that i think that her wax does get uh her shapes do get beaten up it doesn't impact them anyway but you do get a lot of kind of white crumbles on it ah this is really nice it's sweet but you definitely get that manly steel note from it i actually kind of like that better it almost does what leather would do but not as harsh on the nose and the woods and the amber and oh my goodness that's really really good i really like that um pat on field so i've heard a lot of good things about this scent don't know i haven't tried it before um dry leaves tree bark fire roasted marshmallows and sweet pumpkin pastries i really like that she's included in all these halloween scents what put me one of these um cute little spider window things okay yeah i totally see why people like hard and feel again it's a really complex blend she does complex blends so so well it's quite sweet like you definitely get a sweet pumpkin and marshmallow but then the leaves and the tree bark like just that sort of crumbly because the dry hair dry hair leaf scent like when she does dry leaves it really is a dry leaf tone like you just imagine that crunching crispy leaf she really captures like the smell of autumn at that point um in that scent um so that is really really good i think it is related to my other favorite which is here where are you headless horseman so i've got another i just finished a bag of this and now i've got another bag so this is charred pumpkin flesh burnt marshmallows dry sweeping leaves amber and santa so this one is just this is the best pumpkin scent i've ever smelled this one doesn't have a coffin but it's got cute little betty bat um oh man and this one so i was a bit worried my last bag of headless horseman accidentally got it just it transited to australia at the wrong time um and honestly it got cooked like the shapes were just not shapes um and i feel like it lost its scent a bit it didn't lose its sense it still had scent but i felt like it died off sooner than it should have um because of that it just yeah it got stuck in like sydney because obviously my mail travels from the us to australia and it got stuck in sydney for a couple of days and the weather was like ridiculous and i'm pretty sure it was sitting in like a like a hot metal contained shipping container or something because this is really because only melted the last of that bag a couple of weeks ago i can definitely tell this is just so much sharper and stronger and you get much more from this so when i melted the last few pieces it was mostly the charred pumpkin flesh and the burnt marshmallows here i'm getting more of the sweeping leaves in santile and you do get that chard note from that pumpkin like it's a sweet pumpkin but it's just different like you know you've got sweet pumpkins you've got creamy pumpkins you've got um you know spicy pumpkins but that charred pumpkin is just something different and it's so good um gray days so white woods palo santo leather vetiver mushrooms and amber oh my god oh wow so this is like beechwood this is be a beachwood vetiver scent that's the first thing i get is that i love beechwood vetiver ah amazing because i'm picking up the paleo santa i'm not getting really much of a leather tone i'm just getting the best woodsy amber toned beachwood vetiver scent i've just about ever smelled that is phenomenal i can't wait to melt that i'm really excited about that one and then the last bag before i get onto the samplers is the fog so marshmallow fireside salty sea air red delicious apple and toasted marshmallow so there's like a crossbones in here she mostly just does the triangles but you usually get like one or two other shapes as well in every bag all right so this is nice to me it's a really creamy marshmallow it's got like a skull to me i'm getting like a really creamy marshmallow apple yeah it's just a really really nice marshmallow apple scent like the apple is not too strong the marshmallow is coming out really strongly here probably just a touch of salty sea i'm not picking that up strongly but i really like that like i'm not always the biggest apple fan but i do like a good creamy take and that one is fantastic okay so samplers um so i might just no that'll do anyway um so where am i going to start with the samplers i'll do the bakery one first and then i'll do the elementals so i have opened it and gone through it came sealed um in you know sealed up properly but basically this is what each sample sample kind of looks like um so a lot of scents like i mentioned uh checking the time yeah i should be right um so yeah i'll just push straight through so the first one from the bakery sampler is a pink fondant pink fondant bow so pink sugar salty seer waffle cone laced with vanilla pudge now as i mentioned i was absolutely certain that the fire so there's a fire and air sampler and the earth and water sampler um those ones i knew would be winners the bakery yeah she plays around with some tones and notes that i'm not always a huge fan of so um this one was the bigger risk for me that's it this one this one is nice i've had scents with her waffle cone before that i didn't love and i think the waffle cone to me and the vanilla fudge is coming through the strongest it's definitely like a creamy fudgy waffle cone yeah that's mostly what i'm getting here i'm actually not getting a huge amount of salty sierra pinch of them so it's okay um i've got blue moon milk so crushed blueberries rose petals vanilla bean and milk and sugar or sugar milk i don't know it's meant to be milk sugar milk not not a huge fan i'm actually getting a kind of nutty note with rose petals and a touch of blueberry god they're noisy next door yeah don't know about that one i think the rose petals is throwing me off and i don't know where the nutty note is coming from but there is a nutty note there um pecan crusted muffins with caramel topping probably not going to like this one i'm not big pecan pecan yeah no i mean it's not the worst pecan scent i've ever smelled but that sweet nutty vibe is just not my vibe that's just me um the plumpy pumpkin so this is pumpkin biscotti pumpkin spice and banana nut muffins seriously don't know what's going on in the camera tonight so this is very spicy but it's not bad i feel like i really like that what the banana's doing in there and i'm not normally the biggest fan of banana nut muffin but i feel like it just it's adding a nice sweetness to that quite spiced up pumpkin so it's probably a better spiced pumpkin than most because i'm more of a creamy kind of pumpkin person i'm not the biggest fan of pumpkin spice um earl grey lavender scones with orange peel frosting this um i'm hoping my nose isn't dying because i'm starting to this one's not smelling like a huge amount to me uh i'm not getting a strong orange peel off it a little bit it's definitely peel like it's definitely got that slight bitterness but yeah i'm mostly getting like a lavender lavender bakery with kind of a slight bit of orange it's not bad i mean when i say it doesn't sound very appealing when i describe it that way but it's not bad uh happy birthday boo so boo berry cereal birthday cake and frosted danish cookies this is not bad i don't think i'm the biggest fan of that cereal but it's got a nice creamy combo of the the danish cookies because they're quite a kind of creamy cookie and the birthday cake but it does have that cereal note which i'm not so found fond of so that could go either way i feel like uh blue frosted donuts so blue sugar bourbon frosting and vanilla crumb donut this is really good i think this is the best one from the sampler so far it's really bourbon-y like really strong on that burpin the vanilla crumb donut like i said before it's a really nice um just creamy baked creamy bakery and this is just a touch of blue sugar but it's really all about that bourbon but it's really good i really like that uh lemon almond macarons with vanilla cream no i don't think i like this one i don't like almond scents it just smells funny to me so i don't think i love that one strawberry butter cake with cotton candy glaze this is not bad it's kind of like strawberry pound cake but with a bit of extra oomph yeah i feel like that cotton candy glaze is just giving it something a bit nicer than your typical strawberry pound cake but it's definitely to me very similar to strawberry pancake and then the last one is banana nut panda salt the last one from this sampler poor that is strong i don't love it um it's very very strong on that banana i've not smelled panda sal i mean it smells kind of authentic in a way to certain bake like bakery type goods i've smelled in um places i don't know i couldn't tell you where got a really like a really strong nutty bakery which is not my kind of thing so i don't like that uh so that was the bakery sampler so a few kids finishes which i knew would be how it would be um it was only like 7.50 so i really don't mind and i figured it'd give me a chance to play around with her bakery a bit more uh so the next one is the earth and water sampler this is definitely more in my wheelhouse so i've got mermaid hair don't care which is sea cult mermaid kisses and blue agave love this fresh green like aquatic green tones zesty just beautiful beautiful beautiful i can't i you know in some ways scents with agave and sea kelp all smell kind of similar but i love all variations of them so bamboo water so that's green bamboo green mango ferns and coconut water this is nice i'm discovering two i really like scents with fern it's a really nice green almost leans to like a herbal space but it doesn't quite get there and this has got that it actually does have that mango tone it's not super strong and it is more of a like under right mango like not super sweet really good these scents are just these scents in my wheelhouse um renegade so that's earth and oak cardamom oodwood rosewood and oatmoss i think i've had a similar blend to this from her before a really pretty slightly sweet wood that cardamom is actually really nice in here yeah there's kind of a gentle sweetness to it in with the woodsiness that's nice um trampled linen so that's clothesline laundry fresh dirt torn grass and ozone okay so you definitely it's definitely like torn up dirt and grass like you dug a hole but the ozone and the laundry make it really pretty like like it definitely has a strong laundry vibe i like i'm not it's funny i'm not a big fan of black clothes like like clothespin or clothes like strong laundry and i'm not the biggest fan of dirt and grass on its own but together that's working for me that is that is really good uh oh again so blue crush so that was a sample i got as well so neroli sea salt water florals vodka sea turtle so i won't talk about that one i liked it and i've got two which is good to know uh forest nymph so oak moss driftwood purple sandalwood this is nice i can't remember exactly what purple sandalwood is but i've had it before and i liked it it's almost got a soapy tone to that wood but it is nice it's a nice soapy tone with the wood uh seaside cottage so that's sea mist hydrangeas and fresh laundry okay this is pretty good definitely again quite a strong laundry tone sorry i thought i'd just see if cleaning my lens helped me with the focus a bit but the hydrangeas is a really pretty floral note so it's going to be good these are going to be great ones to melt like now these are like perfect sense for me for spring uh cable knit sweaters so dark woods black pepper bergamot amber cool dirt okay so pretty much with dirt since always i get the dirt first it's just this it's always the top note but then as you dig a bit deeper on it there's definitely a deep kind of woods tone [Music] bergamot always kind of reminds me of herbs so i get bergamot definitely a black pepper vibe as well so this is nice and amber amber's a good blender i think the dirt um it just it does something to it to make it just a bit more palatable so like not like just like not like you just stuck your face in a pile of dirt like a little bit more um refined and then the last one from this sampler coachella so lush karma type juicy tangerine and frasier fur i love love karma oh my god that is amazing i don't know why vendors don't blend with lush carbon more often ah with that fur note and a bit more citrus because karma is quite is it like an orange patchouli oh my lord i'm gonna have to request this one in bulk that is amazing just citrusy and slightly fur like an oh my god um that is so good that's like probably the best scent i've smelled out of everything so far and then the last sample is the fire and air so um nearly done i was hoping to get it done in 30 minutes but it won't be too much longer um so four winds of heaven amazing grace shaving cream velvet and incense not sure about this one it's got a bit of a burnt tone to it i'm not familiar with amazing grace type but yeah the incense and the shaving cream and it's yeah it's not hmm it just has a slight burnt tone to it i suppose that's maybe the fire um bad to the bones and tonka bean black amber would truly must oh this is good what's standing out there maybe the black amber yeah i think it's definitely the black amber that's standing out on this it's got a deep kind of manly but slightly sweetness i guess from the tonka as well it's not really earthy it's to me this is a really nice kind of manly scent not colonish i mean these i guess if i'm saying it's manly it's like a cologne like it doesn't smell like a real man but it smells good um thorn prick so patchouli rosewood dried rose violet sandalwood part of me burping a bit that's not too bad it gives me potpourri vibes like lots of dried rose and like you know dried woods and stuff yeah it's giving me like definitely kind of proper advice but not a bad way i mean that stuff is designed to smell good sons of liberty so a lot of miserable velvet sugar lavender incense sandalwood oh wow this is fantastic you get the lavender you get the sweetness of the lord of this rule i think the velvet sugar plays up the lord of mysterial sweetness a little bit you get that deep incense vibe it's peppery it's sexy it's so good she always does lord of this rule blends fantastically uh this one i also had before as well so um lost in ether again so i don't need to talk about that because that was one of my other samples a ringleader so egyptian musk bergamot fern rosemary and coffee i always get excited when i see coffee in the list that's it i'm not sure about this one i think the rosemary's may be turning me a little bit because i'm not always the biggest fan of rosemary it's it smells kind of funny could be the egyptian musk as well it smells really mossy green to me but not not like a i don't know sometimes what green mossy tones can be okay this smells funny it could melt okay though i feel like that one could change but i'm not loving it i'm cold uh ambra and linen so vanilla and bread white linen ozone only two more cents then i'm done this is pretty it's smooth it's clean it's fresh it's pretty it's not like wowing but it's pretty and then the last scent also limited discontinued rose quartz so sweet like candy type laundromat agave nectar and cilantro coriander i'm australian i say coriander it's not bad it's definitely sweet whatever sweet like candy type is sweet and crank clean it's not like a favorite but it's not bad um so that is my entire empire alchemy wax haul um lots and lots of stuff i probably should have done in two videos but oh well here we are um so lots of fantastic sample sense some amazing autumn um scents and then a few good summer ones as well so i'm really excited to get stuck into this stuff um so that is the last um vendor wax video from my forwarder box um got through that in record time two days um it did help i was not feeling the best this morning so i took a day off and filmed a couple of videos um so i probably sound a bit scattered in some of them because i you know have had a bit of a headache but um i do like getting through the videos kind of quickly so that i can put the stuff away and start melting it um although i don't have any of it picked for my wax box this week but anyway so now i'm just rambling so i'm going to leave it there um thank you so much for watching as always i always appreciate it um and i'll talk to you again really soon bye", "QI4yby5-d_E": "hey guys welcome and welcome back to my

oasis it is beach treats brown sugar and fig and tahitian vanilla this is what the outside i love her aesthetics of her packaging um the font of of her labeling i mean it's just this is beautiful to me i love looking at this at her labeling um really really pretty her clam shells are pretty hard to get into oh heaven this is yummy pretty purple wax there is really nothing on it it is nice and plain pinkish purple lilacy um this is yum yum this smells like i get the fig the vanilla um is beach treats a like the boardwalk mallow type of scent i'm not 100 sure but this is really good i think when i'm sick and tired of christmas scents this will be a nice treat or i may hang on to it until um summer this is oasis pretty her clam shells are pretty hefty there are eight pieces in here um 6.75 i believe is the cost like i don't have i don't have a um an invoice but if memory serves me correctly i think that that's what this is um some of them have poor dates this one does not so i'm going to assume that it was a recent pour um patisserie is the next one and this is warm donuts baked bread powdered sugar and a touch of spice i am just wanting all the delicious smelling fattening foods as i am trying not to eat them i want my house to smell like them so this is pretty this is like like a taupe color glitter um excuse me you really do get this is a very bready um very bready yeasty type of scent a little bit of spice but that's really all i'm picking up right now so i'm gonna let this bad boy sit for a while there isn't a poor date on this one but this is it was a new um scent from her um so i'm excited that i was able to snag that i don't remember all of the new scents but i know that that was one and i picked it up this is midnight snack and it is sweet lavender shortbread cookies and sugar cookies this is very nice again this is just a plain purple which i'm totally happy with i do not have to have all the glitz and glitter on my wax this is good i'm not the biggest fan of lavender um this lavender i'm not 100 sure about it says sweet lavender let me open this again her clam shells are a little they're not very secure i don't know about this one we shall see midnight snack so there's that then we have winterfell which is marshmallow fireside palo santo white birch icy snow and vanilla oh this is wintery magic oh this is really good you guys really good this looks reminds me of like a leek that has frozen how pretty this is really nice let's just just reminds me of being outside in the cold like maybe out going to get your christmas tree like where you go and cut it yourself this is really really good very excited i'm happy that this one didn't jump out of my jump out of my cart that smells really really good move this back a bit okay we have blackberry boardwalk a layered blend of boardwalk marshmallow and lovely oh you guys i don't know what lovely it's lovely the perfume am i thinking of the right thing the sarah jessica parker perfume or is lovely something from bath and body works i really don't know this is nice wow i can't pinpoint exactly what the scent notes are um you do get that boardwalk marshmallow and like i guess like a flowering florally like feminine type of scent yeah this is good oh i didn't show you guys the wax i don't think this is a pretty like teal green just a little bit of like shimmer on there i totally cannot deal with that um it's not a poor date on that there was a poor date on winterfell and it is october 26th so that is good to go all moving right along we have santa claus is coming to town so i got a sample in that and santa claus is coming to town is the smell of fresh baked cookies candy canes and christmas trees so that is that you guys this looks so pretty i can open this excuse uh look at those the beautiful christmas colors um i get ginger ale with this and when i take it out on the back i get a little bit of um christmas tree and peppermint but smelling this it smells to me like ginger ale i don't know what that's coming from my nose may be a bit off the smell of fresh baked cookies candy canes and christmas trees yeah i don't know my nose is playing tricks on me because i get ginger ale and this was poured in october so very happy we have pink towels which is pink sugar and towels fresh from the dryer and i already know i love this yes this is yummy fresh clean laundry scent um with that girly feminine note that i feel pink sugar brings so really good just a pretty pink wax pink's house love it had to get it yum yum then we have winter solstice which is um the winter bath and body works type frosted eucalyptus and a hint of bins and i do have this candle and i have not burned it yet oh so good that's so pretty with a little snowflake yum yes this is really good this does i'm really getting that mince and eucalyptus this is wonderful i may hang on to this until i warm my winter candle which i plan on doing on the first day of winter super pretty this does have a poor date november 15th i'm excited for all of these in case you can't tell then we have boardwalk circus cookies frosted sword my gosh all right let me take a sip of my drink um this is frosted circus sugar cookies and marshmallow and magnolias this is a little bit of heaven i know that the um marshmallow magnolias is like all the crazer it was i'm always late to the game on new scents i kind of wait a lot and see what people say and how they love it and then i eventually go and try things but this smells really good pretty yellow wax yum i'm hoping that i'll hang on to some of these until the warm water till the warmer weather is back again but i'm so excited for this this is winter farmhouse it is sugar cane rosemary blue spruce teakwood sweet mint palo santo and light florals this was poured um october 21st so this is good you really really got that blue spruce but it's like the it's like the needles that's what this smells like not just the whole tray like if the needle started coming off of the tray that's what i really get with this that's good it's strong um a little bit of mint i guess the teak wood too is coming through i don't know that i i'm getting like light florals per se oh this is gonna be good and i think this is gonna be really strong this is gonna be fantastic to warm in my front room where my christmas tree is so really really it smells really good i'm so glad that i did get some like christmassy winter suns so really fantastic okay this is laid on the beach and it's a blend of beach treats and marshmallow and magnolia so i did get beach treats right no i got bedtime treats yes this is sort of this kind of reminds me of the other one that i got this smells good though this is strong so if you are familiar with um the marshmallow and magnolia and like the beach is it like a beach walk i'm horrible with names but i know that this is something that i've like that i like because i have a loaf of something exactly this or very similar to this from maybe am i thinking beach boardwalk or what i don't know you guys whatever um i have a loaf and something similar to this from uh l3 waxy blenders so couldn't raise us the name or what is in it so i had to get it just have some pretty little glittery goodness and there is that the last clam shell that i have is blankets by the bonfire and this is fresh linens white tea bergamot lavender and bonfire bliss yummy everything i like um like i said i say i'm not the biggest fan of lavender but in all honesty it depends on the lavender so it's just a pretty gray wax and then on the bottom it's gray and white and this all together this lavender is fan freaking tastic in here sorry this is really really good like really good um that linen mixed with the lavender is a fantastic and the bonfire bliss is the white tea really really good super super happy to have this i'm excited about all of these i will have a hard time um deciding what to warm first then i picked up two of her souffles i think these were like five dollars five dollars for 550 somewhere around there this one is head in the clouds it's white clouds tiff's favorite lavender and pink sugar can't really go wrong here just a good clean scent i am finding that i don't have a lot of clean like laundry types of scents and i like to have those um i like them in my bedroom sometimes i like putting them in the laundry room in the bathrooms or after i have cleaned so i really did need i say need i really did need some and that is head in the clouds so yummy there's that and then one other souffle that i kind of took a chance on is banana spice it's a vanilla pound cake bananas caramel cinnamon and vanilla buttercream so i really have yet to find a true banana scent pretty yellow sparkly um they all come across as very artificial very like runs candy this might be kinds of clothes um like overripe bananas and um get it together here and get some cinnamon and caramel it's definitely more than just banana so i'm kind of excited to try this so we will see um i love like the smell in my house when i'm baking banana bread i love how it smells so maybe this will come close i don't know but it was available and i was able to snatch it so i took advantage so you guys that is everything she doesn't send a business card no business card don't enjoy some things have poor dates this does um october 12th and this one does october 26th so something to pour dates someday some some do not the ones that don't i'm gonna let sit anyway um so that's everything i am so so excited that this has arrived at my house everything smells delicious and amazing and wonderful i'm very happy and i definitely see more teddy bee purchases in my future hopefully not until 2021 um it is the season to give so i'm gonna try not to just think of myself well i mean when i'm fragrancing my home i am actually thinking of others too i mean others live here and they do enjoy the scent so that's how i justify it but you guys that's everything i hope that you enjoyed this video if you were able to purchase from teddy bee's recent restock let me know down below have you gotten your order what has been your favorite um that you have sniffed and um i'll see you guys in the next one take care bye bye", "R3lMvwT8pSM": "[Music] hi guys my name is Luciana karnovski I'm pre-medicated from Brazil and today I show for you about more silicone molds and waxes ok the releases so first we have a medallion material this is so soft and easy to work is easy work George so I try to apply some [Music] it's easy very easy to work with this material [Music] so it's up to you wait to dry here you know sorry for many hours our movie and put in some place to drive so I prepared this you know one hour before you know sometimes when you movie in the silicon modes the piece is little flat you know but sometimes I I like because it's more dimension and volume in the project I like but this is up to you so this piece is I use the black gesso and this I didn't do nothing but I would like to show the difference this I didn't apply white gesso geez did piece this piece I apply white Rajesh and this black Egyptian you know the different scent this species is more like it's not I don't know the middle light and this is darkness you know and I applied the new based unicorn should shimmer you know Joe is glitter to work for Tony he has more Sparkle yes so in this species it's possible to see the difference when you apply in black and white this is more green this is more boom it's perfect to mix the colors you know before the dry this in this pieces I apply this world and red you know to create more contrast so and this is another pieces again I use these boxes is supposed to surprise but in the black is more in doubt and here is more surprise and i mix with another other box colors which makes you know and create a little effect and this is [Music] the same in the bike is very very big in a soft peak but in the dark in the black is little alike and purple you know it's a very interesting the colors mix forth of the project it's possible use brush you know so let me see the color [Music] he used brush fingers so this is in the black [Music] to apply and here in the light [Music] sometimes I like [Music] not cover all the peace when we have a lot of the tails I think like patina and it's possible meters the colors let me see this is a joke but you know  we and when dry permanent you know but how long have to take to dry like so what's like thinking ready me nuts you know it's not too much 30 minutes is is nice Joe Joe Biden and so I didn't wait to dry complete completely but I cannot buy the new waste to create marsh because it have a lot of sparkle you know I didn't finish but that's right but that's okay it's not problem sometimes [Music]", "Myflx8FeOVw": "[Music] [Laughter] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another wax review uh i don't know which one yeah let me see which one's better i don't know which one's better but as you can see i do have two brands right here we got cream genetics and we also have a highland oil company which i do follow on instagram i've seen them from all the flowers and plus my homie jason said that he's got it from them this was twenty one dollars their cookies glue

authentic 209 all right so they also showed the bottom so you can see kind of what it is which is uh not bad hey the cream baby so uh i'd like to mention guys that i did goes to the club thinking i was gonna buy this uh cure company rosin for 36 but then i was just like in line waiting i don't care uh i was in line they said she suck at packaging who the [ __ ] is this we're gonna see what this looks like decent put it next to the the cover for thumbnail no the yeah just enough to show the cream or whatever there all right how does it smell does it have a smell to it the diaphragm's gonna smell to it cause some creamy taste creamy it smells like some generic wax to be honest it smells orangy so um i don't know if this guy's smoked today so we're gonna give him a hit first guys oh really all right never mind we're just going to i'm going to give myself that hit first well i was talking about earlier i'm going to smoke now oh yeah don't mind the that the air conditioning is on

that's what ended up getting 300 total damage the whole [ __ ] game a lot of the games oh it tells you damage total damage he did 300 i didn't even know the total damage there you go sir so like i said subscribe to the homie you know what i'm saying look at that milk up and how does it taste far higher for 25 would you buy it yeah i buy it so it was a it was a new uh new brand that popped up at authentic so you know i had to try it you know but like i said my original intent was to go go there and buy the watermelon i mean the the wedding cake from uh care company it was like 36. i don't know what that is but you can open it up cookies and glue better you know you know what it is you're just going to bite it i'm going to just buy it actually the guy recommended it to me that kind of tastes nasty to me what the [ __ ] i gotta try that again what the [ __ ] yeah it smells weird too you blew it out yeah you smell that yeah i don't know cream definitely did not taste like it smelled all right hold on the [ __ ] cream you better that strong john [ __ ] that strong drone was trash i can't get this [ __ ] ever again if you see strong john and it's fire i'm just passed this tastes like that cbd soco stuff with a little bit more flavor not bad but definitely not worth 25 to me [ __ ] all right let's try the other one well that's it [ __ ] it i don't know what this is going to be called it was going to be a cream thing but i don't even know i don't know open this hold on hold on so this is just gonna be a two wax review then [ __ ] it hold on let's see the the pictures so highland it's the company cookies and glue was what people said came for for this brand and what's the uh that okay total thc okay open it two total two this one was cheaper guys or four bucks so presentation a lot better four dollars cheaper jason was right oh what what's that black [ __ ] on there oh wait that's the the [ __ ] there's a hole in it all right all right let me zoom in again one more this one smells weird it smells like something farted on it everything actually no squirrel though that's not weird i mean i don't know look at this smells sour [ __ ] dude smell like something sparta on that [ __ ] just you first [ __ ] it because i want to taste someone's fart first they're next there's three times you can choose [Music] oh [ __ ] nope yeah definitely i might taste some of this fart though why i should taste hell of fire this one that one smelled hella good but it tastes a little bad this one let's see i thought it wouldn't taste good it was all right actually i wasn't like complaining a little bit but i mean what for 25 i definitely gotten better oh yeah definitely damn you want a fat hit they said people went there for the cookies and glue so never doesn't taste like what it smells okay that's [ __ ] relief oh [ __ ] but didn't taste good it wasn't bad i don't know what do you think nothing didn't taste like hot smell though so i'll tell you that right now so that's a good thing with the smell though i'm smiling jesus christ jesus [ __ ] cross like reclaim probably definitely tastes better like cream too actually i don't know i think that one's better than the cream sure i don't know what the [ __ ] it's tasting like yeah that's all i don't know i'm just saying don't smell like what it tastes tastes better than this one should have bought the [ __ ] rosin the cream let's try your raw garden bro let's get a good tasting one in here we're all garden just simple no i'm just kidding i actually picked up raw garden a long time i've been trying different things too but then i've seen this one and whenever i look at raw garden you know i look for new flavors ones i haven't tried and it came across this one so i'm like oh blueberry yeah he bought that for the trip to pine grass open it well i just bought it i don't think about the trip well no you bought it for the well before the trip yeah yeah that's what i meant all right all right let me pack a hit and uh we're probably just going to take a hit of this and end it off with something actually good you know what i'm saying um it's not like these are bad but for the price that i've paid i've definitely had better probably even cheaper you know so yeah yeah bunch of buddies probably taste better than but i'm here to you know take these bullets for you you know what i'm saying because you know you could have ended up with a cream or a highland or some [ __ ] you know some damn grandma want some grandma so good overall garden it tastes like trash the platforms oh delectable you want to hit her there yeah i actually haven't even tried it you haven't no so this is brand new yeah i haven't even tried it i've been smoking that uh other one i just go on basically the sour diesel one that [ __ ] i went through that one section below if you guys go through sativas faster or probably so most of the times people don't feel sativas well at least let me know in my experience so am i the only one it's a good video guys it's a long video to be honest but we ended up with some raw garden a good strain i'm a little bit disappointed uh that this is what i'm going to be smoking on for the next week or so but at the end of the day it's still going to get you high it's not bad it's just not tasty honestly the only thing enjoyable is probably the eye jeez okay but yes uh that's gonna be it for the video hopefully you enjoyed the video uh i'm probably just gonna be video on three waxes we're reviewing three but i don't know what it's gonna be called but something along those lines subscribe to rj eats you know i'm saying i just gave him some of johnny's uh well it was his gave him back johnny's uh jerky that he he sold to him so expect a video on that because that's jerky

channel okay so you saw my thumbnail this is how the box came with my sampler and i did receive some other samples so let's talk about those first the first one here is christmas at the ranch which is cranberry orange crackling firewood in hydrangea heaven so that's interesting i like that the scent notes are on here the pour date is actually on here too which is nice i see it's handwritten so maybe they're changing their labels but i definitely appreciate that so let's give this a sniff so the first thing that i'm getting in this and let's take these cute little things out as i crinkle the bag look at the little bears this is super cute so the first thing that i get is that cranberry marmalade which does have a spice component to it and so to my nose it screams fall i'm not saying you need to melt it in the fall but in my you know my goofy my goofy nose says fall so yeah i definitely get the cranberry marmalade first and foremost i don't get a lot of firewood in this and the hydrangea not so much it has a touch maybe a floral to this but i'm not really getting the crackling firewood at all but this is going to be really nice to melt i'm going to set it aside it's going to get some extra time as i like to say and i will put it aside for fall because my nose it's a fall note this next one is i guess it's supposed to be denver i'm not kidding reference i'm sorry i'm old i don't and there is another youtuber that i'm not gonna we're gonna go into it but this particular individual says that they are old constantly and they're younger than me so i'm kind of like hmm stop saying stop it i hold that title anyway so i think it's denver but i'll show you in a second the scent notes are amber crumby fitch type and bamboo hemp with this gun interesting shape let me see i can't some of these are they're like the um sticky wrap around type thing so i know i'm crinkling sorry not everybody loves crinkling of the bags so this one take this gun out yeah it definitely smells like the hamburgean fish it was taking a second so what is the other it says bamboo hemp yeah i mean i guess i get i don't know about the hemp but it smells kind of like a bambooy type of fragrance to my nose this one is gonna be a favorite of my son's loves any of that i mean my god back in the day that kid that's all he wore and i shopped the sales they had clearance sales trust me i would shop it and put it aside and that's how we could afford it believe me but yeah and everything you know everything in that store you would walk and then you couldn't even breathe it was like a cloud of cologne that would come out yikes so he loves that i'm sure that brings back a lot of great memories for him he will get that one for sure this next one is goblin breath which is clove nutmeg bergamot honeysuckle gardenia lily geranium amber sandalwood musk and cedar holy cow there's a lot going on in this one and look at the little shapes there the skulls let me fight with this and i'll be right back okay so there's the the skull there for you this is really nice actually this to my nose again is this is a soft wax definitely a softer wax um you know some some of the waxes are soft my lights are probably not helping either but to my nose this is really a nice cinnamon clove mixture i mean i know there's a lot more things going on in this but that's what my nose always picks up on if it's in a scent blend it doesn't matter if it's i mean like this has a ton of other things my nose is like nope that's the only thing you're gonna smell yeah it's very pretty though so it's a very nice um cinnamon sugar and clove scent to me so again i will put that aside for the fall and we will enjoy that then because again my nose is like nope wrong season so we will set that aside and so this scent box or this the sampler box that i got came with you can see the different shapes in there are super cute i mean they look like petty fours or delicious desserts that you would want to eat and there's even more samples i'm telling you this is so generous we have a couple of more samples here that we're in here we have this breakfast with santa winter carnival we're gonna be here all day if i go through all of these this is so generous we have this labanda declares war which is sea salt caramel black cherry bomb and salt water taffy cute little melts there and i'm not even gonna try it's a guava fig and tea and cakes yeah i'm too old to get some of these references i think so let's pop these open and show you what i mean these are so cute this says for the love of lemons cake which is lemon squares vanilla buttercream and cake bake so you know those are all scents right up my alley let me fight with this one i'll be right back i mean like i said so i'm back so like i said this is a softer type of wax and they use these fold over um type of packages instead of like the zip close so just be aware of that look at how gorgeous this is i mean honestly this looks like something that you would get you would see at a wedding like a fancy wedding oh my gosh it's so delicious oh delicious and delightful i'm putting those two words together it is a beautiful it's a team cakes because i swear it smells like that to me but it it it's similar notes to that so i feel like i get a little bit of that almond yeah i wow i would swear that's what this smells like because that's that's what it is to me and i know tea and cakes can be lemony a lot of times you put lemon curd in with it or some type of lemon with tea cakes to just kind of amp up the citrus but this is gorgeous so this i'm getting more of the lemon cake type of thing the more i sniff it but it still reminds me of tea and cakes in the best possible way because that's i absolutely love it so look at i mean this is just gorgeous it's gonna look so pretty melting i'm not gonna want to melt it but absolutely stunning let me fight with the next couple so you don't have to hear me crinkle all kinds of bags so this next one is the art of pie which is cherry creme pie caramel custard and french vanilla see if i can pop this out without destroying it i mean so artistic and gorgeous look at that oh my gosh yeah it did this is definitely a cherry forward scent which you would expect oh it's so delightful i love cherry it's not cough syrupy at all it smells like a cherry dessert that you know you want to pop this right in your mouth let's see what else we have i'm not getting a lot of caramel custard which is good because i don't my nose doesn't always like that particular fragrance so you get some vanilla in here with a beautiful like cherry type of cake fabulous i'm gonna love that one okay so this next one is two scoops perfect for i don't know i'm butchering that one you know that i am so it's mexican fried ice cream and chocolate con controls is that how you say it i'm sorry sorry i know butcher me in the comment section [Laughter] i took german for way too many years and can't really speak it sort of i mean sort of and can read it way better than i can speak it which is not saying much so anyway that is this beautiful piece of deliciousness here oh it's so good you get the chocolate and the mexican fried ice cream oh this is delightful if you don't like chocolate scents this is really chocolate forward but i do so this is perfect for me oh that's delicious really really nice and i mean again look at how gorgeous this is absolutely stunning love it okay so we have another one here that was um in the little bag and i think the little cup top wouldn't fit on there because you get the the little lego type pieces this is chocolatiers friendship bread which is hot cocoa and amish friendship bread there i'm going to probably use this up quickly because i don't want to lose any scents on this any scent i'm dropping little pieces here yeah this is gorgeous i love amish friendship bread which is funny because it doesn't smell too cinnamon to my nose absolutely fabulous i'm gonna say that that is the predominant note the chocolate is way in the background so i wouldn't worry about that if you don't like chocolate i'm going to enjoy this one this is going to go in my warmer it might even go in my warmer in my bedroom today this is really really nice i don't wanna i don't wanna lose any of the scent notes on that particular one if you know if it's not staying closed for that one so the next one here and you can see like in the packaging because this wax is so soft and like i said my lights heat everything up in here so the scent notes in here are banana cream and lemon meringue pie just delicious and delightful beautiful yeah i definitely get the banana cream pie with a hint of the lemon yeah this is really nice i do like banana scents and wax my cat is going crazy i fed him and he wants to be in here with me he's like why can't i be in here with you so that is delightful and i'm gonna get the cat because it seems um with the logo here it seems like it goes together so if we have my giant cat in the video it seems like it would just be appropriate right it was embarrassing okay so we're back the cat will probably jump up here any second the next one we have is the same one that was in that set shot cup so that's nice maybe i can um put it in my warmers in my um the living room today then this is the chocolatiers friendship bread which is the hot cocoa and amish friendship bread there so i'll just take it out so you can see this beautiful piece here look at how pretty absolutely stunning beautiful and i think that's going to go in my warmers today we'll set that aside i don't know he's going crazy my cat is going nuts today okay so this next one didn't survive the heat of my office here this is cobbler meats bread pudding which is blueberry cobbler whole wheat bread and oat milk and honey oh my goodness so it also looks like this we'll put it back look at that it's gorgeous mmm i get the blueberry cobbler oh that's delightful this is so so nice and i'm not 100 familiar with the oat milk and honey in wax but i love it if that's what it smells like oh this is delightful absolutely delightful and so so pretty look at those pieces on here gorgeous i would purchase that for sure next one we have is the strawberry wonder cookie which is sugar cookie royale and strawberry soda pop here and look so pretty yeah i definitely get the strawberry component of the it smells like a fizzy type but not overwhelming yeah fizzy soda takes over this is nice this is definitely a strawberry forward very pretty like a strawberry cake so yeah i mean you definitely it says sugar cookie but to me this smells like a strawberry cake and a little bit like strawberry pound cake to my nose very very pleasant we will love that one and you know one just fell but i saved it that's this one it is candied yum cupcake with buttercream cupcake and crisp and candied it says so the first thing that i smelled and i popped it out of the package was it smelled like fall to me and it does so it smells like the um i want to say clove and cinnamon and you know all of those holiday spices that's what this smells like so you know you know how my nose is it says nope fall so i will put this aside for the fall and we will enjoy it then but look at how pretty absolutely stunning okay so what are my favorites from this sampler i'm going to say that this cobbler meets bread pudding it's definitely a favorite and the for the love of lemons cake is definitely a favorite of my but these are beautiful they are fabulous they are going to look so pretty melting i'm not gonna want to melt them truly but they are gonna look so pretty melting it's like an instagram dream right because you like to put or i like to put the melting photos on there i don't do it enough i truly don't i should do it more but you know i'm changing wax and i'm moving on to the next thing and i'm like darn i should have taken a picture of that but i will have to remember with these these are absolutely gorgeous so if you haven't checked them out yet make sure you check them out i will put the link down below and let me know if you have purchased from them before what is your favorite scent so thank you so much for watching and i will see you next time bye everybody", "C2feUQRe5Us": "hello everyone welcome to my channel or welcome back um kicking off the uh vendor wax holes from my forward box so um i'm gonna start small um only because i am still recovering from this cold and um just a little bit worried that i found that sniffing cold wax sets off my asthma really badly at the moment melting wax seems to be fine but um yeah i tried to do one of my i keep doing my um videos sorting out my wax stash and going through the drawers um two days ago i think and yeah i came into the room fine after smelling a few things i was like couldn't stop coughing so um but i think i'm a little bit better today so i'm gonna do two vendors in this video only because one of the orders was literally two items so um it's just easy just yeah i just prefer to have it all in one so the two vendors that i will cover in this video will be um empire alchemy wax and um little llama wax coast so um empire alchemy was literally two custom bags so um i think it was around the time of black friday she put up a listing where you could buy bags like empire bags of any scent or custom so you i think you could do customs but um i took the opportunity to do a couple of blends that i'd had samples of that i really wanted more of um that i hadn't really seen appear in her um regular restock list i really wanted to get more there's so many samples that she does that are amazing that just don't typically sort of you know get done um and i really wanted more but i stuck to two um and then the little llama wax co was just she did a i think i was like just 20 off ready to ship and i had a look at what was on there and there's one scent in particular that i absolutely adore from her um and she had some of that left so i just literally went in for that and a few other scents came along for the ride so uh starting off with the emma alchemy samples i don't have i didn't see it doesn't mean that i didn't have one but i didn't see a card or anything so um yeah there probably was one i just didn't see in the four-water box but anyway um so sample one is cranberry champagne which is peach crushed cranberries champagne berries this almost has like a bakery tone to it it is nice i get the champagne i get the fruits but i swear it's almost like the cranberry is like a cranberry like a bakery i actually like that a lot more than i thought i would it's interesting it's nice i feel like i've had a bunch of scents like that but it's just got an extra note to it i'm not yeah i wasn't expecting uh mistletoe so pine fur cedarwood clothes camphor that's um yeah it's a very strong pine fur camphor kind of scent it's good i'll hold on to it for the winter all right and then literally the two bags so the first bag that i got i wish she had the center apple dumplings so fall apple dumplings is just bear with me so it is hazelnut coffee fresh doughnuts um full leaves i was literally just looking at it why have i forgotten hazelnut donuts yeah hazelnut donuts fresh coffee full leaves and dried apple and it is just amazing so the shape so i've got these kind of things and then a big donut it is it's really unique um i'm getting i am getting more of the hazelnut from this than i did than the apple than i did in the sample but it could i don't know it could just be my nose at the moment but it's just it's just got a touch of coffee the hazelnuts kind of like a cute liqueur the dried apple is a really beautiful apple tone and then the freshness it's really really lovely hopefully the apple does come out a little bit more than i melt i do remember more apple last time this one i'm getting more hazelnut but still really good it's possible because this was done custom that it may have come out slightly differently and that's okay um and then the next customer i got was blue frosted doughnuts which is it is a blue sugar bourbon frosting and vanilla crumb doughnut so i love that she's done like like these little donuts for this and then the big donut as well this one was so amazing um so i really like a vanilla crumb donut as a bakery base for blending you get quite a you get quite a strong bourbonized bourbon frosting and then that sort of specific blue sugar sweetness although the blue sugar is not overwhelming i think this one's more kind of bourbon bakery but which is a touch of blue sugar it is amazing so i'm really happy that one came i think in a bakery sampler um i haven't seen it be done but it is really really good so that is the empire alchemy order really really small um from a little llama so i got this sample which is so fresh i don't know what's what it is it's a bit shattered up okay it smells it does smell laundry but it smells very it's not like a fresh crisp laundry it's very snuggly smooth maybe with white clouds to it i'm not sure i'd have to look it up but it's not bad um okay so the scent that i placed the order for which i got three shot cups in um is smoke and mirrors so i'll put you down smokey mirrors is blood orange black cherry tobacco palo santo and bonfire this i've had before and i'm absolutely i absolutely adored it it was one of my it's probably one of my favorite palo santo sense ever which is why i do check back and forth on her website um and i just never seemed to find a time when it was in stock when i was able to get it so i love the sort of red and black coloring she does on it too um so when she had 20 off ready to ship and it was up there i was like oh seriously it is just this epic combo of smoky woodsy and you really get that pop of pop pop of blood orange and the black cherry is the black cherry like black cherry tobacco i think i can totally cope with it it is so unique and it is so amazing so happy to have that back in my life um the other since i haven't tried any of these scents before so the other scents that i got from her so voodoo fest so that's blue sugar palo santo and flannel that's not bad i'm not the hugest flannel fan but that's a nice cozy comforting it's very strong on the blue sugar in the flannel i think more so than the palo santo but it's still good um i got wolf of wolf street which is palo santo and moon lake musk i think i've smelled me like musk before and i wasn't crazy about it it's very it's a very perfume-esque kind of pretty scent that's mostly what i'm getting i'll be interested to see if the pilot santo pops out more which it does tend to do um when you warm it up so uh the science sounds so flowering cannabis exotic hemp bourbon coriander rosewood i will say these are all the types of scents that my lobe eye which is only morning time sense all of these kind of woodsy woodsies florals deep scents i love them but i just have so many i need to stop buying them for a little bit this is so pretty it's a real deep mysterious kind of floral it's got a kind of watery depth to it i'm not sure where that's coming from maybe that's the hemp mmm that is really pretty i really like that and the last scent are the kraken so this is uh black sorry she's sort of printed over the scent notes black sea sea mist oakmoss sage ozone patchouli emma musk i should have showed the top of um some of these so this one looks like that this one just got some glitter this one's also just got some glitter and this one too yeah so glittery not too much glitter though this is really really good too i do i do like black sea a lot black sea is a really good kind of sort of cologne but deep oceanic kind of tone and the ozone in this as well it reminds me a little bit of um the ozone in super tart street right it's really good this is much more deep and mossy and stuff but than that but this has this kind of similarity to it that's really really good i really love scents like that um okay so that is everything from empire alchemy and little llama so i have so many of these videos to do i don't even know what order or when what will happen next i know sometimes i like to say what ones i will be doing next i will do i will do um ebony violet next because that is also a small one so i know i can get through that now um and then depending on how i'm going i might do another smallish one as well just so i can start putting some stuff away uh because i've got this big box of wax sitting right here um so thank you so much for watching and i'll talk to you all again really soon bye", "oNV991v_Xyo": "hey everybody i'm ryan from Webster's Mediacom we're back in the shiplap studios again we got our shop dog in the background making a bunch of noise so that means it must be another episode of hands-on so what we're going to talk about today is actually two different things we're going to talk about agenda surf wax I know agenda surf is mostly known for their EBA traction but they also do have a line of a traditional kind of surf wax and we're gonna talk about wax track which is kind of an enhancement for surf wax it's a film that you lay down it's kind of got these cool lines on it and that's gonna help your wax bead up kind of stay in place as well as make removal pretty easy too so let's go ahead and just kind of get started so as you can see the board we're actually going to be applying it to is Adriel El Jefe this color combination I believe is called refresh and I just love the way it looks the colors are awesome there looks pretty Ichi and man we really dig it it's a really fun board it's considered a longboard in the wick surfing world not so much probably in the ocean of course but behind the boat you can kind of walk from back to front get your toes on the nose and that's why I remove the stop traction that it came with and we're gonna be placing some wax on it instead so going over the steps from wax track we've already cleaned it we're gonna peel down several inches of the backing paper we're gonna peel off the remainder we're gonna firmly press down and then we're gonna rub over the top of it just to make sure it's stuck well so the first thing that we're gonna do is remove a couple inches of their backing tape which is right here so what I want to point out here before we just start sticking it down as that it actually as a black line running down the middle of it which is kind of help for when you go to alignment on the board especially like this board has a wooden stringer that you can see so we're gonna line those two things up we're gonna start pretty high and we're gonna work our way backwards put it all the way up as high as we can that is you look good so I will peel some of this back like they say just a good couple of inches maybe the wooden tube in it so I might have an air bubble or two but I'm just gonna kind of work them out let's think they're pretty easy to work out I don't know if then the mat is perforated or kind of like it has a little earful there's something in it but the bubbles are coming just right out so that's really cool anyway so we got the major the first part done I'm actually probably gonna stop there at least for the video what we have here is the pro set and it comes with two so just in case if you've got a little bit more board like what we have here I'm gonna put this on there but as you can see our dual board and the air vent and I don't want to cover that up with this so I'll just try and measure it out so what we're gonna do for our next step just following the instructions from wax track is they say to use the backing paper flipped over and just kind of go over it make sure everything's pressed down very well that there's no more air bubbles or anything like that we've already done that here so we're gonna go to the step where we actually apply some of the agenda surf wax you the compound I have today is the summer series of the summer version because we live in Texas and it is crazy hot out here so you can tell that there are lines already put on to this clear film on the wax track itself and what that's gonna do is help grab some of the wax as we go in a circular motion and kind of help it stick down to the actual film so previously when you would have to kind of make a couple big scores first or just start going in circles until the beads started forming these lines are supposed to help us kind of grab the wax and hold it there and I assume I'm just gonna kind of start beating up relatively easy now that we've got those lines there so I'm not the best with applying this stuff I'm just gonna give it a shot I'm pretty average with it so let's just go ahead and start you start going in a circular path that's cool you can already see it oh man okay okay so we're just gonna go in a circular pattern the noise that you're hearing is actually the wax running over the line and it really is it's just kind of grabbing it and holding it there know if it's like acting like a face we're with no it's already beating itself as well that's really cool man yeah I'm just gonna apply a little bit more but I can already tell that it's it's on there it's a pretty good that made it way easier more like going in circles forever I guess and waiting for it to kind of start blinking out of it everything that's pretty cool man see if I can turn it yes y'all can see it not used to go first well kind of splice in some of some boy I'm sorry for that noise some of that stuff let's see well I I'm sold on this stuff that's pretty red and I didn't really use that much wax either kind of help save on that I guess instead of having to hit like a ton of layers town first and then going over it and making the the bumps that kind of aids it I mean I anyway I mean that's pretty much it so once we've got it on there if you want to later on of course or if you like coding at some other kind of wax over a base coat you could do that as well I'm just gonna cruise the like this because I want to be able to walk up and down and everything but yeah this is pretty cool man so again I'm Ryan from Lake City Mediacom this is some agenda surf wax and wax track yeah and if you got any suggestions for us for future episode make sure to send it in to us and if that suits me we'll catch you guys down", "3gw792mgi9o": "[Music] hi everyone its Karen Samir here from the Prima marketing booth and I'm here to show you a mixed media Kingdom demo on some the patinas pace and the waxes so thanks so much and I'm going to get started so this preset it has called a wrap a patina paste it comes in blue bright and the mint green and combined together they give a really antiquing effect to any product this is from the IOD line this is already pre-made they just made it with some rolls and it's just a regular wooden plate and I'm just going to show you how to alter it to make it look and see so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to use the this one which is the blue patina rock okay and I know I have red underneath but I'm just basically going to cover the whole place I mean this is a big piece so just bear with me so I might discover have this chakra otherwise they're going to watch me paint forever okay so so this is like basically I'm gonna go just the main thing I want to show you is how it works well with all the different you know raised elements the 3d elements to make it look like a like you know an m16 so there you go now I'm going to the next step and again I'm not as I said I'm not going to go I'm gonna just do half of it because otherwise not to get too long I'm going to use the brass one because everything everything antique usually has a brass kind of color looks that we kind of like sergeant well I'm going through this and this time you kind of want to dry brush it you don't want to have the full effect of the brass and if you get too much on one area then you seal the wipe and kind of wipe some of it off you know that you don't because you do want to blue knit underneath to kind of give that patina look you always want to go on when on wet yes you because you want them to blame you want them to blend so that's a great question so if you are doing and if it dries up it will not blend with the patina and if you look at something oxidized it actually had just blend all the colors it has a little bit of that mint green and some of that blue and some of that turquoise and the brass and that rust so there's so many elements to it that's why it's so cool but you really shouldn't be working with something that is rusty because the dangers of you know getting cut or you know the metals are not they help I don't know getting some kind of disease I can't remember which one it is tex-mex or something you can cut that part off so so that's basically so you see as I'm robbing look at the cool effects let me just you know that it gives it give that really neat aspects that you have I'm going to even continue with the web is I'm going to do the third one because it's good to combine and as you can see and I'm not you can't touch they're a little bit gritty they have like a little bit of like kind of a the grid inside like a stone and I'm going to add it not everywhere right because you want that effect to being only in some places the nice part is once you start adding that once you start adding the the waxes which we're going to do so again I want to go a little bit more because I feel like I should have taken too much off and I want that that shining it to kind of be on it so once I've mixed it I go back in and as you keep on putting things on doesn't it it starts becoming it starts looking very much like an antique okay the next step is to start putting some of the wax these are brand new they come in many different the three different types there is a metallic wax which is these are some there is eight of them in different colors then there is the opal magic which I kind of change colors and then there is the antique brilliant which actually have I'll show you inside have two tone so if you can really use them as it has a brown undertone and you can use it to kind of antique things and they're permanent and you don't need to seal them they go right straight on they dry and that's it and you don't have to you don't have to do anything to them anymore now I'm going to start with just our different colors now this one is too dark I'm going to add the maybe this religious called rich copper and it's going to give that really cool home what despair that you want the nice thing about if they don't smell that they actually smell very very good I know you can smell them on on the video but it smells really really good I just find that they they're not looking to like you can in hail from sake now I'm gonna try these these are two-tone okay if I grab from the middle which has the two tones on my finger you see it gives you a really cool effect of green I just really like this the patina and it continues here so the more you add the more this this becomes very impatient looking and I'm going to try to send this one looks really good on the floor so this is also a brilliant and okay and the and I go back and forth so for example this already changed the color but it made it look really like it almost looks like a like an old run key or something exams want to go back with the copper and this fingers too dirty are ready to people to just I'm trying to please see like so I really like it so on the raised areas the waxes work really really well so this is one of the demos one of the really nice damage that we have an advanced peeking possibility that you can do to basically anything it works well on metal it works well and resin so you can really work on on would like on all things on the dollar store you can use so that's really you can stick something all something that is like you know junky and turn it into like a beautiful piece of art thank you so much and see you soon thanks for watching be sure to give our video a thumbs up and subscribe to sweat time videos on YouTube to be the first to see all our videos from creative ation", "H_P_okEnqNI": "hello everybody welcome back jiu-jitsu mm here today I'm back with an interesting video for you today just a very simple unboxing video this is something that I'm really excited about and I think you guys might get a kick out of it I have some very good friends that live in Colorado and I was looking for some beeswax because I want to make some candles and I called a local bee farmer in New Mexico when I work on the trains I go to Berlin New Mexico I got a hold of a local bee farmer over there and I needed about 10 pounds of beeswax and they quoted me about 10 dollars a pound so it would have been around 100 bucks so then the local bee guy here in town he wanted even more than that so my friends up in Colorado I'm not going to say their names but they know who they are they got a hold of their local bee guy and he had about I think it was 11 and a half pounds 11.6 to be exact of beeswax and he only wanted like 65 bucks so even with shipping I still got 11 and a half pounds 11.6 pounds of beeswax for my candles and my soaps and things like that for around 80 bucks so let's open it up and see what we got I'm really excited about this package in fact my friends that sent this to me um the shipping was amazing fast I mean it got here like very very quick now I put the address side down because I don't want to throw them all over the internet but look at that this is some beeswax look at that just good quality beeswax I'm going to melt this down and I'm going to filter it and this is exactly what I wanted in fact there was a picture that they sent me I'll see if I can find it here on my phone they sent me a picture before I purchased this of the wax on the guy's truck it was cool-looking I said oh yeah that's exactly what I want so I'm looking through

you the tools that you need as a miniature connector this episode we'll be talking about wax covers or modeling tools this type of tool in tabletop gaming is normally used for sculpting the Pacific's materials can range from green stuff to putty but the most common application for using this type of tool would be molding sculpting smoothing or any application that involves working with green stuff when talking about sculpting tools there are many choices for you to make you want it to be stainless steel wood rubber or any other material the pictures you see here are different types of tools you can purchase at different places for instance you can go on to amazon.com and find both rubber heads and stainless steel sets for a large difference in prices from $10 to $100 but for what we do as a tabletop gamer i highly recommend you to either get a stainless steel set or a rubber head set so this is the wax cover set that I bought from Amazon it was around $10 as you can see it comes in a pouch that contains all 12 pieces of the set I will put a link in the description to buy this product opening the pouch is as simple as you can see pull back on the lock and the pouch will open up exposing 12 tools all of the trial tools in this set are well-made they are made from stainless steel so you don't really have to worry about maintaining the quality each two comes with two sides or two heads one on one side of the tool and the other on the opposite side so you're not only getting 12 but 24 type of different tools to use in different type of application because I have no background in sculpting and I am NOT a professional sculptor I will not be going into detail of what are the names of each two and what are the proper application in sculpting you can find this detailed information on the world wide web by simply going to Google and searching for it this particular set is a very good product to have in your arsenal however like the exacto knife set I showed you in the previous video it is not a necessity to have all 12 if you're looking into finding a basic tool for basic sculpting you should only look into buying maybe one or two tools please leave comments on what did you think about the video and what would you like to see in future episodes thank you for watching my miniature twos 101 video series feel free to click the subscribe button like

microcrystalline wax occasionally there is a product of course Renaissance wax which is a blend of micro crystalline wax and other things there's a few other commercial products available but I've never used it before I've seen other woodturners videos and articles and they swear by it greatest thing since sliced bread but I never have bought any because I always thought it was too expensive used to coming only at a fairly good size Tim and it ran about thirty or thirty two dollars or something like that which is like more girl I'd wallet cringing for me but recently Renaissance wax I don't know how recently but I recently noticed that you can get a smaller ten now of the Renaissance wax for realm 1516 dollars and I'm willing to risk that much money so wanna test the micro crystalline wax for three things one is appearance shininess I like really really shiny wood turnings and I do all my small stuff with friction polish because it comes up with a really good shine I want to see if I coat the finishes that I normally use with friction polish with micro crystalline wax will it give me a better finish a shinier finish than carnuba wax or then no wax at all I also want to test it for a couple of things that is supposed to be really good for and that is where resistance fingerprint resistance and water resistance it's going to be hard to test for some of those perhaps but I'm gonna make an attempt to do it now I've got some spin those of wood that I divided into three pieces along spended with three sections in it and on each section I've got to put one type of wax the first one's going to be running socks wax second one is going to be a pure micro across Norway so this is not a blend of anything else just plain old micro crystalline wax and the third section is got to get carnauba wax I'll apply the wax polish it up and then I'll take a look at it and see how's it look I've got four different spindles of four different woods and on each one of those spindles I have a different type of finish I've got tung oil I've got one this finishes friction polish I've got one that's finished with a wiping varnish I've got one that's finished with just a sanding sealer which is really just diluted shellac so on those four spindles I'll apply the polish on the stand up and check it out and see what happens between the three types of waxes on those woods and those finishes after that I'll attempt to see what the wear resistance might be by kind of getting my hands dirty maybe a little bit body oil on it or something like that running the lathe at a low speed and pushing my fingers against it I don't have time to sit the the piece out for several years and handle it once or twice a day so I'm gonna try and simulate a lot of handling by doing it rather quickly on the lathe we'll see what happens there and finally water resistance not too hopefully I'm going to see anything there because it is a spindle that's round water I drip on it's just gonna roll off so I don't know if I'll actually be able to tell anything there it will be interesting to see what else might come up before we get started I want to go back to my computer and just give you some background on exactly what micro cluster on wax is and what the products are that you can buy or where you can buy the pure stuff alright let's get started back at the computer let's take a look at micro crystalline wax just briefly to see what it really is micro crystalline wax as you can see right here this is the formal definition of it it's derived from petroleum refining and that of course makes it quite a bit different from beeswax and carnauba wax which were familiar with beeswax and canoodle wax are much closer to nature be facts coming from bees and connubial wax coming from cannabis it's a little wax joke odubel wax really comes from a plant in South America but micro crystalline wax it gets its name because it's its crystal structure of the wax itself as is very fine much finer than paraffin which is also derived from petroleum micro crystalline wax and is fairly hard fairly flexible and that leads to its resistance to fingerprints that fine crystalline structure also enables the wax to bind solvents or oils and this problem is what helps it resist dirt and and where more mystery categories micro crystalline of wax as you can see right here generally the kind that we're interested in is this one right here the hardest one 85 to 95 degrees that's about 185 degrees Fahrenheit which is its melting point the melting point of grenoble waxes about a hundred and eighty degrees as I recall as you can see right here there are a lot of different uses of micro crystal on wax other than just putting on wood turnings it's used in cosmetics and making candles and making certain artists products packaging adhesives chewing gum ain\u00b4t plastics custom jewelry making there's probably a lot of other things is used and as well and if you're looking for don't lie you're gonna find different colors Agra from dark brown to almost white depending on the amount of refining of the wax after is extracted from the petroleum process so let's switch over and look at Renaissance wax Renaissance wax is a commercial product that is pretty much mostly micro crystal laughs Renaissance wax was where I first ever heard about this it's been around for quite a while Renaissance wax was developed by the 1950s by the British Museum and they needed something that would protect wood and metal museum exhibits better than what they currently had and they found the micro crystalline wax would resist fingerprints where water alcohol better than other coatings that they had been using now the in 1968 the london-based company Pitt creator began commercial production and distribution of Renaissance wax making it available to the common folks such as us according to the MSDS for micro for Renaissance wax it is not classified as hazardous though I'm not sure I need it but I don't feel the necessity of putting rubber gloves on when I handle it in the workshop either there are a few other products that are similar to Renaissance wax that I've managed to track down anyway and there's probably some that I don't have here woodcraft carries one called doctors woodshop micro crystal wax bowl finish which is a mixture of walnut oil and micro cholesterol and wax then there is dr. Kurtz versal wax micro crystalline polishing wax and I think I found this on yes woodturners catalog or craft supplies another product I found this is a wood craft is Bora protect - wax polish so here we see micro crystal on wax being used as a protector for metal and I think I'm probably going to be using micro cluster on wax to wax the bed ways of my length all right let's switch back to the workshop now late-breaking news this is a product I had missed a little bit earlier when I was preparing the video Hampshire Sheen Hampshire Sheen has a number of different waxes and apparently all or at least a few of them contain microcrystalline wax a blend of food-safe Danish Oil printable wax and micro crystalline wax and one of their products right down here is apparently the micro crystalline wax is fingerprint water resistant and a period doesn't mention carnauba wax here so this is probably all microcrystalline wax and Hampshire Sheen also has their corner crystalline wax stick which is features both credible wax and micro crystalline wax all right let's move on again [Music]", "vOzg9HmPT1c": "alright guys today we are gonna do a three-way I'm actually gonna be using part of this as a review as well this is the miglior a primo I think it's MIG little right hey I'm horrible with pronunciations they were nice enough to send me out some so I'm gonna be testing it out form working on a review this was nice enough to get a sample from al this is the new black fire black ice so it's just a small sample but I get to try it play with it a little bit and we're gonna be testing it against the old standby black fire Midnight Sun batch number 25 so one of the easiest blacks us to use so I'm going to as you can see I already have everything prepped I'm gonna go ahead and I'm going to apply them what I want to see is I want to see durability I also want to see if like say the black ice darkens the center section at all compared to the others because it's color charged and whatnot and I'm also going to be giving my thoughts on each one after I use them I have used the primo once before so this is my second time using it but to give it a fair shake I wanted to use it at least one more time before I gave my initial thoughts on it I've used Midnight Sun quite a few times and this will be my absolute first time with the black fire black ice so I get to see what all the hype is about we'll be back alright I'm gonna try my best to get it on here believe it or not this is the Midnight Sun everybody's seen it white carnuba no staining on the applicator whatsoever super easy on I mean literally probably the easiest product as far as a paste wax goes that I've ever used to put on Blackfyre black ice obviously it stains here is one thing that I was kind of surprised with it is very very soft I mean not putting soft but I'm talking very soft as in you touch it and it kind of it transfers right away it's not like most hard waxes harder waxes that you can touch them and they kind of take a little bit now at this moment I'm not seeing any real difference I am gonna back this thing out into the Sun pull the tape away and look at it but right now it's applying its hazed and try and get a good you can kind of see the haze on it it's actually very easy to apply pretty straightforward not nearly as easy as Midnight Sun but it is still very very easy and here is the Primo obviously I've used this applicator for primo before it's got a little bit of the orange coloring primo there's an orange wax I do really like the citrusy scent I'm thinking orange orange oil orange extract I do really like the smell of it now it's on there so I'm they're fairly good it is a lot harder to spread and spread out nicely than the other two now being that it's a high content carnuba wax pure carnuba no not that I know of not necessarily any sealants or anything like that in it so it's a natural on all natural carnauba wax it you know is expected to be a little bit tougher but we'll see how it comes off and we'll see how it how everything comes off I'm gonna go ahead and back it out here while everything's still hazed and see how it looks and then pull the tape away and we'll all right I've got it half out in the Sun half not I did find this interesting at least live let's see if I can get a good picture of it there's a definite line in between the differences and I can definitely see the hazing and then the line and then the hazing and then the line so I'm gonna go ahead and buff it off and then we're gonna back it out and see what it looks like all right we've got primo we've got black fire black ice and black fire Midnight Sun all the way on the end can you tell a difference honestly right now I can't getting all the Sun and all the reflection I don't really see a whole lot of difference between any of them no I will say that when I step back this is the thing I noticed the most you can kind of see that wine primo is so oily that it is collecting dust and lint like nobody's business at the moment so hi carnuba high oil content and guess what we've got dust magnet city honestly looking straight down on it it's bright it pops I mean it makes the metallic Sparkle I don't really notice any difference between I gotta be honest fellas I'm not seeing any difference in the overall look between Blackfyre Midnight Sun black ice or primo so it really is gonna come down to price point I'm gonna wait 24 hours and then we're gonna run some water tests on it some beading some sheeting we're gonna go from there and see what it does but once again Midnight Sun black fire black ice primo", "wA-gMg03oL0": "how I'm doing welcome back to the channel if you're new welcome to the channel in this video is pretty simple video on teaching you how to use carnuba wax carnauba wax is a great finish for woodturning is quite cheap it gives a lovely shine to the bowl it's very smooth it might be food safe I'm not sure I'll put that on the screen out if it is or isn't but anyway it's very simple to apply and in this video I'm going to show you how to do it right so I got a piece of a van Kull here on the lathe and I'm turning this into a bowl you can use carnuba wax on pretty much any wood so don't worry about that what I've done here to prepare the service is I've sanded the bowl down to get all the tool marks out of it i sanded from food to grit all the way to 320 if not 400 grit I wanted to leave a very smooth finish and then I used some Yorkshire grit and if you didn't know what that was it's an amazing woodturning paste it's very easy to apply you just get a bit on a paper towel you rub it into the grain turn the speed of the lathe to about 500 rpm you wrap it in for about 2 minutes until you get the desired finish you want then you raise up the after him to take away the paste and then got a lovely finish your secret turns about 220 grit into a sixteen thousand grit finish so it's incredibly smooth and it's got a lovely shine on it so that's why I'm now and it's time to use carnuba wax I got this wax from record power and I think it's about four pound is actually very cheap because you will be able to get tons and woodturning projects from this one bar and if you did know carne what is a friction weather so the way you apply it is to get it hot so you turn the speed of the day very high you push the wax in horizontally until it starts to melt on the edge then you run the wet along the side of the workpiece to get even coverage of the wax the speed has to be very high enough to melt the wax and once you've got even courage you get a clean paper towel you start from one edge rub it in until you see the wax start to melt then you run the paper towel along the side of the workpiece until the melted wax has gone up all the way over the piece and then at that point you'll see we're really nice shine now of course because this is friction wet is going to build up some heat expect your fingers to burn with this that is normal you can change fingers if you want but you want a nice even coating and an even coverage of the finish so try to do it in one go and yeah that should leave you a very nice finish so I'm going to demonstrate that now and then we'll see how it turns out [Music] [Music] right so there we go quite quick video I just wanted to be a bit helpful for those of you who have never used carnuba wax before it's a very nice finish it's got a nice natural feel to it the grain has popped slightly you should definitely try it out if you haven't already I'll put a link in the description to this car neighbor wax you can buy lots of different types of carny wear actually don't need the record power one but if you want to use the one I'm using upper link in the description where to buy this one it's actually free pound 99 so quite good if you want to see how this bulb turns out in a couple of days I'll upload the making video this so if you're new to the

you very much for watching and I'll see you in the next video [Music]", "NOUyul6rkzQ": "okay folks today is a good day today is a good day look at what we got look at what we got well I'll put it up in a minute you'll see what we got checking it out oh yeah so here's what was in the box okay the FIS is banning Laurel waxes for twenty twenty-one twenty twenty two year anyway so the ski manufacturers they're the wax manufacturers are having to come up with special new formulas and the guy at Dominator is a hell of a chemist and he's working on this line right here it's FFC lime floral free competition now one of the things I got to of the base prep waxes which are the number one and then I got one of the glide waxes which is number two cold and then I got this other set which is up a rub on and cork set this like your your-your-your anyway your correction waxes anyway so there's a number two regular - for not cold so I did not get that so I don't know maybe maybe they you know I don't know anyway beggars can't be choosers I'm not gonna complain I'm gonna test this stuff out floral free competition Dominator can't thank the man enough vanos is the man with the plan and he's been on it for a while and who knows there could be some more secrets he's working on but well we'll just have to wait and see alright catching me a while ago Dominator there's only way", "eifC9UH-My0": "you [Music] hey everyone whacks weirdo here and I have a ginormous monstrosity of a hall from Teddy B's this is three orders like a custom order a pre-order and a ready to ship I believe okay there's so much bear with me this is gonna be at one this is gonna be a minute okay miss kit okay first we start off with the Dornishmen wife which is follow Santa BlackBerry's marshmallow fireside and a hint of lemon the power Santa and teaches cute little shapes in here um when I get a little bit of smokiness from the marshmallow fire sign and definitely a little bit of blackberry to brighten it and the lemon maybe I'm not quite sure it's just a hint of it so it could be something that comes out more in melting but gorgeous full of action I don't know if you can see it there next we have so much strawberry pound cake this is a blend of white and yellow cake strawberry buttercream strawberries and marshmallow whipped cute I just like the simplicity it's so nice yeah I get the strawberry it's very sweet very very sweet strawberry mm-hmm almost kind of like a jam and there is a little bit of creaminess from the cake and the marshmallow whipped very nice up next and which is be crazy this is birthday cake pecan waffles sugar cookie dough and a pinch of a cinnamon spiced vanilla mmm coming in the con waffles I get immediately oh my gosh look at this sassy Kitty sass serious sound oh sorry mostly pumpkin pecan waffles maybe a little bit of cinnamon yeah just a little bit of cinnamon very good yeah I'm just gonna keep on going because there's a lot of action you guys don't even know mm-hmm teddy bear biscuits I love this one on cold it does not do it justice you do not know you do not get what this is all about Uncle Sam you have to melt this it's amazing one of my favorites warming is made with nutmeg creamy vanilla coated in powdered sugar and dipped and whipped cream a very decadent bakery mm-hmm see it just smells simple it smells just kind of vanilla ish and a little bit of nut Mangesh like that's really all you get better trust me it is sensational yeah okay keep on cruising I got this little six-pack in the haunted bakery which is zucchini bread buttercream frosting and pecan praline do you say pecan or do you say pecan oh that's good oh my gosh that's so good I mostly get buttercream frosting is really hard to pick out it just kind of adds creamy notes so I definitely get this in teeny red but it is not overbearing because zucchini can be but I also get the pecan pralines as well so yum delicious fallenness okay and we got this pink beaut six-pack here this is messy buns and uh glutes which is vanilla chai tea and vanilla beans no this is not like I would think it would smell like there's a little bit of a tad floral I wonder if it's from the vanilla chai tea mmm vanilla tea tea black tea is What's in chai so I'm thinking maybe this black tea oil has a tiny bit of like a floral Ness to it so just a little different than I thought I thought it would just be more like a cardamom and cream type so it's not what I was expecting but you can't judge a book by the cold sniff so we'll see what that's like melted okay and I've had this one before I loved it so much this is blackberry butter pecan cookies this is butter pecan waffles blackberry jam and cookies it's so good it smells just like pumpkin pecan waffles even though it doesn't show that there's like pumpkin in here that's what it smells like to me is pumpkin pecan waffles with a dash of a fruity blackberry just a dash and it is just so lovely okay then we have some banana spice this is vanilla pound cake banana caramel cinnamon and vanilla buttercream excuse me hiccup look how cute these are lovely hmm it smells to me not necessarily banana nut bread because there's not like a nutty the miss to this but if there is a banana there is like a cake and some cinnamon and I do get the caramels here so it's kind of like a banana nut bread but more cake vibes and no nuttiness as as much not cuz I mean ya know I'm gonna say no not in there that's really good okay there's some cute little jack-o'-lantern and campfire stories this is wiggly s'mores cold night winds and sweet vanilla wood this has a hint of body care vanilla woods smell to it a little bit of a little bit of beach Nights ish and the vanilla woods body care and I and then the sweetness from the s'mores so that is interesting it really smells more like body care lotion to me and we will see how that them up I got a little sample and purple sugar cookies purple sugar cookies is blue sugar and pink sugar mix together which I don't you think sugar really I if you guys watch French combo you probably already know cuz I talk about all the time this is nice I can't mostly the blue sugar so it's definitely a little bit of that caramel bloom Oh sugar masculine note and some sharp akiza I don't know mad at that actually okay I hadn't tried this one yet and I heard there was some hype so I got some frosted sugar cookies mister sugar cookie dough vanilla butter cream brown sugar crystals and fresh baked pastry dough mm-hmm smells really good there's kind of a cousin\u00eds to UM teddy bear biscuits there's just not the spice from the nutmeg in this one this just kind of smells a little bit lighter and I'm sure it's going to be different when I melted but it smells damn good and it doesn't smell fake sometimes with vanilla or sugar cookies you kind of get this waxy fake smell I don't know if you know what I'm talking about but I know what I what I'm talking about mmm and I'm not kidding that's what I love about 20 bees I don't get that when the plain like vanilla or plain bakery sense they legit and I like those bakery signs when warmed ok and then I'm so picky about lavender so I did pick up some lavender marshmallow peppermint cuz I know this is a favorite of a lot of people and this is a spa lavender toasted marshmallows and peppermint so I'm gonna give it a go one of the peppermints really nice I get a lot of the lavender and it is a sweet lavender to me I wouldn't necessarily call it's kind of a small Ravinder but I love herbal and a lot of people don't it's almost like it's mixed like there's a little bit of herbal and a little bit of sweet that's what I'm getting so sadly this one's not for me I will probably pass this along to someone that I know will love it okay and then got another little campfire start well not another but more campfire stories okay now that was the small box I'm gonna move into the big box I did get a back of what just be crazy so we already know about this one then I wanted to try this a fall berry sugar cookies cranberries dusted and sugar and sweet sugar cookies that's really nice I was hoping that it would be a more of a tart cranberry one more time but it's more of a Christmas cranberry and what I mean by that is it has maybe a tad bit of like a pine or a balsam in it already and other spices that accompany the Christmas time so it's good but it was I was kind of hoping it would just be like a tart kind of cranberry cranberry sauce with sugar cookies smell but it is not it's lovely it's Prem's Christmas I will enjoy it I did get two of those this is cute it's a little apple okay moving right along sorry this is gonna be forever cottontails sample I don't know what's in cottontails that smells nice it's like a laundry what else is in there like berry it's our berries and laundering is that what that is that's what I would get picking up it's actually really nice and then some winter which see what this is all about if I can pop it out oh it's kind of citrusy clean fresh clean citrusy that's what it sounds like to me okay then I got these little shapes in haunted bakery which we've already talked about but how cute are these shapes a doughnut and a little jam jar okay then I got a big old pie slice and milk and cookies which I adore milk and cookies so much it's so good this is creamy vanilla powdered sugar sweet milk buttery cookie dough it smells milky like you legit kids the smell of milk it doesn't smell sour to me but that doesn't mean that it won't smell sour to anybody else but that's gorgeous okay then I wanted to try this the sound it's so interesting this is milk of the poppy which is Palo Santo and the richest creamy vanilla okay I just I mostly get the woodsy from the Palo Santo and then maybe just a hint of the creamy so we'll see what this is like it's melting but I won't be melting this until January because that's when I do my woodsy and my vanilla notes cuz I'm the weirdo okay then I wanted to try some sugar - pear hi this is brandy pear brown sugar pecan pie filling pie crust and whipped cream it's like in the family of a caramel apple but instead I'm getting a caramel pear if that makes any sense and it's a good pair um some pears I don't tend to gravitate towards but this one is delicious wow I haven't loved that that is really surprising okay keep on going this is a Christmas trees and cream which is fresh pine boughs vanilla sugar waffle cone and rich vanilla buttercream oh it's oh it smells so good um you get the pine immediately its immediate pine and then a heavy like dark of cream I'm really surprised at that cuz sometimes vanilla buttercream gets lost in the mix but not this the tree is still the dominating no but yeah the cream holds its own I'm really surprised ok I'm back I just cleared up some space because I know I have some big stuff and if somebody was whining at me like crazy because he wanted to be paid attention to cuz I was filming and she wasn't paying attention to him isn't that right Eugene okay only a few things like well not really the whole big box but it's mostly loaves and a few more little shapes here let's get through them okay I'll add some cinnamon toast this is brown sugar cinnamon butter a pastry dough and vanilla buttercream oh yeah yummy cinnamon it's almost a mix between like red hot cinnamon and baking cinnamon and then you do get some bakery that's lovely oh I have another frosted sugar cookies and then I want you to try I don't do perfumes a lot but I'm like I'm gonna give this a chance this is sweet pink lemon cookies which is pink chiffon Boston lemon cookies and sweet vanilla cream bring such a brightness to the pink chiffon excuse me I am hiccuping like crazy that's really lovely it does smell like a beautiful lady wearing the pink chiffon with a little hint of lemon that's lovely because another milk of the poppy so it always need to discuss him okay it's lost time get into him so I had a bunch of loaves custom-made was so nice of teddy bees to do that for me so thank you so much this is an pineapple upside-down cake which is pineapples brown sugar vanilla white cake confectioner sugar cherry and a hint of coconut Lake serendipity so she did give me an extra set shot on these just so because these are the big ones with the embeds what is it the 16 ounces yeah and so she wanted to make sure to give me the full 16 houses of what's really awesome machine shops oh no but I can share so good ah I get the beautiful right part pineapple and I get serendipity and I get like a brown sugar bakery oh that is so good but I mostly get a beautiful bright pineapple I cannot wait to not that one it this time then I got my ultimate favorite from tiny bees which is fancy cakes and this is strawberry sugarcane a tonka almond and caramelized around the sugar obsessed I love it so much it's so different than you would expect it to be you get these bright beautiful strawberries but then you get these middle tones of the brown sugar and you know a little bit of I don't want to say bakery cause it's it's like brown sugar yep and kind of a nuttiness it's just fantastic if you've not tried this you need to get your paws on it moving along we have a blackberry and lemon cheesecake which it or no hot water a blueberry hello creamy cheesecake blueberries vanilla buttercream and lemon zest and sugar cookies I get the lemon right away the blueberry but I have evening a kind of an odd note but maybe it's just me it has a little odd sometimes I have it might be the Cheesecake because me and cheesecake sometimes don't jive but of course I'm going to melt this and see how she does okay then I got it's five o'clock somewhere a big old heart on it and this is frozen lime margarita champagne bubbles and sweet lime that's really good I'm kind of getting I'm really picky with lime too if you watch my channel you know I'm getting that a little bit more of cleanser live than anything else and then I also can detect the like sweet lime that I like the lime kind of sherbet I'm not getting any rind I'm not getting that super sour or that vinegary one I'm getting more of the sweet lime and a little bit of the cleanser line which I don't mind and I mean it could just be from the you know moment the margarita could have some notes in there but I actually it's really invigorating I'm really liking this so to me it's not necessarily supposed to be that sweet line like it would be in a bakery I think is best so I'm actually intrigued we'll see I will be a better world and then I got a big thing a strawberry pound cake which we've already talked about but these are just beautiful oh okay and I have not tried this either a lot of these I have not this is a peach cobbler this is fresh peaches buttery baked dough sweet cinnamon brown sugar and a vanilla I get a lot of bakery I get a hint of cinnamon and I get I know peach gives a lot of people problems I'm getting a lot of kind of a little bit of a floral peach and a nectar peach which I wasn't expecting but I don't mind it because I don't mind all the different kinds of peaches but some people don't prefer them we all have different noses right okay and I got a big loaf of brown sugar a waffle cone this is vanilla wafer or black home light brown sugar and a hint of blueberries and vanilla don't mind you Jean ash little boy sorry I had to tell him what's up YUM blueberry and brown sugar delicious mascara and that beautiful bakery from that waffle cone and vanilla wafer delicious I can't wait to knock this off my thing that was a lot of them there's some I'm intrigued that I'm like I'm not sure but there's some I might call okay and then I got a loaf and cinnamon toast which we've also talked about as well okay I have like five left okay keep the butterflies this is a smooth berry mint which is blackberries vanilla pound cake and fresh mint all of these on my heart that is gorgeous the blackberries are beautiful they're deep they're tart they're sweet the mint is smooth exactly like the label says it is a smooth delicious mint oh it's gonna be like bath time or sleep time for me okay then I got some cotton candy fizzy cakes which is birthday cake cotton candy guava and Bizzy citrus Oh mm-hmm but fizzy is not overwhelming oh my gosh I get a beautiful like guava cotton candy and a little bit of an invigorating fizzy Oh delish obsessed okay oh this is so cute blackberry butter pecan cookies that we've already discussed but look at the paws oh hey oh and then we already talked about teddy bear biscuits yeah okay and the last thing oh yeah is ice cream for breakfast this is vanilla ice cream caramel Froot Loops and vanilla sugar waffle cone I thought this sounded so interesting oh it's lovely I hit the vanilla the caramel and the waffle cone the waffle cone comes out last and then the Froot Loops is definitely there it's in the middle but it is not the dominant segment which is interesting so I love to this that's so cool I'm excited to see what this smells like when it is warm beautiful look how cute this little bit okay I don't know how many times I said I can't wait to mount this I'm going to melt this oh I'm sorry maybe I need to get some new material obviously but thank you for watching if you hung in there for this massive haul and let me know what you've been loving from Teddy B's and if you ordered I believe her pre-order well by the time I guess I upload this it's probably gonna be closed but hopefully you

are in upland collectibles blockchain heroes edition coming soon to wax", "jORRJab7UjY": "hello and welcome back to my channel in today's video i'm very excited because i bought this like candle making kit at walmart and it cost me 18 so looking at the contents of it it was a little expensive but whatever i thought it would be a fun little craft for us to do together um so i have opened it already here but i took some shots for you before i opened it when it still looked nice i just really wanted to get to the instructions to see what i needed uh before we set this whole thing up um i feel a little witchy making a candle so that's why i'm wearing one of my smaller witch hats and also i'm wearing a shirt that is sold as a pajama shirt by emin sprout so if you've never heard of her she's an etsy store i love all of her designs her patterns everything i have a bunch of her dresses and she recently put out this sort of witchy pajama set i will be wearing a shirt as a regular shirt thank you very much the shorts maybe just pajamas but the the shirt definitely for real so i'm just going to open the um candle instructions here so not the french ones the english ones carefully glue the bottom of the round metal piece of the cotton wick to the inside center of one of the empty candle jars using either a glue gun or super glue i have nail glue that should be okay so i didn't realize when i bought this that the candle jars are so small like this is a shot glass but that's okay i will live to see another day so the packaging in here is really cute and everything is taped down there's all that like eastery paper confetti stuff in the back this kit makes two candles and i think it's like vanilla and spice and blossom and clove are the two that it says you can make um and you can put gift tags and stuff on them i'm not going to because they are for me they also had another candlestick at walmart that was um crystals and not botanical and i was really interested in that one too so if we have fun with this today we might do the crystal one at some point as well i don't know i just thought the botanical one seemed like more fun to start out with so i freed the wicks from their tape prison i'm just going to bend it up and then what it wants me to do okay you can see it if i put it on top of the bowl the bowl is going to be for melting the wax so i'm just going to open the glue put a whole bunch of it right on the bottom and then what you're supposed to do is you set this down right in the middle and then they give you these wooden sticks to kind of help push it down and then the wooden sticks are also supposed to help barnacles it's moving that's hard man i'll just hold it here for a sec and then once i think it has like a decent hold you're supposed to use the little sticks to help hold the wick up while it dries the rest of the way i believe step two or whatever step after we have the wick sitting there waiting to dry is to heat up the wax chips so i have this bowl which is actually a ramen taco bowl it is microwave tape and this is a bowl about a bag of wax chips and it says to put it in the microwave what does it say uh in a microwave sample melt one bag of the soy wax chips at 30 second intervals until it is completely melted please be careful if the contents of the bowl may be hot when removing select the fragrance you would like to use and add 8 to 10 drops into the melted wax it actually says eight to ten drops into the melted was and stir but it should say wax and then carefully and slowly pour the melted wax mixture into the candle jar try to avoid pouring directly onto the wick stem how that is all right okay so what we're gonna do is i'm going to use my phone and we're gonna go to the kitchen and we're gonna vlog heating this up from my phone and then we're gonna come back in here and add the scent and pour it in without spilling hot wax all over myself it sounds like wishful thinking okay so this is my microwave safe bowl these are the wax chips i'm just gonna cut them open and put them in the microwave [Music] 30 second number one is done let's look pretty much nothing happened let's put it back in part two okay it has now been four minutes let's see if that worked it did work okay let's go back okay so now it wants me to add some smellies so one of these is vanilla this one is vanilla apparently so we're just gonna oh very easy to open little bottle and we're just gonna i like vanilla the most there we go let's put it right over there and then maybe i'll throw in just like a hint of the cinnamon one i'm not really a big cinnamon smell girl but and then the only other smell it came with was clove so i feel like i should use that one too right okay that was more clothed than i meant to but now i have a little bit of all three scents in and we're just gonna try my best to not get this everywhere and to have my phone focused okay so i got it on the stick but that's okay now the instructions want me to reposition this so that it's standing up in the middle and then to use the sticks now it wants to fall back this way so i'm gonna have to cross the sticks right okay so that's good so now it wanted me to wait until i think it said two-thirds carefully slowly pour the melted wax mixture into the candle try avoiding pouring directly onto the wick stem i think i did okay adjust the wick as needed so it stands tall in the center allow your candle to dry until one third of the top is still liquid so two thirds is dry is what it's trying to say place the dried flowers or clothes on top of the candle and use the stick to gently push each piece so it sinks in slightly the wax might still be hot so be careful when testing with the top of your fingers continue to let the candle dry completely until it becomes cool to the touch once the candle has dried remove the wooden sticks from the wick trim the wick so that is slightly shorter than the candle jar and then it wants me to personalize my labels and make the second candle so i'm gonna have to pick off that wax that's on the side but the hard parts are over i just have to wait till it's mostly dry now to add the stuff on top okay so this looks mostly like it's dryish to me like maybe less than the top third is dry uh you know what i mean it's dry enough now that i can put the stuff on it so it came with two little packs of botanicals so that one there is peach blossom and then this one is cloves because i did accidentally put so much clove smell in this we're gonna put some cloves on top as well how do i do this with one hand okay these pieces look really big like i feel like maybe they should have given us smaller pieces considering how small the candles are okay and then it wanted me to use the stick to push some of them down okay i admit it's cute so we're just gonna let it dry the rest of the way i've decided i am going to just go ahead and make the other candle now largely probably off camera i've already glued the wick in so i just gotta go heat up the wax is what the word i'm looking for and we'll let this one dry all the way and then i'll put the other one together and then we're done so i put the peach blossom pieces in before it's really uh dry at all compared to where i put those ones in but that's because they were like really thick little chunks like almost like little rocks like see how much there is and i wanted it to like be able to settle a little bit deeper and that sort of thing so i really can't see that affecting the candle negatively but i just wanted to make a note that because like i feel like they didn't equally fill the clove bag and the peach blossom bag because the peach blossom bag was way fuller and had way thicker pieces so i mean this is nearing dry now but when i put them in it was still very wet so i'm sure it comes as no surprise to you at this point that i've never ever made anything with wax before um so i didn't expect it to take that long to dry i mean i use candles but i don't know like they dry faster but these are finally dried the second one that i made is still actually quite warm to the touch like on the outside of the bottle um container whatever i didn't bother picking off the outside wax yet but whatever um so now we're gonna use my favorite useless tool which is this wig cutter that is from yankee handle and it said just below just below the glass so we're just gonna snip it like that cool and now i have two tiny little cute homemade candles this one is a little clovier this one is peach blossomier but for the most part i kind of just put the same smells in them i think they look cuter without labels i wish more candles came without labels i'm sure i could get them off the other candles somehow but i just like not not having labels i think they're cute in this sort of nondescript type packaging overall this kit was expensive 20 bucks for these two little candles but i had fun making it and like is it really wasted money if you had fun just like wasting time is it really wasted if you had fun i mean would i ever buy this kid again probably not but if i had kids and they wanted to do a really fun little craft and depending on how how and how old the kids are because wax um but this was fun maybe i'm a child might just think it's fun i actually really like the smell of the clovy one to be honest i don't know i think this was really fun and i really liked it i totally want the crystal kit now even though it's 20 bucks and i think it's silly anyway thank you for coming on this botanical candle kit journey with me i've been looking forward to shooting this video for literally weeks and i finally had the time today um so i'm really glad that we shot this i think they're cute thank you so much for watching this video make sure you give it two thumbs up and you subscribe to my channel if you have not subscribed already and i will see you next time bye", "uk9kXrJyN0Y": "well ladies and gentlemen boys and girls i'm back here in the ski shop and uh i'm going to talk a little bit about wax and i'll show you some of these skis mine and you're going to see some of them are really old so anyway that is over here i got some really old ones look back here of course i'm not skiing these anymore but uh there's old pair of pre back there and those old dean's star evasions let's see see i had a a pair of old dynastar v6s i skied for a long time anyway uh so yeah i got some old skis here but some are older and newer anyway you know yeah i've been i've been skiing for a long time folks i've been skiing for let's see since i was eight years old i don't want to tell you guys how old i am but i've been skiing for a lot of years and my first experience with wax was when i was about maybe 12 years old skiing on old head standards and what i did was uh i rubbed on some toco wax one day i bought a pack of wax you know it came with uh with what do you call it a a three pack you know it came with a with one red and one yellow and one blue and since i hadn't been waxing skis you know i was just get anyway you know skiing old dried out head standards anyway man the first time i rubbed some wax on there one day boy what a difference that made holy moly i felt like wow so anyway as the years went by and i got to ski more and i've been skiing really consistently for about the last 20 years and i've been waxing and servicing skis for myself and other people uh all those years so the latest the latest development here i'm going to show you in the dominator wax line and the thing is what happened is the fis the sanctioning body for world cup racing and all that and uh anyway fis decided they were going to ban floral waxes okay and uh it's a kind of a you know i don't want to get all day long about it but you know yeah there's there was stuff in the floral waxes that was poisoning some of the applicators because of bad ingredients that were in them you know and anyway one thing about dominator was well they made their own floros unlike the other wax makers even the top end guys some of their super floral you know powders that they put on the skis i mean you had to wear a dang gas mask you know to put these things on or you could really poison your lungs so but uh dominator always made their own fluoros instead of ordering them from you know cheaper chinese suppliers etc and uh they took an extra step to take the p o f a's out of it if i'm saying that right anyway so so i use fluorinated waxes from dominator and i never worried about it although you know i just didn't worry about it but then later i found out actually it was nothing to worry about but there's still this environmental issue and i know some people are greener than others and really it doesn't amount to much but you know you got to go with flow so uh guys at dominator worked on these two lines and these are the new waxes and these this first line right here this is the ffc line fluoro free competition fluoro free competition okay and it's a super simple system comes with number one a base prep number one is your base prep wax you always want to use base prep wax folks you got to get that super soft wax and get that into the skis that's what makes the other waxes last and sticking it here much better so there is then the number two and the number two wax that is for uh well you can see on there i i better put my glasses on stand by and buy a kit they're going to you know you get you get old and then you you need you need your glasses so anyway okay so okay so real simple system here okay and this is this is not as spendy as the top system of these new floral free waxes so it's not just fis bantam fluoros it's other race and bodies you know that that you might be in that you're gonna be in maybe before you get to the fis level you know or competition so uh the number two uh as you see right there that's for 19 uh fahrenheit or uh and warmer snow and we're talking about snow snow temps here and then the second wax is the cold one and that one is for 19 and colder so really simple system in the ffc the floral free competition and then it also has a correction kit well or like a second run kit so like maybe you know you thought it was going to be you know 19 and warmer or you thought it was going to be 19 and colder but conditions changed or maybe for your second run you know you just needed to reboost a little bit of wax on those skis and so then it comes with this rub on kit okay the rub on kit comes with uh a one rub on for the colder temps and one rub on for the warmer temps so if you put the wrong wax on put on the coil anyway you can rub the other one on over anyway and then then it comes with these two little synthetic corks and so anyway here's your second run or correction wax so that's super simple system right there okay boom boom boom boom boom boom floral free folks floral free competition so uh these were tested i just got these at the end of last year so you know some of these have all been used i only used one of the rub ons a little bit testing it myself uh but the people that i put these on their skis they told me they were smoking oaken and they were stoking kobokan so one thing that you notice about these waxes is see they're they're they all have this dark color okay now this warm one yeah no it's not that dark it's rub on one it's lighter but anyway what this is is like okay it's not dyes but that's your anti-static that's your graphites in there okay and so anyway super important and that's one thing that dominator has done in these new formulas is addressed the anti-static in each formula so anyway long story again but anyway blah blah anesthetic so they're in there they're already in there okay now these ones aren't so as spendy as these ones okay so this is the elite line so now if you're a skier that's really in this you know like you want max glides you've used fluoros before and you know how to wax properly and you know the difference it makes that florals can make you know on uh well when they're needed you know on the warmer snows and uh so at any rate uh trying to maintain my focus here uh so these are a little spin here but these are gonna give you that max performance now the the reports back now none of these have been tested yet from me because i just got these a while back okay as a sample batch you know so that i could test them out and uh so anyway let's go over these real quick so the elite line this is this is like the top for for racers so if you're racing it's again it's still a super simple system now with this line right here you don't see one that says base prep but in this line you do want to use a base prep so you can use either this this base prep from the floral free line but both the base prep waxes from dominator are also floral free so you want to use those so anyway so os elite old snow old snow one old snow two old snow three okay the lower the number the colder the snow this one is for 14 degrees of snow temperature and colder 23 uh and and then up and then uh 20 oh 23 and warmer i'm sorry and 20 23 to 14. i'm you know you guys could probably see this so so anyway so just three formulas there and uh anyway so then you got the new snow formulas because your anti-statics are different in new snow and old snow okay that's what they've discovered at uh testing there at dominator so same thing over here new snow one new snow two new stowe three the the lower the number the colder the snow now i will tell you this already from testing these other uh these ones over here and putting them on and the information is on their website about how to use these i gotta tell you the number ones okay they are like hard as a rock man and you if you've ever watched any of my waxing videos i say don't run your iron too hot like keep it you know 180 200 but i'm gonna tell you when you put on these number ones okay whether it's the new snow or the old snow you are going to have to turn that iron up at least to 220 and maybe even hotter than that uh you know you can go to 250 but uh boy be qui anyway so yeah because they are hard as a rock okay and so anyway so the new snows you see they're all black because they've got different anti-statics in them than the the old snows and uh then it comes with two well or you can get two overlays okay so these are your overlays but there's no fluoro in it okay so what they did was they developed uh he spent a lot of time developing different polymers okay a mix of these different polymers that act like fluoros they're super hydrophobic so anyway and then they got this uh elite w with wet for super wet snow and this is kind of like if you're familiar with uh dominators waxes it's kind of like butter but butter with no with no floral so again all floral free here okay so if you're green and you want to be super mean you know this is the line you're going to go for and if you're racing for sure this is the line you're going to want to go for but if you're just a junior you know and all that and you don't want to spend a butt load of money uh well not to do but but anyway yeah so so here's your floor free all right folks there you go but i got to tell you something my battery's going dead and uh i still will use because i'm not racing okay and i'm still going to use uh floral waxes when they're called for when the snow is super wet and when the snow is dirty uh and what not from dominator because they're still going to produce them and because they passed the epa uh regulations you know years ago so i will still use those but if you're racing you cannot contaminate your ski with any floral waxes because they're going to figure out how to test for that so anyway yeah i will still use the floral waxes when they're called for you don't need to use fluoro when it's not called for so anyway all right folks super excited super excited the dominator of floral free waxes again super super a lot of work put into these to create these uh polymers that act like floral and reports back on these uh guy told me that he was testing these with about seven national teams over in switzerland shortly ago and they said this elite line of wax was was top of the board there it was kicking some butt but you know remember ski based structure and all that always has a lot to do with everything too so got to have the right structure for the right temperature of snow etc etc combined with the right wax all right battery going down catching me a while ago all right big news big news big news folks tried to keep this video short but you know i talk a lot and i just i can't make a short video it's just really really hard but okay once again just before i check out you're a green you're a greeny you don't want to use florals but guess what now you've got a choice with these new polymers that act like florals but are not fluoros so maybe if you try some of these waxes here what you might find is that you might find your glide was better than ever before and again assuming that you have the right structure for the conditions and you know how to wax and learn how to wax so and it takes time to learn how to wax good but once you learn how to wax good boy look out look at me go baby look at me glide look at me glide all right catch you all while i'll go dominator floral free waxes yee haw", "WoDAdxbDW1Y": "right just a short video on Renaissance wax here as you can see is a buckler it's been cleaned it's not add anything applied to it yet slowly dry which is you must make sure it's dry before you put this wax on put on a radiator gentle heat make sure all the moisture has been driven out to the metals should stop clothing from within then so so easy Renaissance wax just wait your finger with very little needed and then just apply gently socks in very quickly back and front and that's covered it will dry like this on what it is here now but what it does is it gives you a nice air proof caught in so the air can't react against the metals there is no acids inside the wax unlike cannula works and many cooking oils rousseau know somebody's a petroleum or olive oil leave our dry and then back up with a little soft cloth and you can repeat the process a couple of times it builds up a layer and leaves your finds exactly how the museum the legacy as well and that's as easy as that", "Lu-2PoSmPpk": "what is going on YouTube family this is pressing peat the press and puffin coming at you

limonene point one five eight be pining 0.079 terminal 18 point oh seven eight PI nine point oh five six that's all she wrote folks now I picked this up on April 4th this is April 9th actually it's the 10th now and this was packaged on the 13th so not the freshest not the least fresh so you see it's still sealed at the nice little sticker there we're gonna change that real fast when we bust her open now these are those childproof containers I keep talking about the one that defeated me when I first got into the program it took my wife and I both to figure this damn thing out and even then we couldn't I finally got it so you have to push in on the two ends while pressing down on this tab and then you can pull the tray out like so that easy but it took I don't know why it took us a bit to figure it out now of course this is trim run it's usually what happens with the layer that's what you get that's the envelope break you're open it's dark you know I expect that with Alera it's not the darkest stuff I've ever seen with them actually actually this is better looking I'm surprised usually it's a weird green a weird green color but this is actually it not a bad color it's a nice amber it's a it's actually nice-looking shatter I'm surprised that's actually some of the better-looking stuff I've ever seen from Alera and I don't mind they're shatter it's a little expensive for my opinion for what it is but I [ __ ] with a shatter or sometimes when it comes around we have a nice big old fat chunk here we're gonna stick that bad boy they go i dabs stick that in there another little piece top it off now I almost forgot actually I did forget I broke that off and I wait I didn't weigh it so we're gonna weigh it without what I just put it in the Deb and we'll see exactly what we got here okay you folks saw me load up my two big chunks into my Jeep and connect so I've got two nice chunks in there the chamber is pretty full in fact I'll pull it out here so you can see so you can see that chamber is full chatter okay and I just weighed what was left 1.05 so it's probably you know pretty sight of this little over 0.1 I would say it actually 1.07 1.07 so I'm gonna say that that's probably 0.4 0.5 maybe so yeah with over not only was a better looking than normal but it was over which I like to see so shout out cool air for that at least let's crack into it and see how she tastes now like I said it's grape pie or grape stomper and cherry pie grape stomp or cherry pie so supposed to have you know sweet flavors to it but it's also supposed to be a little spicy from what I read we'll see alright cheers folks hmm Wow not too shabby okay mm-hmm I tasted it you got a little bit that grape little bit that cherry it does have that little bit of a nutty spicy exhale like I said that's actually an accurate description that they had yeah sweet and a little spicy I like it grape pie all day long yeah definitely a favorite for me as far as the lair goes time for a haircut again oh that's good stuff it's right where I wanted to be this morning having a rough day at bad night last night not having a good day this morning this whole corona virus things got my [ __ ] [ __ ] up my schedules off because of work being messed up so it messes with my sleep schedule messes with my routine and I don't know how many of you watching suffer from PTSD and anxiety but one of the things that keeps me functioning well is a routine it's not a lot of unexpected you know a general routine I mean I can have your usual daily stuff of things that get thrown at you but my whole world being thrown into turmoil like this is not good it's got me just freaking out for no reason ever I'm gonna have some reasons but I'm taking I'm freaking out to the extreme and I know it's to the extreme I just can't stop it - even though I'm aware of it I can't stop it from happening I just have to kind of try to roll with it and get past it it's kind of like back in the days when I used to you know trip I used to just have to tell myself look this is temporary it's only the trip it's just it's gonna go away so I have to tell I have to try to keep telling myself is this what I'm trying right now is you know medicating Aniki it's only temporary it's gonna change it's gonna go back to normal or you know obviously it's not gonna go back to the way everything used to be because nothing ever does but I just it is what it is so this is what I needed today because this is starting to calm me down it's making me feel a little better physically as well as mentally it's calming very calming I will say that I was pretty I was pretty anxious to worked up at the beginning of this I put on a happy face but I was pretty pretty upset when I started the video so it was nice to get a care package and to have some medicine so it's little things like that to brighten my day little things like that but it's huge to me oh yeah definitely like great pie that's one I'll buy again I don't care what you think about the company now that you just stand myself but there are some things I will buy I'll buy their flour because the press as well I won't vape it I think it's trash for that but it presses well makes good wax so I will buy it for that they're shattered once in a while if it's if it's great pie I'm getting it redheaded stranger I'm getting it um otherwise we'll see but those two all day just because I mean they're expensive for what they are but I like them so it is what it is I gotta be honest you know people can hate everyone you can jump on the bandwagon I hate to I hit on them too because they do have some garbage I'm not gonna lie but the same one oh this is good stuff this is actually the best chatter I've seen from mallero quality and effects it looks fantastic compared to the other stuff it's like this weird green color at least this had a good proper amber I mean it wasn't as clear as I'd like but it was a good proper amber color not that weird green [ __ ] also shut up - mama an ex-con John my business partner and best friend who makes these awesome rise & grind shirts hit him up they are awesome they are comfortable get him in long sleeve get him in short sleeve it don't matter I'll get it in a hoodie man I mean it's not that time of year but uh I wear hoodies all year-round so that's just me I know we're not doing the cannabis festivals but all the products will be available online through us just hit us up we can make that happen hopefully I'll have some prototypes here to show you personally I'm ice to channel otherwise check out ex-con John he's got him up there and some recent videos to show you what we got also like I said Prizm great pie by Alera it's a wind folks overpriced boy win I like it it's good stuff I'm not disappointed at all I actually kind of wish I bought a second one just because this one is pretty good its heady a little unfocused but its heady which is really needed right now is to kind of clear my head or at least clear of the bad stuff so if you are not a subscriber hit that button below we hit 200 thank you all that is freaking amazing I mean it's nothing in the grand scheme of things I'm a little nobody but 200 to me that's freakin unbelievable I never expected to have you know 200 subscribers and that's that's awesome guys you guys are fantastic thank you all so much for the love I'm I just also get 420 on Instagram last night so that was kind of cool I'm gonna have to look about doing a giveaway when we hit 420 on the YouTube channel we hit 420 on the YouTube channel and I'll do something crazy maybe I'll give away a piece of glass or you know something we'll think of something the closer we get to 420 we'll brainstorm it but if we can hit 420 this year dude yeah I'll do something I'll do something silly I'll give away something cool just because to me that's that's crazy numbers everyone else look oh and a thousand but ten it that's unheard of to me to me that's unfathomable 1,000 so far away that's unfair I'm at 200 and to me that was crazy I couldn't even picture that six months ago so thank you all as always be safe be well and keep on puffing", "24TrpNcccJ4": "hey what's up everybody focus focus feel like I'm at the [ __ ] Rainbow Gathering focus people all right hey so sorry it's been a while I've been super busy you know kombucha has been keeping me busy in the ladies new yoga studio so I apologize we've had a mishap in the grow it seems like the past couple cycles have been the I don't know the trouble cycles I guess but this time has nothing to do with the actual grow itself and it has to do with my $6,000 [ __ ] mini split going out so now I'm down to four lights at 600 and pulling in cold air from outside to finish this harvest off while Dyken comes out to repair my mini split it is covered by warranty but I still have to pay for [ __ ] labor so I'm a little burnt I mean this thing is a beast it's been doing a really good job for me and the one of the computer boards on the house side unit just fried for whatever reason so the warranty covers the board but it doesn't cover the labor and yeah so hmm anyway um I'm so [ __ ] ready for LED I can't even I can't even express it enough like I'm sick of dealing with this heat from these lights our power is really cheap here in Washington so I only pay when I'm running all eight of these at max power it only costs me about 300 a month so it's not that much to run I just you know I think I'm ready for LEDs so if somebody can help me out and point me in the direction of an LED unit that would be equal to or I know I've had some other people talk about le seas and whatnot so in the comments section by all means please give your opinions and advice on what like what fixture or LED would replace one kavita that way I can I could figure out how many of those I need to get to achieve the same yields I've been getting with these HBS I don't want to make a big change and then then end up getting less yield so yeah help me out folks let me know what I need to do I've been such an HBS head for so long I'm [ __ ] clueless I need to sit down with grill mouse or float on phantom anyway things are looking great in here really really frosty this phone will not focus there we go but if you've seen my Instagram and you can you can see these things are just frost coated and they're gonna be at six weeks on the first so all other [ __ ] in the room aside with the a/c and whatnot I'm pretty happy with the way things are looking they're starting to fill out and put get a little a little more dense but it's what's really impressing me is the defrost they're just so frosty so oh yeah just wanted to pop in and do a really quick video show you guys what's going on here I hate running the room not at full power because it really affects yield so the last half of the bloom cycle they're getting way less light than they were through veg in the first half of bloom but so it goes I mean I suppose I could run them like 24 hours of darkness and then switch the light cycle up so they're on during the daytime hard the lights are on at night and I'm pulling in the cooler night air I could probably run some more wattage then but at this point in the game I'm content with just flowering out what we got and then hopefully I can get this AC fixed in time for the next cycle which shouldn't be a problem anyway as you could tell the the stretch was pretty immense with this particular Fino again and it looks they've stopped stretching for sure in there and their fatten enough one thing I've noticed is that I've got absolutely zero fade at five weeks which is pretty interesting you know I think I'm starting to see a fan leaf in there that's starting to yellow a little bit so I think the fade is upon us hoping that in the next week or so we should really start to see things fade in here and I'll be honest with you a grape snapper is a really great resin producer but I personally I'm not liking the bud formations and the bud development they're really kind of sparse and it's not it's not the growing conditions it's not my soil it's just this drain some things just grow like that and I guess that's could be should be expected from all the stretch that it does it's been doing so and my minimalist approach I'm not adding [ __ ] bud swell and all this other [ __ ] to the soil and feeding it to the plants so this is the true expression of this particular these particular genetics and I think it's a [ __ ] focus Jesus anyway I think it's a great it's great material for pressing rosin and running you know for concentrates but not so great for the blood development so I think this is gonna be my last cycle running the grape stomp er it was cool but I'm ready to get back on the indica train so anyway down here things are looking great soil conditions are still really good you see [Music] lots of activity I'm sure these African nightcrawlers are loving these cold temperatures I mean that sucker is just cold I could feel them I get that's not a dead worm that's a cold worm the lights just came on out here so [Music] anyway the the soil structure itself is just so hot damn with focus already I don't know what to tell you guys there we go so there you go got some happy warm action but this the the soil structure is just great got really nice tilith and yeah living soil for the win again anywho for this next cycle the one coming up for cycle number seven any of you guys in my local area and by local area I mean Seattle Portland I'm looking for 30 starts of the same strain and of some quality proven genetics anybody who has the ability to help me out with that hit me up on the DM and let's chat I'm not looking for a handout so I'm definitely will compensate you for your material so I'm just putting that out there I've still yet to build the veg room proper it's pathetic but I just don't have the [ __ ] spacing here to do it my god I'm I'm maxed out in space like I don't I don't know what to do though I need I need to hire somebody to be my bedroom anyway yeah this is where we're at and really appreciate all your guys's encouragement there's been several times where I've just been so busy I've wanted to kind of hang up the tube but a lot of you get back to me and say they really appreciate the info that I share and you know I feel like at some level I need to honor that and continue just documenting my journey so other people can kind of see where I'm at and can use that information to help them make better decisions in the future so yeah thank you guys for your encouragement I really appreciate it and I'll keep you guys posted as things progress alright guys later", "hSzkNZ96FG8": "all right this is going to be a review of Renaissance micro crystalline wax polish again that's Renaissance micro crystalline and wax polish this comes in various sizes this is the two hundred milliliter size this is made in London it is a petroleum kind of based product and the cool thing about this is that this is the major choice for museums in England art galleries for the preservation excuse me a precious pieces professional conservators retailers amateur restores and private individuals throughout the world rely on Renaissance wax to protect their collections for home use yes I'm reading this cleans beautifully it lifts oil and dirt that other polishes may leave behind a removes buildup of waxes reveals fine detail of wood it's non stinging and non abrasive it restores and enhances renews fading colors and tired finishes he retains a matte finish one unpolished but buff star high polish boy the list you can use it on I'll just go through some of the major things would raw and finish leather parchment and paper metal including Silver's over a plate gold copper bronze ten zinc ten lead pewter stone marble onyx granite gems except porcelain excuse me except the amber it works on porcelain photographic prints believe it or not so I mean shoes furniture sculpture knives you name it this stuff does it I use this on my guns knives you name it once you start doing it it's kind of addictive it's pretty cool stuff man so I'm just going to show you um I've got a little solar panel here it's brand new but this is good for like a protective coating eventually this will go outside it's just trickle charges and it's got a little mounting bracket but you won't be able to see really the finisher that puts on here and this is not a smooth finish but um what it does is it actually just this will put like almost like a wax on a car or beat up so it protects it the main problem like with solar panels and stuff is what is the wear on the plastic and whether makes it dull so the some I can't get through good this one has magnifying pieces through it this is a real cool little device I'd do a review on it to 12o but here we have just a leather box container and we'll just put a little bit on here and maybe a little tough enough God knows how many times I've done this I don't think you have to do a lot but one my point is I don't the point the point is I don't know if you'll be able to see a huge difference because I've done it so many times got a little this is rad is kind of dirty just little sit on the table just doing some cleaning that has some cat fur and stuff on it dust whatever so maybe might be the best one for showing this so while let's see if we can see the difference here yeah you can kind of see right there the angle its mangle there you go look at that pretty good right there huh huh let's try another let's try another peaceful oh there's a card holder right yeah you pitched business cards in here you want look all professional this one accidentally accidentally Oh washed it wasn't my fault I just forgot it in my pocket so you know that stuff happens sometimes just happens so remember you can leave it as a matte finish or you can polish it to a shiny finish let's see if we can see the difference here a little harder see since I've done this with freaking hundred times then I give the light just right there we go you can see it there it's a little harder the camera so let's see what else we can do here did the box oh here yeah trap Trevor steam table I've done this a bunch of times too and we got the light coming through but again you can use this on granite so it will help preserve your your tabletops it will help I need a little bit of this goes a long ways I mean look how much I've used and I mean I've had this stuff so maybe that's probably a year I've done it on glass that's another thing it's really good at is glass you can do glass that has a distinct petroleum snow to it which I kind of like I don't know if you're supposed to like inhale it I'm not saying do that but I spy a pasta party with a soft paws buff gently drives hard and instantly resists spillage does not show finger marks you another thing it what it does it helps prevent finger marks which is really amazing your fingerprints don't show as much and I'm going to pause it here because I want to show you on something else okay this is a mirror yeah that cool yeah that's cool and see see yourself in the camera anyways I'll tell you I use a smear for in a minute but what my point is you can do this on glass looks pretty gross in it but you just put a real thin coat I don't have the best call to buff this stuff because on this it's pretty dusty maybe some dust off of it but it'll protect it we'll put a coating on here so your glass is less likely too hard for you to see yeah this is I just want you to see how clean it got it I don't know if you can tell here but it really does a good job how clean that thing is now woo-wee clean let me tell you a trick about a mirror dollar store mirror right I'm going to learn something else okay sorry this is in addition this is two-for-one you're not paying extra I'll give you this tip the tip of the day is that this is used let's say this is my stereo equipment my TV or whatever it's an amount and I am trying to get a connector in the back but I don't want to pull the thing out because the wires and all the mess this is what you use your right chair you go now of course it says input and output it's going to be backwards because you're looking at a mirror however it sure is a lot easier when you're going to do the RCA plug to see what you're doing because I mean how many times have you taken a plug and say which one is it you plug in the wrong one or you can't see it and you're getting onto getting tired so this and would you do with it stereos are a little feet and of course they're bigger than this box I'll just store it right under there leave a little bit of this out and that way it's always where I can get to it so I'll pull it out from stereo and if I need to rewire something and for a dollar you can put it behind every stereo that you've got all right so neat trick on wiring I should do a whole video on it because I can show you what it does show you how to do it but yeah you know if you got a big item and it's sitting there you know you can do this and you can see the wiring behind it you can see everything it's right trust me for a dollar go to the dollar store get you four or five of these two of them however many you need for a dollar you put it by underneath stereo equipment if you want to put in a drawer that's sound - okay where you store the thing so right now we're doing a review I got off track so my advice is this product is obtainable online Amazon eBay whatever I could care less where you buy I'm just telling you the stuffs good I'm just telling you this stuff is well worth it I'm just telling you should have some in your house and I'm just telling you if you don't you're missing out on a good product it works great on metal surfaces it works great on stone surfaces glass services towels leather man I'm going to bring my wallet in here if is that that that you can see it good but anyways this is what I'm recommending for this review Renaissance microcrystalline wax polish 73", "1lo5liKkQ-k": "[Music] hello Andrew Wharton burger here Caesar Guarini we're still in the stockroom as you can see and we're going to talk about another level of protection for your hand oil hand rubbed oil finished stock so additional protection for the stock would be to actually wax it we have our stock here with a intact finish we've touched it up to whatever degree we've decided to with our boiled linseed oil now it's dried cured we're gonna add some wax to it as a protection so this is just furniture wax it's available at any hardware store this happens to be min wax but Minwax Johnson's paste wax Renaissance wax there's all kinds of different products they all do basically the same thing so I'm going to get a little bit of this wax on my applicator rag I'm going to dab it onto the stock onto the areas I want to protect this process won't replace any oil that's missing but it will protect the oil that is there I'm gonna gently buff it in and this process is very much like waxing your car or anything else this wax is there has a additional layer of protection for the beautiful oil finish I want to be careful that I don't get this into the checkering again same rules apply as did in our previous video about oil finishes once that's been applied let it dry for a moment or two I'm going to take a clean dry cotton cloth and just buff the surface removing the excess wax leaving behind that nice protective film but that's going to give me a nice bright sheen as well as another level of protection for my beautiful piece of wood on my Caesar green again hopefully this is helpful to you if you have any questions or concerns or ideas that we can help with please give us a call or contact us today at green e usa.com [Music] you [Music]", "nEHRymKCAPM": "hey guys it's Melanie happy Sunday today I actually have a vendor wax haul to share with you guys I'm in full disclosure waxy dude did contact me on Instagram and asked me if he could send me some of his wax melts to be able to share

Bath and Body Works where is it I was snooping through the box so I'll have to find it but yeah he has an incredible dupe for Bath & Body Works nutmeg and spice so if you are like me and you hate Bath & Body Works for never bringing that back sorry did you guys hear my dog sneeze if you miss that fragrance I'm telling you he does an incredible dupe of it his has a little bit more cinnamon than the Bath & Body Works version but it's so so similar anyway let's talk about the code that he provided for you guys so he sent me a nice little sheet of paper um so if you guys use the code Melanie so mal anie all capital letters you can get 15% off any order so whatever you guys have in your cart 15% off with that code which is awesome and it's not like Commission thing like I don't I don't get anything if you order it you know I'm very thankful that he sent me this stuff to try but I don't like get anything else so you guys know the promo will expire at 11:59 p.m. on Monday April 30th so make sure that you guys order in the next few weeks if you're interested in trying anything from waxy dude I'm also follow him on Instagram I will link his Instagram and down below and let's get into my way I'm so excited ma I've already sniffed a little bit okay so here we have cardamom and teak so this is one of his clam shells here and I did knock this box around a little bit while I was moving so some of the lake little designs and stuff got broken but that was totally my fault oh you guys this is a really beautiful scent this is not something that I will probably keep I think this one and there's a couple other ones that I know that my brother would absolutely love they're much more manly sense and cardamom and teak is a very masculine scent it's beautiful and if you are looking for just a really romantic slightly more masculine like bathroom type scent this would be amazing you guys I really get that like woody teak note and I also get a little bit of that cardamom um I will of course be melting these over the next few weeks and be sharing with you guys my thoughts in my weekly home fragrance roundup so do stay tuned for some reviews of these next is oriental tobacco which is another one that I think my brother would love tobacco scents are usually not my favorite this one is lighter it is a much lighter scent I also pick up a little bit of citrus in this one for some reason but there's also that like earthy like spicy type of note as well which is what I'm guessing that like oriental note is in here it's really nice but it's definitely a dude scent it is very much a dude sense so there's that frosted lemon squares I'm excited about this um it's so fresh and you know what I actually get a crust in this like a graham-cracker type of crust no but the lemon is not a lemon pledge cleaner scent at all it is very like fresh-squeezed sugary lemon it's really nice I cannot wait to warm this in fact I think this one is probably gonna be one of the first downstairs now I do want to cure these for just a couple more weeks before I actually start melting them but I'm gonna like start designating them to like their rooms where they're gonna melt and then in like another week or so I'm going to cuz these are like all pretty fresh pours so this one is he says melt after four or five so he may have actually already cured this I'm gonna try it if it's not strong enough for me I'll cure it for another couple weeks and then I'll come back to it um this one was poured 3 to 18 so this one's probably good this one's over a month old ooh this is downy April fresh just going in my laundry room this smells exactly like downy like the original downy oh that's good that's totally going in my laundry room so excited about that this is southern sheets this is another laundry scent that I loved when I open this I was like oh this is more of like a line dried fresh cotton type of scent this one's beautiful you guys and I love I love this type of bar where like you have to like chunk it up yourself I think it's nice to have these like individual serving sizes but I also kind of like the bars where you have to chunk them up yourself I just think it's fun to do that um so here's the nutmeg and spice here it is okay he totally tossed a couple of these in here for me because he knows that I love it you guys it's so it's so almost dead on it is so close the only thing is that there's just that hint of cinnamon that is it's almost just a touch too much cinnamon but it's so incredibly close I actually just went through all my candles and organized them and I found my remaining two nutmeg and spice and I compared it by side it's incredibly close to you guys so here I have Hawaiian pink hibiscus and then Jen's lavender caramels I haven't opened this one I want to have your caramel this smells mostly just like caramel to me no there's some lavender there totally is a little bit there is just that like tiny hint of lavender but it's more caramel and it's like a rich like creamy caramel that's actually pretty nice I don't normally like caramel too much that's this smells like Hawaii this smells like a tropical flower it's beautiful that's the name pink hibiscus right that's beautiful I really really like that one that's a nice floral so let's take a look at some of these different formats here so these are like kind of a larger scent shot so this one here is cotton candy mmm about this this one's it's cup it's pretty light but it does very much smell like a clean cotton kit like like a blue raspberry cotton candy not like the pink cotton candy like the blue raspberry I think I'm gonna keep this one for this room this one is blue cotton candy so funny I think that this once more smells like the blue raspberry cotton candy than this one does I take it out of here this one doesn't really smell like cotton candy to me it just smells like sweetness like sugary kind of generic sugary sweetness not like generic bad but just sugary sweetness I guess that cotton candy is fun shudder so there's that but anyway we have so many more to go through are there any other format okay how about the cute little shapes all of these little funnies they're so cute mom's peanut butter cookies yes totally smells like peanut butter cookies you guys that's good okay that's staying with me my brother's not getting that one oh that's good that's going in my kitchen uh tropical cake this smells like pina colada I don't get cake I smell pina colada I smell pineapple and I smell like coconut cream it's nice but I hope I get some cake when I'm warming it so that's going in the kitchen oh my he packed this box fool you guys this was super generous of him um peachy keen rose I don't know that I'm gonna have time to go through all these because this video is gonna be so long but peach and Rose that's amazing I would never think to put those two together oh you guys should try this okay if you place an order you need to try this that is phenomenal it's not old lady rose it's like fresh garden rose and like fresh juicy ripe peach one more blackberry Moss that's different that it's slightly masculine with that like green earthy moss eerie note and then there is a fruity it's a fruity berry note I don't know that it's blackberry necessarily but it is a fruity berry note that's really good these are also good so he also sent along tiki bar watermelon salad okay we have to smell this one this smells like a watermelon pina colada that's talk smells like it smells really good that's going in my kitchen kitchen pile um what

wax empties i think this is my third one yeah this is my third one on this channel this is my weekly or i should say every friday i post a video like this so yeah and i'm really sorry that that this

blue coop i finished up their waffle in cinnamon bun i liked it i loved this one actually i would repurchase it um my mom wasn't a fan of it because she got more of the sweetness than cinnamon and this is buddy trying to steal my spotlight little man dude you are supposed to be in bed dude dude dude hey oh you're so cute anyways but for me i really love cinnamon bun it was a nice combination of sweetness and cinnamon you know um i would repurchase it but not anytime soon until i move out this one was in breakfast club this one was just way too mapley dude mommy is working this is way too maple but it had a nice cinnamon and nutmeg type of fragrance but it was just really heavy on the maple okay from goose creek this was a clamp this was a clam shell in cookies and milk and for a chocolate fragrance this was actually really nice i would repurchase that it it didn't leave my room smelling like like a really thick chocolate no you know how hot cocoa and cream from bath and body works can tend to leave like a heaviness in the air if you know what i mean because it's really rich and decadent this one is really nice it's more toned down but it throws amazing and then this one was actually in my melting basket this week this is an iced lemon sugar cookies i have three more um full uh clam shells of this this is very light you barely get anything out from this so i usually do two cubes with this scent or you can mix it with some other citrus scents i probably will repurchase just because i really love the fragrance and it's a little bit of a lighter fragrance but you still get a little bit of something you know and then the last one i finished up was also in my melting basket and this is in peach cobbler from the dandelion wish candle and gift company and this is premium soy wax blend with notes of sliced peaches sugar cinnamon and buttery pastry not my favorite peach scent i would not repurchase this it didn't really smell like peach you most you more so got the buttery pastry more so the peach you know but yeah i know this isn't a lot but with me working two jobs and barely having time in between my shifts to come home and change out my wax and all that i didn't really go through a lot so yeah but i'm really glad that i made progress on these because like i do have a lot of wax i have a lot and you know it brings me happiness to have home fragrance

about Hindi you'd are specifically Hindi would because I think it's it's something which is quite confusing as you know who this agarwood it is a fragrant material found in nature it can be completely natural wild imagine an old agarwood tree these these trees can grow very tall and they can live for many many years so imagine a tree in nature hit by lightning hit by torrential rain soaking the perfect temperature the sunlight that's provided by the northeastern region in India it gets beautiful beautiful amount of sunlight and the nature is completely undisturbed so the stree has been there for for we can say decades in decades sometimes even 100-year old trees even older trees are found which have developed you know an immune process against these natural stimuli that's how who'd come to be good is a natural resin which is found in agar wood trees and not in all our wood trees in a very weakened say small percentage of of the total number of aggregate trees in an area and that's how this fragrant material came into the hands of man accidentally and it has been in use since thousands of years now not just in the Middle East the Middle East fascination with woods is not new and it is during it was during the travels in the ancient world that these people came to know about wood people in China people in Japan people in the other Southeast Asian countries and then of course its birthplace which is India I'm talking about Hindi you people have been aware of agarwood since a very very long time so it was used as incense as you can see here I have displayed these beautiful resonated woods this is how other wood looks like you can see all these wood chips covered covered in this brown sort of resin this this pigmentation that is look at this pattern specifically and you can see it looks like a bird's feather I mean the skin of it an eagle more specifically that's why it's also known as eagle wood so this is how a Garuda looks like these are some beautiful chips so the purpose of these ships is that you can directly put them on gentle heat and it lets out of a beautiful smoke the lovely scent of agarwood the incense and you can apply to your clothes it's going to it's going to be there for a very very long time and it's it's going to smell absolutely divine this is the actual smell of a guru that I'm fond of naturally people get more inclined to woods as they progress in their journeys it starts from these conventional perfumes then people start chasing actual oils so actual oil what is an ood oil wood is basically they still like any other natural material like whatever like roses or any other things found in nature you can distill and you can take out oil from these woods from these soaked woods and you have yourself a beautiful collection of these lovely Indian food oils hardcore Barney has people people call it and of course there are some other naughty ways of describing the scent of the Indian agarwood people call them fecal at times so you know people have different associations with smell and different cultures to contribute to your experience I would say that Indian foods are typically balsamic extremely leathery mostly leathery and then you've got the beautiful the quintessential the bonafide smell of the sweetness this the sour sweetness I would say that comes from berries these these little fruity berries that you get in nature it's got that that kind of smell and of course the strong incense smell that now you find an egg of wood smoke precisely that is what an old oil should smell like now this this fermented part well where does the where does this come in because as I said when you put one of these these chips on gentle heat you will not get that fecal smell or that Barney smell yes it does it does smell a bit funky but it's not off-putting in in any way so what happens during the process of distillation when people are distilling these these oils they leave these woods to be soaked so that they become more pulpy and they are easier to distill and of course you can produce more quantity of of the oil you can extract more so in this process fermentation occurs just like how alcohol is produced fermentation occurs that introduces that slightly putrid smell that Indian earth has been associated with for for probably the last fourth of five decades Indian wood is not supposed to be Barney or fecal in any way in fact if you put any food on from any region let's say Chinese wood Burmese whoo the Sri Lankan wood Cambodia knew that I would Malaysian or whatever it is if you put put any part of it of this chip on a heater you will have the typical sweet resin a smoky incense you smell but of course the regional central very to a certain degree to a very minor degree I would say there can be some beautiful additional notes there can be some off-putting words like what you get from these coastal sort of woods especially the gathering of species so the oil smells you know it is reminiscent of extra lacquered wood but it's not completely representative of what the wood smells like that's that's a fact that needs to be cleared right here right now you can see these beautiful mysore sandal chips as well these are also used in incense many parts in many parts of the world especially India we've been making and using in census from sandalwood for a very very long time even the Japanese many many dedicated incense houses love sandalwood you can find some of the best old sandalwood material in these parts of the world and sandal was a sandalwood is relatively cheap agarwood is becoming you know the next big thing it has already become so let me go through this collection of hindi you doyle's that I have I will talk about the various profiles it's a very interesting subject so it's it's I think it will provide you with a lot of information a Garuda Sam is the name of the house that I source my in the Udo it's from of course I have lot lot of stuff from inside as well I have a lot of authors from them Jacques is the artist there just like in SAR is fallens are wood and adam is for feel wood the highs for a Ghidorah many of these respected guys have wonderful works that's how I got introduced to actually my first introduction to real lose oil was through Adam field and then ends our would but ends our is someone who has inspired me greatly so I progressed from these international artists then I found Zakir and then I got the real taste of Indian food he had some of the most precious food oils that one could imagine imagine of one could think about extremely precious woods like this one Lucia Hills a gentle sweet resinous incense EW oil which is so smooth this almost honey like the sweetness is exceptional in this scent and it's not Cambodia sweet it's not your typical fruity sweet this is the softest this is the most gentle sweetness that one can experience there is there is some bar and there is some leather to it there is you know an accompanying note of something tap Enoch something you know more like material which is used to polish wood something like that and that can also be found in many many other oils especially the Malaysian oils but this oil is so rich so smooth right from the first sniff it becomes one with your body it is such a lovely scent with almost meditative spiritual properties and it will help you when you are in a bad mood it'll really make you smile it's that kind of an oil very very old just settle down you can smell the edge of this old oil and this is I believe more than 20 years old so it has aged to perfection the sweetened to an exceptional level beautiful material I don't think he has it let me talk about the second oil the atom soon now this is a wonderful Naga profile compare the color on these this is slightly muddy dirty this one is clean reddish and this is another beautiful Indian wood profile that one can experience and this will give you the sweetness of the more expensive vietnamese woods woods that are known as chiara keenum so initially there is a lot of a lot of leather illness to this fragrance it's intensely spicy typical northeastern spice think about chilies think about spices in ten spices and [Music] that's what you get in this fragrance very very typical of that area it's very smoky and then the scent settles down into this this ethereal sweetness I would say it is completely completely different from the opening it takes it takes quite a while to get there and you need a beautiful Pleasant weather that day to be enjoying this scent it is a very demanding scent so I specifically wear this in winters because that's the perfect time and the sweet vist that come later during its progression the same progression I mean that is something of an experience it's it's so unique so stimulating so relaxing so wonderful and that's the most wonderful thing about these woods these natural others that we produce here in India and other parts of the world they will never offend your nose they are never off putting there never never do heavy on your breathing system so if you are someone with an allergic respiratory system you don't have to worry about you know any nasal congestion which follows with stronger perfumes that happens to me that's why I use these natural materials during the winter season during the winters it really helps and agarwood has this this beautiful spiciness that eases nasal congestion throat congestion stuff like that so it's something which feels very very natural and Adam song is one of his finest oils it's one of the most beautiful oils that comes from the region of nagaland from the northeastern wild the wilderness of northeast India it is it is a very secluded remote spot and this oil really makes the whole experience so special now let me talk about Raja Laos look at the color on this an extremely dark brown almost resin a starry sort of thickness Raja Laos is another old dude from the house of Agra wood Sam this was produced by Jacques late uncle who sadly passed away I think two or three years back and he used to talk highly about him I have some of his photographs that Jacques used to share and for such a wonderful thing to see his whole family engaged in who that's it's his father had had been selling wood to clients all over in Sri Lanka the Middle East and many parts of the world so he's not the first in his family he's not like a new adventure he just realized that he had to get into the world of woods and it just happened by chance he got the response he saw that he has a beautiful collection of oils from his uncle from his father from those times and he's been doing a fantastic work and that's how a guru does have the brand came to be so it's it's something of a legacy for this guy I've been to his home I've met his father I've seen what happens in his family all the kids even the kids are engaged they sniff food oils together they burn Bach who together this is my cool this is what natural bug food not a synthetic one so I've seen what goes on in this family and it's a culture that truly amazes me these guys are from Assam which is the oldest wood producing region in the world so these oils have these oils carry the beautiful legacy of these food vendors it's lovely this oil is one of my favorites you can see this this is from the year 1995 so it's a very very old oil and it's absolutely phenomenal the sweetness they almost vine like sweetness a little bit of terpenes almost impossible to find this oil now with one of the most awarded oils in in the community one of the most respected and moussaka prices are exceptional this was launched at about 150 US dollars or some I think even lesser for 3 grams which is quite less for such a beautiful aged artisanal oil and then it becomes sweet it's got the sweet tartness of cambodia new oils but at the same time it carries the darkness of the typical Indian lousy and sort of you know profile Barney dark cherry liqueur sort of scent very beautiful material let's talk about something else now yes another gem from this house this is Manik 2 0 1 1 so comparatively I would say this is an old oil so almost 9 years old this was one of his favorite food oils and this gotten a lot of attention along with is another fantastic scent another fantastic oil which I could never get ahold of known as kala kasi has stock shell so kalakashi as you know is a like a sub Indian profile I would say sweetness it's got that sweet lemony sort of sand which is also reflected in this this beautiful oil Manik it means a gem in the Indian language system so this is intensely Barney you get the notes of fermentation in this with oil it's almost a vac see you can see wax can be that in all oils it's not like this ooh this cut with something else so this scent is extremely extremely sour it has the typical fermented notes but it's not cheesy or salty as you would expect like you get from lousy and synthetic foods or plantation roots that you find in conventional or niche perfumery it's completely devoid of that it's a beautiful scent that of course needs your patience slow progression takes takes its own time to develop the sweetness that wonderful sweet lifts of the typical Indian agar wouldn't sense that most would converse laughs that's the most beautiful aspect of India new Indian others like the holy grail it brings you the happiness the spirituality the the natural connection that you are expecting in such oils it would really take you to places I cannot guarantee you hallucinations or something supernatural that many of the vendors promise nothing of that sort happens it has never happened to me but it has at times given me a surge of rave it has it has provided me with the utmost comfort especially when I'm meditating or before I go for my morning runs or intense exercises I really love putting on these oils so it's not a fashion statement for me it has become part of my reality part of my spiritual being part of my happiness so Manik is an oil which is relatively fresh does not have the smoothness of these aged oils but it'll get there that's the most wonderful thing about these oils of I have this for the last four years I believe it's aging if you keep on aging you know as I get all this this this oil will become smoother and smoother now these are the newer oils from socket let me talk about this legend as well mighty mighty another beautiful oil from the northeastern region and it's got a typical spicy so by this time you must have realized that when I say Northeast region non East non Northeast non asam region asam is typically this Manik or what's there what else is there okay let's say Manik it is your typical a Sam oil where you have barn eNOS these are northeastern non-us a Moines so these tend to be spicy does not have your typical Assamese tamarind chutney or Imlay chutney are called these are more spicy more vacci and mighty it's got this this beautiful ancient hoody character to it along with its peppery spiciness peppery fiery less it's extremely extremely Wakita extremely stimulating when you wear then you variate it'll give you a spicy jolt and that's something which is also found in Adam so these these will give you a spicy jolt and almost hot fiery jolt to your olfactory system immediately your head will go boom and that's that's something which is very typical of these northeast yunnan northeastern known as I am boards so think of areas like Mahalo especially the Nagaland region naga region these oils are exceptional in their spiciness and then the scent keeps on changing into the sweet incense eNOS that you get from the more expensive precious oils from legends are or aha I mean a very few of their oils are of this calibre they're Indian oodles of course they are they are great when it comes to you know these Southeast Asian wound oils from Vietnam or from Malaysia all these expensive food oils rare rude oils they have this typical characteristic this lifting sort of a scent but when it comes to India nude I think this is this is top-notch work this is one of the most amazing sense which is close to the actual a girl would smoke experience incense experience it just just shakes your whole system it's such a beautiful and you know relaxing sort of send it can be used with the other expensive precious oils that you have rose oils your exceptionally rare actual my sauce and oil maybe some hookahs of witches you're not Indian whatever the concentrated highly concentrated extremely complex Lucas these layer beautifully and if you layer these scents like Rose cuts sandalwood and Anne who love this caliber I mean the experience is just divine and you're here for M expedience you're not here to listen about bloody Chanel's and all these a your own kind of sense these are boring you want to explore more you want to have something in your collection with depth with something natural probably we lean naturally towards national things that that could be one of the reasons and oils like mighty really make me wonder when people talk about Hindi Oats do they even have the experience I have had one of these artisans even traveled over to India and explored these these places are met with these old Indian note sellers now being being cynical here but at the same time I am being honest with my experiences I haven't seen an oath of this caliber outside the agarwood the same realm and that was my idea of the India knew that I used to consider their Indian foods as the finest I know this is a bit controversial but it is true and I am pretty sure by this time most of you are aware of these things most of you can make your own reviews compared notes you know compare the olfactory profiles there was a time when people could not distinguish between these olfactory smells and now we have a whole group of people talking about woods and bass notes and many other forums who they'd garu Hudak has been there for a long time there who has been there for a long time these guys have been enjoying moods longer than me of course these guys cannot be beat with their experiences but agarwood Assam happened to us at the same time and then we compared these same profiles and we got to know but apart from all this nonsense and all this good business behavior the most important thing is the experience and all of these vendors are providing us with an exceptional insight into the natural world of perfumes and I think it's always better to experience everything before you make a judgement compare learn unlearn relearn that's the whole process and that's how I have understood what good actually is and specifically this let's talk about the other roots now this would lose all is another it's not good so let's keep this aside Buddha John now I'll talk about these in one go because I think this is already a very long video the Buddha John will give you look at the color on this one this is another thick waxy good oil which will give you the profile of Assam so by now you know it is Barney it's it's sour sweet and sour berries tamarind chutney stuff like that so who the John gives you that sort of scent it's almost like Manik but it's not as refined as old it smells like a fresh oil then we have these three beautiful modern food oils the smell of this typical kalakashi accord which is the sweet lemony Accord kalakashi aghast will give you that sweet lemony experience then you have kalakashi Naga which is more spicy which is spicier which is hotter and of course will give you more and then you've got this half long half long Mahal dal so all these come from northeastern region the non Assam region and all these will have your typical kalakashi I smell kalakashi is nothing special kalakashi is just an average grade of food by the way guys many people have many brands and use that word to you know put emphasis to their expensive more expensive oils but nothing of that sort exists in India there's nothing called as kala kasi Hill as people believe alright kalakashi is just a word to describe the bark of the banana trees and most of the I have seen it with my own eyes so I can tell you so kalakashi is just a sub Indian profile which is typically used by commercial grade wood manufacturers from these plantations to to provide you provide the masses with a good quality oil which is sweet which is sweeter less Barney and smells of smells like a perfume more than an actual experience so you don't have to wait for things to happen on your skin you immediate there's immediate gratification so if you're looking for immediate gratification I'm not saying these oils out of that sort I'm just saying that's what colic I see people you know thrive to give you an immediate gratification it's not a bad thing half long well that will take some time kalakashi Naga will take some time and of course Calathes yoga's will take some time to get there Calathes kalakashi yoga's is the simpler version and of course the lighter looking version of this kalakashi sweetness so we have so many sub Indian profiles in the India category I hope you had fun in today's episode got to learn something and keep trying various oils different regions will give you different scent profiles and the reason why I'm saying this is because some people might not like Indian whose oils even though they are highly prized you don't have to may be the Sri Lankan wood will connect to you better maybe you will connect better with these Thai fruity oils it's all about your own personal needs your preferences and your own experiences but when it comes to the actual Hindi o'the oils you can see there are so many sub profiles and so many misconceptions I hope I have cleared all those and the last word of course the woods get yourself these woods these actual pieces put it on a burner put it on a coal whatever whatever you can get hold of try to experience that smell try to fumigate your clothes once like the people in the Middle East - it's something of a beautiful experience it's something that I really love seeing in their culture the smell the raw smell of agar wood coming off your clothes is is an exceptional experience it's an experience which which was which really shook me it amazed me it showed me so many new things about food it should it showed me food as who's supposed to be it's supposed to be fumigated with it's supposed to be burnt supposed to be heated rather than put into these little wires this is just convenience but here there's an artisan who provides you with the nearest experience that you can have and that's something I really cherish but this is the real deal the agra wood chips the Baku's the incense the doop or the agarbatti as we call call these here in India and the crushed pieces the crushed powder made into incense sticks that what is known as ever but in India so this is the real experience it will truly show you the natural unadulterated you know all factory spectrum of food will give you a very unique olfactory thrill which I which I crave that's what I look for something unique something new in my sense need a conventional perfume be it a natural perfume the unique is what I crave so I'll end my video here guys and there's a lot to talk about rising rising sorry rising phoenix has been on my mind for a long time now he's waiting to do a review I'll do that pretty soon we have some Chinese with oils yeah from unexpectable company plantation which is probably one of the biggest distillers in China beautiful unique oil some real some really unique distillation techniques very different looking or oils this is going to be an interesting video so and then my video here guys and thank you very much for your patience thank you very much for watching as always take care goodbye see you in another fragrance of you stay tuned

video for you today because we've had some queries coming in regarding the correct working temperature for opal so I just wanted to do a visual on the wax and actually show you the correct working temperature what you'll see first of all is the centre the core of the wax will always remain quite solid so throughout the day that may shrink slightly but try and avoid actually mixing that all into the pot we're going to be working with this juicy stuff around the edge so temperature-wise you are looking at the wax being around 52 to 56 depending on room temperature and time of year but the better way to actually show you the working temperature of opal is what I call a visual consistency check with your wax on the spatula so what you'll see with that on the spatula is it's it's like a thick honey I'm not having to get my hand underneath to catch any running wax and it just sits and takes a little while before it will run off of the spatula so again it needs to sit like a thick honey so it takes a while to drop off and that will show you the perfect working consistency for opal I'm also going to show you some application for the opal so you can see at the correct working temperature how it should go on okay so correct application for Opel so I've got my wax on the spatula like a thick honey and then when you apply you're going to deposit make sure you're stretching supporting the skin and really firmly press your wax into the area so these here are creating a stretch so I can let go and the polymers can then shrink the wax onto the hair takes about five six seconds to sit and then we need to put a stretch in front to remove use the tip of your spatula to lift your edge adjust your stretch and off", "2tstiVq4hEg": "[Laughter] you're too funny girl but why

Illinois becoming the 11th state to pass a bill legalizing recreational marijuana use which would go into effect January 1st 2020 let's bring in Charles Bach tell he's the co-founder and CEO press co.labs one of the largest multi-state operators in the country headquartered in Illinois Charlie great to have you with us thanks for having me so what are you doing to gear up for Jan 1 2020 in terms of your own company you know without a doubt expansion capex you know the the supply that's gonna be needed to meet that demand you're talking about a state that is going from a relatively conservative medical program we have about 70,000 patients and it currently to the fifth largest state in the country thirteen million people over a hundred million tourists a year that anybody over the age of 21 are gonna have access to the program we think it's a 10 to 20 x over the current size of the the medical market Illinois is one of the biggest or will be one of the biggest marijuana markets in the country by state and so I'm thinking of the example of California everybody looked at California thinking that's gonna be one of the biggest markets in the country and the tax revenues were really disappointing for the first full year of full legalization of 2018 a big part of that was this thriving black market and in a big part of the bulb thesis for pot companies and pot investors is the notion that you can convert every dollar in the black market to a dollar in the white market in the legal market how do you view that in Illinois and and the rest of the country for that matter in terms of that thesis and where we are in cracking down on the illegal sales so a great question in and one of the biggest distinguishing factors between what we saw in California and what we're going to see in Illinois California sort of put regulations in place for the first time right Illinois already changed the way that medical cannabis was done it really created gen2 of medical cannabis which was highly regulated compliance focused and these limited licenses so it's a very controlled program it is a very professional well-run program so we're building on the back of that type of a program and you know the the legislature did a great job of marrying increased opportunity increased acts retha points of sale while at the same time really giving the current operators the current infrastructure the opportunity to be first to market because we have the infrastructure in place we can flip the switch Jan 1 2020 as opposed to having to go through an application process and have new people get on boarded and get up to speed which they will but the current infrastructure is there to take care of that from day one so from an illicit market standpoint you know I think we have a great chance of converting a lot of the incumbent illicit market because Illinois doesn't have its own inherent illicit market that's all imported from out of state so as soon as we get our infrastructure and our adult use program launched we give a we give residents in Illinois a great opportunity to participate in California for instance where they actually I broke the product there in Illinois will be easier to sort of to get rid of that illicit market you're a multi-state operator though where are you facing some challenges where do you see the most opportunity in in various states yeah so our thesis really lies in we we look at the regulatory structure first and foremost we like regulation we like they're being obligations on the operators we like controls in place and then we look for big populations so you know of our 11 state footprint 7 of the 10 most populated states in the US and then the other 4 have very you know high strategic value to Nevada with Las Vegas and Massachusetts with adult years gonna happen yeah you know New York New York will and that's one of the great things about Illinois pulling this off first state to ever pass a robust regulated adult use cannabis program through the legislature and so I know that the the conversations in Albany and likewise in New Jersey lately have been can you do this or does this need to be a ballot initiative Illinois as shown them you could do this through the legislature Charlie great to have you with us thank you I'm maksoon Charlie backed out of Cresco Bradley you've been trading this space so Kronos so yesterday I had a headline that be of a upgraded it on its p'tee so if you look at it's up over 50% Chara charles stock is up over 50% as well you have to buy the top best in breed names you have to buy the large cabbage names here they're the ones that are gonna gobble up all the smaller names so just stick instead of sticking with one name buy a couple of these names make your own CBD ETF or pot or cannabis ETF you you you", "-h2xWLbXkT8": "From feet and urine to bondage and other inanimate objects like leather, people have all sorts of interesting sexual desires and fetishes. But is being aroused by non-living objects or non-genital body parts normal? Within the brain what you find sexy is a combination of cognitive, emotional and physical processes. Of course the private aspect of sexual behavior has made studying fetishes challenging. To get around this, one study used online Yahoo groups to estimate the relative frequency of atypical sexual preferences. Looking at 5000 online users, researchers discovered that the greatest number of fetishes were not just of body parts but of objects associated with body parts like shoes or headphones. Popular groups included bodily fluids and body size but the most popular group was by far the feet and toes. This is because there's actually a Neurological basis for foot fetishes. If we investigate this visual map showing which areas and proportions of the brain are dedicated to processing sensory functions, we see that feet, toes and genitals are all physically right beside each other in the brain. One study was able to highlight this link between sexual desires and brain regions with the man who experienced epileptic seizures as well as a fetish for safety pins. After getting a partial temporal lobectomy or removing part of his brain, both his seizures and sexual fixation on safety pins stopped. Sexual fantasies likely developed during early experiences as this is when there is more synapse formation and neurogenesis in your brain. Sexual imprinting is the process in which we and other animals learn the characteristics of desirable mates at a young age, often influenced by those who raised us. one study found that adopted daughters end up choosing husbands with a significant resemblance to facial traits of their adoptive fathers. Women who report having a more supportive emotional relationship with their fathers were also more likely to choose mates with similar features to their dads than those who had negative relationships with their fathers. But with fetishes this sexual imprinting can be with objects as well. A study using two groups of sexually naive lab rats had one group wear a small Velcro jacket during their first sexual experience while the other group, the control wore nothing. When sexually mature, the control group displayed a normal copulation behavior whether wearing the jacket or not whereas the jacket group were unable to achieve sexual arousal without their jackets. This same study has been done with other objects and had similar results. This could explain why a person with a leather fetish may have difficulty getting off without leather. A separate study on rats had one group of male rat pups lie on bedding scented with lemon and the other group lie on unscented beds. For their first sexual experience, they had the option of two sexually receptive females one scented with lemon and one without. The control group mated with either female at a normal frequency while the lemon laying group preferred lemon scented females. But these specific desires or preferences could be blocked by a naloxone which blocks endorphins or the feel-good neurotransmitters from binding to the opioid receptors in the brain, thus blocking the sexual reward that is attributed with the velcro jacket or the smell of lemons. While we know a lot about rat fetishes, there isn't much research on rare sexual preference in humans and in the past they were often listed as mental disorders. But while your specific sexual desires and fetishes may be unique to you and your experience, modern science does show that having one in the first place is a normal part of being human. And if it isn't harming you or someone else, they can exist as part of a healthy sex life.

video um be the last one before i get stuck into my day job um will be about teddy bees so teddy bees i had uh are ready to ship and a pre-order both of them were on the small side um i've got eight clams and then a few sample shots um and all of the big all everything both the pre-order and the ready to ship i got big clams now i can't remember which was pre-order which was ready to ship they're just still mixed in together um so yeah i'll get stuck straight into these samples now i don't have all of the notes i don't have the notes on the samples um so she does generally does two scent shots per order um which i think is cool so first sample is strawberry pound cake i've had her strawberry pound cake before it's really nice um i'm not the biggest fan of pound cake strawberry pound cake um it's okay but her strawberry pound cake i tested about four different vendors at the same time and hers was by by far my favorite so it actually smells i actually get a bit of the cake note and the strawberry is really nice so i hers is the only one that i actually want to melt it's not still not one that i'm gonna reach for crazy amount but it's a really nice scent um tiff's favorite birthday cake i'm hoping i can smell this today last night i couldn't but that was probably a combo of not feeling super well plus just had too many things to smell because i had a box of you know 100 different scents or so i still don't get a lot of it i've got to be honest i do get a cake note but it's kind of light and yeah and something else maybe something else i don't know it almost smells like there's like a laundry or clean not quite but it smells like a clean cake i don't know um three-eyed raven so i've had this one before i can't remember what it's what its notes are but i know it's like a uh a pala santo fresh air kind of slightly i remember it being kind of comparable not the same as winterfell but kind of similar family i'm not smelling this one super strongly either so it could be my nose i suppose i'm getting like the paleo santo and a kind of frosty wood scent of that so um but i have melted it before i do like it i think it was when i said i'm not gonna repurchase because i like winterfell better but um and purple sugar snuggles so i'm guessing this is like pink sugar blue sugar because it's usually what purple sugar is and then laundry would be my guess it smells okay i'm not the biggest fan of that type of like snuggles laundry but the pink sugar blue sugar or the purple sugar i should say kind of makes it interesting like i have um i've had this other pink sugar laundry sense i love and this one's kind of in that zone so i might actually enjoy that i might we'll see um so those are the samples now i'm going to talk about the clams so i've got to show you this i've never had her big clams before they are big i've heard of people doing half of a cube per warmer to me that looks like it might not be quite enough like i've not found teddy bees for me personally to be a brand that less is more like when i've done and cut when i've cut my loaves up into small pieces before i haven't had great throws so um i mean maybe i'll start with half a cube and see where we go but i have a feeling i'll be melting one cubed performance like that's just um it's hard to say because there's a big bridge um like if you look like it's not just the cube it's the you've got the fair bit of wax in between as well so maybe i can do like two thirds a bit awkward cutting that out but that's okay um so escobar uh beach treats and palace santa so beach treats being her beach nights dupe used to be called boardwalk marshmallow um i actually melted this during the week and i quite enjoyed it um although funnily enough i melted another vendor's blend you know same blend beech knights and palo santo and this was to my nose i preferred that but i still like this one and this one is actually giving me a look i probably shouldn't judge what i melted the other day because i have been sick for like a week and i feel like some things i can smell but i feel like sometimes particularly if my sinuses get impacted that certain things don't smell like certain notes just don't pop the way they're meant to because i felt like i didn't really get the beach nights off it but now i really am and it's that i just i just love beach nights i've got so much beach nights at the moment that i can guarantee by the end of summer i'm really thoroughly sick of it but i'm not sick of it now i love it now um so sun and stars i should probably show what's on the actual clams as well i'm really bad at that so this one's just got um like black glitter which is okay big glitter is not too bad to clean out of a warmer uh so sun in stars is palo santo blue sugar shaving cream and golden sand so you can see this one's got the little um kind of finer glitter now her wax um is a softer type of wax it does actually seem to hold fairly well in these um these clams like for a soft wax it still pops out quite nicely so that's good sometimes soft wax gets stuck in clam shells this is a very good scent i don't mind surprised i love blue sugar and i love palo santo and i like golden sands i think i was a bit unsure about the shaving cream and it's definitely there but this is a really pretty clean slightly blue sugary the blue sugar is not super strong um pylor scent so that's really really nice very strong too um christmas trees and cream so i'm actually melting this um because i had a mini loaf i've got it melting down um in the kitchen at the moment fresh pine bars vanilla sugar waffle cone and rich vanilla buttercream this one is just plain a drop in it nothing on that i i can't explain my love for this scent other than to say it's actually it's funny it's a plain scent but it's really stained up that clam shell that's interesting um it's to me i think it's a it's her pine scent is really good but that rich feeling like buttercream um just makes it it's just it's a gorgeous to me it's more of like a buttercream scent but just with this beautiful hint of pine that just ah it's so good so so good um yeah this is one i feel like i always need to have stock of so um i don't think i've had an opportunity to buy a bigger loaf yet but i've still got about a third of a mini loaf left and then i've got this uh white tea lemonade so crisp clean white tea with a slightly sweet citrus background so this one is a two color pour um they're green and white okay so this is very strong like a very strong lemonade scent to me with kind of like a herbal element to it i guess the tea is kind of you know giving herbal vibes so that'd be a nice scent um for spring summer uh dirty blonde so orange sherbet marshmallows champagne raspberries and cranberries blonde moment i actually don't know if the whole thing is blonde moment or if just some of that's blonde moment i don't know anyway um i'm not familiar enough with the notes of the moment obviously so this one is just a plain pink thing so blonde moment i had it before in blends i've never had it solo assuming this is solo it has a tone to it that i'm not 100 a fan of but i do like it i think the cranberries maybe but it is just a nice sweet kind of sweet and fruity kind of scent so i do enjoy it but there's always this lurking undertone note that um turns me off that one a little bit uh milky way roses so boardwalk marshmallow sweet lavender and rose milk so boardwalk marshmallow being her beach treats which is beach nights too many different names um this one is a plain loaf but with glitter okay so the rose milk and the lavender like i can tell that beach nights is here but it's completely transformed by that rose milk and sweet lavender and the rose milk the most to be honest i get a really kind of creamy marshmallowy rose milk or just a hint of sort of sweet lavender so it's not bad it's it's different i'm not like it's not one that i would say is obviously part of that sort of beach nights family but um it's it's a nice scent uh yeah yeah so i'm thinking about like rose i will have to say like i'm not the biggest fan of sort of rose milk scents like milky roses um i think the boardwalk marshmallow slash beach treats beach night is making that better but whether it's making it better enough we'll say um blackberry boardwalk so a blend of beach treats so beach nights and lovely which is i'm pretty sure that's like a isn't it like a sarah jessica parker fragrance or something i didn't realize that was blackberry but anyway uh so squiggle this is very nice that blackberry or lovely or whatever it is smells really it is perfume-ish i will say it's like a very perfume-ish kind of blackberry scent but it's good it's really nice i have look i've had blackberry and beach nights in forms that i like a little bit better than that but that one's still good and the last one uh blackberry butter pecan cookies so butter pecan waffles blackberry jam and shortbread cookies a bit of a gamble i've heard good things but i also don't like cookies so um this is just a plain pink all right so this is nice it's very buttery it's definitely got that blackberry blackberry jam the ca i can barely smell the pecan which is good so that's actually a really nice blackberry jam cookie scent i'm enjoying that um i may have to try more of her pecan since then because i've heard lots of good things about them but i tend to avoid them because i generally don't like to come um okay so that's it that is everything that i got from teddy bees so i'm going to [Music] take a break when i say take a break i'm going to go and do my my job um i will probably come back i think i'm going to film i've got a big super tarts one to do i might do that at lunch and then over the next couple of days i've still got to get through some savannah blue um and then a couple of new to me vendors so should sense and blend with love um so thank you so much for watching um these will go up probably one a day over the next week or so so um keep will keep checking back if you want to see more of these hauls that came in this giant box um and i'll talk to you all again very soon bye", "yb26D8bBZB8": "[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] [ LAUGHS ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE CONTINUE ] HAVE A SEAT. WELL, HI, EVERYBODY. [ CHUCKLES ] THAT WAS A NICE LITTLE... HELLO?\n...OPENING. IS THIS THING ON?\nYEAH. [ LAUGHS ] WELL, I FIRST MET EDDIE\nIN 2009, AND IT WAS WHEN I INTERVIEWED\nHIM FOR CNN. IT WAS AT HIS 5150 STUDIO, AND HE WAS ROLLING OUT\nA NEW GUITAR FOR HIS EVH LINE\nWITH FENDER. AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT YOU GUYS ARE REALLY\nIN FOR A TREAT TONIGHT. YOU'RE GONNA GET A CHANCE\nTO HEAR HIS STORY AND ALSO FIND OUT A LITTLE BIT\nOF WHAT MAKES HIM TICK. AND AT THE END\nOF THE NIGHT, I'M SURE YOU'RE GONNA WANT HIM\nTO BE YOUR BEST FRIEND. [ CHUCKLES ] [ LAUGHS ] [ LAUGHTER ] MAYBE NOT. [ LAUGHS ] WELL, THIS IS\nA NICE INTIMATE CROWD. YOU'RE USUALLY\nUSED TO ARENAS. THIS IS... IT'S ABOUT AS FAR\nAS YOU CAN SEE IN AN ARENA. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, LET'S HEAD\nINTO THE PROGRAM. THE THEME OF TONIGHT IS\nROCK 'N' ROLL AND REINVENTION COUPLED WITH WHAT IT'S LIKE\nTO BE AN AMERICAN. AND THIS IS KIND OF\nYOUR STORY, TRULY. YEAH,\nI'D HAVE TO SAY SO. LET ME START OFF BY SAYING THAT MY FATHER WAS\nA PROFESSIONAL MUSICIAN, CLASSICALLY TRAINED\nON CLARINET AND SAXOPHONE, AND HE TRAVELED THE WORLD\nMAKING MUSIC. AND HE MET MY MOTHER\nIN INDONESIA. AND AFTER THE WAR -- INDONESIA USED TO BE\nA DUTCH PROVINCE. AND AFTER THE WAR,\nTHEY HAD A CHOICE. EITHER REMAIN UNDER THEIR RULE\nOR MOVE BACK TO HOLLAND. AND THEY OPTED\nTO MOVE BACK TO HOLLAND, WHERE LIFE BECAME\nA LITTLE ROUGH BECAUSE MY MOM BECAME\nA SECOND-CLASS CITIZEN BECAUSE\nSHE'S INDONESIAN. SO, HERE SHE IS, STUCK AT HOME WITH TWO RUGRATS,\nALEX AND I, AND MY FATHER'S OUT\nTRYING TO GET GIGS, WHICH KEPT HIM FROM HOME\nFOR WEEKS AT A TIME. EVENTUALLY, YOU KNOW,\nWITH THE BIG-BAND ERA AND EVERYTHING COMING\nKIND OF TO A CLOSE, IN ORDER TO MAKE MONEY\nTO HAVE ANY KIND OF GIG AT ALL, HE JOINED THE AIR FORCE\nIN HOLLAND TO PAY THE RENT. AND SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE,\nWHEN HE TURNED 42, HE SAID TO MY MOM, \"LET'S PACK UP THE KIDS\nAND THE PIANO AND MOVE TO BEVERLY.\" [ LAUGHTER ] EXCEPT IT WASN'T BEVERLY HILLS,\nTHAT IS. WE CAME TO AMERICA\nON A BOAT. NINE DAYS ON A BOAT. AND HE PERFORMED ON THE BOAT\nWITH THE BAND, AND THAT WAS OUR TICKET\nOVER HERE. AND ONE DAY, HE COMES UP TO ALEX\nAND I AND HE GOES, \"WHY DON'T YOU GUYS PLAY PIANO\nDURING THE INTERMISSION?\" SO, WE ENDED UP PERFORMING\nALSO ON THE BOAT, WHICH SHOWED US THE QUIRKS\nOF BEING A PERFORMER, OR THE PLUSSES OF IT,\nBECAUSE THE NEXT NIGHT, WE'RE AT THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE\nEATING DINNER. [ LAUGHTER ] SO, WE FOUND OUT\nAT AN EARLY AGE, YOU KNOW, WHAT BEING ON STAGE MEANT,\nYOU KNOW, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT. BUT ANYWAY, SO WHEN WE FINALLY ARRIVED\nIN PASADENA, CALIFORNIA, IT WAS ROUGH. MY FATHER, YOU KNOW,\nA CLASSICALLY TRAINED MUSICIAN, HAD TO WALK THREE MILES\nTO GO WASH DISHES. HE WAS A JANITOR\nAT MASONIC TEMPLE AND PACIFIC TELEPHONE. MY MOM WAS A MAID. AND THERE WAS ALWAYS\nA COMMON THREAD OF MUSIC IN OUR FAMILY EVER SINCE WE WERE YOUNG\nIN HOLLAND. YOU KNOW, SOMEWHERE,\nMY MOM HAD A SENSE THAT WE WERE GONNA FOLLOW\nIN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS. AND KNOWING THAT\nIN THE BACK OF HER HEAD, SHE INSISTED THAT WE START BEING\nCLASSICALLY TRAINED ON PIANO ALREADY IN HOLLAND. THAT'S WHY WE BROUGHT THE PIANO\nWITH US. BUT ANYWAY,\nSO WE COME TO AMERICA, AND MY MOM BEING A MAID\nAND MY DAD... THE THING JUST CUT OUT. IT'S BACK. AND HE DIDN'T KNOW\nANY OTHER MUSICIANS, REALLY. AND, YOU KNOW,\nTHE MUSICIAN'S UNION WAS THERE, BUT THEY WEREN'T\nOF MUCH HELP AT THE TIME. BUT SLOWLY, HE STARTED MEETING\nOTHER MUSICIANS, ALSO, YOU KNOW,\nIMMIGRANTS. AND HE STARTED GIGGING\nON THE WEEKENDS BECAUSE BEING A JANITOR\nAND A MAID AND ALL THAT STUFF, IT DIDN'T PAY THE RENT, AND WE LIVED IN ONE ROOM. WE SLEPT IN ONE BED IN A HOUSE\nWITH TWO OTHER FAMILIES. SO, IT WAS ROUGH GOING. SO, THE ONLY THING, AGAIN,\nTHAT SAVED US WAS MY DAD GIGGING\nON THE WEEKENDS MAKING MUSIC. AS WE GREW\nA LITTLE BIT OLDER, ALEX STARTED PLAYING DRUMS\nWITH MY DAD. AND I'LL NEVER FORGET. 'CAUSE HE HAD LONG HAIR, HE HAD TO TAKE A WHOLE JAR\nOF VASELINE, AND -- WHAT WAS THAT STUFF CALLED,\nVITALIS? AND JUST SLICK HIS HAIR BACK,\nYOU KNOW? TOOK HIM DAYS\nTO GET IT OUT. AND THEN EVENTUALLY, I ENDED UP PLAYING BASS\nWITH THEM. AND I DIDN'T KNOW MY \"A\"\nFROM A HOLE IN THE GROUND, BUT THESE, YOU KNOW,\nFUNNY SONGS, YOU'RE LIKE -- WE WERE PLAYING,\nYOU KNOW, OOMPAH MUSIC. EVERYTHING FROM OOMPAH MUSIC\nTO WALTZES TO, YOU KNOW, WEDDINGS,\nBAR MITZVAHS, YOU NAME IT. AND AL WOULD YELL TO ME\nWHICH CHORD TO PLAY. YOU KNOW, HE'D GO,\n\"ONE, FOUR, FIVE. NO, YOU FUCKED IT UP.\" [ LAUGHTER ] BUT -- DOES HE STILL DO THAT? BLEEP THAT OUT. [ LAUGHTER ] I DON'T LISTEN ANYMORE.\nNO. [ LAUGHS ] ANYWAY, SO MUSIC\nWAS JUST A COMMON THREAD THROUGHOUT OUR LIVES. WE WERE BORN IN HOLLAND,\nMUSIC IN THE HOUSE. WE USED TO STOMP AROUND\nTHE LIVING ROOM TABLE WITH POTS AND PANS AND, YOU KNOW,\nMARCHING AROUND, LISTENING TO BIG BAND\nMARCHING MUSIC. AND WE ALWAYS\nLIKED THINGS LOUD. EVERYTHING HAD TO BE LOUD,\nYOU KNOW? BUT AS WE GOT OLDER, WE CONTINUED TO TAKE\nPIANO LESSONS, AND MY MOM HAD PUT US\nIN THESE CONTESTS, THESE ANNUAL CONTESTS WHERE YOU PRACTICE ONE PIECE\nOF MUSIC ALL YEAR LONG, AND -- I'M GOING WAY OFF\nTHE SUBJECT HERE. NO, THIS IS FASCINATING. ANYWAY, YOU PRACTICE\nONE PIECE OF MUSIC ALL YEAR, AND THE FUNNY THING IS I NEVER LEARNED\nHOW TO READ MUSIC, AND I FOOLED\nTHE TEACHER. I WAS JUST BLESSED\nWITH GOOD EARS. I'D WATCH HIS FINGERS AND\nEMULATE WHAT HE DID, YOU KNOW? HE DIDN'T FIND OUT\nTILL MUCH LATER THAT I COULDN'T READ. HE ACTUALLY FOUND OUT\nONE TIME WHEN HE WAS PLAYING\nA NEW PIECE OF MUSIC, AND HE ASKED ME\nTO TURN THE PAGE FOR HIM, AND I'M SITTING GOING... [ LAUGHTER ] HE GOES,\n\"WHAT'S THE MATTER? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TURN\nTHE PAGE.\" I'M GOING,\n\"WELL, I CAN'T READ.\" HE'S GOING, \"WHAT?\" YOU KNOW, THIS IS AFTER\nLIKE FIVE YEARS OF LESSONS WITH THE GUY, AND HE FINALLY FOUND OUT, WHICH HE WASN'T\nTOO HAPPY ABOUT. BUT THE FUNNY THING IS -- OKAY, THESE PIANO CONTESTS\nTHAT THEY PUT US INTO, YOU'RE NOT EVEN ALLOWED\nTO READ, OKAY? YOU CAN'T USE\nSHEET MUSIC, SO IT WAS ACTUALLY\nA BLESSING IN DISGUISE FOR ME TO NOT BE ABLE TO READ. I COULD NOT LOOK UP\nAND DO THINGS AT THE SAME TIME. I HAD TO SEE\nWHAT MY FINGERS WERE DOING. BUT THESE PIANO CONTESTS, ACTUALLY, BOTH ALEX AND I WON\nTHREE YEARS IN A ROW. I THINK I WON FIRST PRIZE\nTHREE YEARS IN A ROW, AND AL WON FIRST PRIZE,\nSECOND PRIZE, WHATEVER. BUT WE ALWAYS WON, AND IT'S KIND OF LIKE IN PHASES\nWHERE YOU GO IN AND YOU PLAY, AND THEN YOU WAIT AN HOUR TO SEE IF YOUR NAME\nGETS WHITTLED DOWN. I HAD NO IDEA.\nIT WAS LIKE 5,000 KIDS, OKAY? THEN IT WOULD GO DOWN\nTO 2,000, AND YOU'D SEE IF YOUR NAME\nIS STILL ON THE LIST. AND IT WOULD GO DOWN\nTO 100 PEOPLE AND THEN 10 AND THEN 5,\nAND WE'RE GOING -- ALEX AND I ARE BOTH GOING,\n\"COME ON, LET'S JUST GO HOME. WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT,\"\nYOU KNOW? AND MY DAD WAS ALWAYS THE ONE\nTHAT SAID, \"NO, NO, NO. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.\nCHECK IT OUT.\" AND, WELL, THERE IT WAS.\nWE WERE IN THE TOP 5. AND THEN WE ENDED UP WINNING,\nWHICH WAS GREAT. BUT THAT WAS\nTHE PIANO PHASE, SO THAT WAS 9, 10, 11 YEARS OLD\nTHAT I DID THOSE CONTESTS. AND THEN WE DISCOVERED\nTHE BEATLES AND DAVE CLARK FIVE, AND OF COURSE, LIKE ANY KID,\nWE WANTED TO ROCK AND ROLL. AND I QUIT PIANO LESSONS AND CONTEST CIRCUITS,\nSO TO SPEAK, AND SAID, \"I WANT TO GET MYSELF\nA DRUM KIT.\" 'CAUSE I LIKED THE SONG\n\"GLAD ALL OVER\"... [ IMITATES DRUMS ] ...BY DAVE CLARK FIVE. AND I WANTED TO PLAY DRUMS,\nSO I GOT A PAPER ROUTE, BOUGHT A ST. GEORGE DRUM KIT\nFOR 125 BUCKS. AND MY MOM\nSOMEHOW CONVINCED MY BROTHER TO STILL DO SOMETHING\nMUSICALLY RESPECTABLE, WHICH WAS TAKE\nFLAMENCO GUITAR LESSONS. NOW, FORGIVE ME\nIF MY MEMORY OR RECOLLECTION IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS,\nAL, BUT ALL I REMEMBER IS ME GOING OUT\nAND THROWING THE PAPERS AND COMING HOME,\nAND HE'S PLAYING MY DRUMS. AND I'M GOING, \"OKAY.\" YOU KNOW, P.O.'d ME A BIT\nIN THE BEGINNING, YOU KNOW? AND THEN FINALLY,\nI JUST SAID, \"OKAY, HE'S JUST BETTER\nTHAN I AM.\" SO, I NEVER WANTED TO PLAY\nGUITAR, BUT I SAID, \"OKAY, GO AHEAD,\nTAKE MY DRUMS. I'LL PLAY\nYOUR DAMN GUITAR.\" [ LAUGHTER ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THE FUNNY THING IS\nWHEN I WATCHED ALEX PLAY -- YOU PROBABLY SAY\nTHE EXACT OPPOSITE -- OR THE SAME THING,\nEXCEPT TO ME -- AND THAT IS THAT\nTO WATCH AL PLAY DRUMS WAS LIKE HE WASN'T JUST\nKEEPING TIME, HE WAS MAKING MUSIC\nON THE DRUMS. IT JUST CAME\nSORT OF NATURAL TO HIM, WHEREAS\nHE'LL PROBABLY SAY THE GUITAR WAS JUST\nSO EASY FOR ME. AND WE'RE BOTH RIGHT. YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] YOU KNOW,\nWE ENDED UP ON THE -- IT WAS DESTINY. IT DOES SEEM LIKE\nTHE UNIVERSE HAS A WAY OF SHAKING OUT THE WAY\nIT'S SUPPOSED TO, DOESN'T IT? NOW, YOU DIDN'T TAKE\nFORMAL GUITAR LESSONS IN THE SAME WAY\nTHAT YOU TOOK PIANO LESSONS. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO. I, INSTEAD OF READING A BOOK,\nI WROTE MY OWN, SO TO SPEAK. I'D SAY THAT 90% OF THE THINGS\nTHAT I DO ON GUITAR, IF I HAD TAKEN LESSONS\nAND LEARNED BY THE BOOK, I WOULD NOT PLAY AT ALL\nTHE WAY I DO. AS A MATTER OF FACT, BECAUSE OF THE THINGS\nTHAT I CREATED TECHNIQUE-WISE AND WHATEVER\nTHE WAY I PLAY, THEY HAD TO REINVENT\nA WHOLE NEW WAY TO WRITE MUSIC, 'CAUSE THEY COULD NOT EXPLAIN\nWITH REGULAR NOTES WHAT I WAS DOING\nWITH THIS HAND. SO THEY HAD TO CREATE A WHOLE\nNEW THING CALLED TABLATURE. WITH SYMBOLS\nAND THINGS? YEAH,\nWITH SYMBOLS AND NUMBERS AND WHAT FINGER'S WHERE\nAND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH. AND THE FUNNY THING IS,\nOKAY, I CAN'T READ MUSIC. NOW THEY COME UP WITH\nA NEW WAY TO WRITE IT, AND I CAN'T MAKE SENSE\nOUT OF THAT AT ALL, SO I DON'T HAVE A CLUE\nIF IT'S RIGHT OR WRONG. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, CAN WE FLASH BACK\nALL THE WAY TO 1978? THAT'S WHEN VAN HALEN'S\nSELF-TITLED DEBUT ALBUM HIT THE STORES, AND IT REALLY KIND OF TURNED\nTHE MUSIC INDUSTRY ON ITS HEAD. DO YOU GUYS AGREE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THERE WERE SOUNDS THAT HE WAS\nMAKING WITH HIS GUITAR THAT NOBODY\nHAD EVER HEARD BEFORE. THE SOUNDS\nON THAT RECORD WERE A LOT OF YEARS\nOF EXPERIMENTATION AND TEARING APART GUITARS\nAND OPENING UP AMPLIFIERS AND GETTING ELECTROCUTED\nAND THROWN ACROSS -- YOU KNOW,\nKICKED AROUND, AND... AND, UH... YEAH, IT WAS A LOT OF -- BY THE TIME\nTHE FIRST RECORD CAME OUT, WE HAD WORKED SO HARD\nTO MAKE THAT RECORD, TO GET TO THAT POINT. 'CAUSE DON'T FORGET, BEING A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND\nIN 1977, '78, IT'S KIND OF\nWHAT IT'S LIKE TODAY, EXCEPT BACK THEN,\nTHERE'S PUNK AND DISCO THAT WAS, YOU KNOW,\nDOMINATING THE CHARTS. THERE'S NO ROCK 'N' ROLL\nTO BE HEARD OF. SO, FOR US TO SUCCEED\nIN THAT, AMONGST OR IN THE MIDDLE\nOF THAT -- AND ANYWAY,\nBUT THE SOUNDS. LET ME START BY SAYING\nI WAS NEVER HAPPY -- I GUESS WHAT DRIVES ME\nTO TEAR THINGS APART IS SOME OF IT IS NECESSITY, AND SOME OF IT\nIS JUST EXPERIMENTING, 'CAUSE I'M ALWAYS PUSHING THINGS\nPAST WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE. I HATE TO BRING UP\n\"SPINAL TAP,\" BUT, YOU KNOW, WHILE THEY'RE\nGOING TO 11 AT THE TIME, I WAS ALREADY GOING TO 15,\nYOU KNOW? I WAS WAY PAST THAT. BUT SO ANYWAY, WHAT I REALLY\nLOVED ABOUT A FENDER GUITAR WAS THE VIBRATO BAR, EXCEPT THEY ONLY CAME\nWITH SINGLE-COIL PICKUPS. WHICH AT HIGH VOLUME, THEY SQUEAL\nAND THEY'RE VERY THIN-SOUNDING UNLESS YOU USE SOME KIND OF\nDISTORTION PEDAL OR WHATEVER, WHICH I COULD NOT AFFORD,\nYOU KNOW? AND THERE'S\nTHE OTHER COMPANY, GIBSON, THAT MADE A LES PAUL -- LES PAUL WAS A DEAR FRIEND\nOF MINE, ALSO -- WHICH MADE HUMBUCKING PICKUPS,\nWHICH WERE SIMILAR TO THESE. THEY CANCELED THE HUM,\nAND IT HAS A MUCH FATTER SOUND. SO, I PROCEEDED TO FIND\nA COMPANY THAT MADE KNOCKOFF BODIES\nAND NECKS OF FENDERS. A COMPANY CALLED\nBOOGIE BODIES. AND I WENT OUT THERE AND SAID,\n\"HOW MUCH FOR A BODY?\" HE GOES, \"OH, YOU DON'T WANT\nONE OF THOSE.\" I GO, \"WHY NOT?\" THE GUY GOES,\n\"THEY'RE SECONDS.\" I THOUGHT HE MEANT\nTHOSE ARE NEXT TO BE MADE. YOU KNOW, WHAT HE MEANT WAS\nTHOSE ARE JUNK. \"WE CAN'T SELL THOSE\n'CAUSE THEY HAVE KNOTS AND, YOU KNOW,\nTHEY'RE DAMAGED.\" I SAID,\n\"GREAT, I'LL TAKE ONE.\" [ LAUGHTER ] SO, I BOUGHT A $50 BODY\nAND $75 NECK, AND I PROCEEDED TO TAKE\nA CHISEL AND A HAMMER AND MAKE A HOLE BIG ENOUGH FOR A GIBSON PICKUP\nTO PUT IN THERE. AND OF COURSE, THAT PICKUP HAD TO COME OUT\nOF A GUITAR SOMEWHERE, SO I RUINED THAT GUITAR\nBY RIPPING THE PICKUP OUT. BUT I KNEW\nI WAS ONTO SOMETHING. SO, I SCREWED THE PICKUP\nSTRAIGHT INTO THE WOOD. AND A STRATOCASTER\nACTUALLY HAS THREE PICKUPS, SO I ROUTED OUT THE BODY AND CRAMMED\nTHE HUMBUCKING PICKUP -- AND MIND YOU, EVERYTHING WAS UNSOLDERED\nAND JUST LAYING THERE. IT HAD THREE KNOBS\nAND TWO PICKUPS OVER HERE. AND I HAVE ONE PICKUP THAT\nI WANTED IN THERE, AND I GO, \"OKAY, NOW HOW AM I GONNA\nHOOK THIS BACK UP?\" I HAD NO CLUE\nHOW TO HOOK IT BACK UP. SO I WONDERED\nIF IT WOULD WORK IF I JUST HOOKED\nTHE HUMBUCKING PICKUP STRAIGHT UP THE ONE KNOB,\nAND IT WORKED. SO I JUST RIPPED EVERYTHING OUT,\nTHREW IT AWAY, AND MADE MY OWN PICK GUARD\nTO COVER THE HOLES, AND THAT'S WHAT ENDED UP\nBEING THAT GUITAR. WITH ALL\nYOUR EXPERIMENTATION, WAS THERE EVER ANYTHING\nTHAT DIDN'T WORK? LIKE, DO YOU HAVE\nA WHOLE GRAVEYARD FULL OF\nINSTRUMENTS THAT -- YES. [ LAUGHTER ] YES. I'VE DESTROYED MANY\nACTUAL VINTAGE GUITARS, TAKING JUST CHOICE PIECES OUT\nTHAT I WANTED FOR THIS AND THAT. SO THEN FINALLY, OKAY,\nTHEN I HAD THE GUITAR BUILT, AND I GUESS ONE OF THE\nMOST OFTEN ASKED QUESTIONS IS, WHAT PROMPTED\nTHE PAINT JOB? THAT I HAVE NO ANSWER FOR\nTHAT EXCEPT I'M SITTING THERE WITH A BLANK PIECE OF WOOD\nWITH A GUITAR AND IT SOUNDED GREAT\nAND DID EVERYTHING I WANTED, AND I PAINTED IT BLACK, AND I'M GOING,\n\"IT LOOKS KIND OF BORING.\" THERE'S SOME TAPE LAYING THERE,\nAND I JUST STARTED TAPING IT UP, TAKE A RAZOR BLADE\nAND JUST CUT PIECES OUT, AND SPRAY PAINTED IT WHITE\nAND THEN TOOK IT ALL OFF. AND I'M GOING,\n\"HEY, THIS IS KIND OF COOL.\" IT WAS REALLY\nAS SIMPLE AS THAT. THERE WAS NO \"I HAVE TO MAKE\nA PIECE OF ART,\" YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] EVEN THOUGH\nIT'S INTERESTING-LOOKING. AND THEN LATER ON,\nTHE RED GUITAR IS THE SAME GUITAR\nAS THE WHITE ONE. I TAPED OVER IT AGAIN\nAND SPRAY PAINTED IT RED. BUT -- AND THAT LED\nTO A LOT OF PEOPLE KIND OF COPYING, YOU KNOW,\nTHE GRAPHIC DESIGN. IT BECAME STANDARD\nIN THE INDUSTRY. ALL OF A SUDDEN,\nEVERYBODY WAS MAKING SINGLE -- I MEAN, A HUMBUCKING\nIN A STRAT-STYLE BODY. BUT THERE'S SO MANY OTHER THINGS\nTHAT I DID, LIKE POTTING THE PICKUP,\nWHICH -- OKAY. IF YOU GET UNWANTED\nHIGH-SQUEAL FEEDBACK, YOU KNOW, LIKE IF YOU EVER WATCH\nA PUBLIC SPEAKER AND YOU GET THIS REAL ANNOYING\n\"EEE,\" YOU KNOW? I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE GOOD KIND OF FEEDBACK\nWHEN YOU'RE PLAYING. I'M TALKING ABOUT\nANNOYING HIGH SQUEAL. NOW, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT\nPROMPTED ME TO THINK THIS, BUT I WAS THINKING,\n\"OKAY, COIL WINDINGS. VERY THIN COPPER WIRE AROUND THESE PLASTIC THINGS\nWITH A MAGNET.\" AND I'M GOING, \"MAYBE IT'S THE LITTLE\nCOIL THINGS VIBRATING.\" SO, I PROCEEDED TO EMPTY ONE\nOF MY MOM'S YUBAN COFFEE CANS AND WENT TO THE STORE\nAND BOUGHT SOME PARAFFIN WAX AND GOT A HOT PLATE, AND AGAIN, PROCEEDED TO RUIN\nMANY PICKUPS 'CAUSE I FORGOT\nTHAT THE PICKUP BOBBINS, YOU KNOW,\nTHE BLACK AND WHITE PART THAT YOU SEE THERE,\nTHAT THEY'RE PLASTIC. AND I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT\nTEMPERATURE TO DIP THEM AT, SO I MELTED\nA LOT OF PICKUPS. AND THEN I FIGURED, \"OKAY,\nI'LL JUST HOLD ON TO IT, AND AS SOON AS I SEE\nAN INKLING OF SHRIVEL, I'M GONNA YANK IT OUT.\" AND IT WORKED. AND PEOPLE STILL USE\nTHAT TECHNIQUE. THAT BECAME A STANDARD\nIN THE BUSINESS NOW, TOO. EVERY COMPANY DOES THAT. IT'S LIKE ALL THIS STUFF THAT COMES OUT OF\nYOUR MAD SCIENTIST BRAIN. OR IS GIVEN TO ME\nFROM SOMEWHERE. I DON'T KNOW. YOU KNOW, SAY THE CROSSING\nA GIBSON WITH A FENDER WAS A CONSCIOUS,\nYOU KNOW, OUT OF NECESSITY 'CAUSE THERE WAS NO GUITAR\nON THE MARKET THAT DID WHAT I WANTED. SO, THAT WAS A NECESSITY. THE PAINT JOB\nWAS NOT A NECESSITY. POTTING A PICKUP, I HAVE NO IDEA\nWHAT MADE ME THINK THAT. SO, THEN I HAD A GUITAR, AND I USED TO WORK\nAT A MUSIC STORE DELIVERING PIANOS\nAND ORGANS, AND ONE DAY,\nA MARSHALL AMP COMES IN. I'VE ONLY SEEN PICTURES\nOF THESE THINGS, YOU KNOW? ONLY ERIC CLAPTON,\nGODS PLAY THESE, YOU KNOW, NOT KIDS ON THE STREET. AND I SAID,\n\"I GOT TO HAVE THAT AMP.\" SO, I WORKED ALL SUMMER\nTO BUY THAT AMP. AND WE WERE ALREADY TOO LOUD,\nAS IT WERE. I'M SURE YOUR NEIGHBORS\nLOVED YOU. NOW I HAVE A 100-WATT MARSHALL\nTHAT WAS SO DAMN LOUD THAT I DID EVERYTHING\nFROM FACE IT BACKWARDS TO LEAVE IT FACEDOWN,\nYOU NAME IT. AND WE'D BE AUDITIONING\nIN CLUBS, AND, \"NO, YOUR GUITARS\nARE TOO PSYCHEDELIC, TOO LOUD, AND TOO MUCH\nUNCONTROLLED ENERGY, AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH,\nBLAH, BLAH,\" YOU KNOW? ALL THIS STUFF BECAUSE\nI WAS JUST TOO DAMN LOUD, OKAY? I SAW AN AD IN THE PAPER\nFOR ANOTHER MARSHALL HEAD. I'M GOING, \"WELL, MAYBE\nTHIS ONE WILL BE DIFFERENT.\" WELL, IT CERTAINLY WAS, 'CAUSE WHEN IT SHOWED UP\nAND I PLUGGED IT IN, IT DIDN'T WORK. BUT I LEFT IT ON, OKAY? WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE WAS\nTHAT THIS THING WAS FROM ENGLAND AND IT WAS 220 VOLTS. SO I PLUGGED IT INTO THE WALL,\nAND IT WAS SET -- I DIDN'T BOTHER TO LOOK\nIN THE BACK UNTIL LATER, BUT IT WAS SET ON 220. SO IT TOOK A LONG TIME FOR IT\nTO WARM UP AT HALF VOLTAGE. AND WHEN I PICKED UP MY GUITAR,\nI'M GOING, \"IT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE,\"\nBUT INCREDIBLY QUIET. IT WAS SO QUIET THAT ONLY MY DOG AND I\nCOULD HEAR IT, YOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] AND THEN IT DAWNED ON ME. I'M GOING, \"WAIT A MINUTE.\nTHE VOLTAGE,\" OKAY? \"I CAN CONTROL THE LEVEL\nOF THE AMP OUTPUT BY VOLTAGE.\" SO I PROCEEDED\nTO TRY TO HOOK IT ON TO THE LIGHT DIMMER\nAT THE HOUSE, BLEW THE POWER OUT,\nAND SO ON AND SO ON. SO FINALLY, I WENT TO THIS PLACE\nCALLED DIAL RADIO IN PASADENA\nON COLORADO BOULEVARD, AND ASKED,\n\"DO YOU GUYS MAKE ANY KIND OF INDUSTRIAL\nVARIABLE TRANSFORMER, LIKE A HUGE LIGHT DIMMER,\"\nYOU KNOW? AND YEAH. HE GOES, \"YEAH, WE GOT\nTHIS THING CALLED A VARIAC.\" AND I SAID, \"OKAY, COOL.\" SO, I TAKE IT HOME\nAND I PLUG THE AMP HEAD INTO IT. AND I WOULD LOWER THE VOLTAGE\nFROM 110 SLOWLY DOWN TO 100. THE LOWEST I EVER WENT\nWAS LIKE 60. DEPENDING ON THE SIZE ROOM\nYOU'RE PLAYING, I'D SET IT\nANYWHERE BETWEEN 60 AND 100. AND THAT BECAME -- BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY\nTHE AMP SOUNDED GOOD WAS WITH EVERYTHING\nALL THE WAY UP, AND IF IT WAS RUNNING\nAT 110 VOLTS, IT WAS JUST SO DAMN LOUD,\nYOU KNOW. SO THAT BECAME MY VOLUME KNOB,\nYOU KNOW? WHEN WE USED TO PLAY GAZZARRI'S,\nI'D HAVE IT DOWN TO 60 VOLTS. IF WE PLAYED SOMEWHERE\nA LITTLE BIT BIGGER, I'D CRANK IT TO 80. AND FOR RECORDING, THE SWEET SPOT\nSEEMED TO BE 89 VOLTS. THERE SEEMS TO BE, THOUGH,\nA RECURRING THEME, AND THAT\nYOU'RE ALWAYS PUSHING. YOU KNOW,\nYOU ALWAYS WANT TO SEE WHAT IS BEYOND\nWHAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS DOING. MORE POWER,\nMORE VOLUME. YES. [ LAUGHTER ] MORE IS ALWAYS BETTER,\nRIGHT? [ LAUGHS ] IT'S LIKE -- WHAT'S THE OLD\nSAYING ALEX AND I ALWAYS HAD? IF IT'S ALL YOU CAN EAT\nFOR A BUCK, GIVE ME THREE BUCKS' WORTH. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT IT'S -- TO ME, IT'S JUST\nA NATURAL EVOLUTION, YOU KNOW? I'M ALWAYS TINKERING\nWITH THINGS. THE MAIN THING I ALWAYS ASK\nMYSELF IS, \"WHAT IF I DO THIS?\" YOU KNOW? \"I WONDER WHAT'LL HAPPEN\nIF I DO THIS?\" AND A LOT OF TIMES,\nOPEN UP AN AMP AND ACCIDENTALLY HIT A CAPACITOR\nAND WENT BRRRRK! YOU KNOW,\nLIKE MIKE TYSON, YOU KNOW, KICKED YOU\nIN THE CHEST. BUT, YOU KNOW,\nTHROUGH TRIAL AND ERROR, I CONTINUED\nTO PUTZ AROUND WITH STUFF. IT ALSO GOES WITH\nYOUR PLAYING TECHNIQUE, TOO. BECAUSE YOU'RE KNOWN\nFOR PLAYING WITH BOTH YOUR RIGHT HAND\nAND YOUR LEFT HAND ON THE FRETBOARD. YEAH, WHICH BRINGS ME TO,\nLIKE, I CAN -- I CAN DEMONSTRATE. CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHOOPS. THERE GOES THE EARPIECE. BUT IT'S WORTH IT IF WE GET\nTHE GUITAR IN HIS LAP. THERE IT IS.\nGOT IT. IS IT WORKING?\nYEAH, GOOD. OKAY, LET'S SEE\nIF WE CAN DO THAT AGAIN. I DIDN'T KNOW THIS WAS GONNA BE\nA STRIPTEASE IN ADDITION. IS IT HOOKED ON\nTO MY JACKET? GOT IT. [ LAUGHTER ] MORE POWER. OKAY, SO, YOU KNOW,\nA LOT OF PEOPLE, YOU KNOW,\nBEFORE THE INTERNET, NOBODY COULD SEARCH THINGS\nAND WHATEVER. BUT, YOU KNOW,\nLATELY EVERYBODY'S GOING, \"OH, EDDIE VAN HALEN\nDIDN'T INVENT TAPPING AND PULL HAMMER-ONS\nAND PULLOFFS AND THIS AND THAT,\" AND I NEVER CLAIMED THAT I DID. BUT I DO KNOW HOW AND WHEN\nI FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO IT. AND ON TOP OF THAT, I NEVER REALLY HEARD ANYBODY\nDO WITH IT WHAT I DID, WHICH IS\nACTUAL PIECES OF MUSIC. I'LL NEVER FORGET\nALEX AND I USED TO GO TO EVERY CONCERT\nAT THE FORUM IN L.A., AND LED ZEPPELIN'S PLAYING, AND JIMMY PAGE\nIS GOING LIKE THIS. HE'S GOING... [ GUITAR PLAYS ] OKAY, SO HE'S GOT HIS HAND\nUP IN THE AIR, AND I'M GOING... [ GUITAR PLAYING ] [ TAPPING NOTES ] SO, BASICALLY,\nI JUST MOVED THE NUT. OKAY? THIS PART RIGHT HERE'S\nTHE NUT. BUT THEN,\nINSTEAD OF USING THIS HAND, I USE THIS HAND. SO, LIKE RIGHT NOW,\nIF I GO LIKE THIS... [ TAPPING NOTES ] ...YOU CAN'T TELL\nWHICH FINGER I'M USING. THIS HAND OR THAT HAND. YOU TELL ME,\nRIGHT HAND OR LEFT HAND. [ TAPPING NOTES ] I USE THEM BOTH, OKAY? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NO, SO MY POINT BEING IS\nIT'S BASICALLY THIS FINGER, OR THESE TWO,\nOR HOWEVER MANY YOU WANT TO USE IS JUST AN EXTENSION\nOF THIS HAND, OKAY? SO, IF I'M PLAYING AN \"A\"... [ GUITAR PLAYING ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] THEN, YOU KNOW,\nFIGURING THAT OUT, THEN I STARTED ACTUALLY MAKING\nLITTLE PIECES, YOU KNOW, LIKE \"ERUPTION.\" [ \"ERUPTION\" PLAYS ] SO, THAT'S -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO, THAT'S THE TAPPING OR THE -- I DON'T EVEN KNOW\nWHAT THEY CALL THE STUFF. I DIDN'T CALL IT ANYTHING. IT WAS JUST, YOU KNOW,\nPART OF MY PLAYING. BUT THEN CAME STUFF LIKE THE INTRO TO A SONG\nCALLED \"MEAN STREETS,\" WHERE I'M GOING LIKE THIS. [ \"MEAN STREETS\" PLAYS ] AND THEN HARMONICALLY, DOING... [ \"MEAN STREETS\" PLAYS ] SO IT'S JUST HARMONICS\nBY TAPPING. [ GUITAR PLAYING ] YOU KNOW, JUST STUFF LIKE THAT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND PEOPLE ASK ME, YOU KNOW,\nWHERE ARE THESE HARMONICS? WELL, THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. IF YOU JUST GO LIKE THIS... [ GUITAR PLAYING ] ...YOU KIND OF HEAR THEM\nPINGING OUT. [ PLAYING RESUMES ] THEY'RE LIKE... [ PLAYING RESUMES ] AND IF YOU KNOW WHERE THEY ARE\nAFTER A WHILE, YOU CAN DO THIS STUFF. [ GUITAR PLAYING ] OR -- I DON'T HAVE\nTHE RIGHT EFFECTS, BUT... [ NOTES TAPPING ] IT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND, YOU KNOW, BEING\nTHE ONLY MELODIC INSTRUMENT IN A THREE-PIECE BAND -- ACTUALLY BEFORE THAT, IT WAS JUST BASICALLY\nALEX AND I. SO, WE BOTH JUST FILLED\nEVERY HOLE POSSIBLE. IF THERE WAS A HOLE,\nWE FILLED IT, YOU KNOW? AND IT'S -- BUT THE MAIN REASON\nWHY I SQUEEZE SO MANY, YOU KNOW, CALL THEM TRICKS,\nCALL THEM WHATEVER, TECHNIQUES OUT OF A GUITAR\nWAS OUT OF NECESSITY BECAUSE I COULDN'T AFFORD\nTHE PEDALS, YOU KNOW? COULDN'T AFFORD A WAH-WAH PEDAL,\nCOULDN'T AFFORD A FUZZ BOX AND ALL THE TOYS\nTHAT EVERYBODY ELSE HAD. SO, I DID EVERYTHING I COULD TO GET SOUNDS OUT OF THE GUITAR\nWITH MY FINGERS. KIND OF NECESSITY\nLEADS TO INNOVATION. YEAH. IN A LOT OF WAYS.\nYEAH. WHO WERE SOME\nOF YOUR MUSICAL HEROES? WELL, MY FATHER,\nTO BEGIN WITH. YOU KNOW, WE WERE SURROUNDED\nBY MUSIC FROM DAY ONE. AND HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH\nTO SEE OUR SUCCESS. AS A GUITARIST, ERIC CLAPTON WAS MY HERO BECAUSE HE WAS\nA STRAIGHT-AHEAD GUY, JUST PLUGGED HIS GUITAR\nSTRAIGHT INTO AN AMP AND, YOU KNOW, IS VERY ORGANIC,\nSO TO SPEAK. WASN'T A LOT OF B.S.\nIN BETWEEN. SO, YEAH,\nI LIKED HIM DURING CREAM. AFTER CREAM, I KIND OF\nLOST INTEREST IN HIM, AND BASICALLY STOPPED LISTENING\nTO MUSIC ALTOGETHER. I DIDN'T LISTEN TO MUCH\nOF ANYTHING AFTER THAT. WHY IS THAT? I WAS SO BUSY AND WRAPPED UP\nIN MY OWN LITTLE WORLD THAT I JUST DIDN'T -- YOU CAN ASK ALEX\nOR MY SON. YOU KNOW, WHAT'S\nTHE LAST RECORD I BOUGHT? [ MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ] PETER GABRIEL'S \"SO.\" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THE RECORD BEFORE THAT,\nI DON'T HAVE A CLUE. YOU KNOW?\nI'M JUST NOT ONE -- PROBABLY AN 8-TRACK.\nHUH? IT WAS PROBABLY\nAN 8-TRACK. A CASSETTE. BUT YEAH, I NEVER LISTEN\nTO THE RADIO IN MY CAR, 'CAUSE I LIKE TO HEAR\nTHE ENGINE OF THE CAR. [ LAUGHTER ] THIS IS THE MAN WHO, YOU KNOW,\nENJOYS SOUNDS, RIGHT? YEAH. THAT'S PROBABLY\nWHAT KIND OF -- ACTUALLY, ONE OF MY CARS\nIS ON THE RECORDING, TOO, ON THE BREAKDOWN\nIN \"PANAMA,\" WHERE IT GOES,\n\"OH, I'M A LITTLE HOT TONIGHT,\" AND THEN VROOM! THAT'S ONE OF MY CARS. [ LAUGHTER ] DID YOU ALL KNOW THAT,\nOR IS THAT A NEW ONE? Woman:\nWHAT'S THE MAKE AND MODEL? OH, A 1972\nMIURA S LAMBORGHINI. [ SCATTERED APPLAUSE ] WHICH I STILL HAVE TODAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] NOW,\nYOU TALK ABOUT CLAPTON BEING AN EARLY INFLUENCE\nOF YOURS, BUT I THINK YOU ALSO WERE\nLISTENING TO JIMI HENDRIX. NOT SO MUCH, ACTUALLY. NO?\nNO. JIMMY PAGE?\nANY OF THOSE GUYS? YOU KNOW,\nIT'S LIKE UNLESS... NO, NOT REALLY. UNLESS THEY WERE SONGS\nTHAT ALEX OR OUR BASS PLAYER\nAT THE TIME, MARK STONE, WOULD COME IN WITH AN ALBUM\nAND SAY, \"HEY, WANT TO LEARN THIS SONG\nBY THIS BAND,\" I USUALLY WASN'T THE ONE\nTO PICK THE SONGS WE PLAYED. IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE\nALL OF THOSE ICONIC GUITARISTS, THEY ALL PLAYED\nOFF-THE-RACK GUITARS. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE\nWHO SAID, \"MNH-MNH. THAT'S NOT\nGOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.\" WELL, OBVIOUSLY,\nIT WAS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM, BUT IT WASN'T FOR ME,\nYOU KNOW? DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING\nEXCEPT THAT, REALLY. WELL, THE SOUNDS THAT YOU WERE\nMAKING WITH VAN HALEN, REALLY KIND OF CHANGING\nTHE MUSICAL LANDSCAPE, IT REALLY KIND OF INSPIRED\nA WHOLE ERA OF COPYCATS. YEAH, WHICH AT FIRST,\nYOU KNOW, I KIND OF WENT... YOU KNOW, AT FIRST,\nIT KIND OF PISSED ME OFF. [ LAUGHTER ] THEN I STARTED THINKING,\n\"OH, GOD, WHAT DID I START?\" [ LAUGHTER ] BUT THEN, YOU KNOW, MY BROTHER\nAND MY FATHER BOTH TOLD ME, YOU KNOW, IMITATION IS\nTHE BIGGEST FORM OF FLATTERY, SO I JUST LET IT GO\nAT THAT. 'CAUSE WITH ME, IT WAS JUST\nTHE WAY I PLAYED, YOU KNOW? IT WASN'T LIKE\nI WAS COPYING ANYONE. BUT I THINK AT THAT TIME,\nPEOPLE -- YOU KNOW,\nALL THE RECORD LABELS WERE LOOKING FOR THEIR OWN\nVERSION OF VAN HALEN, YOU KNOW, WITH A GUITAR GOD\nAND COPYING YOUR HAIR, THE WAY YOU DRESS,\nEVEN YOUR STAGE PRESENCE. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M NOT A RECORD COMPANY EXEC.\nI DON'T KNOW HOW THEY THINK. [ LAUGHTER ] IN FACT, DIDN'T\nYOUR OWN RECORD LABEL TRY TO GET A BAND THAT\nSOUNDED LIKE VAN HALEN, TOO? OH, I'M SURE THEY DID. YEAH. WELL, YOU'VE HAD\nTHREE DIFFERENT SINGERS... YEAH. ...IN VAN HALEN. DOES IT CHANGE THE WAY\nYOU WRITE MUSIC TO WORK WITH\nTHESE DIFFERENT SINGERS? I THINK IT'S\nA NATURAL PROGRESSION. I DON'T THINK IT'S -- IT DEFINITELY WASN'T\nDIFFICULT FOR US BECAUSE IT STARTS WITH THE MUSIC\nALL THE TIME, ANYWAY. SO, IF ANYTHING, IT WAS MORE\nOF THEM HAVING TO ADAPT TO US THAN US\nADAPTING TO THEM. BUT I THINK, YOU KNOW,\nYOU WOULD THINK THAT THEY WOULD HAVE\nDIFFERENT LIKES AND DIFFERENT MUSICAL\nCAPABILITIES, AS WELL. NO, IT WAS MORE LIKE, \"YOU SING THIS\nOR YOU'RE NOT IN.\" NO, I'M KIDDING. [ LAUGHTER ] I'M JOKING.\nI'M JOKING. YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, THERE'S ALWAYS A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FRICTION\nIN A BAND. IF YOU HAVE FOUR MEMBERS AND THEY ALL LIKE\nTHE IDENTICAL THING, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE\nNO VERSATILITY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S LIKE, I LISTENED TO MORE\nPROGRESSIVE MUSIC, WHEN I DID. ALEX LIKED\nSTRAIGHT AHEAD ROCK 'N' ROLL. DAVE WAS INTO DISCO. [ LAUGHTER ] AND -- NO, FOR REAL,\nYOU KNOW? AND TOGETHER, YOU KNOW,\nIT MADE A SOUP. YOU KNOW? AND WHAT CAME OUT OF IT,\nYOU KNOW, IT DIDN'T REALLY AFFECT\nTHE MUSIC, YOU KNOW, BUT HARMONY-WISE,\nSONG STRUCTURE, THINGS LIKE THAT,\nYOU KNOW. THERE WERE A LOT OF ELEMENTS OF A LOT OF THINGS\nTHAT WE ALL GREW UP ON. WELL, WHAT IT KIND OF\nAMOUNTED TO, I THINK, FOR A LOT OF US\nIN THIS ROOM IS THAT VAN HALEN\nREALLY WAS THE SOUNDTRACK FOR AN ENTIRE GENERATION. HOW DO YOU FEEL\nABOUT THAT? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] TWO THUMBS UP. WELL, I MEAN,\nIT'S AN HONOR, YOU KNOW? I MEAN,\nVERY FEW BANDS HAVE -- ARE AS LUCKY AS WE HAVE\nTO STILL HAVE AN AUDIENCE, YOU KNOW,\nAFTER PUSHING 40 YEARS. ROCK 'N' ROLL\nIN RECENT YEARS HAS KIND OF TAKEN A BACKSEAT\nTO POP, TO HIP-HOP. DO YOU THINK\nIT CAN MAKE A COMEBACK? I THINK IT HAS GONE AWAY,\nCOME BACK, GONE AWAY, COME BACK\nSO MANY TIMES, I WOULD BET ANYTHING\nTHAT IT'S COMING BACK. I MEAN, DON'T FORGET, WE GOT SIGNED\nIN THE MIDDLE OF PUNK AND DISCO. THEY LAUGHED AT US. YOU KNOW, \"WHAT ARE THESE GUYS\nDOING PLAYING ROCK 'N' ROLL? IT'S 'GET DOWN TONIGHT,' MAN. KC AND THE SUNSHINE BAND,\"\nYOU KNOW? WHICH YOU USED TO PLAY, RIGHT,\nWHEN YOU WERE DOING COVERS? BUT IT SOUNDED LIKE\nBLACK SABBATH WHEN WE DID IT. [ LAUGHTER ] THAT'S ANOTHER THING,\nYOU KNOW. IN THE CLUB DAYS, WE HAD TO PLAY\nTOP 40 TO GET THE GIGS, AND IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME\nTO EMULATE THESE RECORDS. I COULD NOT MAKE -- FOR THE LIFE OF ME,\nI TRIED SO HARD TO MAKE THE SONGS\nWE HAD TO PLAY, TO MAKE THEM SOUND LIKE\nTHE RECORD. BUT IT WAS ALSO\nA BLESSING IN DISGUISE, 'CAUSE ALL I CAN DO IS ME. NO MATTER WHAT I PLAY,\nIT SOUNDED LIKE ME. AND THAT'S WHY\nWHENEVER YOU HEAR VAN HALEN, YOU KNOW IT'S VAN HALEN\nBECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE CAN DO. YOU HEAR ALEX'S DRUMS, YOU KNOW IT'S HIS DRUMS,\nYOU KNOW? IT'S JUST THE NATURE\nOF THE BEAST, YOU KNOW. OTHERWISE, YOU PROBABLY WOULD'VE\nBECOME STUDIO MUSICIANS. [ LAUGHTER ] WELL, YOU RECENTLY CELEBRATED\nYOUR 60th BIRTHDAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. THANK YOU. [ APPLAUSE ] I FEEL LIKE\nA 60-YEAR-OLD PUNK KID WHO PLAYS GUITAR\nIN A ROCK 'N' ROLL BAND, AND I'M SO BLESSED\nAND SO HONORED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT, MAKING MUSIC WITH MY SON\nAND MY BROTHER. [ APPLAUSE ] IT'S REALLY KIND OF\nVAN HALEN LEGACY BUILDING. I MEAN, YOU'RE BUILDING\nA THIRD GENERATION OF VAN HALEN MUSICIANS. WOLFY JOINED THE BAND\nIN 2006. WAIT TILL YOU HEAR\nHIS RECORD. [ LAUGHS ] WHEN IS THAT COMING OUT?\nPARDON? WHEN IS THAT COMING OUT? OH, THEY JUST STARTED. YOU KNOW,\nPROBABLY END OF THE YEAR. BUT THIS IS NOT POP TALKING.\nTHIS IS REAL TALK. IT BLEW MY MIND. LOOKING FORWARD\nTO HEARING THAT. OH, YEAH. BRINGING THE ROCK BACK,\nWOLFY? [ LAUGHS ] WELL, YOU GUYS ALL MET\nALEX AND WOLFY HERE SITTING\nIN THE AUDIENCE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WHAT ADVICE\nDID YOUR FATHER GIVE YOU THAT YOU WANTED TO MAKE SURE\nWOLFY KNEW? [ SIGHS ] THINGS HE ALWAYS\nUSED TO SAY TO US WAS THAT YOU CAN LEARN\nFROM EVERYBODY WHAT TO DO\nAND WHAT NOT TO DO. MOSTLY WATCH PEOPLE\nFOR WHAT NOT TO DO. AND IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE,\nTRY TO DO IT TWICE AND SMILE. [ LAUGHTER ] 'CAUSE THAT WAY,\nPEOPLE WILL THINK YOU MEANT IT. YOU KNOW,\nHIS DUTCH TERMINOLOGY. [ SPEAKS DUTCH ] JUST MEANS JUST KEEP PEDALING\nAND SMILE. CAN WE TALK ABOUT LES PAUL\nFOR A MINUTE? OH, YEAH.\nVERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU'RE THE HEIR TO THE TORCH\nHE CARRIED FOR HALF A CENTURY. I MEAN, YOU BOTH WRITE,\nPLAY, YOU BOTH INNOVATE. A LOT OF KINDRED SPIRITNESS\nTHERE. A LOT OF FUNNY STORIES. I MEAN, HE --\nI'D KNOWN HIM FOR YEARS, AND HE -- YOU KNOW, HE LIVED IN NEW YORK,\nSO EAST COAST. AND HE'D CALL ME UP,\nAND IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING, AND I'M GOING\n\"[Groggily] HELLO?\" HE'S GOING,\n\"EDDIE, IT'S LES.\" I'M GOING, \"RIGHT.\" [ CHUCKLES ] I'M GOING, \"OH, HI, LES.\nTHAT'S RIGHT, IT'S 3:00.\" BUT WE'D PICK EACH OTHER'S\nBRAIN, YOU KNOW, ABOUT, \"SO, WHAT ARE YOU\nTINKERING AROUND WITH NOW?\" YOU KNOW, AND I REMEMBER\nONE OF OUR CONVERSATIONS, I SAID, \"WELL, YOU KNOW, I'M HAVING SUCH A PROBLEM\nFINDING THE RIGHT PICK. YOU KNOW, I CAN'T HOLD ON\nTO THE DAMN THING, SO I TOOK SOME KRAZY GLUE\nAND CUT OUT SOME SANDPAPER AND KRAZY GLUED IT TO THE PICK\nSO I CAN HOLD ON TO IT.\" HE'S GOING,\n\"YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING. THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING\nRIGHT NOW.\" [ LAUGHTER ] AND THAT'S FOR REAL.\nTHAT'S FOR REAL. IT'S LIKE WE WERE DEFINITELY\nCONNECTED IN A STRANGE WAY. AND HE WOULD ALWAYS END\nTHE CONVERSATION BY, \"YOU KNOW SOMETHING,\nEDDIE? YOU, ME, LEO FENDER, WE'RE THE ONLY ONES THAT KNOW\nHOW TO BUILD A GUITAR.\" [ LAUGHTER ] [ APPLAUSE ] HE WAS A WONDERFUL,\nWONDERFUL MAN, AND, YOU KNOW,\nI'M SO GLAD THAT MY SON HAD THE OPPORTUNITY\nTO MEET HIM ON THE '07 TOUR? YEAH. ON THE '07 TOUR\nBACKSTAGE IN NEW YORK. AND REMEMBER HE ASKED ME\nABOUT THE TAPPING THING, AND I ALMOST GOT HIM TO DO IT,\nYOU KNOW? [ LAUGHTER ] 'CAUSE HE SAID, \"SHOW ME\nHOW YOU DO THAT TAPPING STUFF,\" AND I SAID, \"OKAY, HERE.\" AND THEN\nAT THE LAST MINUTE, WE EITHER HAD TO GO ON\nOR SOMETHING OR HE BACKED OUT AND SAID,\n\"NAH, I BETTER NOT,\" YOU KNOW. BUT THAT WAS A MOMENT\nTO CAPTURE, YOU KNOW? OR, YOU KNOW,\nA MOMENT TO REMEMBER. DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU'RE\nLIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM? OH, COME ON. COMING HERE WITH\nAPPROXIMATELY $50 AND A PIANO, NOT BEING ABLE TO SPEAK\nTHE LANGUAGE, GOING THROUGH EVERYTHING\nTO GET TO WHERE WE ARE, YEAH, IF THAT'S NOT\nAN AMERICAN DREAM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS. YOU KNOW? [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOUR FATHER PASSED AWAY\nIN 1986, SO HE GOT TO SEE\nTHE SUCCESS THAT YOU HAD. YES,\nHE DID GET TO SEE IT. HE USED TO SIT\nON MY SIDE OF THE STAGE NEXT TO THE MONITOR GUY, AND YOU COULD JUST SEE HIM\nJUST BOOGIEING AND, YOU KNOW, SMILING,\nAND TEARY-EYED SMILING. HE WAS JUST SO HAPPY\nHE WAS CRYING. SO, YEAH, HE GOT TO SEE\nTHE SUCCESS THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE, YOU KNOW, WHICH INDIRECTLY,\nHE DID GET, YOU KNOW. WELL, HE'S THE ONE\nWHO HAD THE NAME VAN HALEN. OBVIOUSLY, HE WAS... [ LAUGHTER ] WITHOUT HIM,\nWE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN, SO YEAH. SO... WELL, I'M SURE --\nBUT YEAH. OH. NO, I'M SURE\nHE WAS INCREDIBLY PROUD. I MEAN REALLY, ONLY IN AMERICA\nIS IT STILL POSSIBLE, YOU KNOW? IT'S ALL ABOUT FREEDOM, AND YOU PUT YOUR NOSE\nAND TAIL TO IT, AND IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING\nTHAT YOU WANT TO DO, I REALLY STILL THINK THAT IF YOU JUST DON'T STOP,\nYOU KNOW? WELL, THOSE ARE GREAT WORDS\nTO KIND OF THINK ABOUT AS WE LEAVE HERE. BUT IN THE MEANTIME, WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS\nFROM THE AUDIENCE. Woman: KEITH. THERE WE GO.\nTHANK YOU. WE DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS\nFROM THE AUDIENCE. WE LEFT SOME TIME ASIDE\nFOR ALL OF YOU GUYS. THERE ARE TWO OF US\nWITH MICROPHONES. THEY'LL APPROACH THE PEOPLE\nWITH THE QUESTIONS. I WANT TO SAY THAT PLEASE SAY YOUR FIRST\nAND LAST NAME BEFORE YOUR QUESTION. THIS IS BEING RECORDED. IT'LL BE UP ON THE whatitmeanstobeamerican.org\nWEBSITE FIRST THING\nTOMORROW MORNING. YOU CAN SHARE WITH FRIENDS,\nFAMILY, COLLEAGUES, AND OTHER AMAZING FANS\nWHO COULD NOT MAKE IT TONIGHT. DANIELLE'S GOT THE FIRST\nQUESTION ON THE LEFT. Lambdin: HELLO, ED.\nOVER HERE. MY NAME IS JOHN LAMBDIN. Van Halen:\nHEY, NICE SHIRT. HEY, GREAT ALBUM. [ APPLAUSE ] BY THE WAY, THANK YOU\nFOR BEING THE MUSICAL OASIS FOR ALMOST EVERYONE IN HERE. YOUR DEBUT ALBUM WAS RELEASED\n37 YEARS AGO THIS WEEK. ACTUALLY,\nIT WAS TWO DAYS AGO. WHEN YOU FINISHED RECORDING IT, WHAT WAS YOUR PERSONAL FEELINGS\nOF HOW IT WOULD BE RECEIVED BASED ON THE MUSICAL LANDSCAPE\nOF THAT TIME? HMM. LIKE I SAID EARLIER,\nWE WERE -- YOU KNOW, ROCK 'N' ROLL\nWAS NOT AT THE FOREFRONT AT ALL ON THE CHARTS OR ANYTHING, SO WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLUE,\nREALLY. BUT WHAT GOT US\nTO GETTING A RECORD DEAL IS THE SAME THING\nTHAT MADE THAT RECORD SUCCEED, WHICH IS WE JUST PLAYED\nEVERYWHERE NONSTOP. WE WERE ON THE ROAD\nFOR 11 MONTHS SUPPORTING THAT RECORD. WE DID 23 GIGS IN 25 DAYS\nIN ENGLAND ALONE, AND THEN WE CAME HOME\nAFTER 11 MONTHS OF TOURING, AND WARNER BROS. GOES, \"YOU OWE US $3 MILLION\nAND A NEW ALBUM.\" [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE WENT,\n\"HOW DOES THAT WORK?\" [ LAUGHTER ] ANYWAY, I WON'T GET INTO THAT,\nBUT... [ LAUGHTER ] BOTTOM LINE IS\nWE BELIEVED IN OURSELVES. AND WE WOULDN'T TAKE NO\nFOR AN ANSWER. JUST LIKE WHEN NO RECORD COMPANY\nWANTED ANYTHING TO DO WITH US, WE THREW OUR OWN GIGS. WE PLAYED BACKYARD PARTIES. WE PRINTED OUR OWN FLIERS TO STUFF LOCKERS\nAT HIGH SCHOOLS AND WE PLAYED HIGH SCH--\nWE PLAYED EVERYWHERE. WHETHER YOU LIKED US OR NOT,\nYOU DEFINITELY HAD HEARD OF US. [ LAUGHTER ] AND WE WOULD NOT\nLET YOU GET AWAY WITHOUT AT LEAST GIVING IT --\nYOU KNOW, HEARING US. AND SLOWLY, WE BUILT AN AUDIENCE\nOF ABOUT 3,000 TO 5,000 PEOPLE EVERY TIME WE PLAYED\nTHE PASADENA CONVENTION CENTER IN PASADENA, OBVIOUSLY. DUH. AND WARNER BROS. EVENTUALLY\nCAME TO US BECAUSE THEY SAID, \"WOW, IF THEY CAN DO IT HERE,\nTHEY CAN DO IT ANYWHERE.\" AND THAT'S HOW IT ALL HAPPENED. Woman:\nNEXT QUESTION ON YOUR RIGHT. HI, EDDIE. MY NAME IS JEFF POLANSKI\nFROM BUFFALO, NEW YORK.

YOU KNOW, I WAS ACTUALLY GOING\nTHROUGH A PRETTY ROUGH TIME WHEN HE JOINED THE BAND. I WAS STILL DRINKING\nAT THE TIME, AND I GOT SOBER\nDURING THAT FIRST TOUR. AND I WAS SO NERVOUS, AND EVERY TIME I LOOKED\nAT MY SON, I'M GOING, \"OKAY, IF MY 16-YEAR-OLD SON\nCAN BE KICKING ASS LIKE THAT, I BETTER SUCK IT UP HERE,\"\nYOU KNOW? SO, LOOK.

THEIR NAMES WERE STEVEN\nAND RUSSELL, AND WE BECAME FAST FRIENDS\n'CAUSE I COULD OUTRUN THEM. [ LAUGHTER ] BUT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS\nACTUALLY THE WHITE PEOPLE THAT WERE THE BULLIES, YOU KNOW?

some more helpful tips go to Rick Kirkham Ju and hit the store finder button thanks for watching good luck and I hope to see you answer", "3patCDVUooc": "[Music] this morning I took the liberty of picking 23 plants here in Ashland Oregon these plants all grow in Oregon but I'm confident that you will find most if not all of these plants all over the United States and if you are a viewer from Europe or Australia or New Zealand I've traveled to your country and have found most of these plants growing so I think what I'm about to tell you is going to be very applicable to you so the idea today is that I'm just gonna take each plant and spend a few minutes talking about some of its health benefits how to identify it that kind of thing and hopefully by the end you will be a little bit more familiar with wild edibles the first plant that I would like to talk about today is this one known as lambsquarters often people get scared when I say I put lambsquarters in your smoothie because they're like well and if you really put meat in the smoothie but it's just the name I'm guessing lambs like to eat this that's called lambs quarters for that reason it's a very awesome beginner a wild edible because it's pretty mild to the taste it tastes pretty delicious you can eat it in salads it's great in smoothies literally every part is edible although I generally stay away from eating the roots of plants because they're not as delicious they're definitely not as nutritious and they're just harder to harvest they also kill the plants so I just today I'm going to mostly concentrate on eating the greens so a few identifying characteristics of lambsquarters is that it has this fine dust it's like this waxy substance on the leaves sometimes the dust is white sometimes it's purple but regardless it's full of calcium and protein and good to ingest so you don't need to wash that off you can see the the shape of the leaf is triangular it's kind of serrated although not too sharp and the stem is very fibrous and it has these white lines going up it so this is lambsquarters it's sort of like a wild spinach it's going to be high in protein high in calcium rich in iron and antioxidants which is good for killing cancer cells and it's an awesome green to use now if you're not familiar with wild edibles you're not sure what lambsquarters looks like a great resource for finding lambsquarters is organic farms lambsquarters is actually a weed that plagues all organic farms so if you have a moment you know maybe on some Saturday you can visit your local organic farm and just say hey can you please point out the weed lambsquarters and they'll happily show you you can even you know buy a bushel from them although I don't think they will charge you number two is wild strawberries and wild strawberries are easy to identify because they look just like regular strawberries except they have berries that are not super symmetrical and they're generally smaller what most people kind of figured out is that you know wild strawberries the strawberry is of course the edible part right wrong you can actually eat all parts of the plant you can eat the leaves you can eat the flowers the stems and of course the berries the leaves of wild strawberries are actually more nutritious than the berries themselves the berries are going to have lots of carbohydrates lots of sugars they'll give you energy whereas the leaves are very mineral rich and they're going to nourish your body now while strawberries in particular are rich in iron they're especially good for women who are pregnant or wanting to be pregnant because they soothe female organs and just do miracles for that wild strawberries as well as household strawberries also tighten the gums and prevent loose teeth and they have high vitamin A & C which is good for the skin so whenever you're making a smoothie maybe throw a couple wild strawberry leaves in or if you get strawberries that are organic from the store make sure that you blend the green part with the berry okay next we have miner's lettuce and this is probably a staple wild edible in my diet during the spring months it's readily available very easy to identify and very delicious it has very minors lettuce has a very unique structure it's got this well-defined stem that goes right through the center of the leaf it continues growing and then it will develop flowers and fruits of course fruits it's not going to be like a grape or a banana it's just going to be like little berries of the miner's lettuce so this so we're clear on that so there's the stem that goes straight through the leaves and it's very juicy very high in water so it can actually hydrate your body it has a pretty plain taste there was a great plant throughout history people would just eat it as a salad green miner's lettuce is most famous for preventing experiment unev vitamin C in it in fact in history General George Washington one of the presidents of the United States once issued an order to all his troops he said you know scurvy and other diseases and infections are running rampant in the camps and I've noticed that those camps that pick and harvest wild edibles and add them to their meals don't have the same problems they're more resistant to infections disease and so on and so forth so he actually ordered the commanding officer of every troop to go out every morning or twice a week three times a week and ration them out to all the troops so miner's lettuce is high in vitamin C it's good for the heart and also in vitamin A which is good for our eyes and our skin you can see that it also has a unique growing structure in that the plant has one root and then all the the different stems spread out from that root growing tall sometimes sprawling along the ground and it doesn't matter it if you find one with a big leaf or a small leaf because you know the structure is the same the stem goes directly through a circular disc like leaf plant number four is dandelions and dandelions are probably the most common found wild edible I'm pretty sure in this day and age everybody knows what a dandelion is however I'm here to change your guys's opinion of them today dandelions are one of the healthiest wild edibles that I'm aware of although it's hard to say that because literally every wild edible here is going to be very nutritious there are roughly 300 varieties of dandelions and all of them are edible there's no poisonous look-alikes which means that if you eat something that you think is a dandelion and you make a mistake you're still guaranteed health benefits there's nothing poisonous one sure way to identify a dandelion versus something else is to pick a leaf or leave it on the plant and run your finger along the underbelly of the leaf along the main vein and if it's smooth it's a dandelion if it's not smooth it's a dandelion look alike so whether the Leafs they're pointy or lobed or very sharp as long as the stem is smooth it's a dandelion now sometimes people say well I've heard that the white sap that comes from a dandelion is poisonous that is completely false it's not true whatsoever dandelions are bitter by nature and we need bitters in our diet to be healthy the bitter taste that is prevalent in dandelions is good for cleansing all of our organs our pancreas our kidneys our liver our gull bladder and so we need to get those bitters into our diet if you're not so keen on bitters try eating the smaller leaves again the smaller the leaf the less bitter it's going to be another good way to trick your body into liking dandelions is to blend bitter tastes with some kind of oil or fat so for example making pesto and adding dandelions to the pesto is one great way to consume dandelions another excellent way is to consume dandelions in a green smoothie because the fruits will cut the taste of the bitter and also don't forget to eat dandelion flowers they're very sweet they're very delicious they have the same benefits as dandelions although they're much more palatable and you can just pluck the flower and eat it straight off like that this next plant is a newly discovered plant to me it's called wild sweet peas or wild peas and it was I became aware of it when my friend and fellow wild edible enthusiast John Kahless had us eating it and it basically is just a wild pea ironically this wild pea the pods that will develop on it taste horrible they're very hard they're bitter and I generally don't eat them same with the majority of the plant it's pretty firm it's not that pleasant to eat however the very tip is super tender and super delicious and you just pluck it off stick it in your mouth it's delicious as a trailside nibble you can throw it in wraps salads smoothies that kind of thing so basically any part that's tender is fair game [Music]", "pfEb3Ao6M0w": "what's rocking with y'all today how y'all doing today it's all about this new vendor who is on the streets stumping through the mud let's get into it [Music] thank you for choosing and grinning and watching and looking and listening come in and get doing all those things that you do on YouTube welcome back to my channel it's your girl Sasha we bout to rock into this teddy bees wax Hall very new vendor on the scenes and when I say new I don't even think she's been in business a year or half she educate me in the comments below cuz y'all know the superfans only come out when you're incorrect when you say something they don't like if you don't like something they don't like okay so correct me and let me know but you know what I don't think I'm gonna have that problem when it comes to this community of teddy bees that she's you know created shall I say customers have created and that her admin team are creating her group on Facebook is poppin they are like cousins and it's really crazy how the dynamics of so many different personalities can come together and just really connect with each other over things that make you you know feel good I guess shall I say but we're gonna go ahead and flip the camera around I'm gonna share my honest opinions about my hauls some of y'all's favorites are mine mm-hmm like that Coachella it's not my favorite it appeals 7 8 out of 10 but it's not something that I would like dive into I have to like add something else to it but other than that we'll see when I flip this camera around and then we're gonna be right back so chill out hey guys all right so this is her awesome business card you guys know how much I am in love with square business cards I use them for my own business so they're just awesome now I love that she has Teddy's teddy beeswax all across social media to me that's very important very nice beautiful aesthetic minimalistic business card and I absolutely love her logo love it so much now let's go ahead and jump into these samples that I melted first I went ahead and got through the morning cup of spice this was very very good I was actually digging this I did not want to pour this off and I wrote this down to make sure I buy more of that because that was a very nice beautiful coffee blend I loved it so much then we have blueberry butter pecan cookies my husband really enjoyed this one I am not usually a butter pecan type of person but this was nice with that Blackberry I'm sorry I said it wrong blackberry butter pecan cookies this was good okay and we were going back and forth because my husband says pecan and I said pecan too but then sometimes I'll say pecan but either way it's good stuff so then we have violets are blue now this was a little bit on the floral side for me I tried to love it love it but I wasn't loving it as much as I wanted to so I went ahead an adage I found one of my lingerie oils that I really love that I went ahead and add it to it and then it just really turned it up for me highly recommend that for those of you that like violet let's see here then we have blueberry lemon cheesecake this is a heart I did not melt this because I already know I'm not a fan of blueberry in wax I have had blueberry cheesecake wax before I just not a fan of it so I'm just gonna save this and toss it in a random act of kindness box one day lovely now this is a very nice pretty scent I am really looking forward to melting this one I have not melted this I do like it's kind of like this sophisticated vibe going on so I will probably just go ahead and put the sentinals up so you guys can see what it is if I can find them and then go from there then I have an extra sample of Coachella now Coachella is one that I did by larger quantities up it's a very nice scent you know the scent appealed to me on warm when I did melted which I'll get into was 8 out of 10 it's not one of my favorites I actually prefer her I love you to the moon and back over Coachella and diving into that this was a very nice lovely scent I had this in a guest bedroom on the first floor this through so well this through just one square it was a it was a nice sized chunk it was you know some people will cut their chunks in half me if it's us if it's something if it's a sample this size you know I put the whole thing in the warmer it's it's perfect for warming you know a lot of people will be going back and forth about oh you're using too much or you're not using enough you know you go I go based off of the warmers that I'm using in the size that I'm using so in my guest bedroom my large plate I actually put that whole thing and earned it through for it through for a while and when I say a while over a day matter of fact I actually still had this going because I forgot to take it out that's how awesome this is and that's how what I love about her wax is you can actually just let it go and do its thing then we have kamasutra this is very nice I have not melted this one yet but on coal I really really enjoyed this one now this is a dual order so that's why I have so many samples because this is more than one order okay let's go ahead and dive into what our order now I've been saving this one I mean I want to melt this one so bad this is what I love about Sunday now I probably won't put the scent notes up for these like I usually do because I'm gonna read them to you so there's no need for me to put it up anymore let's see here lavender jasmine rose petals white lilies and vanilla musk this is a very good on cold this is a nice fresh type of vibe not fresh as it going outside or walking through the park or anything like that but more like a pretty type of fresh and as you can see it got like the D to the two sizes here I don't mind taking one out to show you the different designs on it you know I know like I know people love looking at that stuff see how pretty that is very pretty I just don't like handling getting wax all over the place on my table and stuff I don't care about my fingers anyway what I love about Sunday I definitely recommend this scent from her can I wait to melt that now I probably would have melted it by the time I flip the camera around but we will see so let's go ahead and keep going through this then we have tips favorite lavender on cold this is a very beautiful lavender it's soft lavender sweet marshmallows and vanilla coconut milk I do like the design again some people will cut these in half me I just put the whole thing in the warmer and keep it moving and now her lavender is very very nice I can tell that she really you know you can tell when someone's really putting in the effort or finding a good lavenders out there oh this is just such a this it kind of reminds me even if she were to take the marshmallow out of out of here if you like fake BAPS lavender coconut milk you will love tips favorite lavender that's a really good comparison or if you like comfort from hating row that's what exactly what this reminds me of okay I mean just really honestly its depth its damn near spot-on to tapes lavender coconut milk and we just want to be truthful then we have blankets by the fire now this one is so good if I were to get bags of something it would definitely be this one this is cotton white tea bergamont lavender and bonfire bonfire bliss I even have it in her clams I love this so much this is a very nice beautiful blend I don't even I can't even rave enough about this sundresses and lemonade now this is a very bright this is ozone roses Jasmine lavender let me tell you what makes this bright that sugar and lemon that that's the lemon sugar is really lemon sugar all I smell on warm is lemon sugar and I redid rebadge this out of the bag that it came in because it came in a regular sized chunk bag but I did go ahead and repack it but this is straight-up lemon sugar with a little hint of laundry and it's very very strong as hell you don't need a lot of this and if you use too much you may want to turn your warmers off so strong but I do recommend this for those of you that like that bright lemon Laundry type of vibe and but it's not my favorite my favorite was actually bonfire blankets and also laundry day laundry day was awesome beautiful clean laundry this through well over a day I enjoyed it so much the scent appeal was 10 out of 10 was 9 out of 10 10 out of 10 it was amazing I highly recommend that now here's the thing with her clams not only are they huge but that's how big that is that's a pretty nice size but you can also cut them in half if you want okay just so you can get some mileage and some real estate out of your out of her clams last but not least is Coachella now Coachella is very very popular a lot of people push this saying this isn't this isn't my favorite out of the bunch this is nice it throws very well I did leave a review about this in her group I left my honest review about it you know a lot of people were saying this is 10 out of 10 9 out of 10 it's a lot of people's favorite it's not my favorite but it is on a very nice scent it's not complex to me because it to me it smells like to specific oils that I have smelled before you definitely can get the lavender and the cedar wood on this but for me I would say having melted this again that I prefer her blankets by the bonfire and her laundry day but definitely blankets by the bonfire but I do recommend Coachella and let you let me let me know what you guys think this is lavender cedar wood Tonka sandalwood tropical fruits Jasmine coconut sea salt sea mists and green vetiver but let me know because this is a very popular stamp but these right here this this particular one right here steals the show for me so does her her laundry day I love it so much this is a very very good one and so these are two right here are my favorites out of all of these orders so let's go ahead and sit tight flip it around and I'll get right back to you now right now there are my favorites now because I haven't melted these yet okay to be fair alright sit tight okay so you saw what I ordered if I did not mention the owner of teddy bees is tiffany tiffany is fantastic outstanding seems to be very outgoing always speaking up in the group always willing to assist the customers commenting on the post replying to comments trying to help her customers talking about different warmers talking about the warmer she's also using and things of that nature so it would be really cool to actually see her get on camera a lot more and to see her do more behind the scenes you know since she's so active in her group that would be very very cool and with her being a newer vendor it will continue to help her be able to connect with her clients which she's doing so I think that will be awesome now that being said Coachella I'm sorry I know y'all love it y'all love it I like that bonfire blankets more than Coachella and I'm a lavender fool okay I love lavender I love fresh lavender types of blends but to me it's not a fresh lavender blend but I do love her laundry blend though that laundry is a beach I am gonna be placing another order with her soon now I do still got some coach on the left so i'ma revisit it okay I may eat my words and later on but right now it's not my favorite but I don't hate it come and say that you know I really think you guys to check this vendor out she's got some very nice creamy wax easy to cut it throws very well and all of my warmers that I use regardless of temperature you know sometimes I see some comments and I'd be like hmm and I feel like testing the theory to see and I'm like no no no no no different so my opinion try her and all of your warmers okay and regardless of wattage to see what works best for you and your home you know the customer service is great turnaround time for shipping is great the pricing is great for her to be such a new vendor and the environment that her group is already create like there are some vendors that are just like boss boom amazing and they just have some dead-ass groups tagging these groups is one just bump in it's just a fun environment it's great um you know I know it's not this ain't about her group it's supposed to be about her wax but I've already said order her wax okay now I'm inviting you into what appears to be a very cool family that you want to be a part of and so all I'm saying is I think is dope as far as the wax the the throw in my house has been very very good I do think that she's very generous when it comes to her samples and things like that now there are samples that I did receive there's an order I think I'm gonna go ahead and place I do need to place another order with her with other scents and get some more of that laundry I hope she brings the laundry one in Bakery bags again because that's a good one I think that for those of us that like fresh sense it does not smell like you're washing clothes I think it's so well blended and you know I think a lot of people just have this bit misconceptions about what those of us who like laundry smell like you know and as I said in the laundry video that I do have coming it's a laundry fresh clean type of video and it's about an hour long I think I tried I tried to cut it down maybe like maybe not an hour long but it's pretty lengthy I think an hour is over stretching it but I talk about different types of things that you can blend different types of launching oils out there the most popular are your flannel sheets some gain island fresh gain clean cotton but there's so many more laundry oils past that so many things that you can blend with laundry to make it something other than smelling like a dryer sheet and and it's such a big misconception don't get me wrong I still love my clean cotton my flannel sheet if it's a good flannel sheet oil and things like that but this particular blend that she has created the laundry day blend that she has it's very very good it's just so clean alike and refresh refreshing and to me someone who melts a lot of clean fresh spa earthy blends I'm able to just really pick up on certain stuff on as long as I've been melting and the years that I've been melting wax and stuff like that so yeah definitely check out teddy bees join her group and also I haven't checked the file section of her group to see if there's any information on her file section usually I am on top of that so my apologies I will not putting up scent descriptions in this particular video I didn't know you guys know me over here as the person who does the whole set description thing because that is something extra that I wanted to do for my viewers to make myself a little bit unique on my channel and just to kind of you know make the videos a little bit more informative but at the end of the day sometimes I have time and sometimes I don't so I have already given you guys some scent descriptions on it so if you guys kind of don't remember what something is go back to that part of the video and we can go from there but I've had successful throw in my space with the sense that I have tried thus far and I came looking forward to continuing to order from this vendor so glad to be a part of the the teddy bees tribe I'm not as active in her group as I could be but I have like three other groups of my own that I'm running my business groups and stuff like that so I'm not always able to comment in facebook groups as much so when I am in there I pop in and I pop out but I definitely recommend you guys to join the group for those of you who are looking for like another community or family that belongs to a wax vendor that is very active and gone from there and definitely order her wax alright guys thanks for watching bye [Music]", "-dBWrpivT0w": ">>> WALK AROUND CENTER CITY, IT SEEMS LIKE

business or hobby feel free to check in the description below for my other resources facebook instagram website and so on okay so as i mentioned today we're going to talk about the supply shortages and the delays that we all are experiencing and it's very frustrating and difficult to deal with i'm going to review some of the root causes some obvious indirect and some more indirect also what we are hearing from other manufacturers and suppliers directly and then several tips and options for dealing with these problems okay so let's start off with the the root causes of the supply chain issues that we're all experiencing by supply chain issues what i'm referring to is uh supply raw material shortages or delays and increased lead times things like that i think most of us understand what the problem is and i think also most of us understand what the direct cause of this problem is and that is the pandemic but i think a lot of us when we hear that we don't really understand what that means like yes we know there's a pandemic but why is the pandemic causing these issues well the biggest issue that the pandemic is causing directly is a lack of domestic and global resiliency and what does that mean well if we talk about domestic first now i'm here in the u.s but this domestic would be your own country where you're at all of our countries are having internal domestic issues uh with maintaining normal operations normal operating procedures and that is issues caused by delays in shipping staffing issues issues getting their own raw materials to do their normal job shutdowns things like that so we're all dealing with different varying levels of domestic disruption well the second part of this is your global resiliency issue and that is global disruption well if every country is dealing with their own domestic disruptions that of course you can imagine is larger on a grand scale when you talk to global think of it like one big puzzle if every country has its own piece and they're all having issues and they're not fitting right things just aren't working right well you miss a lot of those pieces it's hard to really get an idea of what the entire puzzle is supposed to look like it's hard to complete the puzzle the entire globe works together when it comes to business with that efficiency broken down it really causes a lot of problems so i'm not going to go into a lot more detail i think most of us understand on at least a high level that the pandemic itself is causing a direct issue with our supply chain however there is the more indirect cause to the supply chain issues that we're experiencing um and it's caused from the pandemic but in a more indirect way and that is the booming home hobbies and businesses that have started in 2020 and are going to continue to go on through 2021 because of shutdowns and lockdowns and or layoffs due to businesses having to reduce staffing a lot more people are turning to at-home hobbies and at-home businesses and what that means is now we're having a surge of other people entering the market and utilizing the same supplies that we normally would so there's been a demand in supplies because more people getting into these industries or getting into these hobbies and with that increased demand and with already a shortage due to the problems the operational problems from the pandemic that creates it creates a big gap demand and supply works so well together normally to make the market work well we're dealing in this kind of perfect storm of a year or two years maybe now of where we're having supply issues yet we're having more demand and that's widening the gap even more than it normally would be considered acceptable normally when demand and supply gap widen there's correctable measures that can be taken to help kind of fix that issue that's kind of part of business and how the economy works well this is uh beyond extremes we have extremes on both end we're having extremes on the demand side and extremes on the supply side and it's causing the issues that we're seeing today but let's talk a little bit more about what the manufacturers and suppliers are telling us directly so the first thing that we're hearing is that and this is the obvious one is that manufacturers and suppliers are being adversely affected by the pandemic in a few different ways one is a shortage in raw materials well manufacturers can't manufacture what they do without the materials they need to make to manufacture and so if other manufacturers are having material issues a raw supply and material issues then that leads the next manufacturer who uses those components to have issues which leads the suppliers to have issues and then retailers and manufacturers like us to have issues it's really the supply chain cycle of inefficiencies and product problems that are causing the issue another problem is the shortages in staffing this kind of goes without saying but there's been a lot of unemployment around the globe in the past 12 months and those shortages in staffing is also affecting the ability for these companies to uh keep up with the normal operations and then lastly is your shipping delays sometimes this is an issue with the carriers themselves and other times it's just causing shipping delays because of the other two reasons there's a shortage of supplies and materials there's less staffing which means less production and that loss of production also means slower lead times and shipping delays now another reason that we're seeing some increase in etas and lead times is because employee safety concerns all companies are stepping up their employee safety standards and taking precautions to protect their employees and protect the public which in some of these measures do cause some extra delays so it's completely acceptable and we all understand why that needs to be done but you also also understand that that can cause extra delays and receiving our products as well now manufacturers and suppliers are also sharing with us that the optimistic scenarios for when they expect operations to turn back to quote-unquote normal is uh sometime late or early summer so basically summer of 2021 that's the optimistic scenario now the conservative scenario expect these issues to continue through at least q4 or quarter four of 2021 in other words expect problems to continue through the rest of the of this year now no one likes to hear that and that is concerning whether to some of us that have been doing this for a long time or concerning for new candle makers trying to get their feet wet and trying to get started and having a hard time doing so because of the issues trying to get new supplies so again that is not great news and no one really loves hearing that but that is the world we live in and that's reality so instead of just kind of burying our head in the sand kind of hoping for the best and everything turns out let's go ahead and take some steps let's what are the measures that we can do to help ourselves in this situation and is there anything we can do to kind of not just combat the problem but also prepare ourselves for the next year or so well that's the next chunk of this video i'm going to go over 10 different tips and strategies and options that you can take as a handcrafter manufactured retailer yourself to help set you up best for success in 2021 now some of these are my own individual tips and others are gathered from the experts in the industries that are telling us the best option in order to handle this issue so the first tip is to simply step up your tracking of your production your sales and your usage of your materials i've always been really big on metrics and analysis and logistics even as a small business owner so even if you haven't been doing this very long and you're very small overall it's still always important to track your own logistics and measures within your own business now if you're doing this as a hobby i understand that that's not going to be near as important for you to do if you're just kind of doing this as a hobbyist and and or for fun but as a small business one of the best ways to grow is to understand the logistics of your business and i have other videos that i talk about some software that i that i use heavily it's called craftybase i'll leave it in the description below and i'll also leave a link to the video up above now the reason i like that software is not just it doesn't just track your materials and your expenses and your orders and your cost of goods and all of that but it also gives you an idea of what you're selling and your you can create low stock limits and you can set those limits to whatever you want which means you can start getting alerted when you need to reorder and you can do this based off of whatever pattern you think is is the best and the best thing you can do is to track your sales try to forecast what you think you're going to need if you have a better idea of this visually and you can see your business on paper and how your sales are going your your production and your use of your materials you can better forecast what you'll need in a timely and more efficient manner and what i really like to do is consolidate these so i will set my thresholds for low inventory alerts um to a certain number and then you know every quarter or every month or something like that whatever whatever makes sense for your business you can order and consolidate that so you you can see all items that are low and then you can also see all the items that are approaching that low level and maybe you just order all that together a short summary tip here is just that you should be tracking your production and your materials the best that you can you don't have to use special software like the one i refer to you can do it on your excel spreadsheet you can do it whatever method you want but it's really important to track your production and your materials so tip number two is sort of related to tip number one and in fact once you do tip number one this tip will become a little easier and that is doing seasonal and routine projections so rather than just saying well i'm getting low on something i need to order start using those patterns and metrics to help you plan and focus out forecast out a little bit further particularly for seasonal projections like holidays for example instead of waiting to late fall to start deciding what you're going to want to offer for christmas or winter start doing that a little bit earlier in the year in other words don't wait to the last minute to decide what you're going to want to offer start thinking about that earlier in the year project what you plan to do earlier in the year this is a normal practice for big businesses it will help you grow as well but projecting those isn't quite enough which is where tip three comes in tip three is once you know your projections once you know your patterns and you've done tip one and two you really need to order supplies much earlier than you normally would and that is tip number three if you normally order for winter and fall and you normally order for fall during summer go ahead and do your ordering all a season earlier now i know that sounds awfully early and you you know a lot can happen between two seasons we live in right now with all these supply chain issues and excessive lead times it's really important to uh not be waiting the last minute for your supplies so go ahead and get your supplies early you're gonna thank yourself later for doing so so you're not in a rush or in a pinch trying to get supplies at the last minute tip number four is to line up multiple suppliers many candle makers really rely on just kind of one or two main suppliers and and that's a good thing to do in fact i have another video where i really push and encourage lining up just one or two manufacturers or suppliers when you're first starting out because it will help you keep your costs down it will help you consolidate and make your entire business operations easier we only have a couple suppliers to have to worry about dealing with but in times like this you really need to branch out and reach out to other suppliers now you can still rely first and foremost on your on your normal suppliers but it's good to have an idea of other suppliers that offer the same or similar products that you currently use because in times like this it can be helpful knowing that your wax is available not just at your normal supplier but five other places as well same with your wicks same with your jars because if your normal supplier runs short or runs low then you have other outlets to try before they start running low as well now generally speaking during this pandemic suppliers all the suppliers are having issues but somehow suppliers supplies a little bit longer before they run out or run low so get yourself build yourself a list of suppliers and what supplies they offer that you need to rely on number five is to increase your inventory so we've talked about ordering supplies early and increasing the amount of suppliers that you could potentially work with but the next step here is to actually increase the amount of supplies you're ordering increase your inventory now normally inventory control is very difficult thing already to deal with and you don't want to have excess inventory because inventory turnover and management of your inventory is very very important it helps keep your cost down your efficiency up but again with the issues we're all experiencing right now and the delays of receiving supplies and the shortages the best thing you can do right now is to increase your material inventory this will prevent you from getting low or running out nearly as quickly and it will also cut down on the issues you're having with reordering so for example i personally was not affected a ton by the shortages this year the reason was is because i had ordered so many materials and supplies previously just because i always try to keep a lot a lot of stock but i had noticed earlier this year or earlier in 2020 where things were starting to get a little bit iffy that i took some proactive measures just in case and i stepped up my inventory and ordered much more than i normally do and it got me through the entire year of 2020 without having to reorder again for most for most things anyways and so i was very fortunate in that regard but i know that i know a lot of people really did deal with some major issues now a lot of a lot of you newer candle makers don't have the capacity necessarily to be ordering too much bulk at once and so this might not apply to you but if you have the potential to order more inventory than you normally would that will prevent you from having so many issues when we're having these supply shortages and delays the next tip if you are unable to increase the amount of inventory across the board then focus on your critical products what products are most important for you to keep on the shelves to ensure the success of your business do you have certain products that are most popular do you have certain materials that you use in all your products for example do you only cert do you really only have one type of jar if so then that is a critical component for your business and so you really need to up the inventory for that as much as you can and as quickly as you can if you have certain products that sell more than others then you should up the inventory of the fragrance oils that you use for those particular candles or the wicks that you use for those particular candles or labels and so on so the key idea here is to focus on your critical components and critical products to keep your business afloat now tip number seven is to have a contingency plan or a backup plan where possible at least it's not always possible but where you can try to come up with some backup products and backup materials for example if you do typically only use one jar in your candle lines try to find a suitable replacement jar for example a jar that is roughly the same size or at least roughly the same diameter something that you feel like you can suitably replace as an alternative if you run lower out of your other products now of course you would need to be transparent with your customers maybe on your website change your descriptions or your titles or whatever your avenue is for selling make sure you are transparent and explain to customers that you know you've run low or out of certain materials or supplies due to the pandemic and so you're offering these suitable replacements in the meantime now you may need to adjust price depending on how drastic a backup you need to go to but it's really nice to have something else to fall back on so that you're not completely out of business just because you run out of a core material another great backup item to have is an alternative wick now typically our can as camel makers we try to come up with the optimal and best overall wick for our particular candle it's also a great idea to test and come up with a suitable backup wick sometimes we run into situations where we either run lower out of wicks or suppliers and manufacturers no longer carry those wicks right now a lot of candlemakers are experiencing that so having another wick that works really well as a secondary option can really save you in a patch so the seventh tip is to have backups where applicable tip number eight is to update your fax on your website your frequently asked questions and also your policies for your customers for example you might have to update your return policy your refund policy explain that due to the pandemic there's the potential for supply chain issues and you're doing your best to navigate through the pandemic basically just use all these other businesses that are doing this as a reference and kind of see how they're handling the situation but most of them have some type of banner right on their website that says you know we're we are dealing with covet 19 related issues just like most other businesses around the world we're doing our best there could be issues with delays and refunds and processing of orders things like that it's all going to depend and vary by business to business and candlemaker to candlemaker but basically just update your policies and your facts on your website transparency to your customers really goes a long way tip number nine is to extend your own lead times and your etas now you can do this as part of tip 8 when you're updating your fax and your policies but this is really important i would highly recommend on your website updating your lead times and your shipping etas most of us like to say you know we'll ship within three days to one week or will she ship within one week something like that probably should update those during these times most customers are going to completely understand but it's much better to give this information up front rather than not change that your customers are expecting the order in two or three days it doesn't happen until a week or two later and then you have to kind of explain the issues with shipping and that a lot of it's outside of your control and sometimes you can just end up with an unhappy customer even though it's not your fault and even though they know it's not your fault so the best thing you can do is be up front extend your shipping extend your lead times extend your shipping etas i think most customers will ex will appreciate the honesty and the transparency and it gives you more wiggle room there's a saying that i really love and that is under promise over deliver if you extend your shipping if you extend your shipping times your etas your lead times to say one week to two weeks but you still are able to get a lot of your orders out earlier than that well then you're just going to excite your customers and that's just going to be over delivering what you promised and that is always great it's much better to always under promise and over deliver instead of the other way around and the last tip i have for you today is to simply innovate use this as an opportunity to get your creative juices flowing and to be unique and search for ways to make your business even better more innovative unique do something different if you're having trouble getting certain supplies to make certain products this is the time to try something new start working on a new product start testing a new product and making something different or what can you do to your current products to kind of jazz them up a little bit is there anything you can do different in your business and your own operations to increase your own efficiency to increase your own profit work on your marketing anything like that this is going to be a difficult year or two for a lot of us anyways so use the opportunity that's given to you to do what you can improve your business in different ways not everything is just about making the candles themselves there are a lot of ways to improve your business and this is a really good time to try to work on those things i wish you all the best in 2021 i know 2020 was a really rough year and i'm hoping you know just like everyone else at 2021 um ends up being better it's been a little bit of a rocky start so far but uh you know fingers crossed that uh things improve from here i'm wishing all of you the best of luck and the best of success in 2021 and all yours going forward i really hope that this video give you a little bit of encouragement also some hope uh and

weed accom and today we're in San Jose and we're visiting the lux dispensary and they've been kind enough to show us what the process is like for a new patient at a dispensary so let's go inside and check it out okay so we're here with Doug klopek and he is the co-founder of lux and could you tell us just a little bit about lux sure Lux has been operating out of this facility since October Lux is a merger of three previously operating dispensaries in the city of San Jose and can you tell me a little bit about what the average age of the patient is oddly enough our average age is in the early 40s we're pretty good mix of male and female because of the environment that we work so hard to create here with a warm welcoming environment between staff and appropriately recommended medicine we've been able to focus on a sector of the market to make them feel comfortable people have a fear about going to dispensaries but they come to one and they see that it's actually really nice it's really comfortable and it's a nice environment the people at the counter are always nice the blood tenders are probably some of the nicest and most helpful people you'll ever meet and one of the reasons we want to make these videos is get across that this is an easy process as in comfortable process for people to come so it's it's very nice for you to show us around today and we really appreciate it I think what we're going to do is hop over the counter going to show us what we need to do to sign in as a brand new patient and then maybe you can show us back to the bud tenders and show us around show us what we might be able to pick up today absolutely and introduce you to Katie hi Katie nice to meet you too first-time member she always needs your copy of your original doctor's recommendation okay California driver's license got it we have a couple of simple forms for you to fill out here name and personal information feel free to read through this which is just our terms of membership which you are agreeing to follow California state laws okay a couple little things about our rules of one visit one visit per day limitation city of San Jose regulations gotcha and just a signature on the back okay and one question I have and I think a lot of people have can I walk in here with my medical marijuana card and not the recommendation letter and come in on your first visit you have to have your physical doctor's recommendation so this one here this one here which has your embossed stamp on it okay okay for subsequent visits once we have that verified in the system you can bring just your card in that'll that'll serve just fine okay great perfect hi and this is Lori nice to meet you Lori pleasure to meet you and one thing I gotta say about bundt tenders when you come into a dispensary they're probably the nicest people you'll ever meet they really just start here to help you and we thank you very much because it is a confusing thing to go through all these products and I'm very overwhelming it's not you know it's not the 70s where there was like you know a couple different things there's such a variety of everything and yeah you know that is the one thing that's awesome about this place yeah and I think you know before people come into a dispensary they see maybe the flowers but they don't really realize that one of the best things about being a part of a dispensary is that you have access to a whole bunch of different ways to consume or ingest marijuana so let's go over a few I have ulcerative colitis and I found that the high CBD tinctures and just different products work for me the best right right and I like to function during the day yeah sure yeah can you tell me a little bit about what you have that's like a high CBD product absolutely right now I have a tincture these folks it's a one and a half part CBD to one part THC so because it is a little bit more CBD than THC it's even less psychoactive then say the half and half when you know when you have your CBD in there that's a non-psychoactive cannabinoid so it takes away part of that that headspace change if you will of the THC so that it works better for like pain or or when you have any sort of spasms or internal pain like at it definitely will work much better for stuff like that that's great so really anyway I need to take this yeah you've got us pretty much covered all right so I have my tincture I'm going to try it out I wanted to thank Lux and all the wonderful people here for walking us through the first-time experience and make sure to go to weedy calm and find a dispensary near you", "gAS8bSZ1fj0": "hey hey hey hey what is up going to do an unboxing tonight order the product and i want to see what it's like uh got enough package night in the mail when

for coming i think um jen just mentioned it but uh um if you don't we record these sessions so if you don't want to be have your faces on the recording at all please switch off your video um and as we go along if you have questions please type them up in the chat and we'll uh have a look at them as we go or answer them at the end if we can so thank you for coming this is our session with fan beer from the beeswax rap company um and uh so we're going to talk to fran about running a very sustainable planet-friendly business and also about becoming a be core which we'll hear a lot about as we go along and some of you may be really familiar with it and some of you may not be at all so um fan hi hello hello thanks for being here so uh would you like to start off by telling us about your i have my beeswax wraps here um tell us about your business and what you do and how you start stuff yeah it's a challenge yeah i think we're launching beeswax wraps and people like boys they are a plastic free alternative to cling film so it's just organic cotton and then we infuse that with local beeswax pine resin um organic jojoba oil and i'm getting a pizza apparently yeah that's it sorry i just spent two hours trying to get my baby to bed already done a day just in two hours and then you heat your hands just to wrap it around to keep your food fresh so that's just had an apple in it that was cut up i think this afternoon for jude's lunch and you can see it's hardly turned brown that's amazing at keeping your food fresh so um whether it's wrapping you know half used fruit and veg brilliant for avocados you can wrap an avocado and it won't go brown for two days and we use it to wrap our loaves i should have brought out i've been rubbing them a couple of me too to bring them all out so wrapping your loaf so rather than getting to the end of your loaf and that last bit stale it'll stay beautifully fresh so you don't waste any food and you can use them in the freezer for up to a month obviously not in the oven or microwave because the wax will melt off but covering bowls wrapping sandwiches yeah we use every day in our lunch boxes they're just brilliant yeah really good and then you just wash them with cold water and washing up liquid in between each you hang them up to dry use them again so we say they last about a year and then we have little refresher blocks um that you can just grate a little bit more of our wax mix on and then refresh them and use them for another year so you should get about five years out of your wrap if you just refresh every sort of nine to twelve months so super easy look after um and just really great because you know i think we did sort of you know back of a postcard calculation of how much plastic uh cling film peter family would use just to wrap their sandwiches a year you know if you said four lunch boxes every day it was like 500 meters of cling film oh my gosh that's terrifying yeah you're just thinking whereas you can actually replace that with four of our beeswax wraps and you're sort of you know nice and easy so that is what a beeswax track is we do a vegan version as well um works just as well but rather than beeswax we use a mix of plant-based waxes um so i started the business in 2017 so all four years ago now wherever we are mass is not my strong point um and it was purely so i actually i've been in marketing for years in advertising and just my soul had been ripped out and punched so many times so i was just like i can't deal with this anymore you know i can't try and take on brands who are wrecking the world and just trying to make up stories to make them sound good you know you oh well let's give give some money to charity that'll be something that we can sticker on the front of a pack to make it sound great you know these mobile phone companies and stuff so um i just got sick and tired of making rubbish to try and sell more stuff to people who didn't need more stuff and so i actually decided to train to become an acupuncturist and while i was going through that process it was a four-year degree um i got really interested in plastics and how you you know we basically were ingesting a lot of plastics just through at that point it was because i was having you know really into drinking enough water a day so i was drinking you know out of a plastic reusing a plastic bottle and then saw on a plastic bottle that it should only be used once and i was like so then just started doing a bit of googling and reading up about it and then as part of one of the modules that we're doing for um acupuncture i just started to really read into plastics and micro plastics and how you know if you're you know having to leave a plastic bottle in your car and it heats up and the plastic heats up and then the chemicals from the plastic leach into your water and you know just the way that it can disrupt your hormones you know all that sort of thing so that's how i got into them really reducing my plastics in what you know whether it was i stopped using cling film in the microwave you know because if the cling film touches the food then that's going to leach all the chemicals into the food and plastic bottles you know all those sorts of things i started removing from my life and the one thing that i really struggled with was cling film so googling you know just finding alternatives and we found beeswax wraps but you could only buy them in america or canada and i thought well i'm trying to be eco and the carbon footprint of bringing that over here just kind of undid the whole thing and i love you know i've always been a bit of a crafter you know even you know i used to have when i was younger i was doing like five major awareness at school yeah a bit of a dell boy of my time and um just found a beeswax wrap thing i thought okay give it a go you know what floss waxed wrap you know wax paper that's all we've sort of been around um and just filled around with recipes and then it took about a year to come up with this recipe um and just friends and family started saying oh what's that you know that's interesting can we give it a go and then we did a market in bristol and completely sold out and this was like a really quiet little church market you know no one there and we were totally gobsmacked that people were as interested in this as we you know it wasn't something that was really on anyone's radar at that point yeah and then just sort of you know i put up maybe built a website did our social media bits and bobs just because that's my background and i knew you know thought i want you know to pop it up there if we can an extra couple of quid each month you know it's great totals bits and bobs and then so that was sort of may 2017 and then i think october time blue planet came out and it had the whole bit around plastics and then suddenly everyone was talking about reducing plastic you know all that sort of things single-use plastics so by um i've got a little workshop on the side of the kitchen here so we kind of set up in there and then by the december it was crazy it was just i had a you know i was working full time so i was doing making wraps in the evening and then come to january i gave up my job i was a brand manager for a bacon and sausage company and whilst i was i was actually setting up my acupuncture clinic in bristol so i was like oh you know what i'll do it i'll do you know i'll do three days beeswax wraps two days activation that'd be really great you know really nice balance but then by well by the in the january we thought you know christmas has been crazy everyone's poor in january no one will buy it but you know everyone was then it was like new year's resolutions reduce your pass and then we did as twice as many sales in the january as we did in december and then by that point you know it's like oh god this is the thing this is going to happen yeah but still and even now to this day i still think so then in the march april may time around spring time we moved to introvert mill where we met lenny and jenny um neighbors for a while and started to employ um so i don't know if people um cloudy williams who does a lot of um plastic free stuffing um yeah i think i think people will know if yes yeah howdy lovely cloudy so we actually sent us some wraps pretty earlier to that and we were like oh my god and she was on the bbc i think and had our wraps on it and we were just so mind blown by him um and then we'd sort of put out for people um to come and help us and cloudy was actually one of the first people that came onto the team which was incredible for us because she's such a fountain of knowledge um so then by the next christmas we'd grown to i think a team of 12 and then the then the photo the may and then we had the christmas and then that september we then moved into the workshop that we're in now so we went from a workshop of how i think it's about like 300 square feet the world yeah if that may be 200 yeah 100 i mean you were kind of but it was like a beehive it was literally like when we moved into the big workshop we went through a bit of a month of adjustment because we were all so far away from each other like oh god where is moved into the big workshop and um really then started to get a lot more support so we've got a really brilliant team now so cloudy is our head of product creation so she leads our workshop team and we have you know kate who's our head of brand jenny who looks after our corporate partnerships and our supply chain which is super super important tom and my husband who looks after all the ops and sales and then me i was chatting today exactly but you know big thing for that so so you know we grew really we grew now i understand how quickly we grew i think at the time because i'd never run a business before it was just you know all fun and games and you know you just think oh god how long is this going to last before i do something that ruins it so um we but from the beginning it was very much a belief because of my background in advertising and sort of going through that horrible written role of you know trying to make stuff up it was and just you know people not being treated properly and it being very um you know you are a number the company owns you and you will do what they tell you to do and you know i've worked for a company where i was three o'clock and this is just some one of the mental stories i have from working in advertising um three o'clock in the morning sitting in an office with um a senior person in the company shouting at me because i couldn't get princess william and kate to this event that we see that's quite that's quite a contrast to where you are now so it's really kind of embedded this real belief from right from the start that we wanted to you know this was born out of just a personal need to find an alternative so single use plastic and then as we built it it was kind of like well actually if we're creating a really good product then we need to make sure that everything that sits behind that is as just as ethical and sustainable because there's no point in buying a sustainable product that maybe reduces your plastic use but then behind it is doing all sorts of damage to the environment and to the people that are making it so you know right from the start we wanted to make sure that and you know this is a really this will be a forever process for us but making sure that wherever we source our products from or you know especially with the beeswax you know that was one of the main things for us is that you know we always want to get it locally because we know we meet the beekeepers we chat to them we look after you know we look at how they look after their bees all that sort of thing so for us that sort of supply chain was a huge huge importance to us and then obviously you know everyone that works with us you know just having and giving them the respect that they deserve especially a small business like ours who that has literally been built on the sweat of everybody around us who's just really kind of bought into what we stand for and why we're here and it's just lovely to have have people really you know because it's a passion of mine and then to have other people that come on board and are just as passionate and want to work just as hard as you do having cloudy there with you right from the beginning was like a huge sort of uh pillar of that you could kind of rotate yourself around always massively massive well because you just think you know you just questioned it's a bit like having you know i don't know i don't know would you like to teach your butcher you just really pay attention to what you think yeah if anybody in the cloud is pretty straight talking so she doesn't within your who's on your side so that you're not going to get in trouble but um kind of they're looking out at everything that you're doing so you've got someone to answer to within your team yeah because she's so knowledgeable and obviously she'd been living plastic free for you know many years before i'd even understood it yeah so you know for just these little bits of information that she's able to and just that's someone internally who's kind of got that challenger mentality of okay well we okay we buy that from there but is that the right thing to be doing you know that's one thing really ingrained in business is just because we source our product from one place at the moment and okay it works that shouldn't just be the answer you know we should always be seeking a better option so whether it is um and as as and i think especially when we were lifting when we were quite small we didn't really have much clout so we couldn't really do much but i think one of the first things that really ignited this real passion for getting other businesses on board with us is um the printers that we've used from day dot and they do all our packaging and everything that get printed and um we had some business cards printed and they turned up in plastic boxes it was like and it was really great so jenny who's a very old school friend of mine we used to go to senior school together and she she's been in the print industry since she was 16 so she knows print you know upside down and back to front and she'd organized it for us so she just had a really great chat with them and then so they said okay send the boxes back yeah and they've now created and they do it across everything they've created um recycled cardboard boxes to send all their so is that something that kind of you come across along the way where you are working with someone then you kind of question what they're doing in perhaps the nicest possible way or just saying oh why why are you doing it like that um and so it sort of rolls on into other people's thought processes bigger questions and then you know things like so then it was okay well you know you using you're using the plastic tape so the boxes okay well we use this paper tape can use his painting tables so then we you know we've you know we've been using them for four years now and it's been fantastic because they've fully supported and got on board with our mission to the point where now they're one of only 10 printers in the uk who are registered as world land trust printers so they're completely carbon neutral and that was something that jenny um our print via she went to them and said okay yeah great everything's fsc certified but for us that's bare minimum you know that's just something that you have to you know that has what it has to be but what else can we do so now all of our packaging is well land trust certified and what's great again is that you know there are two levels to that you can either you can pay a little bit which means oh yeah you've planted a tree but then actually if you fully invest in the whole process then all of our packaging is completely carbon neutral from production you know from the recycling plant all the way through to delivering to us so it's just making sure that we fully understand these things getting suppliers on board and now for them it's great because they have got a really strong message to put out there to businesses who are looking for strong partnerships because they can offer something that only nine other printers in the uk can do so it's really great to help you know we've helped them see that there is a huge competitive advantage for them becoming more sustainable yeah yeah i think um that sort of um sort of sharing mentality like sharing your knowledge with other businesses but it really feels like really underpins your business and the fact that on your your website you can find your there's the plastic free the loose shops maps the milk refills and that you've had that going from right at the beginning and i think that sort of sense of sharing knowledge and collaborating and wanting to make things change through questioning and collaboration something that feels that's how you can make sort of incremental changes to with other people not to with other people and other businesses that you work with so it's kind of uplifting everyone and they'll maybe take that on and uh make some similar changes with other other people they work with completely and i think yeah you know i you know it's often because we like with our plastic free maps and the milk map that just came out of um i was going on holiday to italy and i was you know i was like well i'm going on holiday but i i don't want to then just go on holiday and undo you know i'm trying yeah so i was googling milk vending machines and they had this fantastic someone had just set up this map of milk vending machine in italy and you i know you think italy maybe they're not as you know on it as we are but they were way more advanced than we it was like god this is incredible and we found this a really cool milkman machine literally two minutes around the corner from where they're playing it's like you know and then you know the markets and stuff and it was actually a lot easier to plastic free over there than it was here so then once and then i thought well this is really cool and then um that's basically we started the milk map first and then that moved into the plastic free shop map because what we found was when we started our business that was when all of the zero waste shops started opening up so you know it was amazing because we just had so many wholesalers or people wanting to wholesale coming to us and it was just like well hang on a minute you're supporting us so how do we get this out and we were getting quite a strong social following by that point so and for us that's been brilliant because i think we are the biggest map now in the uk of zero waste shops again it was just something that you know we you know the time i used to get our milk from stroud micro dairy and obviously we had shiny goodness in the village and then we had um oh i forgot what's one in stroud called loose please yeah yeah and you know and it was like well you know people would say to us where do you go you're like well how do you not know but why would you know because it's not something you know you wouldn't drive past every day so why would you know so then that was just then you know i just spent hours finding different shops and putting it up on a map and it's brilliant because i think within the first couple of weeks we had like 18 000 hits or something on it you know it was really really popular so i think we always wanted to make sure again with the website because we were primarily um selling direct customers that when people come to the website they were they're educated in some ways so yeah whether that is education through how you can use the wrap in many different ways to cut back from your life or it's supporting local shops because you look on the map and i never realized that when it opened up down the high street well brilliant i'll go there take my wraps to refill blah blah blah you know that sort of thing so for us it was just making sure that at whatever point they came to us that you know they might come to the website and not buy anything but they might go away from the website knowing that there's a refill shop in the network you know if we wanted to make sure there was some sort of education or positive impact that then would go on to you know you can't make massive changes immediately it's just little incremental drops yeah and it's that it's that sharing of information that feels really it just feels sort of um obvious but generous and because it takes time to put together but it feels like that's a really important part of your business because i think one of those issues yeah well exactly because i think we're doing something you know we were very much at the forefront of the plastic free wave and it's like well you know i think and again it's one of those things where the businesses that are that we're setting up at the time i think there are a lot of bigger businesses that are now jumping on the bandwagon who don't have quite you know the credentials that you'd hope they have but you know at that point in time it was the people who weren't out for the money they weren't out for you know becoming a big business it was people who had a genuine passion for making changes and being positive so it had this real collective sense to it you know the people that are oh starting out yeah it's quite a big step opening up a zero waste shot because you know no one's been doing it you know and now you know there's waitrose doing their you know token zero waste island cheltenham well done that's good you know and you know so it's like it's and it kind of felt like we needed to support all these smaller shops because we were the ones who were putting our neck on the line we were the ones giving up our jobs to to do this you know these big companies aren't putting anything on the line because they wait for the little people to try it out prove that it's successful and then jump in with it at half the price you know so it's kind of like no we need to try and create a really solid um support network here and we have because it's really shown you know the people that came on board with us three or four years ago they're still buying from us you know and it's amazing to see you know some of the biggest zero-waste shops online you know i remember so there's one called um the plastic free shop run by kath moore and it's lovely because the first delivery that i dropped off at her house she hadn't even set the website at that point so it's lovely we've got these just lovely kind of connections with all these businesses that have really grown and become really successful because we all started off at the same time and we've we all want to support each other yeah brilliant and can we sort of shift to talking about being being i was thinking my trainer thought that then got way laid into another train of thought was um yeah so fundamentally as a business we wanted to do the right thing from the from the get-go and actually it wasn't it was it wasn't a massively conscious decision it was just we i've seen it done badly and i've been treated really badly so i do not want to become a business owner that is like that you know i don't own people i don't you know i should be grateful for the time that people give to me and i will pay them a respectful wage for that you know it's like a you know yeah a single stream yeah you know um so we were at um river cottage festival um in the first year and toast ale were there who thought at the time and um we just got chatting to them and they're telling us about it and we thought this is really interesting you know we've not really heard anything about um any sort of certification really or any way of because we found as a small business we were able to become quite professional and quite organized quite quickly but when we approached bigger companies you know they looked at us i'm like oh how can we you know become a little bit bigger and a little you know a bit more trustworthy as it were um so we chatted to them and we thought it's quite interesting then obviously it found out so next door to us our old accountants scott from concrete mounting he was b corp so suddenly we're like oh god actually there were quite a few sort of blue culture around here and this was way before any of the big guys that started playing b corps um so we looked at it actually this is a really nice way of because at that time you know i was putting systems in place and stuff but i didn't know how you set up a business or what boxes you tick or what things you need you know i registered at company's house and we bought insurance and things like that but it was like well how do we what's the structure that i work to to make sure that we're setting the business up in the right way so it was a really useful tool to then sit down and go through all the questions that they asked and see and actually for us it was more kind of almost affirming that we were doing the right thing and i think it was a really nice way of just compiling all of the things that we should be compiling to be able to report on things properly so whether that was um you know anti-slavery or anti-bribery policies and all this sort of thing it really sort of started to kind of get me thinking oh my okay that's i need these policies and these sorts of things in place in mind saying there's a different areas that you have to look at across your business so this is looking internally and externally exactly you who you work with your supply chain um your sort of sustainability policies so there's kind of like it's really broad it's easy it's really good yeah they say so they kind of audit everything so from where we do you do that yourself first and then you present your yeah so there's kind of maybe three stages almost to it so you go on and you sort of sign up and you know you do your first run of questions and you go through like yeah there's sort of three or four sections and it's um people sustaining you know sustainability where you source from you know where you spend your money basically where it's going who buys from you where you know where are your audience from um and you go through and answer all these questions that's just like an online yeah so you go on it at this point you don't need to upload anything nothing like that so you basically go through and answer it and then at the end you'll get a score so you need to be over 80 for them for them to go to the next step so i think we did it and we got maybe 84 or 85 so then you submit it and then they go through it and then what they do is they um select and i can't quite remember whether so they then say to you okay well thank you for answering these questions please can you submit information for this one this one this one this one this one this one so then i think there may be like 10 to 15 that you then have to submit you know your evidence so then that's the bit that takes a little bit of time i mean for us it wasn't that difficult because we were quite a small business at that point so we did a huge amount of data and things to play so it's so probably easier for a smaller business to take it on than a larger business definitely definitely because we were able to you know if we needed to change something we just go well let's change it yeah a big meeting until you know put new systems in place so yeah i mean if anyone's thinking about it do as soon as you can before you start getting you know bigger or you know employable people so you then go through and submit all of your evidence for the different questions and then to be fair the thing that took the longest time was just waiting for the phone call so then you get booked in for a 45 minute or an hour phone call yeah you know what it might have been two hour phone call um where you basically then go through all the evidence with someone with a b court representative on the phone um so i think we submitted all of the evidence and then i think our we dropped to maybe 79 so then on the phone call went through everything and you know then i realized oh actually i didn't there were a couple of quick because it's because it's set up they might have tweaked it now because there are a lot more people within the uk applying but it was very american so just some of the things that it asked things weren't that clear yeah also um you know obviously america's massive so you know for them locally sourcing within their country who can go hundreds of miles and it's still local but for me yeah by alpine rising from portugal which was still i mean there's a beeswax rap company in america and i found out where they sourced their beeswax from and it was hundreds and hundreds of miles away and sorry not their beeswax their pinewoods well whatever they are i think those beeswax they're one of their ingredients and yet we source all of our ingredients much lower much closer but our pine raisins from portugal so it's in a different country so therefore yeah so it's kind of it's one of those ones where so i think they might have tweaked it a bit more now so it's a bit you know we're a lot you can also made it a bit more applicable for us but basically you then go through chat through the evidence that you put put up there um then maybe we had to re-upload a few bits and bobs just because i hadn't put the right data in and it's things like so you know break a breakdown of your spending for the year okay well how much of it has been within the uk how much of it has been you know we buy our company from india how much you know so then they break down all your spending your percentages of where it's spent in the world um and then also your sales they looked at our sales or how much and at that point they were all in the uk so that for us was quite a big thing things like um it was a female founded business so that was a big tick um all those sorts of things and then i think we then we were basically sitting at 79 and she said what i'm going to do is i'm going to unlock five more questions for you so if you can upload um your evidence for those five questions then we'll reevaluate and see if you pass so i then resubmitted um the stuff for those five and i think i think we're maybe eight i can't remember 83 or 84. so that's what if you're in the position where you're in a good place with your business anyway in terms of being being relatively on top of all of those kind of areas then it feels quite straightforward and then you gain your certification if you pass um if you don't pass you can re-submit i guess yeah try again and then and then so then you become you've got your vcore thing you can put on your packaging and on your website and and what how how else has it sort of benefited yeah you know what it's really benefited us i think um because it's open up another community of businesses today it does it does so one they're really they're great at connecting all of their b corp businesses so they're really good when we were um i mean i think we were we became b corp in 2018 so we pretty much we were about a year old when we became a b corp um and it was brilliant for us because we were able to connect with different b corps on social media so we were able to do you know competitions and things like that and get like-minded people to follow us um we also found that when we were um we started doing trade shows and having bee corp up there you know a lot of people at that point had never heard of b corp but the people who did they were really impressed a small business like us would be cool and then as you know the guardian people like that started becoming becoming b corp um we it's just really put us head and shoulders above everybody else because they look at us yes we're a small business but you know we're already able to have really strong credentials across the board so you know for us either you know we make beeswax wraps for emma bridgewater now and they loved the fact that we were b corp and we've actually been sort of chatting them through the whole be court process so we've been supporting them going through so instead of all these things where we it's now actually we're becoming the people that other companies turn to kind of ask about it understand it you know what do we do because it can seem quite daunting so it really has been a huge help for us one to kind of make us um look a lot um more credible i suppose you know we're not just some silly women we've done all that set of examinations so you know you you you can walk walk and you thought it's all being a company in london who you'll probably have seen their maps they do like the town planning match where you stand in a map and it says you're here and then they do all the you know i've been chatting to them because they want to become the first um i can't remember what they're called now that they're kind of map architects or something like that um in the uk so they're super keen to get that make those connections it's quite a broad um all aspects of the business but we were chatting today about more specifically looking at carbon footprints auditing and you mentioned the planet mark yeah and this was something so this was something that actually came off the back of the beecorp thing so we looked at it and we were like this is really cool like beecorp has made us really understand all these different areas but it gives you that really good overview but then it's like well okay how can i we know we knew for us that carbon footprint was a big you know that was the next thing for us we really want yes we talk about plastic food but actually has a much bigger picture it's about reducing your footprint so we looked into carb you know how do we get our carbon footprint measured and we looked at you know we've got quotes like 10 000 pounds 15 000 pounds and for a little business it was like that's a lot of money because we don't even know what we're gonna do with it yet and so i don't you know what i can't even remember i think i saw their logo i'm a bit of a i like to stand in you know the shop in the shops and look at what came in packaging what's that and i saw i seen i think it was like a soap or something it was planet first and i was like i've not heard of that before that's interesting anyway i had a little bit of a look around and they focused on carbon footprinting so what they do is they um we've had our first year and i'm actually now resubmitting the data for this year so basically you they send you this really great big spreadsheet that you have to fill in so it's um you know whether you have company cars your travel your electricity your um the amount of cars you use all of our packaging the materials they go through the whole thing so you just got to fill out everything it does take a while because you've got to put in everything you know go through all your sales and purchase things and enter all in and but then out the back of it within two weeks they then come back to you with your carbon footprint measured all the rest of it and then they set you targets for the next year so um we've had our targets for this year so now i'm resubmitting and then they'll come back and say right well you hit your target on this or you didn't on this so it's a really great way of being able to have real measures of what's doing and what you need to be doing so um it works alongside i keep figuring out what it's called there's the european payment let me find i'm just going to see if they've got it's they're called the european they're like the 12 european something like a u12 eu what is it uh it is called measure panic mark sustainability sustainability development goals that's it the eu there's um i think several with none yeah 17 goals that were major world issues by 2030 so these have been set um by the united nations they cover like poverty um health and well-being gender equality clean water and sanitation you know all these different things so um planet first sits beside this and then they say okay well you're addressing these ones so that's really great but you're not addressing these and some of them you might never need to because they're just not relevant to your business but it really gave us a real tangible understanding of our impact and now that's pushed us to the next step so we've gone okay well that's great well you know manufacturing our workshop is run on solar panels that's fantastic at the moment we probably can't do any more until we mechanize or something because at the moment it's all handmade um but it's then led us to you know that was one of the things that we our packaging discussion came out the back of that okay well how can we reduce our carbon footprint on packaging so they're they're in a place so there's someone else to be answerable to so they're like your bigger external id and they're really you know and they're looking at facts and figures which is really nice so as a business we can have this up on our website saying right you know once we've got that first year cycle and then those measurements we can we have facts to say we were here um here and our new target is here what we're doing so for us we want to be as transparent as we possibly can with our customers to say this is what you know we're not going to be we're never going to be perfect because we make things there's always going to be some kind of detrimental impact on the um on the planet but at every step of the way you know we are pinpointing areas that we can now move on to to improve and reduce you know once we've done that we'll make the next one so it's just real kind of measurable targets that people can understand i think we were very aware that you know it became very apparent as um i think it's about 2019 you know green washing there are a lot of people coming on you know bamboo cups banging it's like well it's not bamboo it's melamine you know bamboo stuck together with melamine that is not eco-friendly you know and like you know bamboo fabrics the amount you know we chatted to our um fabric supplier in india and he's fantastic guy and he was just like yeah but the chemical process that you have to take bamboo through to get it to a fiber that's not eco-friendly at all like it's you know there's a lot of chemicals that go into that so you know so there were all these products being thrown onto the market you know straws metal straws why do we need so many straws and when we're using straws why are they fine all these things because people just like bye bye bye and it's like okay slow down are you this is anything and you're not buying more you know yeah sorry if i do do you think it's good to um to have a sort of rolling program with someone like planet first who you have to come back to every year so you can't think well we've done that once we can work it out by ourselves from now do you think it's really important to have that external oh completely people take people's trust definitely because i think you know especially as companies grow compromises have to be made you know this unfortunately you know yes we want to be better for people and planet but you also have to have the profits in there as well because if we're not making any money then we're not going to be able to reinvest to grow you know so it's making sure that with b corp and with planet first is that we have got those measures in place because we know or hang a minute okay well it would be cheaper to get our jojoba oil from much further away but wait a minute what's that going to do to our carbon footprint so we need to cut costs then we need to look elsewhere because that fundamentally is a no you know that's a no-go area we've already decided so sort of saying that getting on with doing any of this like early as possible if you're thinking about it just get on with it so that there's less hurdles to cross yeah i mean a friend she's starting she's working i can't say what he's actually launched but she's not even launched her business yet and she's already applied for b corps certification so and b caught pending so she's put in there right at the beginning because she can obviously do it for all of her manufacturing process and then it gives her that kind of base level to start with and she's thinking about doing planet first as well so then she's got something each year which she can measure and kind of um see how she's going against because i think it's and i think also as you you know running a business you've got a million other things to do yeah it's really good time to admit [Music] tangible benefits can you can you kind of touch is it like because i find you know i'm you know i think you get so many numbers and all that sort of thing thrown at you all the time but one thing that would be planet model which is really lovely um as i'll just share my screen quickly um is that they give you this really nice presentation back to you and it basically just really simply shows you your carbon emissions so you can see that is that right yeah you know our total carbon footprint so last year it was the equivalent of 15 return flights from london to new york you just go right i get that okay and then it boats at any building where you use enough power to electrify four homes for one year in the uk we traveled once around the world waste we produced an enough you know a london bus worth so it's really interesting procurement you know it was just looking at you know three sheets of paper used per day and that sounds mental but obviously we've got loads of packaging but again this gives you these really simple numbers that you can look at and fully understand because i think one thing that we found from very early on you know for ourselves and talking to customers is that you know going reducing your waste is really complicated it's really intimidating and you know where on earth do you start so as a consumer we tried to make our beeswax wraps super easy super simple you swap this for cling film yeah that's it yes so for us as a business we just wanted something that would help us fully understand okay well we are at the moment we're traveling back and forth from new york four times a year right we want to get that to three times a year two times you know it's just a really nice easy way and then to be able to explain that to our customers as well so they can see the improvements and the impact that we've made and also internally for the business you know being able to sit down with everyone at the end of the year and say right through all of these random things that we've been asking between boxes that have turned up and all the rest of it this all these little things mental change has meant this you know we've reduced our carbon footprint by this and it's really good because what they do planet mark is they look at because obviously as businesses grow you bring more people on so they look at your carbon footprint per employee within the business so then it doesn't make you know if you're growing yeah and that takes into account okay just got a question in the in the chat or a couple of questions um do you have to recertify as be be cool periodically and is the standard itself evolving and the second question do be calling planet first raise their standards yeah one year do you know when we joined b corp we were meant to basically be re-audited on by the second year but they year two rolled around and we weren't re-audited and i think that's because they have just been completely overrun with people wanting to become b corps and i think they as a company have struggled to upscale to get enough people on board and train their side to deal with the amount of people there's a huge demand for people wanting to do this yes seeing the value of seeing it exactly so i think they might have i need to read the email but i think they've now moved into three years to reorder it to them i think for us you know we we're comfortable that we've made a huge amount of changes anyway so i think it's and i don't think they they for us it's looking at additional areas so there may be areas that we hadn't really scored very highly on before that we would then look at so again i mean one thing area for us that we didn't score massively highly was we were doing all these things all these great things so on our sustainability side but we just hadn't recorded it you know we did a beach thing but why would you record a beach clean you just go so you basically you you come away with your homework to do and you have enough time to kind of get on it and do it and things like planet first that will go towards our b corps certification because it will show that we've gone away and we've practically sought out something that will help us reduce our carbon footprint so that you know so it's great so these things kind of feed into each other to kind of help support you know reapplying for them each year around and then yeah so and planet first this will be our first full year so at the moment i'm just putting all the facts and figures together to resubmit so and again it's one of those things i think with planet first that you know they just sort of strike you off and go oh no rubbish you didn't do it they really we had a fantastic meeting with them in january and they kind of took us through um our year what you know how we'd gone and they really sort of try and help you see the areas that you can improve and discuss different ways of doing it and you know saying well you know let's fix you up with these guys they could really support so um no they're very i'd say plan it first because they're a lot smaller you get a bit more handholding with them which is quite right yeah and and then they're linked with the eden project is that right no so i think it was oh it was i got there you know people tell you these things and you don't quite take it all in but the guy who runs the or owns or runs the eden project he partnered up with this guy who i think his background was basically in kind of running businesses and advertising things like that and i think they both saw that there was a need for a company that could support businesses in reducing their carbon footprint because there really isn't anything out there that gives you those tools to do it so they set it up then what happens is when we've reduced so last year through the obviously you have to pay i think planet mark is 50 i think it's 1500 pounds depending on what size of the business you are yeah you turn over things like that and then part of that is then donated to cool earth so then i think last year we had like an acre of rainforest that was saved under our name things like that so that you know there's sort of bits and again with the packaging world land trust you know through all of the carbon through the additional money that we pay for our packaging that then goes to um protecting either existing um forests and rainforests or you know helping conservation projects to so it's not just plant a tree you know it's not the kind of old country and then people i think for me you know they're really trustworthy things that you know that they're not going to implant a thousand trees and then no one looks after them and they you know they're actually you know sound projects have been around a while and they're doing the right thing the other thing we talked about a little bit earlier was the um uh carbon literacy trust you need to tell us this is this is real kind of early stages for us so we went um to a really interesting talk by patagonia when they were opening up their bristol store and they had um carbon literacy um guys there and they have set up a charity and they've set up this really fantastic website that basically gives you a workshop whether it's at home at school at work that takes you through and basically you get a carbon literacy certificate at the end of it to say okay i fully understand what my what i'm doing is what my impact is and how i can reduce it um so what we really want to do as part of our kind of sharing it and sort of paying it forward almost is um we were discussing with cloudy actually um one of our our plans for this year and going forward now we've got a bit of time and hopefully when we can start being near people um is go and share our learnings so going into other companies so what we're going to be doing this year with emma bridgewater is going up to their um factory in stoke and basically running a day for them so claudia obviously does her fantastic plastic freezer waste talks so claudia will do one of her talks we'll then um incorporate the carbon literacy project and then what we'd like to do is for them to basically pass the baton on to them and say okay well we've educated you we've shared our knowledge with you we hope you've inspired you now can you please go and pass that on so whether you pass that on for supply you go and do a day of supplies whatever it is so and as part of our supply chain you know we are then doing it backwards as well so we're then kind of challenging our supply chain to you know do these things for us [Music] whatever effect it is you know kind of a domino effect of inspiring people and kind of giving people something that understanding what they can do i think a lot of the time you can be so overwhelmed i'm also busy you know finding time for things you know it's actually like just wondering here it is yeah off you go that i think that sort of resonates with what we are trying to do at nelsworth cam is just sort of empower people to make sort of small changes that have that knock-on effect that they can share with others and it's it's that kind of filtering out isn't it and it is i mean jenny your um supply chain manager you know she just said something really interesting the other day because obviously she's been using beeswax wraps in her house since i was you know a friend of mine so i gave him to her four years ago and she said it was really interesting her little son um he was i think he's eight now and he came in the kitchen he was like i need i need some of that plastic stuff yeah he's doing some painting or something and she was like what did she mean he was like you know that plastic stuff and she's like do you mean cling film and he's like yeah that because obviously it's not in the house it's so incredible to see that knock-on effect yeah isn't it just that one small thing has now completely changed a child's mindset to know that is not just a usual day-to-day thing that you use all the time yeah yeah yeah yeah quite sure what it's called they say it's that fundamental thing of sharing and sharing your knowledge helping to educate others and just being really collaborative with with um with all with all of that stuff so that you're not kind of holding on to it your own as a business but kind of questioning it forwards and backwards and giving it forwards and backwards i think also it's one of those things especially a small business is building you know i kind of touched on it earlier is that um you know we have to kind of support each other because the big ones will come in and they will take away all your good ideas and they will just you know so and i think for us you know we've very much been really banging the drum of made in the uk because you know there are a lot of other companies making beeswax wraps in china in india in taiwan but you know there's no supply chain audits you know there's no one looking after the people that are making it you know what is it what is the you know there's no real clarity of what's going into these products so really for us now this year especially is going to be a huge push on really just educating people to understand you know we had a very um sad email from a big company in the uk that currently stock us and they're doing a big push on b corpse at the moment and um our distributor had a chat with me yesterday and said look you've not got the b2x ratco in your big in your you know in your b court page why is it not there and they just said well we've only put things up there that are commercially competitive and and they said well but they're be corps so surely you should just be putting them up there and they said no it's you know that space is for only brands that we know we're going to sell a lot of and they said well you sell other beeswax brands beeswax rat brands but you don't state where they're made because we know that they're all made in china and their um position was well if the customer cares enough they'll find out for themselves and you just think okay this is what you know these big companies this is their attitude they don't care they don't want to educate they don't want to share that all they care about is those numbers and you can understand that that's why they're massive but this is why these smaller businesses who truly care who spend the time in b corp who put the passion and the time into looking after their employees to really analyzing their supply chain you know this is why we really feel like we need to share this and educate other companies and make them other people out there supporting them because you know this is what we're up against just pure ignorance by buyers who don't care because at the end of the day you know they get their bonuses they get their pay on you know the amount of money they make out of their shelf space so it's kind of like well you know these small businesses that we've got on our plastic free map these are the businesses that we want to thrive because these are the businesses that are looking not just at okay well how much am i going to make out of that shelf space but actually my customers were going to ask me where it where is it you know all these sort of things they look at the bigger picture and they fully understand that it's not just about the money that you make yeah it's honesty and transparency at every step of the way isn't it almost like it would be wild i guess come on so hopefully we get really angry let's just i just there's a couple more questions and then we're almost at the end of our hour um so uh so question from sue how can those companies that are green washing be shown to be doing this as it's very confusing for customers yeah so it's hard isn't it because we you know as a brand we wouldn't go and call people out because it's you know you just but for us it's very much being the kind of brand where you come to us and you can see that we are open and we are honest and i think it's through our advertising things like that and further down the line this year we are going to be educating and basically putting we've been discussing um on our you know the big thing that happened you know on breakfast cereals where they have the nutrition bit at the bottom and it's like yeah yeah we were like why don't we do something like that on our packaging we talk about you know the carbon footprint you know where it's made the ingredient you know what are these three so at the moment we're discussing these three or four measures that we have on our packaging so when people look at it you know they're already i understand that because that's on other things that i get and then just try and educate and talk to people in a way that isn't alternative or plastic you know because you know i think there are still people who think that out there and just really talk to them in a language that they understand and kind of get people to really one i mean you know claudia always says first question you should always always ask yourself before you buy something is do i need it you know so that's yeah it's educating people do i need it where is it made is it made in the uk can i see the face of the people that made this is the person who owns this company you know can i speak to them are they you know how these people what information are they giving to me so i think it's really educating people that when you're buying especially sustainable products or products that claim to be sustainable and zero waste will go on their website ask them some questions i mean one thing that we want to do is basically have three or four questions if you're going to buy something ask the business these questions if they won't answer those questions don't buy from them you know just these really simple things that just impact to expect more for the companies that you're buying from you you're the customer it's your money if you're going to spend it with them they should be trying really flipping hard to prove to you that you're worthy of anyone so yeah i was just gonna there's one other quick question can your wraps be used in the microwave to reheat food no it will just fizzle up and go sad but one great thing is if you do put our wraps on i mean some people put them in the dishwasher and things like that because it's fabric you know the wax might wash off a bit but if you've got other wraps you can literally just put them in between two sheets of baking paper iron the good wrap against the bad wrap some of the wax will go off and then boom you've got two great wraps again or our re-wax bars you just create a bit on so for us you know the one thing that we did do is we don't want people to throw their wraps away after a year you know no no no you must rewax we use them you know you can't we can't have people throwing away cup you know and again you know we use cotton at the moment and that's a big project for us is finding a more sustainable fabric because we know it's not it's organic but it's still it's not you know it's pretty harsh on the environment especially water levels so um yeah no you must always always something to be doing normally well i think we're really very almost at the end i really encourage people to have a look at the beast it's beeswax reps dot co uk we'll put all these people that we've talked about we'll put them on to um uh on instagram stories so you can see all the links of b corp um uh planet first my cat's just arriving now um calvin literacy trust and i i really encourage you to have a look at um the beeswax website because there's there's loads of information on it i i go there a fair bit and i found a new page which i didn't know which is a brilliant environmental business checklist which you have on here sort of making a simple eco audit of your business which is a really great starting point for people i think um so fran thank you very much for chatting with us yeah absolutely um if anyone has any questions just find them off now um just to let you know that we've got another talk happening in i think a couple of weeks i think perhaps someone can remind me the date of it it's with helen petel who's a stroke-based um permaculture gardener and educator and she's going to be talking us through what to be doing right now in our gardens which should be really really useful um uh i think we're kind of done thank you fran so much for chatting with us it's been brilliant um and do you know anyone wants to chat further about b corp or planet march and i mean just let jenny know your information and i can sort of call that's really really kind thank you so much thank you everyone who's come along um and uh yeah do you look the talk is", "0IrzAcS4Pgg": "Selena Gomez go salsa dancing with who tagged and narrowly escapes prison will tell you how and the internet reacts to Malia Obama allegedly smoking a little ganja all this and more on today's rundown what's up you guys welcome back to the dare I'm Miriam here with my girl babe hey Miriam how are you I'm great and you guys we got a wrap up this week with all the drama all the shiz and what are we gonna get started with you know what it's Friday we need to get started with some salsa dancing yes without a flirtatious dancer would I need a say yes ohmygosh Mirim so is Selena Gomez ticked a snapchat last night to tell all of her followers that she was a little sick she actually had strep throat and worse I know apparently her doctors told her she needed some rest so she was a little worried about her boy but she wasn't worried about her body because she went out dancing and she captioned the video saying quote when my babies take me salsa dancing even when they told me not to because I'm sick I don't care her babies um I don't know her team members but okay Paulson for babies and yes she knows but let me tell you why this is a big deal so earlier this week we all saw that little Instagram video where she's cuddling up with someone so we're like is it the same someone she's dancing with yeah after some intense snapchats talking I realized that it's not Ali who we all you know saw her cuddling with photographer exactly it's this guy named Toshi I believe I don't know like what his role is in the team but he's with Selena Gomez on her team and throughout her snaps you seem in the background and she's like hugging up on him hugging up on Ellie I honestly hope that the next guy she dates is someone Loki maybe Elly maybe Toshi or Tashi or whatever his name is I I would like to see her with someone that is not famous on to about light all the time he to Julia Roberts married her cameraman and she's happily ever after here we go there you go we get a relationships you guys Tyga and Kylie have been having an amazing time celebrating Kylie's birthday and Turks and Caicos still still but meanwhile there's been so much drama back at home for Tyga and you guys the drama's finally coming to an end so Tyga has decided to settle out of court okay and he has cut to check to his ex landlord oh yeah yeah I did that was it for the full amount though I don't think it was okay so you know there was a warrant issued for his arrest when his ex landlord accused him of owing half a million dollars and meanwhile he's buying these lavish gifts for his girlfriend was which was just a little questionable don't forget part of that lawsuit or whatever it was to fix a few things that have had happen in that room apparently installed a stripper pole in the room and the landlord had to like cover up the little hole I make it deep man you guys are mad but when I run an apartment I'm afraid of him sticking a nail I know are like scratching the paint or something but tagging and carries we got everyone for whatever so he has cut his ex landlord a check that does not mean though that his warrant for his arrest has been dropped the actual amount that he paid is being kept under wraps I'm just glad that he paid period but Tyga's lawyer is going to the courts to day to spiel too much to try to get him to drop the arrest warrant cuz even though he's now paid he still broke the law by not showing up to court and if the judge feels like being finicky he did keep the arrest and maybe you need to teach him a lesson I don't know I also I'm wondering if the judge is gonna be like well isn't your girlfriend worth like 10 million dollars hours that's a lot of money my Miata mine I wonder if she if he borrows the money from her maybe who well who knows I know what that okay here's the thing that frustrates me tige you are famous ergo you are a role model did your near be a role model just pay your bills ere Reggie got babies pay your bills oh my god I forgot about that I know I hope he's paying those child support or else we're gonna be talking about Tyga soon again I'm moving on in other news rihanna is gonna get a very special award at the MTV VMAs this year it was just announced today by Rihanna herself via her Twitter and she says quote honored to take the VMAs stage as your video Vanguard Award recipient live from New York City on August 28th not only am I excited because it's the first year that the VMAs are gonna be at Madison Square Garden but also that Rihanna's gonna get this award

York City outside and last but not least wasn't we with a cigarette we're sparking have to do with it we've got all the details on the drama that has hit the president's daughter so you guys know that the world has gone on like in arms over video of Malia Obama allegedly smoking a little a little reefer no ganja hello grass a little hot oh my god and to the word weed so she was at Lollapalooza in Chicago it's a music festival they're gonna twerk okay because you can get the teenager out of the White House for you can't get the 18 year old out of the teenager she's an 18 year old she's just being young just like the rest of us and unfortunately some people videotaped her smoking it had to have been her friend one of her friends and I hope she's not that person's friend anymore yeah that was so horrible exactly it feels so terrible I mean she almost made it out of the White House god I need major drama you know what I feel like I know I'm defending her but I feel like a it wasn't we like it looked like a cigarette like I feel like it was white second of all um this is like the least of our problems like they have the Leeson way bigger things to worry about right now you just dropped the country on our priority if someone has to reprimand her it's President Barack Obama not us and not any doubt guys well Natalie it's melted into sigh she's just a kid and whether she was smoking a cigarette or whether she was smoking weed I personally don't think it's a really big deal and the twerking thing good for you girl you got rhythm you got rid of your hips and I'm proud of you I'm area but you know what brought you like what I started remembering was when the meme became viral it was like Molly and her little sister like a picture of them wearing a little little flat shoes and then a picture of Kendall and Kylie Jenner who drives very sexy for their age and they were comparing them and they were talking about the parenting of Michelle Obama and Kris Jenner so now I'm like I hope they don't use this against her and say oh you know we've never seen Kendall and Kylie do stuff like that and now we're seeing Malia smoke weed I hope they don't use that against her we don't even know if it was we denied it was I just don't think that it's a big deal exactly priorities people and you know what a lot of celebrities are on her side in fact Chris Rock tweeted Malia Obama was caught smoking weed if she's not careful she might end up pointing 21 Olympic gold medals are becoming president of the USA because we've had former weed smokers do those things Zach Braff joked saying try to find a picture of me at Molly Obama's age not high and other people have basically been tweeting let Malia Obama live and I agree and that's a wrap for today's daily Hollywood rundown but Miriam I honestly want to know what do you guys think do you think Kylie Jenner pays for Tyga's bills yes I do using the lipcott money I do and also what do you guys think of Malia isn't she a good kid isn't she wanted never shot bilingual or something shouldn't we be freaking out over a little weed smokin at the age of 18 my god let us know in the comment section hit us up on our socials at Miriam Isa at Vivian fabiola V yeah he has that time on weekends but wait before you go click the video to your right to find out if kendall Jenner is jealous of her sister Kylie or click

a cannabis based discussion so glenn what are we actually reviewing tonight tonight we're going to review wapa from hannah farms uh wap is in indica it's roughly what do we got 19.5 so just below 20 percent uh it's a great indicator 60 indica dominant strain really good for night uh we kind of i uh jessica and i were thinking about what we were gonna have today and uh i think it was you that recommended it so me been having kind of a dull depressing day to be quite honest a lot of anxiety wapa is a good strain to kind of turn that around i'm very impressed with this and the buds are actually getting a lot nicer yeah actually um glenn and i were speaking just before we hopped on this call to record our conversation with you but um this is not the same lap i would have seen a while ago from canada farms uh so that's who's the licensed producer of this bud we're trying today uh canna pharmacist is in hope bc but this may be the best whapa i've ever seen yeah come out of that facility so it seems like maybe they're working on some improvements internally but i'm very happy one or two like the buds are nice thick and dense so they did a good job all right what are you using for consumption method so i am vaping in my utilian 721 um i'll be vaping at a temperature of about 375. okay i'm i'm only go a little bit lower i'm vaping my mighty from uh stores and bickel so i haven't packed oh yours all heated up already eh almost almost it's good uh 200 degrees celsius heats up pretty quick and we'll see how uh see how it tastes this batch is actually very fresh i'm impressed by the how dense it is and how how nice it's packaged so good job canada farms on the presentation let's see so um as for flavor uh so how i was feeling before i dosed i have a very sore body not gonna lie it's the day after saint patty's right now um a little bit late i i'm tired today i feel beat up physically and just inside so beeping it i am getting like a very earthy taste to it a little bit of a peppery test taste you can even see my smoke coming through yeah i would say peppery citrusy with a little bit of earth underneath it nothing too crazy um my stream that i have is a 19.5 like you said but mine is actually packaged from a while ago well over a year ago uh i don't know about anybody else i know a lot of people don't like utilizing old thc they're going to open their packages and concerned like the thc is going down and yes i will say that your thc percentages do go down your shelf life is like your 6 to 12 months but the thc converts into cbm glenn i don't know if you utilize like uh aged cannabis but i find i sleep better it's a good that's a good discussion to bring up especially because i am the person that loves opening jars like a little kid and i leave these jars uh opened and sometimes i don't want to smoke them because they aged but as you were explaining that could be a benefit for somebody like me who wants more sedation i want to get knocked out when i sleep what's up what's um what's interesting about it is your thc does deplete but you actually create a new molecule on the cannabis plant called cbn and cbn you can absolutely go google it as soon as we're done this conversation and have a look for it for yourself but there's been people who have compared it to you know having 10 times the strength of diazepam for sedation and relaxation um usually i can watch an entire hockey game but i will with this age cannabis even at the 19 um i'll be knocked out alone stronger than i ever have in the other strain so that's i'm so glad you told me that because maybe tomorrow um or on the weekend what we'll do is we'll take another strain from either can of farms or alba medics and something that's aged that's a good indica and we'll see um if it knocks me out i'm curious the difference um i'm tasting earthy definitely taste pepper i really like that flavor my mouth's dry i'm starting to really feel my effect definitely dried my mouth out i'll need to go get water um there's definitely cereal high but i'm really relaxed i'm mentally i'm alert i'm awake but i i'm actually feeling very very relaxed right now yeah all me down was uh i don't know i i think when i'm having days like this i should immediately resort to uh one of the strains i know it just kind of led that you know it is now but you know no better time in the present so i found that this strain in the past has been a really 180 um after i consumed it it's just it's really been positive on my mood and anxiety so i'm feeling starting to feel a lot more calm like a weights been kind of my uh taking off my shoulders so i highly recommend it's one of my favorite strains as you know from uh can of farms so i'm gonna give it uh just because i like it and i know it i'm gonna give it a 9 out of 10. um expect that beautiful buds packaging was great taste was great and the effects i feel are exactly what i wanted and i needed tonight so i would definitely score it high on a psychological level um i will definitely give it like an eight out of ten for physical for if you're looking for pain i didn't get really pain relief but even just relaxing yourself um helps that body tension so i would def i love this strain his personal favorite and honestly i'm really impressed this is not the same like i said lapa i would have seen from canada farms a year ago it's a four-year-old um tune in guys jessica is very very informed when it comes to medical cannabis i try to keep up and tie up the loose ends but uh she has a lot of knowledge and we will be going over different strains so next episode we will have another strain for you guys to uh to test out have a good night", "4EF1zYFHbus": "look at Augustus don't worry he

subscribers known to man and I'll see you in the next one so don't be late say my name risen birth god damn right", "ikgVjiLBMHo": "dabbe connection here with the Cresco Dreamwalker cartridge is a sativa cartridge as you can tell live resin not co2 oil see the test batch information here inside the box it comes packaged in this little plastic tube works pretty well simple but effective packaging the cartridge itself is a pretty standard C cell cartridge with a clear plastic mouthpiece the color banding on the cartridge itself does not denote the specific strain though the strains themselves are color coded so you can tell at least whether it is sativa hybrid or indica depending on the color the color band of course it's got their little logo printed on here and I'll show you guys how it hits it's a pretty good cartridge it has a pretty decent long-lasting high however it's almost entirely flavorless to be entirely honest there's a little subtle hint of flavor but it's so little you hardly even notice it I also picked up another of their carts of a different strain and the flare was honestly indistinguishable anyways here's a hit as you can tell it it's pretty heavy as one expects from the Cecil tarts anyways they all tend to hit pretty heavy there's definitely no off flavors with it or anything like that so it's not like it has any kind of chemical aftertaste it really just doesn't taste like much of anything but the high is great and it's on the pricier end but you get a pretty large number it pops out of each cartridge so I would say overall it evens out on the price side of things this cartridge itself put me back about 50 bucks but which does put it on the pricier side of the spectrum but I've had other pricier cartridges that honestly didn't hit this well and didn't have as long-lasting a high and it was just generally one is good so overall I'd say it's a pretty well above average current so long as you're willing to spend money to get it maybe gonna find a good deal for it then I'd say jump on it and I think that about does it there in show you guys what it looks like in the big battery before we go see yeah pretty good stuff it's some pretty light distillate it's not super dark which in my experience tends to mean a cleaner hit as far as like the flavor and whether or not it really gets to your lungs but that's all I've got to say here hopefully that helps inform your decision hope you all have a great day out there", "vZ-7c7ryljs": "tonight on ion Springfield the Munchkins from The Wizard of Oz where are they now and we'll visit a nudist camp for animals but first a look at the local holiday that was called distasteful and pure I'll buy a panel of hillbillies whacking day oh no no in a tradition that dates back to founding father jebediah Springfield every May 10th local residents gathered and drive snakes into the center of town and whack them two snake heaven after exposing Alger Hiss honorary grand marshal Richard Nixon goes after another deadly hit is whacking day over thank you thanks for coming out uh-huh it's also barbaric hey kids how was school I learned how many grams in a penny wait I got expelled that's my boy yeah what you're going to get an education I'm going to teach you myself Marge it's too late the boys ten years old let's focus our energy on Lisa and the other one what's your problem whacking days coming whoa the greatest day of the year a killing snakes is evil maybe so Lisa but it's part of our oh so human nature inside every man is a struggle between good and evil that cannot be resolved I am evil homer i am evil homer i am evil homer i am evil homer and the Lord said wacky all the serpents which crawl on their bellies and thy town shall be a beacon unto others so you see Lisa even God himself endorses whacking bay let me see that No well Marge should I whack slow or fast slow then fast dad please for the last time I beg you don't lower yourself to the level of the mob Lisa maybe if I'm part of that mob I can help steer it in wise directions no where's my giant foam cowboy hat and airhorn if the snakes were in here we could protect them well according to this snakes here by sensing vibrations in the ground so if we put our stereo speakers on the ground and play something with a lot of bass those snakes will be in here like Oprah on a big ham oh good idea let's see base space Tiny Tim the Chipmunks greatest hits a castrato Christmas Oh can't get enough of your lab a mr. white can we borrow you for a minute anything for a lady don't bother the snakes leave all the snakes [Music] ah oh [Music] Carly my darling I can get it up for your last day he'll I don't know I don't know why can't get enough of your love babe some things I can get used to no matter how I try it's like the more you give them oh I was a baby that's no that's no tell me what can I say whatever I feel hey what all this thanks go people of Springfield wedding day is a sham it was started in 1924 as an excuse to beat up the Irish it's true they took many of them but was all in good fun", "-DiSyczwbR8": "oh lovely stuff very nice yeah they literally just came out the people get sold uh get that but we always believe don't you yeah it seems to see sometimes all right so far [Music] [Music] oh so beeswax is a bristol-based night um run by myself ellie and eric ed matt josh and felix yeah so me and josh started it um and then josh was like hey i know this guy felix he's done parties before he makes music he's in some music felix and then um and then i asked ellie to help get on board with the helping with like the logo and stuff and she made this logo that we're still using today i um i really like the logo even if people say it looks like i was i remember in the summer before we started like trying to pick a logo and i thought this one was really good uh some of the ones that we had before they were terrible i love crafters i've got a soft spot for like like a it's just i think it's the best venue for like a sort of just like fun midweek night without a venue like crafters we probably wouldn't know his butt on our first night it's the perfect place to like get started with these sort of things i came into beeswax just after the big blue mountain night um and ed just asked me one day he said yeah i'd like to get involved with beeswax yeah i mean this year because josh and felix have been away um they've taken like a backseat yeah yeah felix's productions are really good um and it would be great if we could put them up properly somehow but putting out the cassette was really cool cool to do something different yeah yeah so felix makes the light box i remember looking out there like to try to get loads of quotes on it it's like how much does it cost to get one of those one of those things that you see everywhere if felix just popped up like yeah i'll make it everybody's listening for these i kind of like crown jewels is probably like cast voyager in that crew because that was us doing exactly what i said it was saying like there's this really cool sound coming out of morocco that like people are listening to here but like maybe people haven't thought about even bringing them over yet and then when we got the chance to do that i was like we take the box like directly there the crowd was loving it and i've never seen such a happy bunch that were all focused on the music i didn't see a single person on their phone everyone was a hundred percent invested [Music] i'd say castlevania just because it was so momentous of an occasion to have a label from somewhere like morocco who are still pretty unheard of in this country to be there on their uk debut and they played for us on what was only our fifth or sixth night ever and we managed to score them pretty much on gloucester road we've done crafters levine and blue mountain and number 51 and take five so done quite a lot not done lakota um which would be great to do but quite a step up in terms of money capacity we wanted to like try out a different space that's more orientated towards or like more specific towards the kind of music that we play or promote so we're going to have an event at the island with ploy and dj marcel [Music] marcel emailed me today yeah i was like are you worried about it like um she was like apparently in holland um they've cancelled events of over 100 people yeah that's by law though everything here is being done on a whim no one's consulting anyone yeah if it wants to happen it'd be a massive nightmare just because you spent all of this time organizing an event and you know you don't do it a day it's a long process so i think there's a lot of people that wanted to come to our event and it'll be a real real shame if they can't yeah we just want everyone to stay safe i think marcel was the kind of one at the start we were like we need to book her and ploy was the kind of name that we thought would bring people in to come and see her and that's the thing i guess speaking smoothing up the smaller artists and having to at the same time sell tickets it's the problem ploy's a bit more you can just kind of expect what he's going to play ploy would be much more kind of down the uk techno route marcel uses three turntables which is pretty unusual um she needs a particular type of mixer she needs a light to like three lights for each turntable um yeah it's gonna be pretty manic i kind of respect that the approach she has and the kind of i don't know yeah she's not really not ready to make exceptions for the sake of kind of like what's cool and what's kind of like trendy ed's gonna interview dj marcel for 10 20 radio on the night and he's spoken a lot about it and he's been prepping his questions and i think he's really looking forward to it hello hello hello and welcome to this very special episode on 1020 radio with beeswax i'm joined with dj marcella hi also known as another nice mess how are you doing today um like my biggest worry is i'm gonna ask a question she's looks at me like that that's a stupid question why have you asked that but that's just because she will that's great i will sign out on that and you can catch us with marcel and ploy at the island tonight yeah uh tickets still on sale for 11 pounds and yeah it's gonna be wild thank you how many tickets are we at now you know which is probably not so many yeah the post is good jamie's a very good artist yeah outpost is great i think it's gonna it's amazing the difference that a good poster can make to a knight as we kind of like establish like a kind of format it's kind of gone with that it's quite nice i really love the new one though the island one is like probably my favorite so far new ones we've done yeah the posters have got significantly better i think the poster for the identified patient night was a huge factor in how many tickets we sold he's the biggest name that we booked amongst the sort of scene he's is very well known identified patient was great um he didn't quite fit in the venue like such a big guy but yeah he brought such a good vibe and the kind of music he's playing [Music] something that's gotta be massively wrong about promoting is like the identified patient night couldn't have gone better like completely sold out and we made 20 pounds so it says a lot about the industry and the people that are doing it are purely doing it because they love it because there is no other reason to do it i think we did that as well as we could have and like say only 20 quid we love music we love finding artists that we enjoy we love bringing them along to play for us and as a byproduct people also enjoy that and they come to our nights and they buy some tickets and it generates enough revenue for us to just about keep going and that's that's what i prefer that's why i'm involved with this so we're going to give out two love sales tickets um as part of a competition just to you know get people interested in the event we've just bought a couple tickets to love so today which everyone will want to go to every year as they always do um i'm just going to give them away for free to people who share it share our event and say they're going to it which hopefully in turn will get a bit of exposure and sell us some tickets so the island is one of my favorite venues in the city by a long way and ever since started doing beeswax always wanted to do a night there so it's very excited that we finally are going to do one um it's definitely been an aim since we started doing it for me anyway a great lineup to do with we don't really know what's going on with coronavirus unfortunately i think everyone's just gonna put everything on pause for the minute well actually saying that yesterday we weren't in a position to even really think about canceling the event today more so just because a few people have been diagnosed with it it's definitely gonna cost us a few tickets i think it's already because it's quite have you know everyone's selling their motivation no one wants to go out in the next couple of months not going to be going to clubs at all i guess luckily we're sort of fortunate in that we haven't got any slight events set in stone for the next couple months because i think a lot of small promoters like you know no student promoter has insurance or anything like that you know you've got absolutely no chance um so really not good for like the events industry and for the djs themselves yeah it's [ __ ] crazy but hopefully we can get this last party in well everyone's still somewhat safe and sound [Music] i [Music] but", "-nYprqSyi9I": "a big push back at you with another vid this is a breeding project we have uncle

not happy with I'm not after that all this is a buyer beware video it's gonna be a short one two products Pennsylvania medical marijuana do not purchase I don't know what's going on first let's just jump right into the first of all there are so many products out there and all this stuff is behind the counter so you can't even really see it and hold it and touch it or whatever I mean everything sealed up they'll show you things but I mean what I've noticed it's it's a crapshoot seeing if you're gonna get what you want or I mean you're definitely not getting what you paid for because this stuff is ridiculously expensive alright so first thing doesn't work and don't buy is this this is a capsule 20 capsules in here five milligrams each I took the whole bottle yesterday and it feel anything and I'm not like a crazy junkie or whatever you want to call who just you know takes as much as I can so I can't I took two pills five milligrams each so 10 nothing took another one nothing took two more nothing nothing it's a waste don't buy it I don't know what's going on here is on line they say that 50 50 milligrams will send you to the moon some people say that's not true I didn't feel anything and that was under milligrams so either that's a dud or the internet and everybody's lying about the milligrams so that's Cresco a remedy awake don't buy it number two the strain created by Terrapin called a Rando Calrissian what a bunch of [ __ ] that is they said on the website it was going to be 17 percent THC maybe sixteen point five seventeen now it was 13 and a half THC it's nothing it doesn't taste there's no flavor they say it it's like a hybrid between a princess legged some other thing a Terrapin original therapy quit it cut it out nobody wants to 13% CHC nobody wants you know pills that you're gonna spend $30 on and do nothing and this right here how much I have left of this crap this is that Rando Calrissian it looks it looks decent it's dry no smell there's like there's no there's no smell and that was $42 when I've got an amazing ace folks hairpin and I love them but this one sucks don't buy it don't buy it on a positive note I will grab one thing that I got that I enjoyed and I think that you should pick up if you're into this and this is one of the only things that I've been able to really enjoy at the Pennsylvanian medical marijuana shops and that is be a vapor and I feel like I get the best hit invest hi my vapor and I've been going through a bunch of batteries don't buy the stick batteries don't buy that crap and get this thing it's $25 and alehrer at Plymouth Meeting which is like 20 minutes outside of Philly alright this guy it is a eleaf mini ice thick it's got variable temperature changer it's got a little mod so you could put on a bigger tank here five times is a really cool LED adjusted temperature it's not picking that up at all anyway so this was cool when I was hitting off the vape cartridge with the pen I was getting a big really big throat hit and I just couldn't stop coughing so then I sat the bubba kush cart down and waited until i decided on what battery i wanted to her maybe what exactly you know the problem was and how to fix it so I got a new battery set it at 3.3 volts put my bubba kush cart in there from GT I let her rip and then cough that much I don't lot of smoke but I definitely felt it and it was good and this was when I was a waiting for these pills to kick in two hours three hours nothing so don't buy remedy from Cresco do wait cause I want to buy any of the capsules from any of these places yet I mean wait wait till we get the cheap of chews and the edibles from from over out west cuz this crap I feel like people in Pennsylvania the manufacturers don't know what they're doing or just take advantage of a desperate market so anyway that's a quick quick video review about things not to buy because there's a plenty of crap out there it's like yeah unbelievable but anyway for this

Chang's conclusion typically osteoarthritis pain of the hip is manifested in the groin area and where you're having your pain is more soft tissue related good news because soft tissue injuries are often easier to treat than those that affect bone structure and I can keep running though right and the key is you can keep running okay that's good that's good news dancing over there yeah hey go go go go go if you have a hip problem it does not mean you have to stop exercising in fact oftentimes continued activity may be beneficial the key is to identify what the source of the pain is and then to appropriately treat it in Ann's case the muscles ligaments and tendons just needed some TLC dr. Chang often prescribes anti-inflammatories which can be especially helpful when combined with physical therapy he also recommends varying your exercise to include several sports tennis gives Ann's muscles a side-to-side workout which running alone can't provide being active it's important to me as it spits comes become more of a lifestyle and I suppose I ever would have thought so lots of stretching more rest between workouts - Ann it's all making sense tennis is really a lifelong sport and I tend to play when I'm an old lady I have no pain I'm doing great you", "42J4hcppAkY":

Mondays it is 9 o'clock we will go ahead and get started so welcome to Alexander's aesthetics how to choose the best wax for you webinar today if you are new to Alexander's we are a wholesale distribution company for all your aesthetic needs from skincare lines to waxing obviously to cotton gloves all of the good stuff we have two locations one is in Colorado and one in California if you don't already have our contact information we'll have all of that at the end of the presentation for you just some housekeeping fun stuff to start if you have any questions you can pop them into that handy dandy little question box and Wendy in our Colorado location is going to be monitoring all of those for us during the presentation I am going to answer all the questions at the very end but feel free to throw your question in that box during like when you think of the question go ahead and throw it in there but I'm not going to answer anything till the end just so we can kind of stay on track here and please don't hesitate to ask any questions that's what I'm here for and I will pretty much guarantee that someone else will probably have that same question that you would have so let's get started so I am Tiffany Monte bono I have been a licensed esthetician since 1999 I have owned my small business since 2005 and I've been educating for alexander's for about 10 years now I am still a working esthetician so all of these products that I am going to talk about today and and all of these items and bullet points were going through is based on all of the work experience that I've had in all of the challenges that I have and again I still I still have clients so I still have my own questions and I still have my own challenges so don't feel like again a question that you have a can pretty much guarantee I've probably had that or I would have it at some point so that is me so well we're going to cover today this is gonna be me asking you a lot of questions this is to help narrow down your preferences we created a handout to help guide you down that down the road of the questions you can download that in the handout section if you haven't already looked at it printed it out however you want to look at it but it's going to help guide you to the best wax that suits you so when you're considering the type of wax you should spend just as much time researching the brand and its qualities as you would with your skincare we keep in mind that waxing is a skin care service and clients are actually pretty impressed when you explain the wax that you have and why you have it and most clients don't realize that there's thousands of waxing waxes just like there are thousands of skin care lines so we carry three wax brands seer pill like on and eat all wax you don't necessarily need to know a ton about these brands quite yet again the questions that we're going to ask are going to help guide you through this but these these particular questions aren't brand specific but we are going to be diving into the qualities of these brands because that is what we what we have and to be perfectly honest these are the three brands and the only three brands that I've actually really ever used I would say have some note-taking apparatus ready to write down the answers as these questions come up so that again you can help guide through okay so many questions let's start with the basic questions first this texture matter do you prefer a gel texture a creamy texture does color matter yes or no do you enjoy sense things that smell flowers fruit sweet you prefer non-sentient the performance does it work does it not work are there tricks you need to know about about these things how much are you willing to spend is cost a factor for you the type of wax are you looking for a strip a strip 'less or both so i created some videos because they do talk a lot about i do talk about texture and to me that's that's one of the the bigger questions that i like to ask first and only because we're really tactile people and if it does isn't doesn't feel right to us then we tend to not necessarily like it so we created a couple little videos here that will help distinguish that gel versus creamy textured so here's a video of a creamy hard wax you can see it's a little thicker and textured still can be applied fairly thin but still on that creamy side and this is a creamier strip wax so again still a little on that sicker looking side not completely translucent so is a gel textured hard wax you can see that's there's a little more translucency there it's a little shinier and here's a gel strip wax this one is going to be really translucent but again extremely thin going on in texture so hopefully those little videos helped you kind of understand what I'm talking about women what I'm talking about gel versus creamy so let's break this down I choose gel versus creamy gel wax is again tend to be more translucent so you can see the hair and the skin creamy waxes tend to be solid in color and thicker and texture now what does pliable hard wax so pliability really does really geared more towards hard wax so if a wax is pliable it would allow you to apply more hard wax strips down at once without the wax setting up to the point that it would break crack and you'd have a hard time kind of removing it so it allows a little bit of flexibility in nature and allows you to take your time with the application and removal now what about setup time so the time it takes your product to set up Kate's way nice and set up can everyone hear me is this okay yes okay great I was getting a crazy echo in my head there all right so set up time so that can equate to whether or not you're your product is more pliable going back to that pliable question so if you have a longer time to move the wax around it generally means that it's more pliable and your setup period your set-up time is longer which in some cases we really need or we would prefer right so again this is really gonna relate more to your hard wax your strip wax with set-up time that would just mean if the wax actually will dry on the skin or if it always stays moist and tacky on the skin you can apply so an example is if you can apply your wax to let's say an entire like half leg before working on the removal and it still comes off really easy okay so and generally to be a little fair I think most relaxed is really never truly dry to the point where you can't get it off on the skin now another question we do get a lot how many blacks is should you have that's a great question I tend to say I feel like two is sufficient now whether that is two different strip waxes or hard waxes or one of each that's going to be which you know your own personal preference if you want a strip and a heart or what not but maybe consider one that's faster setting or one that's better for your sensitive skins that type of that type of difference in between the waxes might be something that you want you consider now how do you decide which two okay I want you to think about the body parts you want to work on and the type of clientele that you have so an example I work on full body with a specialty of male female Brazilians so for me I have a strip wax for the larger body parts and hard wax is for the Brazilians or let's say you only want to focus on the face and you like hard wax so you might have a hard wax that's greater for the reactive sensitive skins and one that's better for the tougher hard to get hairs okay some other important questions to ask yourself this is about this honestly a little more about you what is your current wax not doing for you I want you to really think about that question is it do you have to go over an area multiple times does it set up too quickly or does it not set up quickly enough do you have a scent that you don't love these are the kinds of questions that you want to ask yourself okay now what do you love about the wax that you're currently using you think it smells amazing and it gets every hair every time okay what I'm trying to get into here is what you might be missing right so when you're looking again think of it as a skincare think of it as skincare so when you're looking at your skincare brands you're thinking you know this particular brand is missing a really great hydrating mask so then you'll look outside and look at other brands to say oh this brand has a great hydrating mask I can implement in on my shelf to retail to my clients okay so things like that that's those are the kinds of things I want you to really start to think about okay now a couple of other things some other potential obstacles we sometimes forget that outside factors can actually affect your waxes performance room temperature is your room really hot is it really cold if your room is warmer and one of your challenges that your wax takes so long to set up maybe it's because your room is so humid so we need you need to find a wax that is quicker in the set-up time because that way then it won't necessarily take as long as your current wax client temperature is your client really warm is your client really cold that also can make a very large difference now to combat some of these is your bed warmer on which also makes your clients a little too warm or do you not have a bed warmer and that might be why your client is really cold and if your client is really cold then the wax sets up too fast and you have a challenge working that way okay hopefully some of these are kind of starting to make you more a little more aware of what we are not missing now the beginning of the day versus the end of the day does that matter so an example my particular office it can be about thirty degrees I live in California so thirty degrees is real cold for us but it can be really cold in there it's a really old building and I know that so if I have clients first thing in the morning for waxing I got to get in there early because I need to warm up the room otherwise my client my poor client who's laying naked on the bed is quilt and because of that the wax that I have will end up setting up way too fast right so I need to be able to adjust the room itself in order for the product that I want to use that day I want it to I want it to work appropriately if that makes it that makes some sense okay now here's one of the biggest challenges that we have right sensitive I always put sensitive / reactive because to me those are those are different okay now what type of wax is best for sensitive skin here's your answer it depends on what exactly you mean by sensitive okay does your client welt just turn red do they get hives do they get a rash now these are different reactions so if your client just turns red a lot of times that just means that they're reacting to the trauma of waxing right that is not necessarily anything that you can always completely come back right redness is a very normal reaction but if they welt or hive that's more of a histamine reaction that means that the body is reacting that's how their body is reacting to the trauma and the inflammation right so waxing can create some inflammation because it's trauma and that particular client they will welt from that okay so again let's put our skin care hats on is it only certain parts of the body that react this way is it certain times of the month this is where we want to start looking at the ingredients that make up the product so hence I want your skin care hat on because when again we're using that cleanser that toner whatever we're looking at the ingredients that are best for our clients skin same same thing here with our wax is so let's get more into that so let's get specific on waxes made for certain situations okay the next few slides we're gonna go into the actual waxes themselves by all three manufacturers don't worry about writing these all down and again that guide that we created is really gonna help get you into that okay so we're gonna get into sensitive skin most waxes have a type of tine of beads wax resin the resin is what allows strength and flexibility to the product okay a lot of times this is the root cause of the irritation to the skin the waxes that are made for sensitive skin can have other ingredients in it like titanium dioxide that can really help with inflammation in the imitation night now hypoallergenic this wax means that the resin is a synthetic present so there's no beeswax or pine in the product that the hypoallergenic wax could also contain other anti-inflammatory ingredients it could have that titanium dioxide in there as well okay we're gonna get into which waxes are for the whole body and the best ones that are also for stubborn hair these tend to be the most asked questions okay so again don't worry about writing these down your handout is going to help guide you through what I've already got up on here on the on the screen here we've sectioned it out by the brand okay so the sensitive skin hard waxes that means these generally have either and synthetic or something like a titanium dioxide and some product it can be a micro mica or Syrah pill uses what's called the micro crystalline which is their synthetic resin so the essential rose and the euros both of those are that creamy texture and they have the titanium dioxide in there that's why they're better for the sensitive skin the boudoir cashmere and the crystalline those have that synthetic micro crystalline resin in there there's no pine or beeswax okay so those are great for those sensitive skins now into like on the like Oh tech white the like Oh Dream and the manaphy Co those three contain that synthetic resin the rosette and they so yummy they have that titanium dioxide and just as a side hint titanium dioxide tends to make the wax that creamier texture so if you see titanium none of ours have zinc in them but a lot of other wax brands do have zinc also can create that that creamier thicker texture okay so that just keep that in mind the like Oh Dream and the manaphy co hybrid which man if it goes new and delightful those both also have a pine bees wax blend in there but because of that synthetic resin it really helps with that hypersensitivity of the skin and the irritation that can occur now moving into the atholl wax hard wax the white chocolate that has the titanium dioxide the crystal the pink pearl and the coral those are all fairly similar in texture they're honestly they're just kind of different colors those have that synthetic resin the pink pearl and the curl also do have the bees pine now the Cleopatra that one's wonderful as well that one just has that great synthetic resin in there okay so hopefully that makes a little bit of sense so again these are just for that that's that overall sensitive skin this isn't the hypoallergenic we're gonna get into that so when you have the sensitive skins the ones that get red also you may be your older clientele right my my Nana is about to be a hundred years old and I waxer and I can use any of these on her and it really helps alleviate any redness that her skin might have she has thinner skin she's a little bit on the older side right so if your clients hell is on that more of that aging verge you're gonna probably want something geared more for the sensitive skins or reactive skins mine too - now the sensitive skin strip wax seer pill we've got the ease the ease has that titanium dioxide crystal ocean not reblock that both have that synthetic resin in there okay moving into the like on the like otech White has the synthetic resin the rosette strip has the titanium dioxide and I hate to tell you that unfortunately like on a lot of the names are similar and the heart and the strip version of them so they're similar and texture ingredient one is just a strip version one is a hard version so again don't worry too much about writing it down the the handout explains all this for you to moving into the Atomics rose oil and the opera more aquamarine tongue-tied on that one that goes both have that titanium dioxide so there on that great creamy texture side okay moving into the hypoallergenic now the see repeal the hard wax the boudoir the cashmere and the crystalline those only have that synthetic resin right so let's remember that synthetic resin means hypoallergenic because it doesn't have the pioneer beeswax blend in there okay like on they only have the like oh the like oh tech white that is the only one that doesn't have the pine bees blend it has that great synthetic resin a tall axe the crystal that is the only one that doesn't have the Pioneer bees only that synthetic okay most of these are all gonna be a little more translucent and texture and I like to almost semi describe them sometimes as more of a silkier texture there's they're generally more on that gel but I'd like to say silky cuz it's just a nice smooth application I guess that's how I want to say that now CIRA pill and like on they both only have one of the strip waxes that are hypoallergenic the crystal ocean of sea repel and the like otech white again on the strip version that only has that synthetic resin okay so there's nothing else there's no pine or bees time and again that is where most of the time your client can find some of that irritation unless they have an allergy to rose or a lavender or something else in in some of the products none of these have any of that either most of your hypoallergenic waxes again are going to be a little more straightforward on the ingredient deck because you want less stuff right then a little little more simplified they're so full body okay now a full body I only really marked down all the hard wax is and I did that based on the fact that realistically all stripper axes are great for the whole entire body I mean I'll take that back these three product lines these three manufacturers all of their strip waxes are great for the whole body so if you are a strip wax person then that all of them are great for it for any body part that you're going to choose to work on now for hard waxes we've got on the serie pill side we've got the blue the boudoir the cashmere the Euro blonde and the crystalline now the blue and the Euro blonde those I kind of like to say they're twinsies one is blue and one is gold that's that's really kind of your only difference boudoir cashmere those are a little bit different and sentient color same thing with the crystalline the crystalline actually is doesn't have any sense to me I don't smell anything they are very translucent more of that gel type texture they're great for the full body and the example of full body what I'm talking about is legs backs chests arms larger body parts they're also all great for Brazilians because I know you'd ask me that as well now moving into the land to like on the like otech white the like Oh Dream and the Menifee Co hybrid those are better for the full if you want to use a hard works on the full body and those three honestly it's truly because the synthetic resin and these really allow flexibility and flow I want to say with these particular hard wax there's a lot of like ons other the other hard waxes they tend to be fickle is probably the best word I want to use they're amazing for the smaller body parts but I truly only found that these three are better if you want to use it on the larger area so again legs backs chests things like that now Atomics definitely has a longer a longer list here this honestly this particular list I've actually kind of took from some of our clients Howell who uses some of these on the entire body and do very well with them so the natural the natural of a toe axe that legitimately has two ingredients and it's bees and pine and that's it we've got the Angeline the Rose the poor home the white chocolate the plum the crystal the pink pearl the coral and the Cleopatra now if you notice to a lot of these you can go back and look hey I want a full-body hard wax that is a hypoallergenic wax well you you do have options there right so again when we get into we'll show you the again if you don't already have that printed out that's going to help guide you into into that ok wax for stubborn hair here's another challenge that we have right the ones that just the waxes that your you'll have a hard time with that peach fuzz or that really thick white coarse hair especially on the chin right that's always our biggest grape so with the Syrah pill if we want to use strip wax for Stuber and I'd go with the ease and the Forte we tended to be honest we tend to forget that the forte is around I love I actually really truly love this particular wax it is really great for that stubborn hair if you like strip wax like on we have the Angeline and the rosette for strip waxes for that stubborn here eat all acts we have the amber and the rose oil for those stubborn hairs ok now with the hard waxes for Sarah pill we have the blue the essential rose and the home they'll like on we've got the agile een the rosette and the like oujet now again these are all going to be the little different texture things like that but through honestly I kind of created this list based on what I really has worked the best for me in my own in my own room with my own clients as far as stubborn hair is concerned it's all acts hard wax we've got the natural Vaseline the poor home the white chocolate and the plum for those stubborn hairs ok so you do have a really broad spectrum of different waxes to try out if you're looking for again those specific types of waxes stubborn hair sensitive skin all of that and again if you go through the list you'll find that even for the stubborn hair a lot of the sensitive skin waxes can still work really well for you so and we don't need to have 45 different access you can if you have the space for it I mean knock yourself out I'm all about it but I don't necessarily think we we need to get that excited okay here is the handout okay so unfortunately the handout was a little bigger then we could fit on the screen so you've only got a little bit of the Sirocco and the like on but you can see here that we've got the each different type of wax we have the hard wax as your strip waxes and we do have all of those sections that we have been talking about throughout this whole presentation the only one I didn't get into is vegan to be honest obviously because we didn't talk about that but it does go through the texture it goes through scent pliability if you can use it on the full body it's hypoallergenic and if it is vegan because a lot of your clients some of my clients are really starting to ask about that as well so we do think that's a nice option to know even if it's not something that you necessarily are a yes or a no for you still how you have the information so scenario is using that handout okay let's say let's say you're going to look for a syrupy wax let's say that you want a gel textured hard wax you don't care if it has a scent but you want it for the full body here are your options the blue the boudoir cashmere the Euro blonde the home and the crystalline so again if you start looking at that handout and you go through those preferences these are the ones that you would have to choose from now mind you some you're going to have more options than others but again at least what it will help kind of define it down a little bit more for you now let's say you're going to let you want to look at a like on let's say you want to creamy textured strip wax you do actually prefer to have a scent to it but you you really want it to be a hypoallergenic wax so the like otech light strip wax that's the wax that you would choose okay now in if we're looking at the italics and we want a creamy strip wax you don't have a cent preference but you do want it to be vegan the rose oil is your answer now mind you there might be a wax that doesn't fit all of your needs so there might be a little bit of compromise on there but you will know yes or no okay so again it can help at least break it down for you okay so hopefully all that makes sense now again once you get to this point and they're like oh my gosh there's so many to choose from or there's only one maybe there's another one I should try we can definitely help start to really hone in a little bit more for you as well but hopefully this is a good a good start for you okay now that I've asked you a thousand questions go ahead and pop your Wendy's gonna pop on here and she's been monitoring your questions so she is gonna loops I get really excited about clicking this thing I tell you so she's gonna pop in here and start asking those questions that you guys have again don't be afraid to ask questions I'm hi everybody TIFF we've got a question here from Christina what are the waxes that are best for redheads so that is always a tough one right those those redheads there they give you a run for your money so I would go with the if you're going back into that scenario you're gonna want to look for the ones for the tougher skin right so I would go let's go back a little bit so I'd go in stubborn hair so are you looking for a strip wax or are you looking for a hard wax with the if if I can go through this so the serie pol i would go with the forte to be honest with you the hard wax for serie pill I would personally the home or the essential rows that will depend for you on if you like creamy gel texture or if you want to sent those to are where I would play in on the Syrah pill side like on to be perfectly honest the rosette on both fronts on the hard and the strip and eat all acts I would go with the rose oil and that the poor home or the white chocolate those would be those would be the ones that I would say that you could that you have some of the most success with for for that that red hair I do those are tough lines that's a good question yeah I'm she kind of thought she followed up with a good another just clarification she's looking mainly for brows and Brazilians for redheads and again any of those would be fine depending on if you if you want a strip or or a heart any of those from each of those lines would you'd have success with and the nice thing with these guys too cuz redheads you're always gonna have some redness left behind there you're gonna have a little less redness with some of these the Forte you probably wouldn't have as much redness with the C repel the essential Rose I would say you'd have less redness especially on the face - I personally because generally this is the question - for hard wax I only use hard wax on the face so I would choose the essential rose the rosette or the the white chocolate those would be my first go twos if you're a hard wax girl like I am for the base alright thanks Tiffany I'm one more question on what is the best wax for males what body part this question came from si si are you looking for a particular body part maybe let's start with back you know it's any of them you're gonna what we actually what you want to look more as is hair type and not necessarily male/female and I'll say that because the redheaded question is a great one to go back to only because it doesn't matter if you're male or female redheads are just they're challenging right so if you have a redhead and at the back wax you're still going to want to look at some of these waxes for the stubborn hairs now if you have a back wax that is a regular client you don't necessarily have to go with one for the most stubborn hairs because if they're regular then their hair is going to be softer finer smoother less right as they start to come in more so it that kind of depends if you're if we're talking about male Brazilians know Brazilians is again fairly well the same I don't I don't personally pick based male or female I based more hair hair type body part if that makes sense because honestly I mean I wax you know there's women's backs and some chests and bellies that you're going to wax on women as well right so and they have peach fuzz on their rear ends to a right or they some of them also have a lot of kind of stubborn thicker hair back there too so instead of necessarily looking for gender focused more on type of hair because that a lot of times can help you out I don't know if that really answered the question no that was good thank you um we have a question here that there's some seen some things on the internet about different waxes that hurt less on the client can you speak to that well here's hairs this is just my personal thought process on that waxing is not a comfortable situation it's it's just it's not and your job is to make it as comfortable as possible I generally tend to like to break it down more for a technique than the actual product itself a lot of the time because I don't necessarily think there's a way to take all of the uncomfort out and I don't necessarily think that one hurts less than another now with that being said I personally again I choose hard waxes on the more sensitive spaces like the face the underarms Brazilians but that's because at the comfort level for me also I work better with those on those areas so I always I always use her I always have used hard waxes on those areas right but I don't necessarily think that using a strip wax on those areas would hurt more either to be perfectly honest with you now I again let's go back to looking at the ingredients so your your pine beeswax blends are gonna be tougher they're gonna probably be a little more aggressive than the synthetic ones to be honest so if you're gonna use something like the like on like otech white either stripper hard or the Syrah pill the crystalline that one's a great one you may have less discomfort with those because there's less actual grip on the skin itself which a lot of times that may help alleviate some of that discomfort if that makes sense but the top one yeah thank you um all right we have a question here what are your wax recommendations for thick coarse hair for Brazilians so again going back into that the the hard wax the blue the essential rose the home any of these would be good for thick stubborn hair now again here is a minute I tend to not always tell you my personal preference but I'm going to tell this to you because I have had more success with creamier texture waxes when it comes to thicker coarser hair because I will absolutely apply more product to those areas and make a really nice kind of hefty lip on there an amount of product I tend to really feel that the creamier waxes kind of sink a little bit more in between that hair to get really to the skin that's I again I that's my own personal success in my own office with my own clients I tend to sell I do gear more towards creamy textured waxes and any honestly any of it within these three lines any of these creamier textures to me work the best for the for the stubborn the thick that crazy hair that you're like oh my gosh how am I gonna get that out that's that these are the ones that I always kind of geared towards okay great a DSM thank you yes that um okay don't see any other questions so maybe we'll wait a couple you know a little bit to see if anyone else has questions in the meantime I just want to remind everybody that in the handout section we do have the handout that Tiffany showed that kind of breaks down all the waxes that we have with all the categories and we also did attach a PDF of the slides as well so make sure you download those before the presentation ends all right we got another question here can you apply the wax again if you don't get all the hair and if so which ones now with all three of these lines every single wax is okay to apply more than once with that being said we didn't obviously go through protocol but with all of these I apply oil down and the oil is going to create that barrier between the skin and the wax that is what is going to give that protective barrier to the skin to allow you to apply the waxes more than once and you know to be honest with you if there's any students in here unfortunately you guys are are taught and as far as State Board is concerned you're you're taught that you can only go over an area one time which to be realistic that's just not how it works you there will always be one or two that just doesn't get grabbed for some reason so you always are you're generally gonna have to do a little cleanup here in there and that's normal so it's absolutely fine for again any of these waxes that can go over the skin more than once but again just make sure that you've applied your oil down and take a look at the skin make sure that it didn't welt or it doesn't have any hives or any kind of extra irritation again redness don't worry too much about but but yeah any of them are and I have used just so all of you are aware I have used every single one of these waxes on my clients so mind they get a little confused with all the product that I always have consistently changing out but I have used all of them and I've never had a challenge with any of them on the skin having to go over more than once okay great see says thank you for that yeah right I think that is all the questions we have and don't forget if you think of something later you can always email call us shoot something in the sky we'll see it we are here to help and you mate you know what you may have questions later when you're in your office this week on oh maybe I forgot about this question or this scenario so don't you know don't hesitate to ask that's definitely what we're here for on our next webinars we're going to get into the waxing product knowledge I wanted to because again we have so many different lines and there are so many waxes and it does get very overwhelming I understand that definitely it's again it's like looking for skincare lines you're like oh there's nobody so we're gonna get into actual product knowledge and we're going to go the first one is going to be with a'tall wax this one's actually with their educator which is amazing and I'm looking forward to to working with her and listening to her on that webinar and then the next waxing one is going to be it'll be with me and we're going to get through like on and all of the different waxes of like on and how to use all of those and this is where so we're

much enjoy your week you you you", "40bGtZgATQA": "what's up guys I hope everybody's having awesome day today so I'm gonna be doing another experiment with my microscope today and a lot of people message me about this issue and that is what happens to your blood cells when you drink coffee what happens when you drink regular bottled water and what happens when you drink cuncun water so I thought I will do this test myself so I got my lens in the vise I got my needles I got my microscope I got my slides I mean I'm ready so let's get this started and here we go got a little blood man I really feel for people that I have to do this every single day you know not look at their blood under the microscope but you know to poke themselves and check their sugar you know that's that's crazy so let's see how is my blood cells right now so I just woke up right I just woke up I didn't drink water last night because I knew I was gonna do this video today so I want it to be you know the regular person that doesn't drink as much water before they go to sleep so right now we're at 10 times soon and you can see that my blood cells are really really really not moving at all they're not moving which means that you know I'm really dehydrating and this is how my blood is right now I'm gonna go ahead and put it on 220 times and you can see how my blood you can see my blood cells individually but they're stuck together and now moving guys and this is what happens for most of you guys I do not drink water and when you wake up what are you doing when you wake you know what are you put it inside your body when are you waking up this is really important guys as you can see mine is really really still Wow guys let go so let's go to 40 times soon again guys it is crazy you can see them but they're not moving at all they're kind of moving I can see them kind of moving now but they're you know they're not they're not moving like there should be so now let's go to 60 times and there it is guys you I mean you can see them like barely barely moving but you know there there should be like moving there should be all over the place and it's crazy so I'm gonna be doing what most people do every single morning and that is drink a cup of coffee and I put on almond creamer in here and no sugar I didn't put no sugar in here I used to be a really really heavy coffee drinker back in the day I used to drink at least three cups a day in the morning mid-afternoon and right before I went to sleep yes I drink coffee before going to sleep I don't know how I did it I seriously don't know how I did it um but today I'm gonna be drinking another cup of coffee I drink coffee every now and then not as often as I used to and actually when I do drink coffee now I make it with my kangen water but this is actually made with just regular plain water just to see what happens to my blood and I didn't want to attract the coffee with the common water and that's that's gonna be another test that I want to do I want to see the difference between coffee made with kangen water and regular clean water so that'll be really interesting to see but in this case I just use regular plain water for this purpose so I'm gonna be out drink this coffee and I'll be right back alright guys so it's been 10 minutes since I drank 12 ounces of cup of coffee with almond creamer okay so I'm gonna be testing my blood again and see if we can see any differences [Music] all right so right now right now we are looking at my blood ten times soon they are moving a lot more than they were which is good which is a good thing right but you can see that they're still getting stuck to each other and that's because the the blood cells are not surrounded with a negative charge around them to bounce off each other so I'm good let's go to 20 times soon and see if we can see any closer and yeah as you can see how the cells are forming lines they cannot look like coin stacking stacking up with each other and that's a sub formation called through loops rowlocks robux i don't know how to pronounce it very well but it's a formation in your blood that is associated with chronic liver disease and chronic inflammation throughout your bodies this doesn't necessarily mean that you're about to die but if you continue to drink this type of stuff and you continue to form your blood like this then over time then it can they can produce some damage in your body so let's go to 40 times some as you can see the blood cells are still moving a little bit but you can still see how they're still stacking up with each other and you know that's not a good sign so let's go to C C times what you want to see is every blood cell individually and bouncing of each other and just moving all over the place obviously right now it is moving more than it was but it's still stacking up with each other and it's not moving as fast so now I'm gonna be drinking bottled water and I'm gonna be seeing what happens within ten minutes of drinking bottled water so I got freakin Dasani here I don't know how I feel about this I haven't drink bottled water in a long time so I guess we're going to see how it tastes so I'm gonna be drinking 12 ounces of Dasani water that is 12 ounces right there so Cheers [Music] he has he has this weird taste to it no no and I can feel the difference I can definitely feel the difference I can taste the difference you have so I don't know he has kind of like a plastic I don't it's a weird taste I don't know I don't know and obviously I can feel it in my stomach so I'm just gonna wait 10 minutes and see what happens to my blood cells all right guys I'm back and it's been 10 minutes since I drank 12 ounces of that's our new water yeah I know pretty boring but let's go ahead and see what effects had in my blood Oh I mean poke it from home let's do it again baby you can see the blood cells moving and this is a 10 times zoom and to be honest you can see that low blood cells has separated a little bit this is a 20 time soon and yes my blood cells has separated a little bit but you cannot see them moving as they should be right so at least we don't see this the coin stack formation anymore and at least we see some separation but I want to see more movement so let's go out for tea time soon all right that's 40 times soon and let's go to 60 time soon alright alright guys so this is a 60 time soon as you can tell the blood cells are individually but you can see some of them are still stuck to each other and not moving much so now this is the good part and this is where I get really excited and that is drinking 12 ounces of kangen water so I'm gonna go ahead to my machine get 12 ounces and see what happens after 10 minutes alright guys so here's my conga machine and let's get some 9.5 and I got my measuring cup just in case there's some skeptics out there saying oh you know you drink more than 12 ounces what whatever so let's go and see 12 ounces just under 12 ounces and you can see the hydrogen in the water so let's go ahead and pour in this cup that is beautiful that is beautiful guys that is where you want to be drinking every single day and that's what they say drink the cloud alright guys so I have 12 ounces of kangen water 9.5 pH water and I'm about to chug this and we're gonna be seeing the results after 10 minutes now wow you can really really tell the difference between kangen water and this stuff I mean you really can't compare that's like comparing Bud Light to an aesthetic you really can't compare that but let's just say wait 10 minutes and see what happens alright guys so it's been 10 minutes since I drank 12 ounces of kangen water so let's go and poke myself again [Music] alright guys so this is a 10 times zoom and I can clearly see more cells moving around not as much as I would like to but just keep in mind that I drink a dead drink coffee and I did drink Dasani and both of those beverages are really really acidic full of protons so it doesn't help my blood at all so let's go at 20 times zoom and you can see that the cells are you know moving more than the previous test and my belief is this because the hydrogen which is negative charge is surrounding those cells and those cells are actively moving and bouncing off each other so let's go out in 40 times zoom you can clearly see the difference in your blood cells after drinking kangen water and this is why I wanted to do this video let's go at 60 times this is the main reason why I made the investment into the microscope you know because I wanted to show you guys the power behind hydrogen water you know so this is one thing me telling you what is what it does but it's another thing actually seeing what it does inside your body so I mean I don't know what to tell you guys I really don't have to say much you can see clearly see with your own eyes that facts on my blood after drinking coffee with almond creamer after drinking 12 ounces of Dasani water and then after drinking 12 ounces of kangen or hydrogen rich water you want to keep yourselves hydrated you want to keep them energized you want to keep them moving to prevent diseases just to prevent a lot of problems in your health so I hope you guys like this experiment that I did between these three beverages if you have any suggestions or or what else I should do with my microscope definitely comment on if you like this video please could like it and share it with all your friends and family because this info is crucial and I think everybody deserves to know this information and all I wanted to do is make people think I'm not trying to convince anybody at all I want to show you guys the results and I want you guys to make your own decisions and I hope this video makes that decision a little bit easier and if you have any questions whatsoever don't hesitate to get in touch with me have a great day stay hydrated my friends [Music] [Music]", "7nPt0qIYDZ8": "hey everybody how y'all doing this is morgan with morgan premium detailing here in south carolina uh man today we got a good got a pretty good video today um i have a vct job strip of wax uh it's a pretty big um office space you got you got like a big training area um a couple of long hallways and like a little break area so i mean it's a it's a pretty decent it's it's a pretty distant space so man i was looking at my youtube man and uh i see that i have like 36 subscribers man and i think that is so dope um you know i feel good about it man is is giving me uh motivation to keep going man you know uh as a lot of people know that make videos man like this is a long drawn-out process like you know um shooting editing you know uh getting getting different takes over and over again and stuff like that it can be it could be a daunting process so like you really gotta love to do it right and you know i like i like to make videos i like to share share my experiences with with different people and you know learn some things in the process and hopefully i can inspire other people to to kind of go after what they want to go after so yeah i just want to say man i feel i feel damn good about that that's that's awesome man um and please believe i'm gonna continue to make more videos i'm about to i'm about to up the production quality um i actually just bought a new desktop um i have a laptop right i got like a lenovo it's a uh idea pad it's a lenovo ideapad something something something but all you got to know is it got like four gigs around to it and it's a 32 32 gigabyte emmc memory and for those that don't know there's a memory that you can't take out that you can't upgrade so you know i only paid like 200 bucks for it so for what it's worth man it's a good it's a good laptop for what it's worth for what it can do um but you know i went ahead and uh bit that bullet man and made that investment into this desktop now first of all the desktop got eight gigs of ram got 256 gigs of ssd uh storage capacity so um i bought that i already already fell in love with it man um and i'll be using some better video editing software so like i said the uh production quality would definitely be higher i'm looking forward to it man i'm excited um so definitely be definitely stay tuned in with your boy man because i'm i'm really gonna try to really be uh making making some pretty good content um i'm still shooting on my phone i got a galaxy note 10 plus i'm still shooting on that so i mean but it's decent you know um i ultimately plan to get a panasonic g7 the uh the mirrorless camera that shoots at 4k but i don't think i'll be shooting at 4k no time soon uh but yeah just wanted to kind of get on here and just uh talk with y'all a little bit man i'm about about uh maybe 15 20 minutes away from the destination um it is very busy right now this is rush hour it is right now it's 4 42 p.m on friday afternoon so i'm not sure when this video will be coming out because um i'll be working this job pretty much all weekend then i got a car to do on um sunday afternoon then i got another job that i'll be doing sunday night so you know i'm gonna be getting it man i'm gonna be running on that midnight off or whatever the stand the the saying is but yeah man um just like i said uh thank y'all man thank y'all um we're gonna grow i hope y'all enjoy my growth hope y'all enjoy my journey because uh you know i'm gonna try my best to let it all out in the best possible form i can um always always like to get into like uh video production and things like that you know photography stuff like that so uh right now right now i'm kind of seeing this as an opportunity to to get back into it you know what i'm saying so that's what i'd be doing man like i said when i get that g7 boy oh there's gonna be some problems in these streets but but yeah man just want to get on here real quick and talk with y'all i will see y'all at the destination all right y'all man so i'm out here at the spot doing these floors right and let me show y'all i just got to show you all right so whoever did this floor last they deserve a prize because the wax that was embedded in this in this towel was so extensive just this little piece right here right oh from the wall to that reciprocal right there i had to scrub this like like five times i had to scribble like five times man and uh the stripper i'm using is this uh i got it from lowe's that's that's pretty much the only people that sell it locally um i could get it from granger but um this this stripper is like 39 bucks for the five gallons and uh grandeur has a five liter for like 180. so i'm a small businessman so i had to had to get the the next best thing but that's it right there i pretty much use i pretty much use the whole zip line of products man i use the whole zep9 products when it comes to floor care um and generally they're pretty good you just have these situations where when you get caked on caked on wax you know got to be at least like five or six coats of wax on this floor man on top of the dirt is it's gonna be a long night man right now it is 6 39 i'll probably be here to about 9 or 10. uh i'm gonna get as much as i can done this is a this is a three-day job uh today tomorrow and sunday so um you know i got a little time to kind of get my cus i got a little time to get everything together um so just want to share what i'm working with man what's going on everybody all right so uh i got let me show you i got that part over there done i had to scrub that like four times man literally four times uh so now i got this the stripper sitting on this piece and my game plan is to you know just do it do it in thirds boom boom and then boom um and i got i got that much stripper left over there right on my finger right there right there that much stripper left you know whatever's in here so that's probably gonna hold me over to to that part man because like i said um it's taking me a long time to get this wax up where we did this wax man i need to know what kind of wax that is or then again maybe i don't need to know um [Applause] all right y'all what's going on man um i'm in the truck about to go home i ran out of stripper and all of the places are closed right now so i'm just going home go give me some rest probably drink a couple brews hug on the wife uh shout out to o'shea uh put some lotion on her ankles and uh just come back and fight again tomorrow man [Music] sir what's up y'all back at it again man all right so man i did all that scrolled all that this is probably three three strip phases man but you still got one probably one thin coat of wax so i'm gonna scrub that let's go this part one more time and rinse and that should be it for this part all right y'all as you can see i'm scrubbing most of it but it's all still wax it's all wax right there the floor is relatively dry there's still a lot of wax on the floor so yeah get a little aggravated can't lie and then this wet vac thing keep coming off so i'm i'm constantly having to bend over to put these uh put those washers and connect them to those little holders and uh yeah it's getting aggravated man i'm um i've been at this for a minute it's a dead frog right there poor little dude dead frog um but yeah i'm getting pretty aggravated i can't lie because this mother what's going on y'all got some more stripper i'm getting out this room today man i still got to do some hauls so they gotta do some hauls and i still gotta do the car that's later on the day um i wanted to be laying wax down this morning that was the original game plan but this wax is so it's so crazy man there's so much wax it is so much wax so we're going to continue scrubbing the day see y'all outside [Music] so so [Music] you", "cXdxYFDZqO0": "hello and welcome to my youtube channel my name is shawana i am the creator and owner of sweet magnolia waxing company and in this video today we will be going through the steps of um setting up and getting everything ready to pour your waxes and your wax melts and in this video i will be showing you two different um two different methods of melting your wax so i have the presto pot and then i also have the method that when you first begin the boiling where you put a a big pot and then you would just put your porn picture over in there so i'll be showing you both of those different options um you can choose which one that you prefer and um i'll be showing you how i mix everything pour it in and get you all started to start making your own candle waxes so if you want to watch stay tuned i'll just let you see it so i have some wax in there already so basically i'm just going to add more and get my cup that i always use this is my handy dandy cup and i just swoop and this is the this is for the presto pot sometimes so that's that and if you wanted to do the other one basically you were just you would just take the same method put it in here and you will stick it in there like this so it's just in here so what you would do is you put it in the water you will boil it well my stove is not on right now you put it in here you would let it melt and then you would measure out how much you want how many other candles that you were making at that at that particular time um i make mine in small small batches because it's easier um so yeah that's that these are the two methods you have and i just poured it back in there so stay tuned i will show you the rest of it so we're gonna let this melt you just bring it over because what will happen is when you get ready to put your pot your picture underneath it and grab it and then you come out of it and then you turn it turn it off it's going to be something that's going to drip and you don't want that on your floor so yeah that's what i do and i'm going to let this it's going to take a while um a good 45 minutes i think so i'll come back on and i will show you how i get everything else so we're going to start by um we got our wax milk so this is the pot that i use and i'm boiling so i like to preheat mine and this is all right i want to do here is just check the temperature so i just go in here and check my temperature i want it at at least 180 that's where i want mine's in so basically you have to take all right so i have my product with the water so you have two different options um the first option is you use this pot and just a boiler method where you put a little water in the pot and then you will put your pouring pitcher in there and you put the wax and wax in there now basically i would just pour my wax how much ever i want and then i would do it that way um you have to have a utensil so to start you would have your temperature reader i don't have the gun yet but i'm actually going to get that one um that's my next step and then you will have your spatula i like this one because it's stainless steel and you can easily wipe it off and so that that's my stern uh when i put my oils and stuff in and then my scale this video i'm gonna use this because this is much easier it's already melted and i don't have to worry about it so let me just show you so you saw earlier where i had it it was all formed let me make sure that you can see that so now it's all liquefied and so basically you get your measurements together however much that is and so make sure the temperature is where it needs to be if you warm the pot i think it's way better because you don't want cold or the the pot to be at a certain and then you put some um the wax in the next thing you know the temperature goes down gradually so you don't move that and make sure you wipe the bottom before you put it on your scale and make sure that you tear your scale out when you get ready to um do this but i have another way that i do mine so i will let you know that i should do everything in my head um so this part weighs i'll just tell you i'm gonna pour whatever it's supposed to be um i will make sure i add 7.9 on to it because the fact that it's already showing that in there so yeah and i bring you back okay so i just want to show you guys how this work so you just pour it in here let me pour a little so you just pour very easy and then see how it drips afterwards that's what you don't want on here okay so i'll just put my scale here i want it at 20 there's 23. now when you put fragrance oil in here you can't put the oil back in so i haven't added anything i'm just starting so perfect 23.9 so i checked my temperature reading and i do that and it is right where i want it um to start putting in my fragrance or so today i will be using um this one and this is the one ounce so it smells very good that's what you would do you just i just put the whole thing in there so whatever measurements you have but you can use read the instructions on the bottom that says how much percentage to use and then i was just [Music] a trash bag like i just did right here um so that way you don't have to be running to the trash and i like to put all my things here because i don't want my house to smell like all these different fragrance so after i finish i just tie it up and then put it in the um in the trash so that's that now check my temperature see is where it's i'm sorry y'all live near airport okay it is a little bit it's right where i want it so bring you over and you would see how i pour so this is my pouring station i have everything already and i put mines in sevens so i don't know you can see it so seven seven seven so there's one ounce for each one of them um it's no perfect way to say this or even put this but sometimes it's hard when it's very clear to see because as some of you know i am visually impaired so it is very hard for me sometimes to see but i make no excuses and i do it anyway so sometimes you have spillage and even the best person with vision still will have that so hopefully this will give me seven and i'll just clean off everything else that had that sale on it get all that off of there don't forget don't be like me i did this and the whole thing came off so that's why i hold it at the bottom right here there you go make sure that you are wearing something that you do not care about getting sent on or wax on because at the end you'll see that sometimes you take apart the other things and oh it just goes everywhere finished product um some things are still cooling so i'll let you see here sorry i put my camping so this is the first one i started when you guys um was on when you saw it when i was pouring so this is the one i was pouring and see how it is now it is almost done almost done and what i would do is just close these up especially this one i would go ahead and close it up it's hard to do with one hand but i will close it up and then i'll still sit in here i don't move them because i don't want to move them because i'm very sure if they're still hot um even warm at the touch and so this is the second one i did off of the off camera and this is the third one i did and then this is one i just finished up now you see these are the different ones that i did some of them i probably won't you know that's just something that's not gonna work and then what i did do was i actually had some extra and so i put it there so that's another option um these these little silicone molds so yeah so if you like this video like comment and subscribe and if you want to see anything else you let me know and i can see if i can make that video for you um we are all here to help each
