{"Tj3aCrUwy64": "yes mad at Rafal studios and welcome to my review of the Herpa 5g dryer vaporizer i would like to thank the guys at Harrah's tech for setting up and sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more about this or there are many other products please visit Arras techcom now let's get started here's what comes inside the box with urbe 5g get in an instruction manual we also get a glass mouthpiece you get the USB ribbon charger a cleaning cord there's a little dab tool and of course the herb of 5g vaporizer itself very tiny little device now let's take a closer look at the herb for 5 G like I said this is a really really small vaporizer one of the smallest I've seen and has one single power button on the front and a LED light there's also the vents where the air flow through comes through for the chamber on the top we have the mouthpiece there it's a composite plastic mouthpiece and that is attached magnetically with a magnet on each side good strong magnets we have a pure ceramic chamber there all the way around ceramic chamber at the bottom we have micro USB charging port and then along the sides we have the little nipples or the little indentations there to help you get a grip really like that finish one thing I like about it is it includes this glass mouthpiece that's also magnetically attached mouthpiece simple glass mouthpiece with a metal plate on the bottom everything really tight and compact right at the top of the unit there ok so now we're going to test out the functions and features this device charges with micro USB and there's a light on the front indicates red while charging and it goes out when it's fully charged in our devices charged up and ready to go really super simple to operate this it's five clicks to cut it on and off and it has three different temperature settings that you change by just pressing one time so that's indicated by green as low medium is the medium blue and then the high is a light blue and we'll go over those temperatures in a second and you can see it heats really fast even if the highest setting there it was fully high within less than 30 seconds and you cut the device off with five clicks super easy okay so now I'm going to grind up some fresh herbs and this is some cannabis here we're going to test this out you always wanted to grind yours when you do a vaporizer to make sure you get a good even vaporization so I'm packing it up here one thing I find it a little bit difficult to pack this vaporizer the little hole and the chamber itself is really small and it's in sets a little bit a little bit tedious to get the cannabis down in there but it works fine and then the hits itself really really pure taste with this glass mouthpiece super impressed by the flavor and also really good puffs on it I'm testing it on the high setting which is 420 degrees not the highest that they go but it did a really good job of it as you can see that cannabis that came out was perfectly vaporized just toasted almond no green left in it and no scorching so really an excellent job there which brings us to the results in scoring pros are is really attractive and tangy little design it's got to pure ceramic oven with an airflow right at the top perfect configuration the glass mouthpiece is nice excellent performance on the herbs and it has three temperature settings 390 405 and 420 and he's really fast cons are it's kind of small battery and it's a little bit difficult to load but not taking that off it's a tiny device with a big punch five stars for the 5g dryer vaporizer really good

"youtube what is up cushy here and we have something i usually don't get we got a couple things i usually don't get uh we got the alera whoa quick hands we got the alera uh gelato today coming in at 73 [Music] 73.650 i'll get you guys a shot this whole back a bunch of mercene lurping terpene smurfing all that good stuff in it too but i always say everyone asks me what's my favorite strain i always say like hash haze that this this is my favorite string gelato i love it i always loved it i never had it from pa medical i never had anything they came out with rhythm came out the gelato wax it was the gelato flower is what it was make sure you hit that subscribe like and leave a comment you guys [ __ ] rock it was out in philly way or whatever we never got it we never seen it so yeah i'm truly excited to try this one uh i guess let's open her up and see if she's full so you just grab here i'm guessing sit straight out just so they when you get a handle at the bottom all right open her up just regular empty little box comes like uh the raw garden and the moxies it comes in the white tube you think it's gonna be full what do you think let's see a little head space i mean not crazy crazy amount but a little little head space i love a layer of cartridges because their air holes are at the bottom so you literally get every drop that's what's pretty cool about alera their cartridges are different than anybody's like grassroots but it's got the adjustable airflow the holes in it at least uh it is a blank blank there's no it's a good old no namer now if you have a pull battery throw this on there i don't think it works for some reason these only work with a click battery just so you know because that would suck to get home and that's all you have is a click battery and your script so i bought this just for florida just to take because i bought an alera ecto cooler i wasn't a big fan of it this one i don't know i mean it ain't bad but let's try it out taste that gelato instantly the battery definitely needs charged on this but oh i love gelato i love it i can't believe it actually tastes like i thought it was gonna taste oh man i love that flavor and i'm [ __ ] lit holy [ __ ] whoo it's caught me sweating my head off but i think you need to do away with the air holes alera i think you're sucking way too much air in way too much air i think you get a way better hit if you cover a couple of these holes because watch that's just a regular two second draw not much up two air holes two second draw this car makes you sweat wow another thing to draft some jordan 23 from uh pharmaceutical rx don't worry it was like 30 off almost 40 percent off is the only reason i bought it or i wouldn't buy i'm over the half grams but for what i paid for it and i love jordan's i grabbed it so this review is going to be coming up you guys [ __ ] rock we still got the one gram cartridge of actually this lost coast travel diesel uh we've got the one gram cartridge that is coming out uh terrapin cresco there's two primes i'm so behind for real i'm about to take a week a week off here like asap rocky you guys [ __ ] rock i love you subscribe like later", "JBmjI21BUPk": "hey y'all trevor here with threaded leaf and today we're going to be starting out with a uh full kit versus just the cartridge i'm really curious to see how ace valley has transitioned from flower to their concentrates this is going to be a gelato base strain for their sativa cartridge we've got a battery we've got a charger in here as well so we'll have a little bit more to talk about on this review i'll see you guys after the intro when we're getting going with the ace valley sativa vape starter kit cheese y'all let's get into it [Music] hey all and welcome back to the uh ace valley sativa 510 vape starter kit one hitter vape review so what we're going to be doing today is we're going to dive in and uh cover not only the cartridge but the battery in this starter kit as well i haven't had any of ace valley's concentrated cannabis products i've only grabbed their one sativa pre-rolls once which is a og melon and then a quite a few actually quite a few of the uh ace valley cbd which are a great white shark strain the misses have a the missus has a has a kind of a preference to that strain with it being a one-to-one as well really likes the effects that come on and the overall high that it has is quite enjoyable i must say myself yes especially being on that lighter side for thca dominance not thca just thc with that being said we are going to focus on the starter kit what we're going to do today for the review is i'm going to quickly cover the information that's on this box we're going to cover the information that's on the ace valley website we'll also be covering the battery information on there because they do have a separate tab for information on the battery so we're going to go in there and we're going to pull that information off as well so you guys can know exactly what the battery is going to be like the voltage anything along those lines because i do like providing that information and then we're going to go ahead and just get right into the review i'm not going to use the ace valley battery until after we have completed the full review with our vuber and our g pen so this is going to be kind of a two in one for you guys you're gonna get the standard cartridge review where we rock through all of our rips and then i talk about the high i give it the score for the overall and then after that we move into the battery i'll pull it through there i'll see if there's any changes see if there's any preference towards either the g pen or the vuber's experience with this battery or if it's just all on its own and then i'll let you guys know if the kit is worth a little bit of extra money that they typically are because they're about five to ten dollars more for the kit over the cartridge by itself but enough of me jabbing you guys let's get into this full review so the ace valley sativa vape 510 thread starter kit is going to be a gelato strain it has a thc total of 78.7 percent thc a cbd total of 0.1 it has a package date of november 16 2020 and a price of 46.99 now the description for the ace valley sativa 510 cartridge on the acevalley.com is going to be the ace valley sativa 510 cartridge is a 10 to 1 thc to cbd formulation based on the popular gelato strain which is known for its uplifting effects and sweet flavor and aroma best used with our 510 logo light rechargeable battery the taste profile for this cartridge is going to be earthy piney and lemongrass flavor and aroma the terpenes are merisinine pinene and carefully you get a pure cannabis distillate that's a huge advantage with this being a distillate based pen botanical terpenes for your flavors and a rechargeable battery now we are going to go over and give you guys the information on the battery the ace valley rechargeable 510 thread battery lights up at different levels as you hit it providing simple controls and delightful interaction best used with ace valley 510 cartridges the usb charger is included so with that you guys we have all the information that we need and that they're going to provide for us to get into this review i'm quite excited to see the overall outcome of this cartridge and kit combo you guys but let's actually get this review on the way let's not dilly-daddly today let's get into it cheers and uh garbage scale intro before we crack this box open and we start getting into the actual review you guys [Music] just cheers that the urban scale intros done we've got the intro the intro after i said the intro is done yeah it's definitely one of those days folks where my mind is just a little bit out there now first things first let's go ahead and take a look at the ace valley battery it's got that big v which i assume are going to be what lights it up it looks like it's going to be an auto draw yeah it will be a auto draw but the charger that they put out with it is actually quite a nice one in and of itself too a little bit of a different setup than you originally you typically see because i thought i had one handy here i thought i had a charger handy here but i must have it plugged in this is not the typical setup that you see but the fact that it sits upright is actually really nice and we're gonna plug that in right now to the laptop and let that get charging so we can start using that battery a little bit later in the review but for now we're gonna move into our cartridge watch the overall look and like this kind of like pastel beige very peachy color as well really impressed with um the look of this cartridge just by itself now yeah these this thc logo is not going to come off easily so we're not going to worry about it we're just going to go ahead screw this cartridge into our uber battery and start working our way through the score here the way we smoke our way through these two cartridges are we start out at the lowest temperature we work our way up to the medium temperature and then all the way up to the highest with our vuber our green is our lowest temperature blue is the medium red is the highest our g pen the only thing that's swapped is the blue and the green we start out on the blue side with the g pen then go green and finally red to finish it off after we take a hoot through each of the temperatures that these batteries have to offer we'll talk about it so you guys get to have a little bit of breaks through the six poles that we'll be doing through this car cartridge and then we'll add our hemper adapter and rocket through our rigs but uh we got a little ways to go first things first let's get through this uh cartridge on the vuber before we get into our rigs or talking about the high and the overall and um then moving into the ace valley battery in and of itself but uh cheers you guys let's dive into this gelato cartridge from ace valley very light experience not really overwhelming with the flavor extremely smooth inhale extremely smooth inhale i like i don't feel like i just took a rip off off of a cartridge and that's not something i typically have at least with the first one the first one usually my lungs go what the [ __ ] is this and then it settles in and it's like oh okay we're doing this it's okay but very smooth not extremely overwhelming with the flavor the little bit i'm getting is more of like a sweet biscuit style of flavor flavor instead of an actual really sweet citrusy or ripe gelato flavor that i would expect now that being said i have a feeling that the second temperature and the third are going to give us that more intense flavor because as this cartridge heats up and we get through it i have a feeling the flavor is going to get a little bit more rich a little bit more potent but uh let's go ahead and take our next haul you guys might know cheers okay now it's going with a kind of sweet flavor that frosted flakes has it doesn't have it's honestly you guys the best way to describe it it's like drinking the milk after having a bowl of frosted flakes where all that sugar is sitting in there and there's just that little bit and it's so sweet honestly let's step it up and level honestly with the the amount of sweet in there it's like drinking the last little bit of a frosted flake cereal bowl like the milk in the bottom when you use a milk to go because those [ __ ] are sweeter than regular milk for some reason i don't know why but it is yeah that with frosted flakes and it's a goddamn sugar color is what you're asking for that's what this tastes like you guys it's got that that creamy flavor that doesn't overwhelm doesn't really turn you off of any experience it's just nice and rich but but there is a slight citrus and sharp tone to the start of it that really has me excited to continue smoking through this cartridge i don't i don't think the flavor is going to be overwhelming for me to give it a really high score i think it's going to be intriguing enough that i ripped through the cartridge trying to find that flavor and i don't know if i like the cartridges that intrigue me and entice me to do that more so than the cartridges that are just nice and potent in flavor but let's see what the highest temperature can do through our uber you guys before we uh move on into our g pen and give it a score okay guys extremely smooth cartridge to smoke through that uber you know what i want to wait until we take this first haul through the g pen because as the temperatures increased the flavor got richer and i'm curious to see if it's an airflow or a temperature setting because at the lowest setting if we have matching flavors with the highest setting on the uber battery but the intensity is way higher with the g pen it's an airflow issue and the cartridge is just getting just getting up temp getting up to snuff but if the flavor is no different than the vuber it's not an airflow issue it's a cartridge and strain and actually this is where the effect is coming from versus the batteries having a difference so with that being said see if the g pen has a uh different experience and overall flavor than the vuber did before we give it a score out of a 10. cheers okay we're on the lowest tab let's just make sure that we're doing it right i'm gonna give it a seven 70 guys it's not airflow i can tell you right now it's not airflow that first it hit it had decent flavor decent intensity but it didn't have [Music] anything more than the vubra had to offer very similar to the first experience without uber light definitely more of that biscuit cookie rich ness to it but it doesn't go as far as that creamy experience i had with the second temperature curious if that's going to become something for me to play with a little bit uh deeper into this but i'm not gonna find out until i actually go ahead and smoke and we've got that second setting set aside and ready to go let's take this rip move on through you guys so we can score the g pen and get all of our rips in today cheers this is matching par for par with that uber you guys creamy a little bit of that citrus bite to it but still that knock to go frosted place to flakes experience at the second we'll see if the third carries through along those lines because honestly you guys this cartridge is just consistent huge huge points go for consistency it's not going to be anything super high scoring but it is a nice experience and it is fun to sit down smoke a pretty even and consistently enjoyable bud you guys but for the time being let's go ahead take another rep and get going cheers okay guys a little bit different on the end there it just continued off with a little bit more of that sweeter richer flavor of that kind of frosted flakes and milk combo that i had the last few times with that medium to higher side on this cartridge so all in all really enjoyed it seven is going to be what it gets through the g pen it doesn't really have anything exciting anything overwhelming it's just all in all an alright cartridge to sit down and smoke but it's nothing to get you excited or really ramped up about for now though we're gonna sit down and uh smash out our rigs and see what we have to offer through that little bit of water filtration because this can really affect the bud sometimes it can really change how these uh cartridges smoke and taste so let's see if that little added humidity little added water plays a factor on this cartridge today you guys now we've got six rips to work through after three i'll stop and talk with you the only difference between what we do now and what we did before is we preheat on that last one because we haven't done it until now so we might as well do it this time cheers breathe that last one cheers okay guys so honestly the citrus push that i got through that glass wasn't something i was expecting wasn't something i was really looking to experience it just all in all had a nice citrus almost acidic kind of a push for the flavor and it really did develop quite well and it it held a really nice even flavor throughout and uh i've gotta gotta tip my hat to it you guys it's it's quite enjoyable and quite impressive through and through with that um overall intensity and effect that um it had to offer that flavor now the g pen can offer the same thing we're gonna start slowly slowly we're gonna slowly start earning those points back to potentially hit a beautiful garbage on this cart but uh for now we got to see how the g pen and the 420 rig do cheers guys let's dive into this okay guys so for the rigs i am going to give it a 9 out of 10 for its flavor it has a really nice and even experience that comes through the rig it doesn't transition that much it doesn't change up uh a crazy amount it kind of finds its lane and sticks to it which is going to be that kind of a slurpy experience where it's got that kind of sharpness to it when you're uh when you're smoking on it just because that acidity like if you get a lemonade or a ginger ale or anything where it's got that little bit of a bite to it or even that tartness to it that was what i was getting through here that adding of the water definitely enrichened and heightened the overall experience that this cartridge had to offer and it took everything that i was just getting hints and nudges of with the individual vaporizers and just dominated it and really pushed it forward and put it to the forefront of the experience and i gotta i gotta give it the respect that it deserves for that it it rid really really did well through the rigs for the presentation of the flavor and the overall smoothness of the smoke to match with that kind of sharp flavor well done on that side now when it comes to the high the high is going to drop down and get a seven like the batteries did on their own the biggest reason for that is it doesn't hit as intensely as i would like it to after a dozen of these rips i should be feeling this cartridge quite a bit i ha i am finding that i'm having to search for it a little bit the uh the mental high that creative ease that kind of uplift that i'm having and experiencing is quite enjoyable quite nice now it's not gonna be as potent or as heavy as i would like it to be when it comes to a concentrate like when i get that heavy head rush i want it to hit heavy i want it to hold and then i want it to ease away i don't want it to just come in and just kind of creep its way in and sit there and it's just kind of almost like an unnerving sense when it's building up and creeping up like that but once it gets to the full intensity i can enjoy it just that that mental ease i wanted to hit fast and hold or not come at all because i don't like that creeping up that creeping mental ease just it's not an enjoyable experience for me overall and that's the biggest reason why seven's the best it's gonna happen it's got that excitement it's got that uplifting it's got the creative ease but the ability for it to hit heavy enough to really leave me an enjoyable high isn't there so with the seven it ends up getting a 30 out of 40 which is a really good score for this uh cartridge a really good score for uh for how it did now the question is how is the battery going to hold up in comparison to the uber and the g pad looks like it's going to be an auto draw it's charged up let's go ahead and take our first haul and see what we have to experience to this that was a blinker and as you work your way up through this cartridge you get different settings of light you get blue you get the green you get the red and then you get the yellow at the very top overall experience very similar to what i was getting through i would say the uber because the airflow this has relatively restrictive ports i think it's going to taste better with the cartridges that match up with the boober more so then the g-pad but with that you guys we're gonna wrap up this video hope you guys enjoyed hope you guys are looking forward to the one tomorrow why now why when i'm wrapping up a video do i get a cough attack kitty i don't know but i think we got composure folks i think we got all all of our poop in a group but tomorrow what are we diving into tomorrow we've got that cafe racer from

the ace valley vape cart review worth picking up one of these you guys like the auto draw battery style i would absolutely recommend it there aren't too many of those on the market anymore but with that being said if you do not like that auto draw style the cartridge isn't really the selling point enough for me at least to want to go and buy this kit just to get that cartridge but with the uh full review here you guys could be the judge definitely let me know if you're thinking about it but for the time being cheers hope you guys enjoy end guard's going to slide in up in the corner is

stoners and chuggers welcome back smoking with small town back at it again today is a cartridge review and a beer review we got a two-part review today before we get to the cartridge let me show you the beer real quick I know a lot of people don't like Budweiser but I do drink it and they had these nitro reserve goals and supposedly you're supposed to shake it three times open it in a hard pour and then wait I don't know I just want to see what the difference is between this is regular Budweiser I'll let you guys know if it's worth this [ __ ] it's even worth buying or what it's all about yeah it says right here you're supposed to tilt it three times open it and a hard fall so I don't know if this cup is big enough but it's the biggest one I got so cheers everybody oh and my channel is for adults so little kids back on up and if you haven't subscribe hit that like button and subscribe right damn now alright so it goes one two three open cardboard what the hell this [ __ ] looks weird you guys see that look good it's what the hell I've never seen anything like that you're supposed to wait for it so I'm gonna wait for it and then drink it okay well we're ready for that okay we got the first time trying select select elite live enhanced live resin this one here is an indica it is the gelato and it is coming to you at a 85% on the THC and this is a food gram I have took it out of the box already because I wanted to get pictures for my Instagram so here's the cart it's got the select in the front California these tips are clear the plastic I kind of not into that I like the ceramic ones better myself but this is the first time trying to select so we will see and it does have too much Headroom for me like it's missing quite a bit at the tip right here so that automatically I do not like and I got my battery here it's fully charged give this a go I think this is a C cell battery it is a C cell so and this is libel resin and this is the gelato so first time trying to select cheers everybody hope you guys having a great day staying baked all that good [ __ ] so let's get a rip flavor not bad it was smooth and then but it did choke me out like it was strong I gotta say just off first like first hit I'm gonna have to say that I like to select better than I like the Ursa cart that I just smoked recently on that B hasn't if you ever guys haven't seen that review and check it out already posted it it taste like a gelato it's pretty smooth and it's got some nice kick to it so let's see what's up with this beer as nitro beer smells nothing different smells like normal Budweiser it's a little darker than normal Budweiser quite a bit darker actually you can see it yeah it's pretty dark it's got like an amber color to it almost all right let's get a drink it tastes like like beer on tap coming up I'd say yeah it's time to me it tastes kind of flat I guess that's because it's not carbonated I don't know if I had to choose that have that normal Budweiser I think I'd go to normal Budweiser let me get a couple more drinks in but first initial taste it's kind of flat and it tastes like a like a not very good IPA or a lager like I don't know I don't like it it's very light it's not strong or heavy tastes very yeah it's not good so far [Music] so select I like to try different companies I've already done raw garden and they've done la cuz I don't know I done Moxie selected one I haven't tried yet or friendly farmers how will be trying those soon Elite live enhanced live resin gelato in Dakota 85% on the bottom they have this like this label they're supposed to take off and put on your cart but I think that's lame and I'm not gonna add anything extra to my damn car they should put it on there already they wanted to dominate I'm not gonna edit I refuse uh-huh I really like this battery to it uh I know there's all kinds of craziness going on in the world right now and I try to stay keep that stuff off my channel it'd be kind of lame if I didn't address it at least though I'm not gonna go too far into all that stuff I just I don't agree with it I think that police brutality and all that [ __ ] is ridiculous racism still is in this world and I wish that everybody could just take a bong load and have a beer and kick it with me and be do but I guess it's just not the way the rest of the world things so wish everybody would get their head out of their ass and get with the program and do like me and B do coexist awesomeness bestfriend shape so cheers everybody hope you guys are staying safe out there and have a great day yeah it tastes like an on tap beer not I'm not liking it at all to me I'd rather just do this and get abnormal Budweiser cracker open and get a guzzle that's not all familiar flavor I know a lot of people don't like you but alright [ __ ] dude I'm used to it anybody like these [ __ ] like these went to a birthday party the other day my girlfriend's daughter shoutout babe she's just turned eight and then and these were in the pinatas so I like these damn thing they taste good all right let's get another hidden before I get the review oh and I did do the like the bubble test you turn it upside down and it's very slow doesn't really move very slow bubbles normally it does it just takes a while takes a while so I don't know seems legit I got from the dispensary I shot out the blue fire Merced California they got awesome bud tenders and great selection they've been pretty packed lately though it's hard to get in that my locker they don't got no parking no parking in there at all all right considering flavor smoothing this price and Highness flavors great smoothness is there it wasn't that they need that expensive yeah and they do get you lit it did have a little bit of headroom like I said that was one of the knocks on it and I do not like the clear tips I wish there were ceramic tips but those are the only two knocks on it did get me really loaded so I'm gonna have to get it the 72 I recommend trying out select and you guys haven't tried not yet so and that beer horrible unless you guys like flat tasting [ __ ] beer then yeah I do not recommend getting the Budweiser nitro reserved gold I think they [ __ ] suck and this 72 what it do I really like it hope you guys enjoyed the review hope you guys are staying baked until next time smoking with small town [Music]", "C0I-fw0LvPM": "what's up YouTube welcome back extinct 420 here with another medical marijuana review got my new uniform today that's what took me so long to put out this next video yo your school shirt it's gonna be my new uniform for all my videos I might get another one I'll put the link in the description just the case you guys want one today we're checking out some of the cheapest the best vape pens you could get on the market right now coming from Liberty Health Sciences that's gonna be the THC count on that and then on this one this is gonna be a jack hair it's pretty good stuff I'm smoking on this you spin here I've had these a couple days so this is gonna be the gelato mmm tastes it tastes delicious these are the reason I say these are the cheapest is because these are $35 for 400 milligrams of THC and a lot of people they are misconstrued about how they sell them and whatnot dispensaries usually sell them by the milligram counts and not like half gram or grams like you see all these street cartridges have in Liberty Health Sciences is selling these which have 400 milligrams THC for 35 compared to true leave that it would be 47 for 350 or cure leaf which is they get a hundred and fifty for 18 or even move which has 250 for 35 or sir Terra which has 250 for 35 but that has a disposable pen with it this you have to have your own little vape pen I got this is for free from a friend of mine Wow it's killer right there mm-hmm you could check out the app hmm the oil in that stuff nice golden color it doesn't move you can hold it upside down for as long as you want it'll move eventually but all these cart Street carts are ugly and brown all right we're gonna try this Jack Harry this one's unopened this is what a car looks like fresh out of the pack 400 milligrams THC like I said this one it's got like a fruity taste this gelato got that delicious oh man alright we gonna try this Jack hare I didn't even tried this yet I had the flower in my last video it was pretty good I actually still have a butt of that left I'm saving it you know special occasion not so special occasion just saving it alright I'm already ripped you off that [ __ ] gelato you know I'm tell y'all what this does cuz I'm ripped definitely not like uh that one's like a citrusy taste that gelato this one has more of a berry taste man I'm ripped y'all the first batch I got which is this gelato had 75% THC the second batch 87% THC so I mean they're both really good yeah so there you have it guys these are definitely the best bang for your buck if you're going for any kind of dispensary cartridges in Florida I mean you could pay I mean yeah these people on the streets and say that oh I could get a gram for 40 or 50 but that's like of like Eric Conn says some hot dog water or something I mean hot dog water probably be better for you but I mean it's not that expensive look you off y'all get invest in your in your card which cost two hundred and seventy eight dollars and then you can get the $78 discount earth no $75 discount on $150 so I got five of these cartridges for $100 so that's that's two and a half grams for 100 bucks compared to these fake-ass half grams y'all get big-ass grams y'all getting for full 50 or 40 or whatever and this is real legit delicious dispensary lab tested quality stuff that's just you know my opinion my channel is here for people who are curious about getting their card and don't want to get ripped off or waste their money and don't know what they're getting because like you would like to see what they get before they buy it and none of these dispensaries show you any flour or any any cartridges that you can't taste it at the dispensary so that's what I'm here for guys but I'm gonna get off here I'm gonna smoke this Luke's tendo right here that's coming up next I mean I'm ripped but I like to smoke so I mean we don't get it and here check out the shirt y'all want it I'm gonna leave a link in the description thanks guys catch y'all next time", "wwLFNAGRECk": "[Music] l will make the beat down welcome to my channel welcome to this hippie headband channel this is a channel where we review carts and we review beat moments now before anything I want to start by saying thank you so much for taking this time out of your day to come watch this video thank you so much now today we got a little special product for you guys last video I did a little dancreep review purple punch not gonna lie to you change it changed my perspective on take beeps was not bad at all but now today you know we came in we came through with another dispensary [ __ ] I got two products for you guys today but I'm only gonna be reviewing one we got the new kingpins this is the Skywalker og which is an indica this is the gelato which is a hybrid now these are the new newest newest boxes so before I open this up I'm gonna show you guys how to make sure that you know if you get these new boxes and how not to get scammed so with these new boxes [Music] instead of having the seal that was more of you know it was it was kind of patched on this is fully printed on so this is on here you can't scratch that off for nothing like this this is on the actual box it still has all the same information it still has the manufacturer date the best body the batch number everything like that you know I'm saying and of course ingredients just cannabis oil and then of course one second draw is a single-serving you know they always say that but you know for today let's try out this gelato so today we're gonna be trying out this gelato kingpin next time why have the Skywalk OG the reason why don't want to do the Skywalker og just just as yet I had the Skywalker og strain and man oh man it is a night night hitter like the Skywalk OG is very strong in - that's the thing was trying to have you do it just it just have you all types are completely gone so let me start right here by Samuel it says on here this is July - of course a thousand milligrams the THC amount is seventy seven point 38 percent total THC is seven hundred and seventy-three point seventy six milligrams there's zero point thirty percent CVD and it's 2.99 excuse milligrams of CVD so push I already know C so don't judge me we're using a plastic knife today to open these up yeah sorry for that that didn't work so we're doing the crackhead way the only choices now if y'all haven't have this tool you need to use this please don't use this tool I done damaged up the box oh yeah I forgot whole sides both sides both sides now a lot of people was saying that with the kingpins you can get the stickers online don't be real with you for you to try to take this thicker Zoff as you can see watch I'm trying to take a sticker off and show you guys you can tell if it's tampered with you see how dingy and everything on top of that looks already so you can put like no and look I've ripped it off and you see what happened the whole bottom came on you bro you you know what you didn't when you know what you're getting this very very hard to do it with that look and I rip off the other side look what happened same thing with the other side you can't just rip you know rip them apart put a new one in there these kingpins are different they're different I mess with them heavy heavy heavy oh okay okay with these new boxes they went back with the regular black of course got the insert [Music] [Applause] [Music] got that my stinker there it is right there as you guys can see of course has the grommet of course has the grommet on each side just take off the holes take off the top let's take off the bottom this one no leakage at all I mean the last one was months and months and months old I live on the East Coast so to ship it and whatever it's been stored it kind of makes sense that it was a little bit of leakage so you know for that last King and it kind of makes sense with no leakage at all for this which should be expected the fact that it only has been manufactured about a month ago and other thing about the king pins where I don't know if you guys could really see but what the king pins being on here there's an actual physical reflection that's all in the back of it that reflects everything that says gonna sit on it so on the back of it it basically has the exact same thing as this kingpin is it has the kingpin man what is right honest so of course as usual we're using the yoke and mini today fully fully fully fully charged today for this video have a whole day rest in peace - Dex screw this all I [Music] [Music] [Music] already know kingpin oil is so thick so big so thick all right let's get to it let's get to it person oh what's the justice real quick let's give this a fool I remember with this review we reviewed three things we review the color taste and how medicated they get you but of course that says reach full its peace right now I can't I can't I can't pinpoint an exact taste but I said this again [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm sorry for that oh [ __ ] oh wait that just felt like my ancestors came back and slept this [ __ ] out of me for every wrong thing I just did what the [ __ ] gotta take this drink of this Depot ooh oh man let's take another three-second hit again [Music] so I mess up with this heavy and this is a hybrid - I'm messing with this heavy heavy but you guys already know always give you guys a 15 minute prelude to tell you guys the effects so that's what I'm gonna do we don't take one more hit right now and at this I'm I'm a class back in with you guys and tell you guys the effects what's up I'm clocking back in with you guys you know I'm saying it's been more than this move 115 minutes actually made of this video already looked at it I didn't like it so let's do our ratings taste I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact that I don't have like actual gelato tastes but I will say one out of five which is gonna be a ruby it's definitely only a three at the highest three entire three second we're gonna get to the color really nice color [Music] [Music] nice honey-colored so I would give that a fire of course and last but not least it's actually a really good balance of a hybrid - this is so for that I would definitely campaign so thank you for staying tuned for everyone that stayed tuned for this home time video and watch this video I appreciate you guys tenfold it's been hard to get a lot of these premium products that you see me getting now but I'm trying hard for you - I'm really trying hard you know I'm saying I get a lot of negativity and I'm not ever gonna respond to it I'm sorry because there's a lot of things people don't know what's going on in my life one time one last thing you find me

formulation is averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids that's almost double from our previous batches hang on charlie i don't think they heard that right play it again for the people in the back averaging about 90 cbd and 95 total cannabinoids yeah you heard that right our team was able to create a high potency formulation that is a single source true full spectrum crystal resistant distillate with live cannabis terpenes this means that our oil is naturally distilled from the plant and not some concoction of isolated compounds thrown together in a lab like almost all cbd isolate-based vape pens we are also able to leave as much thc in there as we legally can around 0.25 since we are big believers in the benefits of full spectrum oils cbd distillate usually starts to crystallize when the oil reaches 60 potency and beyond because of its molecular structure however we figured out a way to naturally maintain the distillate in its oil form without adding any artificial ingredients or cutting agents like mct or vitamin e finally we introduce real cannabis derived terpenes extracted from freshly frozen cannabis plants in their live state pre-harvest and cure giving our vapes a true-to-plant taste and authentic farm-fresh cannabis experience i have with me here today two of our newest full-spectrum cbd vape pens white fire og and gelato 33. that

vape cartridge operation busted in Kenosha County investigators say they saved about a half a million and a half dollars of illegal drugs our Hanna Jewell is live with what's been found so far and how this all started with somebody's worried parents yes is this one of the largest drug operations you've had in Kenosha I don't think it was but of this type it's the largest we've ever had and as far as I know it's probably one of the largest in the country Kenosha County Sheriff David beth says the THC vape cartridge operation was being run out of a house and paddock Lake and a condo in Bristol Beth says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your kids six deaths have been blamed on vaping nationwide many more injuries federal investigators are stepping in here now to see if any of those cases are linked to this case here reporting live in Kenosha Hanna Jewell Fox 6 News", "7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's

guys man and if you guys haven't added the snapchat or the instagram go ahead and do so i will leave all the information down in the description box below but other than that guys i've been pretty good myself um just got back from my dispensaries so so today i ended up picking up a platinum vape guys this is like one of the one that stands it out um it's the first time i've seen them in my dispensaries so i really you know i definitely had to try it out so i've never seen these around before um so if you guys ever had one of these let me know what you guys think about it it's like i said the packaging really caught my attention how it has a little cali you know little logo cut out right there and uh it's pretty dope so i ended up getting the gelato this one's around this cartridge is around 90 so it's one of the reasons i got it and gelato strain is always good you know they're always good they taste good and um so this cartridge was made like about last month or two the good thing about the boxes um it shows you the flavor on it it says it's earthy it's citrusy and it's sweet and it's known for relaxed happy creative uplifted energetic that's pretty dope you know shows the details on the box and stuff like that not that many boxes show that so that's pretty dope so i haven't smoked all day so like i'm just like trying to get high man it's like it's like 12 in the afternoon so it's kind of my waking break you know for my first time so there's ways to open it in the box but you know some some people just like to show the [ __ ] box open i'm always shredding my boxes open man they're supposed to be child proof and sometimes i can't open them by themselves so here we have a tube guys if like i said if you guys ever had the platinum vapes before let me know if you guys enjoyed it you know the price is pretty good on these cartridges honestly i paid like 31 it was 30 dollars flat but with like a dollar tax i think so that's pretty that's pretty cheap for a cartridge no i i don't i don't mind whether it's live resin or distillate you know before all this live resin it was just this is like cartridges and you know i don't mind smoking distillate it gets you high as [ __ ] and it's just it tastes good some people are like ah this list not good but you know i'll smoke this a little i smoke like resin it doesn't matter as long as it's good it tastes good that's all that that shouldn't matter so so this one's a gelato cartridge um i'm gonna go ahead and dry it just see if there's like some flavors in there or some [ __ ] honestly you don't you just get like a little taste to it flip ultra honestly this battery is hella good right now i've been using this um flip ultra for like the past couple weeks and it's been really good you know i had gone this better like a couple months ago and it's a pretty good battery you know it's a flip battery you know you can put it in your pocket and it has a lock on it so it won't [ __ ] flip open in your pocket and break so that's pretty good you know so here we have like so here we have the cartridge guys give you guys a close-up on that as you guys can see the little sticker the california logo sticker it's legit i'm just gonna go ahead and flip it over just to show you guys the quality on it gotta be thick you know i can't be running you guys know that and uh so here we have the battery i'm just gonna screw it on here try and get baked right now man i'm gonna hit the [ __ ] out of this pen so here we have the pan guys and um that's pretty dope though like once you connect it it shows you like the little posts so far on this battery i have 575 puffs so far that's like five cartridges ran to that [ __ ] so other than that guys hopefully you guys are smoking along with me i'm about to get hot as [ __ ] right now so cheers guys i'm gonna let you know i'm gonna let you guys know what this tastes like these batteries hit oh [ __ ] honestly these cartridges are pretty good you know they taste really really clean you know i didn't think they were gonna be as good just the simple fact that they were like 30 bucks you know i thought they're gonna be like 40 so that's crazy it tastes really really clean you know like on the packaging it says it tastes so on the packaging it says it tastes earthy citrus and sweet it's what it says back there i don't know if you guys can see but honestly that's what it tastes like it does taste really sweet and it does taste earthy so to be honest you don't really get like a citrusy flavor it just tastes really clean like an earthy flavor to it so it's pretty good you know i'm gonna go ahead and rip it some more big clouds right i don't know i don't know about you guys but the tip on these cartridges i really love those tips you know those round tips it just makes the cartridge more appealing and they hit way better i don't know that's just my opinion let me know what you guys think about that but i'm trying not to cough right now this cartridge is like 90 you know i'm just trying to hold my coffin i want to start coughing and [ __ ] off my bed on the videos you know it's just my schedule's kind of [ __ ] up right now but i'm still trying my best to bring out some more videos for you guys and uh like i said if you guys have it out of the snapchat go ahead and do so i'm more active on instagram and snapchat but if you guys would like to add both go ahead and do so but just has me going you know she has me high as [ __ ] already and i just took two hits it's around 12 in the afternoon so you know it got me feeling pretty good so and the reason i really like [ __ ] with distiller is just that some distillery cartridges have more thc in them than what a live resin would have like i was looking at cartridges right now my dispensary and most discs to the cartridges they range from like 80 to the high 90s you know compared to a light resin which which ranges from like the low 70s to high 80s you know it's kind of hard to find the live resin with like 90 in it you know i'm still on the lookout for those but other than that yeah there's like a [ __ ] little dish of the cartridges at my shop there's a lot of live resin but i never knock off distally you know there's people that say uh distill is bad but you know it's pretty good you know it depends on the cartridge you guys get and you know there's some cartridge to be honest there's there is some distilled cartridges that are not good i just give you a headache and it tastes like [ __ ] like fake this or like cheap you know but there's just some distillates that you know some companies really do spend their time to make them a little better and they are pretty good so you just got to go ahead and you just got to go ahead and you know start trying new brands that's what i do so like this was my first time trying the platinum vapes and i'm really enjoying it you know it gots me going cheers guys and this battery also if you guys would like to if you guys would like to purchase this battery i'm gonna go ahead and leave the information down in the description box so you guys go ahead and check it out it's pretty dope you know it's a flip battery and also comes with the little lock so you can't open it so like if it's in your pocket you're up and down at work it's not going to open and break up on you which has happened to me before and it's not good so it's dope it turns on automatically as you guys can see so that's one of my favorite cartridge batteries that i'm using right now selenius but other than that guys um i'm gonna be having some more hotbox videos soon for you guys i know i've been lacking on those two so oh [ __ ] i got the ac pumping right now this thing has me sweating man and as you guys can see it says 90 thc hopefully you guys can see that cartridge is really good so if you guys ever see these in this in the store go ahead and purchase one you know they're really good and for the price i paid 30 dollars flat for this [ __ ] guys and that's that's a good thing about living in california you know right here where i'm from in modesto california everything's cheap like a top shelf eighth is like 25 bucks if you want like an exotic uh if you want like an exotic eighth it's like 30 to 40 dollars max you know you know it's pretty dope you know but if you guys enjoy videos like this give

a quick little review on the Himalaya get yourself up there high in the mountains all right that's core beats to see spot thank you for watching peace", "FSI-zShYMk0": "hey guys Breanna here bringing you your first how-to video from a PC so we have had a lot of inquiries from you guys on how to initially set up your vape pen for the first time so today I'm gonna demonstrate that for you so when you get your delivery it'll come in a prescription bag that looks something like this and inside you should have a battery that'll come in a package like this and a cannabis cartridge of some sort which will be like this when you remove your battery from the packaging you will find two parts one will be this top part which is actually how you charge your battery and this bottom skinny part is going to be your actual vape battery so you'll go ahead and unscrew these two and your battery comes already with a fourth of charge so that way you can enjoy it immediately upon getting it at this point you should be ready to open up your cannabis cartridge and you will find it to look something like this every cannabis cartridge is going to have security coverings on it for safety reasons at this point you should have removed the safety covering on the bottom as well as your charger from the top and now we're ready to connect these you will just screw it in and you're probably curious how do you turn it on so there's this power button right here and it's important to remember that you will always click it five times when you want to turn it on or when you want to turn it off so 1 2 3 4 5 and when you see it light up like that you know you're ready to officially start vaping so you will put it up to your mouth and you will hold this button down wow you inhale and there you have it that's how you set up your vape pen for the first time so after you've been using your vape pen for a while you're gonna have to charge it and that's where this piece comes in handy you will go ahead and screw it in and then you can charge it by plugging it in to your average computer or into a cell phone block you might have lying around as always with any of your cannabis related questions it's as easy as a PC", "dNHdi2X0Pwg": "oh it's the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary we help you determine which products at that fine-fine dispensary of yours are actually worth your money and what you should leave behind and today we are taking a look at another pseudo cartridge a cartridge review here on weeds but a very different kind of cartridge one that I've never experienced before and one that I'm very excited to share with you and today we are taking a look at doe cysts and their dos pen the Bliss model I guess you would call it so this is a much weirder project our product than we've seen before this is a cartridge and pen all in one is does not require an extra 510 battery the cartridge is built into the battery so the whole thing is designed to be disposable we've got this little pen here that says it's 50 doses meaning 50 inhalations and then you dispose the whole thing you don't have an extra battery that you have to worry about you just pick this up and you're good to go and presumably it's already charged and has enough battery to last all 50 doses um so let's take a look at the packaging first thing here really really a neat packaging I mean it's like this flat cardboard box and with a nice little lift tear here thing there to get the pen out it has a wonderful lots and lots of information on it tells you there THC and terpenes breakdown and CBD breakdown just really really cool packaging and cool information presented now you can see that this is a roughly equates to a half gram cartridge and it was 40 bucks so not a terrible price for something that has the battery built in in addition to having you know 50 doses as they say this is the Bliss flavored which I was told this basically like comes from their Jack Herer strain bliss by dosis as they say on the back combines the best of the plants uplifting cannabinoids and turkeys into one a targeted formula the DOS pen delivers a precise dose working with your endocannabinoid system to help you feel just the right amount of good the first complete solution in cannabis and then on the back also there are the directions on how to actually use this instructions for use for a single dose inhaled the pen until the in inhale until pen vibrates the doses suggest limiting intakes to three doses per hour okay let's go ahead and open it up see how easy this package is and get a couple hits off of it and then of course the way our cartridge reviews work is we give you the whole experience I'm going to take a couple of hits here let you know how it hits how it tastes all that good stuff and then I'll actually come back to you at the end after the cartridge is completely used up and giving my whole thoughts oh wow okay cool and on the back here you can even see after you open it up it gives you even more instructions that I really quite like it says useful tips for enjoying a moment of bliss a hum smile celebrate with a dance practice laughing enjoy it has recycling instructions it has tips for the right dosage and how to use the dose pen just a really bunch of really cool information and really interestingly designed package very nice and then it goes and you tear again to actually get into the pen which is right here it's just delivering health and happiness so let's pop this pen out maybe possibly there we go okay so how to use this dose pen inhale using the mouthpiece the mouthpiece is located at the end of the device directly above the reservoir window inhale at a normal rate and void avoid inhaling aggressively inhaling at a normal rate will deliver a two and a half to two to two point two five milligram dose stop inhaling when the pen vibrates and then it also suggests that being an experienced cannabis user I should do three doses an hour so I guess this is the window of your uh let's give it an inhalation oh wow excuse me and one more because I'm an experienced cannabis user what an intern what an interesting little pen it absolutely works it worked flawlessly actually I was doubtful that when I was first inhale I was like is this thing really gonna work what is this thing and then sure enough the vapor comes in and let's be very clear that was incredibly low that was tasted incredible love the way it tasted amazing and it hit so smooth and more my coughing that's on me not on them I'm just bad at it um but Wow I really really like the taste and I really really like how smoothly that hits on that little vibration feature so neat I'm going to not take their recommended dosage and go and do another one of these yeah and then that vibration when it hits is it perfectly encapsulated a little perfect dose I am really impressed with this as a package I'm feeling great right now um feeling uh pretty high as bad as high as I would want to feel from a pen so far this is a fun little package I like this quite a bit but I'm concerned it's going to end up being worth the money at 40 bucks I've done four out of my 50 doses already so almost 10% of the way through this little pen but in terms of like disposability in terms portability in terms of just grab and go and not to worry about batteries and charging this is a neat little product I I have I have an affinity for this site there's their instant this and there's definitely a market for something like this that has just grab and go open up this cartridge open this packaging in Europe you're set and you're ready to you know take this to the beach you're ready to take this on a cross-country trip you know it's really interesting need product I'm gonna do one more of these get 10% of the way through it and then guys I will come back to you in well however long it takes me to get through this whole thing which might only be a day or two if that and then I'll come back to you and give you all my wrap-up thoughts so thank you for watching weeks guys we will see you in just a bit peace hi guys I am back and I am here to talk about bliss gnosis dosed pen here we are a little zoom in or focus there so this little feminine-hygiene looking product here um I've got some real feelings about I got some real things to say about this little guy overall I would say my impression is quite positive I think I like this thing quite a bit in several ways I love how discreet it is I I like the technology that's packed into it it's it's it's really cool aids just grab and go you don't to worry about anything else you just open up the package and you've got this thing ready to go don't need a lighter don't need a battery you don't need anything you just take it inhale it and go it's wonderful but the thing that I am worried about is the value proposition I'm not sure that this is the product to go for if you are a heavy smoker or if you have a high tolerance I just don't think it's going to get you your best value this was 40 bucks I believe yeah I think it was $40 and I didn't count the actual number of doses it gave me the 3 second hits but it was somewhere right around 50 maybe a little more I'm not sure if it's calibrated to exactly 50 but that's it just wasn't quite enough in terms of value for me and compared to other cartridges I mean like the 3 second hits we hit pretty well they're they're not bad they're not you know it's not a bad product in terms of potency but just with that few number of draws and I like to take a longer than a 3 second draw it just wasn't perfect for me that being said I still like this I still think it's a cool package if you are a casual smoker if you want to get your mom and dad on to smoking something if you want to introduce you know weed to somebody if you're gonna do weed for the first time this this is perfect this is this is true I think a perfect invention for somebody who smokes very infrequently somebody smoking the first time it's just it's it's calibrated so well it's so simple and there's so little to it you know you don't even feel it when it when it when you do the little inhalation but now it's this little plastic deadweight a kid and he'll anything else I can't tell if it's actually you can't really tell there's a little tank there but you can't see if it's really out of juice but at this point assumedly this is just trash this is this bliss pen is just trash here um so ultimately I am gonna say I liked it and I do recommend it with as long as you fall under one of those categories you know you're an infrequent smoker you don't have very high tolerance you're just doing toothpick on occasion consider this for sure this is really neat and I like the taste of it a lot I like the potency of a lot it's just on the value proposition or for your your high tolerance or frequent smokers it's probably going to be too expensive and it's not gonna be enough of a draw for you but for everybody else give one of these a shot these are really impressive little pieces of technology I think again I'm almost just as much impressed with it as a piece of tech as I am a thing to get high with so um I had some complicated feelings about this one but ultimately positive I can't wait to see what else comes out what kind of new products what other people are gonna do with weed I think this is probably just the start of a lot of exciting cool experiments just like this pen with dosis and who knows some of them might knock our socks off in the future well guys that is gonna do it for this review here on weeds I appreciate you watching as always thank you so much and we will see you guys on our next review peace", "z5Z_-2zMjmk": "hello today we're reviewing connected cannabis co's forbidden gushers disposable vaporizer the first thing i noticed about this packaging was the blue and black swirls that are on the box the nice connected palm tree that shows up here um the branding and the presentation for the product are really really good i like the color combination that connected uses i like the black design that connected uses everything about this box is really nice and elegant um one thing i didn't like and this might just be me i don't like the fact that it's a disposable vaporizer to me especially in the canvas industry we create a lot of waste from our joints we create a lot of waste from our edible packaging from our flower packaging when people are using a lot of that plastic this just perpetuates that because this can only be used once i cannot reuse this battery i can't recycle this battery i can't do anything with this battery after the cartridge is done so i kind of knocked him down a little bit for that if it was reusable if it was just a normal c cell battery that i could recycle if it was even like a pax style battery that i could recycle then their score would have been substantially higher but because i can't recycle this their score got marked down a little bit the color is that ambery color that everyone likes to see with their live resin almost translucent when the light hits it just right the taste was like a sweet candy um with a little bit of like coconut or lime flavor to it tasted a lot like a candy coconut or lime and that's really really hard to explain the potency was great this there's no like aftertaste like after smell the smell doesn't like linger around except for outside of like a subtle sweet lime smell not really a texture so i don't know what it feels like i can't smell it inside the inside the container so i don't know what that smell looks like either overall i had a very pleasant experience with this connected provides some really valuable resources on their website so that you can have access to that information they broke they have a strain broke down breakdown they talked about how it was bred they give you a little bit of the effects a little bit of the flavor so all that information is available to you on the connected website so connected does a really good job at providing information that their consumers may want or may need for consuming their specific products i would definitely recommend this strain to any of my friends i would recommend this product to any of my friends that like to smoke on the go to my friends that use a lot of batteries or smoke a lot of these disposable vaporizers i this is one that i would consistently push on them even though that price point might be a little bit like more than what they reach um fantastic experience fantastic product the only thing as i said before i don't like is the fact that it's a disposable vape so that doesn't make it as appealing to me as something that i can recycle or reuse over and over again just because i don't like creating a bunch of extra waste i think we can do better about that in the cannabis industry anyways you can read

really awesome I guess it does have a good flavor it's really really good flavor-wise I get I mean to dis lit so I'm a giver like a like a nine I mean with this lit because they are you know they're more reintroducing the terpenes after they extract the oil it's always going to be a fainter kind of lighter taste but like what you like like you might not have that strong earthy green taste but you get like a much more concentrated of THC level and a bigger hit you know so at least that's you know the tale of the tape as we speak and something is really really good like I said for the price it's a really great deal um I don't really know if there's much more to say like I said yeah I want to say that's uh that's the ticket honor she's uh they've got more more they've got tons more flavors

how you guys doing just tallying up these numbers right here because I get an experiment on how many full hits it takes to or how many full hits there are and a half gram cartridge you know cuz I was curious so I went ahead and did that if you ever wondered well now I have a almost exact precise number so if you stay tuned and watch this video then that by the end then you'll know the number and you know a little bit more information as well shout out to shout our house you know these are some good good cartridges if you find them out there and dispensaries there anywhere you might want to check them out on that note stay tuned and watch the whole video and I appreciate you guys into the next one everybody has the question so I'm gonna go ahead and give you guys the answer to the best of my ability that is the question is how many true hits can you get out of a half gram cartridge so I'm gonna go ahead no not this one as you can see this one's kind of empty but I'm going to be using this one and this is a timeless sfv og right here but this so you see because most of the time I tap it and I hit them you know a few times at once but for the sake of this test I'm gonna be hitting them one time for through each pool just like this so that's one hit most of the time I like to tap them and try to give it a maximum hit for the back some effect but for the sake of this experiment we're gonna see how many of this take so stay tuned [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] now people see that it might be one more Inlet someone mark 20 34 34 you know results from

"5q2_qOywZDM": "welcome back to fast money pot socks lighting up this year as legalization gains momentum across the u.s just last week new york governor andrew cuomo said the state is close to moving on recreational use meantime the senate is set to take up the safe banking act later this week a bill would which would allow cannabis companies access to the federal banking system and help eliminate the dangers of doing their business in cash let's talk more about all this with charlie bochtel the ceo of cresco labs charlie great to see you again great to be here thanks for having me which is the bigger impact for your business i mean you you have uh dispensaries all already in in new york so you would benefit from from opening up that market yeah yeah i mean if i was gonna if i had to rate which would be larger uh for either cresco labs or for the industry in new york or or sort of a federal change i think you'd have to go with the federal change you you can't sort of downplay the importance of a state like new york uh passing adult use legislation but you know we'd love to see the safe act make its way through congress and and be a cannabis-related piece of legislation that actually gets uh gets implemented so we're you know optimistic for both that's that's the good spot that we're in what's the first thing you do if that safe act passes you know safe is uh it's such a dynamic component right because because access to capital has been so difficult in this industry and again this is an industry that is the fastest growing industry in america uh increased the uh to 320 000 plus full-time employees in the industry last year that's up 32 so this is an incredibly fast-moving dynamic industry that we still have you know a hand tied behind our back without access to traditional banking so the the unlock for a company like us would be of course bringing cost of capital down making it more traditional in the sense of potentially using lines of credit to smooth out cash flow financing real estate capex projects with traditional or more traditional rates and are currently available but the real unlock here too is the the social equity social responsibility dynamic of access to capital as this industry is developing and all of these state laws are being passed that incorporate these inclusive diverse components to them access to capital is still the biggest gating issue for anybody to get into the space hey charlie it's tim let's talk about some stuff crespus cresco specific and and first of all you guys are in seven of the ten biggest popular states in the country you're in seven billion dollar markets and and you guys have had a slightly different approach to uh wholesale distribution and essentially the the wholesale door sale and and how you're positioning the company in a world where i think the larger cnbc in fast money audience knows you know understands the cpg story cannabis is you know arguably the most exciting cpg story for you know many years let's put it that way talk about how you're set up to take advantage of that it could couldn't agree with you more and it was really it was one of the few things you know that was really apparent to us when we first looked at this back in 2013 was cannabis as a cpg product whether it knew it at the time or not um this was going to be branded and packaged and sort of delivered in in a traditional way that cpg is so for us we've always prioritized those middle two verticals of the value chain wanted to be vertical it's really important to own your entire uh aspect of the supply chain today but prioritizing that branded product sale is critical and you're seeing it as the industry develops these state programs they maintain a tight control on the amount of supply and the number of suppliers that are in the space and points of retail are just going to continue to get more and more and more it's a great small business opportunity that's where tax revenue is actually collected is at the register so we've always had our our sites on making sure that we created branded products that resonate with consumers and that we get them into as many doors as we can and we've established ourselves as the largest uh wholesaler or branded product in the industry charlie great to catch up with you good to see you thanks so much charlie bochtel shepard smith here thanks for watching cnbc on youtube", "MGPBUKkBQGE": "[Music] thank you back today I bring you the certified by the fact that they use cannabis turkeys in other words using great Turks to mix down

Academy ha yeah big man [ __ ] today we're just gonna answer a question the question is how long should a cartridge last you and how many hits should you get out of it but before we get into that sure the question I'm asked you [ __ ] a month I guess please subscribe to my [ __ ] man I appreciate everybody that's here and always Sega's always [ __ ] mean it and make sure you hit that things you can get a notification anytime I post some [ __ ] also make sure you go over academy.com get yourself some terpenes shirts get about 10 11 13 [ __ ] I also cuz the contest is still going on you put in cold [ __ ] get 20% off in your whole [ __ ] order and again sirs you into the contest to be able to get yourself a terpene ball I send it out to you no charge you don't be paying shipping and handling under that [ __ ] I take care of everything and I send it out to you so [ __ ] man can't a mink on get your Terrapins o-obviously go over instagram academy kind of underscore me so all right the question of how long should it last and how many it should you get out there [ __ ] I give that [ __ ] all the time i'ma keep my honey with you if you talking about just a free-range like if you get a cartridge and put it on a free a free-range battery meaning that you kind of have up to seven seconds or 13 SEC's something like that's a hit the [ __ ] bait cartridge that's going to determine how much you're getting out of it so it's no way kind of that I can tell you how many hits you can get out of a [ __ ] cartridge so like when a person comes up and says how about a little 1 gram cartridge less I'll keep it 100 with you there's no such thing as a 1 gram cartridge it's a one milliliter cartridge because liquid is Mac [ __ ] measured in grams so it's a 1 milliliter cartridge with an X amount of grams InSAR milligrams inside of it so let's take for instance if you look at the back of a cartridge and it tells you that 3 milligrams is a serving right and then it also say below it the package has 450 milligrams of THC in it okay so that means that theoretically you would have 90 servings if that makes sense you would have 19 servings out of that that that half milliliter cartridge because that's probably what that will be if that if that's the number four right however how do you know you had three milligrams worth of eight and I'm not dissing it I'm just more so say how do you [ __ ] know this meaning it's kind of really hard to answer this question and then I don't know how often you smoke [ __ ] don't to [ __ ] you me how long does come in every two days getting the same [ __ ] I got my burgers coming in every three weeks every week like everybody got that you old [ __ ] habits and they [ __ ] that's like if I gave you a [ __ ] glass of water and on my a man how many sips is it gonna take to finish this that's just stupid right so at the end of the day you got to get the [ __ ] on your own and figure it out so companies try to give you a mindset of what it is but I got I got batteries that I could take a 13 second hit you know long 13 seconds is to be inhaling [ __ ] vape [ __ ] so come on spot it's it all depends on you man if you do like I think it's this matter like oh you didn't help for like two seconds or some little [ __ ] like that that's like a standard but just like I say it also depends on the force of how you inhale for that two seconds you can inhale like little B actually you can [ __ ] hit that [ __ ] up you know so it really just depends on how you [ __ ] hit you as well so those are the things that have to be taken into consideration when you expect someone to answer a [ __ ] question like that it really just depends on you see my life flashing man yeah peanut series it's yeah but it just really depends on what your habits are how you actually smoke at how long something is gonna last you I personally say have more than one method of consumption so don't just have one vape that you just constantly hitting on and then wonder why is going down that's like having one pair of shoes and heel shoes just get [ __ ] up you know versus like man like 27 pairs of kicks that's why my shoes usually all look new because I got so many so I can just switch them out you know so much it lasts longer so I say I've never met this at some edibles that's Mars so yeah I mean admit you [ __ ] I have some real weed my admission up and I think you'll see that the cartridges will last longer but if that's your only source that motherfucker's gonna be here it's gonna be how for like a month okay you have a graveyard of all these [ __ ] cartridges just laying there there's a little bit of [ __ ] oh you know there's no way of saying it now there is one I know some companies that they'll give you like don't dose it out to you it's actually a company called OC and then it's a okay you get 50 hits out of this pin so when you inhale it cuts off at what the proper dose is and you just inhale until it cuts off so think you know aren't exactly how much are the dose you're getting and you're knowing how many hits you get so I would say like if you can try a company like that just so you can kind of have our idea your mind just for shits and giggles I don't mean like all of that gotta make you be in the right place but just for shits and giggles like just think about it and see like man let me see how long this pin lets me hit and how much of a dose this says it is and that might help you out a little bit I don't know that's just theory of mine yeah me but at the end of the day that's what it is just read the back of the package and you'll see what the milligrams are inside look admit it should tell you what's suggested those are some companies do that so anyway that standard [ __ ] I'm out this [ __ ] y'all make sure y'all keep the log or I love each other keep the peace gon be peaceful to each other go over it kind of mean get yourself turn t-shirts I'm out this [ __ ] another one I want to hit the seat blow we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "Yi3i4F-DBlo": "[Music] what's a bad simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is the interesting video this is obviously a cartridge video but this is surprising I've never seen like a cartridge come in this measurement before and that measurement is 0.75 this was only like 25 or something like 25 to 28 dollars I'm not too sure I forgot but you can see right here it says 0.75 milliliters or grams or whatever we want to call it and it is white Walker ology by cruise I've never tried cruise cartridge but I've tried they're there but and it was good you know very very decent flour for decent prices but I believe this is also this is going to be distantly I believe so you know which is still pretty good you know I'm not I like distillate but as you like I really prefer like sauce cards or live raising card some more you know but this split is it bad it's just sometimes it's just like a artificial flavor so we're gonna see what this is and this is white Walker og you see all the specifications right there everything on the back you can pause if I'm going too fast hopefully it's focusing so just like in the other previous videos I like to mention that my merch is available right now I'll post the link in the bond description below this is just one of the sweaters and they have various colors I think I have like twelve twelve designs on there so like if you don't like one maybe you'll like on another one you know so there's one things to choose from and there's a lot of colors on all of them so I got you there and if you guys are interested I'll post a link people been telling me to make merch for a while and these are all designs I've made myself and I feel like it's more genuine that way because I wouldn't want to paste to design something for me I feel like it should come from the content creator you know and not to knock on any of like other content creators but some of their stuff is a little bit lacking I really wanted to like make it known that I made these and also you know I I understand that most people don't really want cannabis on their shirts so that's why I have some shirts that's just it's more about my life you know like how I was actually born in San Francisco I have a San Francisco shirt the bridge is a conic bridge I think we all know even people that don't live in California fall you know about the Bay Bridge and there's a story behind that because like I named that shirt the bridge to the Spencer eeeh and it's because back when Modesto didn't have too much we had to go to the bay and get all their [ __ ] you know and we had to cross that bridge and it's a play on to that one movie I didn't even see that movie Bridge to Terabithia there's some [ __ ] so I thought it was pretty cool but yes you were not inclined to buy any of these things if you want to support me and buy one of these you're more than welcome to but you're also more than welcome to just not buy it and just chilled me still so let's get on with this [ __ ] review what are you doing but link will be in the book down below so this is white Walker og syndicate as you can see right here really really good stuff it looks pretty nice no no way cartridge so far it's a [ __ ] plastic radiator Calvin your sticker our caution sticker whatever you want to call it I'm not gonna lie this looks pretty [ __ ] nice this thing the oil test or whatever this is dumb as hell I mean I've seen some that's very liquidy and you know what that's just it but very thick I mean this just proves how thick the oil is I mean other than it's [ __ ] legit cuz it's not moving no it could still be sure you know trash off the bed notice that there's some like weird like thing on here that I definitely gotta wash off be using it in my as a beauty which reminds me I still need to do that giveaway for this I'm waiting on light so I can do a live on YouTube in choose a winner but guys [Music] Cheers [Music] very small - not too tasty at all of you is that some sort of taste but I'm not really sure how to describe it I mean it's definitely alright I definitely wouldn't prefer other cartridges I mean what enticed me though was that it was 0.75 for twenty-something dollars which is pretty weird for a cartridge like they usually never come in 2075 so I had to get it never tried cruise cartridges soul paper production is there though it's a very like the sensation to cough afterwards is minimal the taste can't really describe the taste but it's minimal as well other than that pretty decent cartridge if you don't really care about taste you're trying to forget about value out of what you buy because it is 80 percent THC cartridge and I believe it as some sort of amount of CBD in it other than that very good cartridge for what it is not a very tasty one in my opinion but that's just me maybe it's just because I brush my teeth no but woman playing an end the video here hopefully you guys enjoyed it [Music] [Music] [Music]", "I3C5WsMIXmc": "oh how you doing guys war vision back for another review I'm gonna be talking a little bit louder in this video I noticed the audio of my videos has been a little bit hard to hear if you don't use headphones to watch the videos so just got done busting a dab of some of this cherry wine from extracts labs easily some of the tastiest CBD that I've had and I have a very tasty product to review for you tonight as well so I got this earlier today this is something I've been wanting to try for a while secret nature's vape cartridges now I did a video on secret nature's but back in the past so if you'd like to see that go ahead and check it out but this is secret nature's vape cartridges these are some of the most highly regarded cartridges that I've seen online everyone says they're top of the line and the reason why is because they're you they use cannabis drive terpenes so they use terpenes derived from actual but this particular cartridge i'm going to be reviewing is the gelato strain gelato if you don't know is one of the most popular top-shelf cannabis strains right now in legal states it's like 30 percent THC I think and it's a cross between well it was the gelato strain was created using the famous strain Girl Scout cookies or GSC so this is supposed to be a extremely popular top-shelf cannabis strain and I've never tried it so I decided to go with the gelato cartridge flavor it is a hybrid because the gelato cannabis strain is a hybrid so they extract the terpenes and they mix it with CBD distillate this particular distillate that they use is 51% CBD 0.2 three percent THC so you get that full spectrum entourage effect the only thing that this oil is lacking that I would have liked to see is CBG and CBC those are some other cannabinoids when you get high concentrations of all these cannabinoids you get what is called the entourage effect which means you get its more full spectrum and they work together to produce the effects that they would have it would have naturally caused or produced in like but if you're smoking bud so the more cannabinoid spectrum you have the more effects you are likely to feel so this is a 1/2 gram 500 milligram cartridges if it's 50% CBD there's 250 milligrams of CBD in this so the first thing I noticed when I open this package up is the packaging on secret nature this packaging is super professional-looking in just premium and it sits like a hard cardboard stock it almost reminds me of like when you buy a new phone the black cardboard box it comes in that's kind of what this is and I like that they use cardboard versus plastic the amount of plastic that we use as humans is getting out of control it's not good so any company that's using a paper or cardboard I applaud them for that so I'm gonna go ahead and show you this packaging it is beautiful it's black and it's got gold ink and it's even like indented and raised up in some parts so when you open it up it slides open which is cool and then the cartridge was sitting right in there so really cool packaging in the front says secret nature artisan cvd gelato hybrid vapor cartridge full spectrum CBD distillate 500 milligrams on the back that secret nature our goal is to help people enhance their chosen lifestyle through relaxation meditation relief in creativity this 100% organic extract is a true full-spectrum CBD distillate has been purified to concentrate beneficial compounds while removing unwanted plant materials full-spectrum oils contain a wide wide array of cannabinoids like I explained together these compounds synergize entourage effect to create the desired effects from the planet we use real cannabis flower terpenes THC free source from artisan cultivators in California to enhance our extracts and give a true plant experience this company is out of Rogue Valley Oregon without further ado so 10 out of 10 for the packaging let's get into it I'm going to show you the cartridge before I taste it so this oil is like really light in color it almost looks if you've ever poured a mountain Dew in a clear glass that's kind of what the color looks like and it's got this really nice metal mouthpiece I'm not sure what kind of cartridge this is it doesn't say C cell on it but it's definitely a ceramic coiled cartridge the oil is very thick as you can see the bubbles are not moving which is expected CBD oil is usually very thick because it crystallizes around 60% so these are supposed to be some of the tastiest cartridges available because they have real cannabis terpenes so we'll go ahead and try this gelato so the first thing I noticed when hitting this cartridge is it kind of has a a hard you have to kind of pull a little bit harder than you wouldn't normally then I've had to pull on cartridges in the past which doesn't bother me sometimes I like having to pull a little bit harder because you can almost feel how much smoke you're taking in a little bit easier and the mouthpiece has a really sturdy feel to it I don't know it feels good on the lips Wow so the flavor on this stuff is amazing you get all flavor and nothing else you don't get any weird taste you're just getting the terpene flavor so it kind of has like a woody fruity taste to it I know that sounds weird woody but that's literally what it I'm getting and it's an enjoyable taste yeah I don't know how to describe it a head it's like oh like a woody fruity taste like almost like if you I don't know I'm almost getting like some strawberries what I want to say but extremely tasty um if you want a cartridge that for the flavor check out secret nature because this is the best tasting cartridge I've probably ever tried this blows for the people's card Church out of the watermelon taste I mean I thought this tasted pretty good but I mean this is this is the real deal Wow amazing taste I'm I would actually really like to try all their flavors now too rather not like a sample pack because it's really that tasty so I got this from the chrome leaf if you watch my videos you know I've been getting a lot of cartridge from the Khalif website it's because the cone Lee's hat the chrome leaf has the cheapest cartridge prices that I've found online so the cone leaf is a reseller so they'll buy also from a company and then sell but they're pricing their pride it's very very cheap I went to the secret nature website and the cartridge on the secret nature website are even more expensive than what you'll find that the column leaves so if you're interested in cartridges check out the palm leaf and I would highly recommend secret nature I think this 1/2 gram cartridge runs at about 40 maybe like 44 dollars for a half gram so it is expensive but it's not uncommon for what we're seeing CBD cartridges being priced at right now and this is I'll tell you what a premium product I would choose this over for the people for sure just based on the taste and the looks of the oil but like I said the only thing lacking in this is the CBG and cbc that's okay it still is a full spectrum product I have to give this 10 out of 10 the effects on this stuff I did hit it a few times before I did this video just to try to give you guys good effects I'm not tired at all it is a hybrid so just with the terpenes you're not gonna get sedated or anything like that and especially it's got the lower CBD not lower CBD percentage but right around 50 so this would be a great daytime product to use I feel energetic but focused as well and I'm also used to CBD so if you're not used to seedy trying a cartridge like this may make you very tired you know it kind of just depends on your tolerance your body type what time of the day you're using it but overall good effects on this stuff I definitely feel it with any constancy be concentrate you will feel it if it's full-spectrum and I feel just a little bit lighter a little bit more uplifted a little bit happier more and more content with life that's my review on secret nature gelato cartridge I couldn't give this anything less than a 10 out of 10 to be honest with you well I've give it a 9 out of 10 because me personally I would like a little bit more full-spectrum maybe a little bit more THC like right cut off maybe even some thca to really bring out the full spectrum effects and hit yet but nonetheless this is a very uplifting cartridge and extremely flavorful that's all for this review I hope everyone's having a great day night

wholesale and distributions wanted welcome to semi inquiry thank you", "4prSaPMylLQ": "high design is cannabis parade with more reviews for you today and today I would like to talk about some vape pen products woohoo hey pen I've got these great products right here 1:1 ratio THC CBD I've got Durbin poison no that's the gelato so there we go again I've got gelato and I've got Durbin poison Durbin poison is the sativa the gelato is the indica I have what do I have in here oh oh do I really oh okay well I guess I've got the gelato I've got the indica in here right now I'm surprised I thought I had the sativa see what happens and you don't pay attention anyway excuse me on piece canyon a month anyway so a little while ago I did a review on a vape n CBD cartridge and I was not happy with it at all and not only was I only happy that the CBD vape pen didn't work for me I really was hoping for that to not have the THC and to just use something that would help alleviate my pain but apparently I'm one of those people that I do need the THC in the vape pen along with the CBD which I've discovered from these I got these on 4/20 and this is what I purchased they had a buy one get one so I thought I might as well take advantage of it and it's this one to one ratio I was really hoping for because again I want I want that pain killing effects from the CBD so anyway again going back to what I was saying I'm so distracted there's people playing acai and I keep looking at them so I should probably stop doing that okay they all have no distraction um okay so I was really looking forward to doing another review of a product cuz they pen was kind enough to give me this battery when I saw them when they were doing some biomass their stuff they were there at the Phoenix dispensary and I mentioned I was looking for some CVD babes and they gave me the battery and so I came back gonna try that product and it was really kind of crappy that I didn't like it it was like oh thanks for the gift oh yes garbage I don't like it so I'm happy to review something of the vape pen for the vape pen battery that I actually do enjoy and both of these are great for different reasons of course I use the gelato in the evening time I'm pretty active person mentally very active and I have a hard time shutting down at night and sometimes again there's children in the home here and sometimes I don't want to go outside and smoke and when I'm really having a hard time sleeping if I'm not using and edible I definitely need to smoke it in to kind of go to bed so these are really convenient I really like using them before I go to the gym especially the sativa this Durban poison was great at the gym because I never felt that the yucky illness you know how you get a little heavy sometimes when you smoke this did not do that at all I was able to make it through my workouts even through yoga and then just some weight training and I had no problems at all so really convenient the smoke is nice I will say though the the gelato the indica is a lot smoother than the Durban poison the Durban there's a bag stuck to a tree and I thought it was a squirrel okay see how easily distracted I haven't hold on a minute I need to bring myself back to what I'm doing hold on get some of this indica gone okay the bag blew away that's good I love blowing smoke at you I just want to say no it would be cool if you sent me videos of you receiving this that would be great anyway okay so even though baby lungs do-do-do-do-do so even though excuse me while I wipe away my cry baby tears okay so even though gelato is smoother again it's a vape pen they do kind of cause me to cough it's a lot smoother than some that I've tried I have had some some big products but I've tried of other people's know something I'm gonna try that and see if I like it they made me cough a lot more so this is definitely smoother maybe it's the battery maybe it's the way it burns it I am looking to try some other one that you can set the temperature and because this one does get hot and I'm wondering if maybe one my oil my my cartridge will last longer if it doesn't burn so hot but also maybe I won't get that burning sensation that I get in the back of my throat mainly from the Durbin poison a little bit here umm so keep that in mind when you're getting them certain ones do burn a little hotter than others I'm noticing so some you might have a little more discomfort and I think it also depends on the way you hit it if you hit it really hard it's been gonna burn a little hotter maybe it's cuz I'm searching sit up straight sit up straight head up and beat into work I know I'm not even funny I'm just gonna smoke this okay see today's a day that I need the in the cup when that stuff to do that requires me sitting down which is pretty much what I've been doing the last few days and it helps curb the I need to get up and do something else thing so big help for those kinds of situations again these were I believe 300 milligrams I'll correct that on there if I'm wrong I don't believe I am though whereas a 500-mile against Amador I knew this before I started anyone it was $30 for one of these 0.5 grams anyway $38 I got a buy one get one free so you know what is that $19 I guess piece and in that sense from the Phoenix dispensary I'm just gonna end up cutting all this stuff out because I'm [ __ ] all right so so these cost me $20 so these cost 38 dollars each except there was a buy one get one so you know game II and the DL they lasted a while I mean you could see how much I have left and I've been smoking on this all week I've been trading off with the sativa but the Durban poison and that's how much of that I have left um so it's been again since since April 20th so since 4/20 I've been smoking on these and I have flowers so I've been smoking my flower to again I'm not real thrilled with how long these cartridges last for as expensive as they are but they are convenient and so I guess you are paying for convenience again if I found the battery that maybe control the temperature there by controlling how much of the oil I was using per puff maybe it would help better I don't know maybe you guys know again you know this is not one-sided I'd love to hear some info from you maybe you've had different experiences or you know certain tricks of using these things that I don't know because I really don't I'm really new to vaping if you have favourites let me know so also if you like my videos hit subscribe this is a rambling one I hope I'm able to edit this together to make it somewhat entertaining because I really like this so that's that's how I'm gonna summarize I really like this of a pen cartridge I really appreciate both of these for different reasons so gelato the turbine the gelato and the Durbin poison they both work different different times a day it's like oh this is the morning and this is the night time if you can do a buy one get one I definitely suggest it as the way to go for trying them out because you can try different products I can't wait to try other ones not just buy a pen but definitely I want to try the other ones like a pen yeah like my videos subscribe say hi talk to me every now and then I'm so long", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "4YGrQaN6hBA": "[Music] what is going on you guys so truly just put out there new CEO to bait pin earlier this week and I stopped by and I grabbed one this is what we're used to seeing from truly right now usual truly packaging co2 bait pen says on top co2 this is what we usually see from truly for a co2 vape pen but now we have their new open vape reserve co2 distillate cartridge bait pen so in this video we're going to go over the difference between these two pins we're gonna say this is jacker rare right here I have jacker rare from the open bait so if I have two of these co2 pins that are the same strain what's the difference between the two so we'll go over that today but first we're gonna check out their Instagram right here you can see their Instagram and here's my Instagram as well in case you guys have never seen it this is a great page to follow as well I post on here all the time and I show you new stuff that's getting ready to come out and it's a great place to see sneak peeks for videos that are coming out you ever want to contact me this is the place to do it and I even put you guys in some of the videos to go check it out alright so here's their Instagram page as you can see here at the top they are High Times Cannabis Cup winner and they are in several different states Arizona California Colorado new New Mexico of that and Florida being their newest warm we got three strains for right now San Fernando Valley oh gee which is a hybrid Jack Herer which is a sativa and Master Kush which is a indica so the one thing that I saw on here that I wanted to show you guys was the cartridge that it comes in the Saran cartridge think this is supposed to be the newest version of a C cell which means it has a ceramic ceramic coil which will help burn the product better than a wit coil I know a lot of times with wit coils they can burn out real easy but with this ceramic oil you won't have that problem this is just the newest version of C cell truly uses C cells for most of their babes except for their cheapest distillate faith and their true pod so it says this cartridge is supposed to deliver up to 110 percent larger hits I'm not exactly sure what they're comparing this to but it seems to hit about the same as a regular C cell from B and you also have the open 2.0 battery which you can get if you like you don't have to get this battery this cartridge will screw on to any 510 thread battery alright so let's check out what all we get when we purchase the bait cartridge so we have that then it comes in a separate little two as you can see here open bait and right here it has the terpenes listed the dominant terpenes are turpino lean trans carry opaline and our lemony and the cartridge is coming in at 87% THC and 0.4% CBD total so to open you simply squeeze the sides and it will slide out just like that nice tip I like the tip on it it's a plastic hard plastic type tip that looks like glass but it is plastic on the bottom you have your little cap to keep it from leaking we won't need that anymore and this oil in here looks great too i mean it's some really good looking product inside of here so you can see it's really nice [Music] so as you guys can see right here this is as full as the cartridge is they say that that's headspace where it has go as gone into the coil but I remember the first time I got one of these I actually had to get it going before the oil was even in the coil that's the only thing that I see so far as it looks like they could fill the cartridges a little bit more and I have had this same problem with these cartridges they're just not quite as full as they could be that's the only thing that I don't like about these half Graham carts is it doesn't seem like I'm getting the full product for the price that I'm paying I mean if I'm buying a full gram of this stuff I'm paying you 110 dollars just make it full at least and I have seen them completely full so I mean that whole headspace thing to me just doesn't make sense so let's try it out I'm just gonna screw it on to my favorite battery as you can see here it's a 5-10 thread it will screw on to any 510 battery and you can also see it says jupiter-c cell that's how you can identify if you have a real C cell it will say Jupiter on it just like that alright you guys so everything you've seen so far has been recorded over the last couple of days and I've really had a good chance to try this product out now and I really like it it's a good product but I'm not quite sure I like it better than the co2 bait cartridge right here from truly do like how hard the new C cell hits it does rip really good check this out [Music] nice hit hmm so and then rips really good you can get really nice rips off of this especially with an adjustable battery which is what I have here it's an adjustable battery goes from 4.8 bolts down to 3.8 bolts in a 3.3 volt so that way you have a choice of what temperature you take your head out and how big of a hit you take and that's kind of similar to the 2.0 pin that they have as well I'm sure it's just a little bit more pricier than the one I have here so if this was a jack herer cartridge what would be the difference between these two cartridges since they're both co2 cartridges well this company right here open they have some award-winning strains that they have and they have the terpene profiles on them so that terpene profile is basically what the difference is between these two things right here you of course have different phenotypes of plants you may have jack or air and jack or air so they're gonna be two different phenotypes and they're gonna have two different types of terpenes in them this is just the terpene profile for their phenotype of Jack Herer so what is a phenotype well to make it easy basically not every plant is the same and every different plant is a phenotype and some are better than others and this is why sometimes you guys will see let's say blue dream and it will be really nice-looking and then other times you'll see blue dream and it won't be as nice-looking it's because it's two different plants and you have two different phenotypes we'll get into all that some other time but you guys did want to know one other question and there is one other difference on this product let's jump back on this screen real quick and check this out all right so I'm on true leaves Instagram here and in the comments of one of their pictures from this new product someone asked as anyone tried these what can we expect are there any cutting agents so truly the answers with cut with nothing but terpenes so everybody wants to know of course what these terpenes come from are they fruit food terpenes or the cannabis terpenes so we see right here that the answer they will be botanical or fruit terpenes basically and down here we see some people are not really excited that they are not cannabis Dr terpenes like the co2 pin the co2 pin from truly has cannabis derived terpenes and right here in this message they tell me one is botanical and their co2 pin is cannabis derived terpenes now true leaf also has to do this with any other things that are distilled that of course is a different process than the co2 distillate but regular distillate who has the terpenes added to it to recreate that strain the profile of that strain this is why they came out with the co2 true clear or distillate is because they are using food grade or botanical terpenes and the regular distillate and that is pretty common practice around the country but the co2 distillate has cannabis derived terpenes in it regular distillate does not have any terpenes in it until they are introduced back into it because it is cooked off during the distillation process and is basically just raw THC without any terpene profile to it at all and it is built from there you guys may have remembered a little while back when they came out with Gainesville green this actually is a strain from a long time ago long time Florida strain from way back when was supposedly lost about 30 years ago well this is how the strain was recreated they actually went to Naiya being godfather of gainesville green and had him approved the terpene profile for Gainesville green and that is where we got it from this is actually derived from gorilla grapes though and this is why you don't see any Gainesville green actual flower in the dispensary because only the terpene profile is available for it and only Rick nya supposedly knows it so that's enough for right now take that in and let me know down in the comments what you guys think would you rather have food grade terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes keep in mind both of these products are half grams and they both cost fifty five dollars I hope you guys liked the video give it a thumbs up if you did and subscribe below to learn some more we'll see you guys next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "iXOiyo5eYW0": "while we've probably all heard about the potential benefits of CBD by now what we don't hear too much about is the potential dangers of CBD oil or more specifically the potential dangers of a CBD oil vape pen CBD vape pens are often marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking and it's probably some truth to this whether you're talking about tobacco or marijuana most experts agree that vaping is less severe on the lungs than the smoke that's inhaled from combusted plant material the reason for this comes down to a simple temperature comparison standard joints and cigarettes can burn anywhere between 800 and 1600 degrees Fahrenheit but some high quality vaporizers operate at less than 400 degrees nowhere near hot enough to produce the tar and combustion that wreaks havoc on the lungs in fact there's really no reason to inhale at temperatures much hotter than 400 degrees Fahrenheit as most of the cannabinoids in marijuana are already fully decarboxylated by this point that being said the dangers of CBD oil vape pens come from the fact that improperly processed products may contain compounds that pose hazards to respiratory health the first thing to be wary of is something called cuticle wax cannabis flour is covered in a thin outer waxy layer which when smoked in a joint or Bowl is simply burned off under the extremely high temperatures of combustion in low-temperature vaporizers it may be possible for the wax layer to break off into tiny particles rather than burn away some have suggested that these particles may end up in the lungs as solidified granulomas to avoid this potential hazard look for CBD vape oil that has undergone winterization this is a chemical process that removes the cuticle wax from the plant material before it ever reaches a vaping device another concern to be wary of is thinning agents like polyethylene glycol and propylene glycol more commonly known as PE g and PG in its natural state cannabis oil is much too viscous to be compatible with vape pen heater coils for this reason thinning agents are often added to make the oil more fluid and also to produce the tasty thick vape clouds that so many people love the only problem is both PE g + PG are known to break down into carcinogenic formaldehyde when exposed to temperatures above 440 degrees Fahrenheit a range that even top shelf vaporizers commonly operate in while the dangers of formaldehyde are most evident in other kinds of products it is probably not a substance that you want to be inhaling on a regular basis lastly in terms of the potential dangers of CBD oil vape products be advised that when you're shopping around for a vape pen you're going to get what you pay for some low end vaporizers have been known to operate at temperatures of up to 900 degrees Fahrenheit this quite obviously defeats the purpose of vaping as you're still combusting the oil and plant material into a thick tari residue in other words try and invest as much money as you can into a good well reviewed unit also try and find a vape pen that has manually controllable temperature settings this allows you to adjust the operating temperature to around 340 degrees Fahrenheit which many suggest is the perfect vaping temperature for CBD and cannabis for maximum safety and to avoid the potential dangers of CBD oil vapes as much as possible try and also look for winterized VAE boils as well as oils and eliquid 'z that RP eg free thanks for watching and of course if you have any additional

over meryl streep yeah this insider is here exactly exactly oh now it's a party yeah you know i i got questions all day about cannabis you know what i told them what did you talk about to the right show go to cannabis insider there's no beef were you there so mitchell i know the kitchen are the men this is great this is great thanks for tuning that up fellas that's awesome and thanks for i i was just i was just listening that last bit that was awesome how are you javi i am doing pretty pretty good honestly it's been a good start to the week what about you about the same man about the same it's beautiful weather here in michigan today it's like 65 66 degrees so my god it is like sun's out guns out over here is what it feels like it's awesome finally finally michigan realized spring is here yes thankfully thankfully um less than a month away from 420 and i think it's time for our introduction let's do it [Music] uh [Music] all right all right we're back back in action javi i've got a few things um yep are you two hey and guys in the chat throw one in there if there is any excitement whatsoever about all the acquisitions going on in the space um a two if you just don't care about acquisitions but um i'm excited i feel like every day there's something else that happens that's really interesting now why don't we start with this one javi i am cannabis i am cannabis i know we talked about this one a little bit last week um but this is a cool one one of the only um operators especially the in the the medical community here that has a footprint in the eu canada and israel right yep um and israeli company in fact they just got into north america through an acquisition yeah well and you have to applaud that right because especially in this industry it certainly seems like the footprint is the the number one thing it doesn't matter if it's retail or clinics or or or brands right a lot of different ways to achieve what that footprint looks like but um but yeah you got to applaud those guys those are three hefty markets to have a foothold in and here's something interesting it's one of the very few you know non-north american cannabis companies now acquiring a big footprint or a like some kind of big operation in north america right we haven't seen many israeli companies get into into the us uh we haven't seen many european companies get into the us and in fact we haven't seen many u.s companies get into europe either right the flow seems to go like canada to europe and that's about it for now yeah yeah yeah well well and i i i love it right at least there's an opportunity to spread the wealth a little bit um we got a question about cbdd or maybe it wasn't a question maybe it's just a little pumping there um you know the stock's at two cents um they're on the otc looks like a market cap of around uh just under 2 million yeah i don't know i don't know what what's what's to know about cbdd we had a few uh questions about it in the past cbd of denver i believe as a company uh we are not a fan of small penny stocks not to say that that cbdd is or isn't great they you know just the level of disclosure for for smaller companies isn't usually massive not a lot to go on uh but i think we need to do our homework so that's it for let's put yeah let's put that one on we'll we'll we'll look into that when we'll get back to you thank you jason for that one um yeah go ahead man no not at all i mean you know going back to imcc for a little bit i am cannabis right you know we were talking about this acquisition they made they paid 101 million canadian dollars to acquire trichome financial right so that says a lot beautiful we got the chart there thank you erin kind of the chart there we'll take it uh so they started trading on the nasdaq very recently through a a spec deal so that's why we don't have so much info or or extremely high volumes yet just because it's a relatively new stock uh and they didn't do much uh press in the us before before going to the nasdaq right i remember uh covering the the company on benzinga every week they have a good pr team but they pitch like me and not a lot of you know of other us-based or canada-based journalists so you know there was often not a lot of information around what they were doing company definitely a company to keep an eye on uh one of the most interesting players in israel especially publicly traded we don't have a lot of those there are a lot of very interesting private players in israel but like this is a very very cool way to play the the israeli european market and now you know a financial play within north america as well absolutely absolutely um well listen i have a couple more that i want to rattle off here imcc again great company great footprint let's talk about great companies for a second um do you want to talk about who will leave truly true i love talking about truly you know that but let's let's let's start with cresco's quick news crl bf is the ticker um we heard from blumo wellness their shareholders approved that merger um so yeah interesting interesting uh response in the market there but that is big news for cresco they go in to the florida market with that acquisition so crl bf is that ticker yeah and what what acquisition is that one i was thinking because they acquired some like a psychedelic company as well it's called um hallucinox or how phoenix life sciences cresco it's a canadian psychedelic assisted by uh psychotherapy uh focused company interesting i did not hear about that that's interesting so that's cresco pharma probably not the same one as chris oh yeah it must be cresco labs fresco labs the big mso i i yeah i'd be shocked if they they jumped into the psychedelic space so soon so yeah no let's let's not get it twisted cresco labs c-r-l-b-f that's an acquisition of vluma wellness which puts them in the florida market we all heard about their acquisition into the massachusetts market uh last week it was about 158 mil or something they spent to jump into massachusetts vaulting into the top three position in that space pretty darn cool um keeping it rolling v r n o v r n o verano holdings here's what i love about this company they seem to be doing this strategically in a time i don't know what you're what you think right now but at a time when all these spacks are jumping into like seven markets at a time right verano seems to be growing strategically right they just acquired another business in arizona to further deepen their presence in that market um but they're going to be huge right they they when they went public they've all companies in this space right so it's it's been it's been pretty cool to watch them and depending you know we we discussed this in the past by the pending merger with ultimate makes them particularly interesting and you know one of the potentially one of the largest cannabis companies in the world want to keep an eye on you know back to today's news um they announced today that they are purchasing patient alternative relief center for about 17 million dollars this is a um a company in operating in phoenix arizona uh and the name of the business they're doing business is local joint um again interesting and and you know the move just comes on the heels of securing almost 100 million canadian which is 79.5 million us in financing so again you know interesting news out of verano and a lot of news out of her i know yeah absolutely absolutely yeah a little tough to read there but yeah um another thing here um yeah let's see the five day there you go and the one month why are why is the market responding negatively i don't know isn't that interesting acquisitions right okay so when was this this is the okay so really on the 15th or 16th it started to it started to to drop again um i don't know perhaps it was the turn in the market maybe we haven't had a full bounce from the safe banking act yet um and the reintroduction into congress but i do expect the market to respond to that i'd be shocked if it didn't i mean etfs are slightly down today but you know for for specific companies i'm still a little bit confused do you think it's it's just you know investors uh worried about uh you know exuberant spending coming back to the industry after what we saw a couple years ago i don't think it's not rewarding maybe maybe but i don't think so i mean look at the last question beat street music why did cannabis stocks today till rey due to the firing of white house staff for the past cannabis use right um so listen this is interesting there were several staffers let go from the white house the biden administration um because of past marijuana use right have we heard any more about that is there has there been any explanation a lot i mean they're bashing they're bashing you know uh bayern's administration really hard especially because only a couple weeks ago he had said he would not do that and here's the here's the you know the plot twist kamila harris last year said she had consumed cannabis she said i consumed it and i inhaled it you know so and i inhaled what the bill clinton i did not inhale or al gore or obama said he did inhale and i think it's a thing it's a presidential thing that's the way you say it i like i smoked cannabis but i inhaled it too now my question is will he also fire camella you know like what's his standard there you know where did we draw the line of course he won't fire camera but you know talks a little bit about the double morale i don't know it makes no sense makes no sense i mean why would you fire someone if it's uh if it was um well if it's legal especially in in whatever market they're in and even if it's not if if we're legalizing it and decriminalizing it in certain markets and ideally federally then why should it matter right um okay so very interesting obviously we have our own opinions about it but um but perhaps perhaps that has had an effect on the market i'm not sure um certainly something to think about um elliot mentions valons and chiron having a good start to the week i saw that too um valens is an interesting company this is vlncf uh big in the extraction space i think well under value in terms of of uh the relationships this company has in the space um and how long they've been in this space i'd be shocked to see that stock sit at that level uh a whole lot longer right um again just my personal opinion but a dollar eighty seven they're up about eight percent today that is a different response right on friday they announced they were acquiring a an edibles manufacturer for like 20 million dollars live food technologies stock stock has been rallying since right yes yes and well they they announced that they were going to support what it what did the acquisition close on friday they announced on friday that that they acquired yeah that they you know okay previously they finalized um the the purchase on friday or at least you know they announced it there's always a little bit you know a few days between well you know when things happen and when they press release right so they announced they closed the acquisition that could have happened on monday maybe right probably so yeah this market it doesn't make a whole lot of sense right now um you've got certain you've got certain companies like uh harvest health and recreation hrvsf hrvsf they were at one time the largest cannabis mso with an acquisition i forget who they acquired but it was a massive deal like an eight or nine hundred million dollar deal um they're up in about a percent and a half today but why yeah i think they just settled a lawsuit didn't they something of that nature there was some sort of um uh of settlement that was reached with falcon international i think was the name of the group but um perhaps we can pull that up i'm not sure but why should they be up and cure relief c-u-r-l-f is down almost a percentage point today even though they had very positive news last week with their deal with planet 13 who is up pl nhf up about another two percent today they're trading at about 672 a share really really positive company um many of these these companies are not treading up or down on specific news right it's just the volumes and people people of course acquiring positions or or you know kind of cashing in on gains also the fact that they're still relatively small in terms of market cap and relatively low in volume it means like any market maker can make one move and really you know move his talk and i've seen a lot of that right of companies being heavily shorted by they by a fund and and really you know one one or two investors being able to determine the fate of the entire company and its investors like it's retail investors is not uncommon in cannabis right right well it's just interesting right especially because some of these companies are doing deals together and one of them's up and one of them is is definitely the opposite um yeah then kyle mentions high tide is up today actually yeah that is true and it's because they uh filed their form 40f for uh the nasdaq listing with the sec great move for them i think yeah another one to keep an eye on i really like to see more and more companies you know from the cannabis space getting into the nasdaq and the new york stock exchange it seems that nasdaq has become particularly friendly you know and open to to listing cannabis talks as long as they're not touching the plant in the u.s right that continues to be their mandate but they were but they were playing around for a little bit i remember you know three four years ago asking them hey are you ready to list cannabis talks and they were not quite ready now they come to come to terms and of course we did see like some listings a couple three years ago maybe even like you know occur now or green lane but but they were mostly staying away from all these companies touching the plant and now right they're listing them and we're seeing a lot of companies transition toward the nasdaq as well right we saw aurora and freya you know from from go from the new york stock exchange to the nasdaq right yeah and i think that is somewhat related to the fact that it's like a younger exchange right so many of the retail investors investing in cannabis skew a little bit younger i don't know just a random hypothesis to be honest no no i think that's very valid you're asking about uh a kerner earnings i just want to see what the exact timing of that is yep so it's it's slated for today i haven't seen anything come out yet javi have you not yet but they should be out colonel news yeah i haven't seen it yet great company jessica billingsley is the ceo there um yeah i don't know beat street music the the comment just to take us back to why potentially we're looking at a bunch of stocks being down today right i don't know i don't know i i i like to think that the administration has to they're kind of in between a rock and a hard place it seems right they they're they they're quite moderate in terms of what they have to portray even if they uh they're trying to push through a a certain agenda right now we know given especially that video that you posted earlier today javi of cory booker and uh chuck schumer and uh who was it ron wyden yeah there's just like tension right in the federal government and and especially among democrats you know like will they deliver on all these promises to relax cannabis laws and and decriminalize and expunge records or not i don't know like you know because lawmakers are signaling that they you know they're interested in doing this that there's interest in the government but then the executive branch is saying something completely different or at the very least signaling something completely different and by the way if you ask me is this a good time to be really like firing what has white house staffers for cannabis use and i'm not saying like they should or shouldn't of course they shouldn't but there are extremely more like extremely more urgent priorities yeah to deal with right now like you just don't you know someone chose those staffers right they took the time to hire them and to train them they're now being fired and someone has to spend time finding and training new staffers in the middle of the largest health care crisis america has had in 100 years well let's let's let's see what other shoe is about to drop and who knows i'm not prognosticating but i would say there must be some reason right other than just there was marijuana use right there maybe there was some sort of past indiscretions maybe they were doing it somewhere they shouldn't have been doing it who knows right we don't know the full ins and outs of that but i agree with you i think the signaling that's happening obviously we talk about that a lot in our political climate here in the u.s um yeah who knows who knows what exactly they're trying to say but right now we know it's not a great positive message right so i i i want to answer a few questions and and you know kind of weave in some news here uh for mochi you ask us if we look into otc uh stocks of course now we're getting into truly one second before that benjamin is asking what's the safest etf to invest 150 000 that's a lot of money uh we cannot provide financial advice here the the etfs i think are cool uh there's mj they're all new york stock exchange rated on the newer stock exchange arika of course so we have mj yolo that's y-o-l-o m-s-o-s then t-h-c-x and c-mbs cmbs is run by our good friend tim seymour from cnbc thcx is uh you know we we have john and jerry and another friend of the house involved in the in the in the etf this is not to say that that that msos yolo and mj are not great mj is the largest you know by market cap followed by msos they're both issued by the same etf issuer called etfmg uh jason wilson does a great job there um but you know check out performances i've seen cmbs perform particularly well recently right they have a very active like they have an active approach uh whereas mj or msos are tied to indices and then there are strategies in between for the other um etfs but you know take a look at those five once again remember to look at what's actively or passively managed right that's that's something i mean you hear um yeah tim seymour talk about it yeah there's no right answer right for active or passive management i've asked a million people and they go like well i mean you know active management is more expensive in terms of fees and expenses for the fund at the same time it allows you to respond better but at the same time you know performance is it doesn't always go hand in hand with active management so you know it's not inherently good or bad just look at who's managing and what their track record has been so far right right now we're going to talk truly just jumping into true leaf you know they were asking uh do we do we look at uh otc traded stocks well truly cannabis corporation trades on the otcqx the tickeris tcnn tcnnf this company was very very very very hyper focused in florida massive operator in florida they were you know one of these single state operators guess what they just got into west virginia what's up with that they acquire mountaineer holdings for about 6 million dollars it's um a cultivation permit and two dispensaries uh didn't they also just did not like it you know because one of the things that that truly was doing awesomely was focusing on one market i i am a a you know a believer that it was time for them to expand beyond florida you know their footprint is massive but the response of the markets you know suggests otherwise i don't know i love truly i love you great great company i love her strategy and every one of her partners and investors love her you know like just partners love to leave as well and that says a lot right because when there's money involved it's easier for us to say i love truly right you know we just cover them yeah you know we we look at what they do partners there's money involved you know you gotta love someone you're you're making business with and can make you win or lose money yeah of course well and and truly is one of those companies i think i said this in the first one of these shows that we did you know there's gonna be a handful of of what you might call a winner in this space right um and i think we can see who those people are whether it's a canopy in in canada or uh an afria tilray or in the u.s if it's true leave or cure leaf or gti or any of those companies right there's going to be a handful of companies that do very very well out of all of this every time i see their stock down just my own personal choice i jump in right i go and grab another share or so right now i have to i have to just because i see it i'm like man it's a perfect opportunity and obviously be careful do your due diligence make sure that you're if you're buying the dip you you you're reading the news you're looking at the financials but but a company of true leave status in this industry and their footprint they're you know it's like a gift seeing like thank you kim for i i don't know for doing whatever happened to make the stock go down and now you know we'll see something i'm sure in the next day or two where it skyrockets again but yeah a phenomenal company i have an exclusive by the way this is you know breaking news you can find it on dot com cannabis privately you know private uh news but uh our good friends at mazda kali have partnered up with satori investment partners to form a strategic alliance with the intention of investing up unto 20 million dollars into cannabis related businesses so if you're looking for interesting cannabis they will cut checks between half a million and five million dollars they are looking for expen experience management teams exemplary record keeping positive cash flows or a clear path to profitability and companies operating in markets with healthy supply and demand traits so check it out benzingo.com cannabis for more information exclusive you heard it here first very cool 20 million bucks that's awesome it could fund as many as 40 companies or as you know little as four you know depending on checks they cut but no that's cool i i love sumit and the guys over at mazzakali they're very very smart guys um oh elliott i'm sorry hexo is toying with his emotions i know i get it i get it hexo is a great company um so javier if you had to see uh of all the canadians right now especially with the recent investments into let's say organogram ogi or the news out of um kronos group right and and what's happening with the they've got kristen bell's happy dance brand and throwing that into the ulta stories like that and cronus is great dude i don't know and it i always admired how young their ceo is mike he is one smart cookie right he he started running this company when was he was like what 24 and managed to grow it incredibly exponentially i don't know there's something about it that just makes me feel bullish always yeah i know what was your question sorry no no so the of the canadians right now i mean who do you who who do you have your eyes on if there's if there's if a handful of winners again maybe pick no more than two or three right now um but who do you who do you say is leading the charge for canada i mean for the big ones i really like you know the potential of a freya tilray you know when they merge sure um aurora is always a good pick for me as well um those are the larger players right so it's like those are easy picks um you know high tide is a cool one to be honest as well you know the we were talking about their their nasdaq listing um probably sometime in the next couple of months cool one to you know keep an eye on could be up if they you know get into the nasdaq i think that could give them a nice little bump sure but what about the mid-tier then like let's or a mid-tier might not even be a fair representation but your your hexo your organogram your chronos group your village farms you know um some strong strong companies yeah village is a great one i know you love it uh i know i do i do like hexo i do like kronos of course always um uh cgc right canopy is is is a very interesting that uh going back to the big ones um i mean those are kind of the ones i'm looking at namaste uh yeah yeah in the supreme cannabis company oh emerald that's that's one i really like emerald health therapeutics they have a billion verticals and different companies within the company and it's like they have an interesting business model and they know what they're doing and every one of their their you know the companies under the the parent umbrella is really well run um before we close the day today you know grow generation just because we've been bringing it up so much nasdaq grgw grooge as i call it uh another acquisition eighth acquisition in 2021 uh they acquired a wholesale agricultural platform called argonne.io they did not disclose the price that has become a little bit of a uh of a tendency last week they announced three acquisitions they didn't disclose the price uh my question is why i really like to know what how much companies pay for for acquisitions right makes me the was either too small or they overpaid for the company that's interesting i hadn't thought about that it's the ticker i believe is grwg is it not grwg trwg okay just making sure thank you aaron for correcting that um i don't know i don't know if they overpaid or not but i i will tell you this they're constantly acquiring businesses they're expanding their footprint again we talked about that to begin the show today you can do a footprint in this in this industry and execute it a number of different ways these guys have absolutely destroyed it um if you don't mind though i want to end with one stock that i don't think we talk enough about they have earnings oh god almighty um so that's sndl sundial for those of you who haven't i don't know opened a computer ever in your life because they're everywhere um no it wasn't this the stock that i'm interested in and i think they have earnings tomorrow is teracent so you've got uh t-r-s-s-f terracen um a crazy crazy good company um under the radar they've been under the radar for a long time right but you've got jason wilde you've got tim seymour you've got relationships with other major major companies uh in the space it doesn't canopy own like or or have yes what's the deal with canopy in that yeah they had a stake and i mean it's i think it's canopy rivers the investment arm oh that's right okay and into terrace and here's my one concern right and and i think it's shared by analysts new york might go wreck any time and and then implementation could be fast if new york beats jersey to the punch terrace then only has operations in jersey in that region so they could be they could they wouldn't be the largest beneficiaries of it on the other hand if new york failed to legalize they stand to to reap enormous benefits from being a major player in in the in the um in the region right and generally northeast and and new england and they could be receiving a lot of tourism and a lot of people buying right yeah no it's interesting i don't know who knows new york i feel like they've been hinting at it all year i i've heard about new york going legal if you like terrace and or you want to play a new jersey play just hedge your bet with one of the good you know someone who's well positioned in new york and again zynga dot com cannabis you'll find a report by counterfeit sheriff paolo swanice we quote him very often and he breaks down which are a good place for new york and for jersey you know in different situations cool well that's a good note to end on my friend we have after hours with ryan up next oh after hours that sounds very classy that's correct we're a classy place guys must be classy i gotta smash the like button let's go let's go like enjoy yourselves enjoy yourselves everyone and and for tomorrow with spencer yes what do you think of that check mark for me spence you're the man thanks for having us

merry smokes real merry smokes ok don't forget some real medicine", "sU8lInunbZU": "yo yo yo guys what is going on we were back for a third video in a row told you guys I'm back I'm not going anywhere who should I keep grinding this out first things first again thank you guys we had a thousand four hundred and something subscribers or something like that so I'm crazy still working out sponsorship stuff like that some dumb stuff but uh ya know it's all in the works it's all the works uh yeah other than that I just want to say thank you guys you guys are awesome but yeah so it's for today's car I have two different ones I don't know which one I wanna give to you guys or review for you guys this one cuz it's late at night so we'll do the end because so we could sleep on right so this one right here there's a sticker on it but it says key relief um there's a couple states that actually have this dispensary Arizona I think Wisconsin somewhere back east I think they're pretty popular back east yeah there's like four or five in Arizona for cure leaves and this is their in-house carts so I think they think normally they run 25 or $30 a piece no I'm sorry they're $30 a piece for these parts they're half gram $30 right and today they were running a deal not gonna show you this one oh no that's this one I want to show you that one so I got two of them for the price of one so I got two for 30 years or one for 15 basically that being said let's go ahead and I mean let me read this out real quick oh I didn't even tell you guys the strain this one the strain is called rainbow Jones I've never heard of that scream if you guys have let me know this is coming at d 9 t HC % is eighty two point five six so not super high the THC percent isn't posted on here or THC a percent I'm sorry well other than that I guess let's pop or open and start reviewing it mmm comes without you know your standard little boxes with your little corner in them she can keep the carton it comes in this little tube too I've noticed that a lot more courts are coming in Dube to do basically for whatever reason I don't mind it though it's nice it's never bad to have a couple extra Dube tube saying you know I mean so my first impression it's kind of sticky on the outside so I don't know if it's leaking or not I hope not could just be the metal and stuff just like the finishes but sup it's actually really nice looking card guys right here so on the front there you got the little leaf logo right that's the airs and then you got that key relief writing frame wow that's it this is a really gorgeous looking card not even gonna lie I don't think I've ever been turned on by a car but this one comes with your standard little rubber stopper on the bottom I don't have any nails tell my nails so it's just dancing alright so you guys go see the wax like like a good weed to be reviewing it's not focusing of course cuz I have a phone but you know no bubble though not the biggest fan of it not the biggest fan the other one has that too all half-korean cards have them usually full grams are a little bit better but yeah this oil looks gorgeous though super thick it's not running no bubbles except for that one gorgeous like gold color to it so it's go ahead and pop it on the good old booze battery I don't know where my only one is and it won't charge for some reasons so we're just gonna stick it with this one alright guys first hit of the night guys Cheers okay well okay okay so the only flavor you get out of that excuse me hydration break wow man I don't really get yourself going man well that was a great hit um oh so first impressions off that first one big fan I highly recommend it already but we'll keep going with the review you know if you want to stick it out and you know keep looking hmm then he said hydration brakeman oh well some yeah this car is pretty dang nice this is an indica so hopefully slumped me out a little bit I'm gonna go watch a horror movie or something after this chill relax that's distress that trip hi his funky some toasty nose you already muggy let me gonna let me know what you guys favorite uh like food or snack and beverage so give me like one food item edible item and one beverage right to eat and drink when you're stoned or just smoking or hot boxing or just any situation what your high right what are your go to edible items that are non marijuana you [ __ ] drug addicts yeah I was talking about edibles no no so now marijuana have food or drinks not marijuana world there's THC drinks you know yeah a little zoink you guys let's do it all Cheers it's a great hit from the thin by the way that is a solid asset real well for $30 for two of them I'm not usually guys $30 for two of them is not a bad deal at oh wow I think okay except for like first time patient deals and like that that one video I did were it was like I got four cards for like 24 dollars or something like that besides those like really crazy deals like the wild wild ones like that one for for 424 so it came out six bucks a card this is the cheapest I've ever got a card like a real dispensary card because $15 for a half gram some of you guys live it up in like Michigan and [ __ ] isn't Michigan I don't remember who just legalize weed for the like me I cannot figure it out at all but um I heard somebody told me like half gram carts there we're going for like 60 55 $60 or some [ __ ] like that dude I love marijuana but I cannot spend that much on weed so getting carts that are 15 dollars for a half gram so probably like 30 $40 for a full gram would be insane and so many people would have some more access to it and hopefully one day we can get that figured out maybe I mean concentrate like dabs and stuff that's not that bad I mean flour is pretty pricey you can get yeah it depends depends on your tears but you know there's a lot of variables of course but I don't know I hope one day they forgot a way to maybe if it becomes federally legal they'll be able to lower the prices because they're a little high yeah um I also want to know if you're still here what is your favorite brand of Kart or like if you don't have like a favorite brand like what's your favorite strain like across across the board for all the brands um I don't have favorite strain to be honest I make these reviews and I review these cards just to tell you how they are and then I just completely forget so that's something alright let's do number three oh that reminded me of my girlfriend Leslie you should kept doing this to me I don't know why anyway guys I am I'm really I um if you live in any state that has a key relief dispensary that's uh oh so that's these guys right here hey they're key relief I'm just so [ __ ] stupid that's your logo that doesn't even say their name I am so sorry and I gotta grab my iPod so rate purely great store they're running pretty great deals um you get 20 area for every twenty dollars you spend you had a dollar back so that's pretty cool so I got eight dollars off for these things I spent like [ __ ] 26 bucks for two close what's can't go wrong all right well fair shot ask you your [ __ ] dope you're better than all the other people Logan see you on the next one deuces", "Bk1KABHZhgA": "hi moaners welcome back to my channel if you're new here my name is rose today's video will be about my very first vape a review and yeah CBD FX vape kit so I ordered it it came fast delivery was kind of fast I did receive this on Friday the 10th so I've had it for almost a week now this is the kit it came in just a regular brown box very discreet it didn't have CBD or anything like that on the outside packaging which is good in case you know you didn't want anyone in your business but yeah so let me go ahead and tell you what came with the kit it came in this box again like little magnetic so this is the vapor the charger and then the cartridge it came with two magnets and this is what it looks like I absolutely love it it's very small it fits in like the palm of my hand perfectly I love love how little it is yeah and it's it's heavy it's it feels very solid and high-quality I do really enjoy that so again in the package it came with the vape and then this cartridge here pulls out it does have that magnet that came with it on the bottom in the USB cord to charge it just plugs into like your computer or like laptop or something to charge I did get a free hand sanitizer okay and I actually really enjoyed this hand sanitizer it's very lightweight like it doesn't make you sticky or anything it smells real like alcoholic like clean so I do actually really like this little freebie here I keep it on my desk and so that's what came with the kit I did have to order actual separate CBD oil and so this is the one I chose just a regular 60 milligram and this is how it looks it comes with like a little dropper which is very convenient because when filling the cartridge there's a little fill line that you would have to fill it up to so the dropper makes it very easy again since I've had it since the 10th so I probably have used it almost every day except for today probably like five six puffs a day it does definitely relax me and again I only have a sixty milligram I'm very very new to all of this vaping and things like that stay tuned to the end of the video to see exactly what kind of persuade me to get a vape and try it again I'm not a smoker I don't smoke cigarettes I don't smoke weed so this is all new to me so yeah let me go ahead and set some out of oil let me go ahead and show you on camera how easy it is to fill it so I'm gonna go ahead and open the oil and it's so like the taste of this oil it doesn't have this is not a flavored oil they do have a bunch of flavors and I'm definitely going to go ahead and order them now that I've tried this I've watched reviews and I'm gonna I'm gonna list below the guy that actually did the review that um he was so dope I can't remember his name humble smoke stay high something like that but I listed below he was amazing he did a review on the same kit and he was part of the reason why I was like you know what I'm definitely gonna try it but back to this oil this is not flavored it's just I don't really know what it is I guess it's original but um it's 60 milligrams it does they do have different milligrams let me slow down it they do have different milligrams 120 to 5500 in them like a thousand I heard the milligrams make it stronger so again I'm a beginner so I started with sixty but this oil here it's so light on my mouth like I don't even know this it's so light in like it's like kind of refreshing um yeah it's kind of refreshing and it doesn't burn my throat which is a big plus for me because that's part of the reason why I don't smoke weed marijuana just because it burns my throat usually I don't like it but anyway so with this oil it's really light and refreshing it definitely does call me again I will be definitely ordering some more flavors as well as higher milligrams just to test it out so let's get back to go ahead and refill this again it does have a fill line real quick tip fill it under the fill line because when you insert this back into the glass here it it you know expands so it will overflow if you fill it too much so tip is fill it under the actual fill line so here's the dropper just gonna go ahead and pay attention to the fill line and it it smells it smells real clean like I don't even know how to explain it I absolutely love it so I do do recommend this here alright so I filled it here and then you put this the mouthpiece right in here and screw it on it's that easy and when I first got it all I had to do was add the little magnet and do the same thing so you go ahead and screw it add it back in here and there you go so with this the reason why I got the handheld versus the pen being a beginner you would think you'd want to start with the pen I don't like the way I hold like blunts or cigarettes I've you know as a young young kid I tried one sticker in my life almost died I've smoked a few wraps with you know friends and my husband but I don't I don't look right like let me show y'all like I look like a [ __ ] fool trying to hold the damn blunt or cigarette like I just feel real like it's not steady between my fingers like ha like I'm gonna drop the ash and burn my leg like no we're not gonna do pens even though the pens don't have ashes you get my [ __ ] point I don't look right I don't know how to do it so the handheld was much easier for me this is the on and off button you've got to press it five times consecutively fast to turn it on and 5 to turn it off and then it lights up like this and you hold it to heat the oil I guess I might have turned it off so now it's on and the blue light is is on can you see it and then like I love it I might have filled it a little bit too much I can feel the oil but then again that's right you got to be careful how you fill it but yeah so I absolutely I love it it's so clear as you see on camera I suck at smoking I suck at it but this is my first time and I wanted to come and share this because again as the first time they smoker anything finding videos that are like beginner beginner friendly is very difficult a lot of people are very you know good at they that's what they do they smoke they'll do CVD they'll do THC they know how to do all of these things so being a very beginner I was like it was really hard for me to find a video that was my level so I thought that it would be really good for me to make this video and plus I absolutely love the product and I want to share so yeah just real quick in like it does smoke a lot more and better than that but again I suck at doing this it's my first time but I do highly highly recommend this I actually was telling my friend about it she went and brought a whole bunch of stuff that she's a beginner smoker as well so you know I definitely recommend this so let's see what else do I have to say here yeah so refill it's discreet press it five times on five times off it is relaxing it's so light like I don't and I just learned how to blow it through my nose literally I just learned that I know that's real stupid like really you didn't know I never knew how to blow get the smoke to come out my nose never my friends was like just swallow I swallowed my throat starburns and I'm coughing I look stupid and get a headache like oh that's why I don't smoke this here is a lifesaver I absolutely love it so yeah highly recommend that I'll go ahead and leave the link below so you can check it out as well the price it was really inexpensive I think the whole entire kit which came with the vape the the cartridge the magnet and the charger was like $39 and then the additional oil that you had so supply yourself with I think was $19.99 but again I did get the original flavor with the lowest milligrams that was $19.99 but I was just on there today even like the flavored one that I want to get in 250 milligrams is only $29 so yeah it's definitely a deal let me go on and share what persuaded me to even start to look at vaping and smoking again I am getting older now before I was so against it like I know people that smoked all their lives I have nothing against it I don't it's not that I don't like it it's just isn't for me I've also seen the side effects of addiction I know that sounds weird with marijuana everyone's like addiction but addiction to the point where it takes over your life where you spend all every dollar on it you're not the same person without it things like that all of that kind of like made me like oh [ __ ] I don't want no parts of this but now that I'm getting older I do feel that I would I want to enjoy my downtime I want to enhance my downtime so whether that be smoking marijuana vaping CBD even edibles I do enjoy edibles occasionally I wanted to go ahead and expand my knowledge on it so I bought this book y'all know I bought a book y'all know I bought a book I'm in the red robe did you think I wasn't going to mention a book come on now ya know me better than that so I bought a book I bought this book way before I bought my vape but this is why I bought my baby a Woman's Guide to cannabis using marijuana to feel better look better sleep better and get high like a lady so this is the book that I bought that actually made me start to even think about buying myself something so let me go ahead and tell you what got me the reason why I was like you know what [ __ ] all it is forget what everyone thinks forget it all the negative right let me do what I'm gonna do for me and yeah I'm a little I'm a late bloomer I'm 30-something 30-something you feel me and I'm starting late but that's okay because this book here really helped me put it into perspective so it says here oh and the author is Nikki fur do not I'm sorry Nikki if that is not your last name third her Fuhrer Nikki wrote it but anyways she says before I begin working the legal marijuana industry I was an independent bookstore owner now I am working as hard as ever but my shoulders are relaxed my back doesn't hurt and my depression is a distant memory now that I am in my 40s cannabis makes me feel prettier and more relaxed than I ever was in my 20s or 30s I am still a bookseller at heart and I didn't have a book to recommend to new cannabis patients sure there's a lot of books out there marijuana cookbooks gardening books and such but I couldn't find a book that I could give to my mother for her first trip to a dispensary so that her saying that she was in her 40s and just now started smoking I was like yo it's never too late to get high but yeah so this book I definitely recommend this book as well this is like a two and one and two and one for yah um yeah I definitely recommend this book it has hella information about cannabis again I am a very beginner I am still on the CBD and that's okay because I read in here that CBD let me read you what it says here it says THC the queen bee CBD the valedictorian period Pope so yes CBD was like the wanna be high but now that it's mainstream the way it has it is so much more enhanced and so much better and it just has so many benefits that a lot of people didn't recognize because they always thought it was like the bootleg kind but it's not so she is now crowned the valedictorian let's see so she goes in to say she does have things in here about CBD but again most of the book is about THC campus it has some recipes in it so here she goes on to talk about vape pens and all types of vapes the handheld vaporizer if a vape pen is for beginners the handheld vaporizer is intermediate-level they can be used with flour or concentrate they still fit in your clutch vapors do baked vapors do not smell like smoke so it is very discreet and perfect yeah so she goes on to talk about what kind of vapors she uses yeah and like I said she has edible extractions cooking with concentrates she has some stuff in here about the different types of cannabis like I had no idea there's like bubble hash dry sift shaker shape I don't know what that says see I'm a beginner I have no idea wax crumble live resin like she goes into hella detail like I absolutely recommend this book even if you are like you know major smoker this is still like very educational because I'm sure you don't know everything but yes so that is my wrap-up for today let me show y'all what I keep my vapor in in my purse but yeah like I said it's so little it's so little I'm coming back to this I have to it's so little it fits in here with my oil and the charger when I'm on the go all they're gonna just pop this out and just show like I went by the water the other day read my book and I was vaping I absolutely recommend it right so thank you for watching peace and blessings peace and blessings I hope you enjoyed the video give it a thumbs up and make sure you subscribe hit the bell so you can get notifications when I upload and I shall see you late thank you again thank you [Music]", "cQyCv_q4eLA": "[Music] what's up everybody it's your boy heaven sent this is my smoking channel today's video i'm going to be doing a cart review for you guys it's a canadian cart uh it's lemon cherry gelato by farms canada carts premium vape carts net weight 0.5 grams has a little government warning on the back um cost me about 30 bucks for the half gram at the dyspo 28 dollars to be exact let's go ahead and uh pop it open you just slide it down like this and then the carts right inside pop it i don't really smell anything coming from the cart i got my ooze twist battery right here blue and red i'm gonna put it on [Music] the rubber gasket on the top and the rubber gasket on the bottom i'll take both of those off got the top one off see if i can taste anything coming from the carp i taste absolutely nothing coming from this car wow this isn't this isn't a good sign i taste zero flavors coming from this car i've never tasted zero flavors coming from a cart before wow nice oil kind of looks like live resin it's not live resin though i believe it's distillate but um i'm gonna go ahead and uh start hitting this card the only way i know how i'm gonna take a blinker you guys see if it gets me faded see if i cough see what happens you guys hopefully it makes me die hopefully we'll see cheers [Music] it's going to be a whole lot of trouble today believe that okay so like i kind of expected it doesn't taste like lemon or cherry i didn't expect it it doesn't taste like lemon or cherry i kind of expected there to be a slight lemon taste or a slight cherry taste of the cart but no it's mostly a gelato taste it's mostly a pure cannabis flower taste to the carrot [Music] so if you're picking up this card expecting a fruity flavors off of it you're going to be disappointed kind of like i was or kind of like i am right now but um that it's not too bad i'm used to smoking carts with live resin terpenes or cannabis derived terpenes botanical terpenes are not a problem fruit terpenes are only uh it's added to the distillate cards sometimes and i understand that but um yeah let's uh go ahead and hit it one more time i'll go ahead and uh rate the taste rate the potency and then uh yeah as far as for the looks i'm not sure if it's live resin or distillate it looks like live resin um it says nothing about being um live resin or distillate on the cart but if it is live resin it's not bad at all um for what it is 79 thc not bad if it's distillate i'd like to see the thc percentage uh put up a little higher um if it's a live resin i'm going to rate the looks probably like a a 10 out of 10 but if it's a distillate gotta rate those looks probably like a seven out of ten i'm unsure as to what it is if it's distillate with live resin terpenes or if it's just live resin it may just be live resin you guys um but i'm not sure if anybody knows in the comment section um be sure to let me know i'm gonna go ahead and hit it a couple times and let me let you guys know what the taste is like [Music] [Music] yeah it's um mostly a cannabis taste entirely a cannabis taste no lemon or cherry or any fruit terpenes used [Music] if you're someone who enjoys the taste of cannabis you're definitely going to enjoy these cards i myself will enjoy the car regardless um i just thought that it may have had lemon or cherry inside of it um but i was wrong um as far as for a live resin cart it's really good the potency is uh right up there with what it should be um so i'd give it uh i already rated it for that um no i didn't read it for potency i rated it for looks for potency if it's a distillate then i have to give it a seven again but if it's a live resin i'm gonna give it a nine for potency because it's um pretty decent it's just not the best [Music] i gotta say nowadays it is becoming harder to tell whether you have a live resin or distillate product even if you have a distillate product sometimes it may say live resin on it or even if you have a live resin product sometimes they may say distilled on it um things are getting um pretty uh difficult to determine in the cannabis industry but that's just how everything's going for a reason [Music] i don't want this video to take too long guys i just want to give you a review on canadian carts lemon cherry gelato overall not too bad of a car pretty decent when i pick it up again i don't think so i stick with uh other companies that are more just a better quality and it tastes a little bit better to me but um overall not a bad car you guys enjoyed this video so far make sure to slap the like button down below you guys have any comments or criticisms like always let me know in the comment section i'll make sure to respond to you guys as soon as i can but if you guys enjoyed the overall content make sure to subscribe to my channel so i know to keep on producing content that's similar to this until next time you guys my name's heaven this is my smoking channel peace out", "fsFMKz-OLBg": "hey what's up I'm just gonna be talking about a new strain of cannabis that I got from urban culture yesterday this is gelato by Verano and so I'll show you the nug really quick the pictures are probably a lot better there's actually a little bit of purple in this and the nut the flower is kind of like yellow with Keef and then it has some dark dark greens in there and a bit of light greens and not too many red hairs or orange hairs but a couple and they're curated really well they're cut really well and they look to be cured really well so that's good and I'll go ahead and read you the terpene profile potency THC is 0.92 percent THC a is twenty two point one four percent CBD a is 0.12 percent CBG is 0.22% CBG a is zero point seven nine percent and the total cannabinoid content is twenty four point one nine percent this is good because it has the CBG CBD and CBD a in there some of the other cannabis strains that i've gotten recently don't have the CBG especially in there and occasionally they won't have CBD as well terpene profiles beta Pennines zero point zero six nine percent limonene zero point two eight seven percent lean Ahlul zero point zero six one percent beta carotene zero point three eight zero percent human zero point two nine nine percent and total terpene content is one point zero nine six percent so what I'm going to do is um I guess we're going to go ahead and use this lo Luca piece and so we'll go ahead and load up a little bit of this and I'll just do a quick review of everyone's morning's going well by the way I did a little bit of house housekeeping housecleaning for my parents all right I've got my Ravens later so we're gonna be using that today Wow it's got like a really earthy piney flavor and like a diesel II flavor - its got like a diesel or the pining diesel flavor and oops yeah really diesel II and actually super diesel like scan them to the extreme and well I'll take this out later yeah that uh left like a really potent taste of diesel in my mouth not in a bad way but it's just like what it is and really like piney - um okay I'll have to sit with it for a little bit and then I'll come back and do a review on what I think of it all right well I had the urge to clean earlier after smoking this and I cleaned quite a bit so it was kind of an uplifting experience and um now I'm kind of coming down a little bit and it's more grounding and um I yeah I'm just like coming back down a little bit I basically cleaned the whole entire top floor and so I feel good and energized and uh but I'm just like kind of settling down a little bit more this is a good a good strain I don't know if I've ever tried the verrano products before necessarily but um yeah it's it's pretty good I'd give it a recommendation it's not like too overwhelming of a high or anything it's good a good mellow feeling and I was able to do some productive stuff so I'd give it a recommendation yeah peace you", "f0jmB2kDslE": "hey what's up everybody out there it's your boy Tommy jokes and today we're gonna do a little stream review on a pure earth partridge and it's gonna be gelato how to go out this morning and pick up a nice little cartridge was running low so right up to Nirvana and shout to navona for always the great pricing the great patient service definitely one of the best in the valley in Arizona but uh jump into this cartridge like I said today around with gelato aka Larry Bird which is a nice 50/50 hybrid from the cookies family believe this is a bit mint cookies crossed with sunset sherbert so definitely Bay Area heavy but yeah let's jump into it it comes in this nice little coffin style which I always like that they do but uh kind of rip off the bottom here open it up nice little nice little style there anyway like the mouthpiece definitely a nice little suction style there pop off the bottom there so get this thing going not like I carry two pens usually one for the emergency backup you know just in case this one dies on me but I like the more temperature setting so that way I can hit it at you know the temperature setting that I choose rather than not just pull it until I feel so you thought you know I was going and shot the giorgio Pellegrino in the shot man don't listen to in the background over here definitely taste the fruitiness definitely don't lie to close a lot oh very nice very nice definitely one thing that is part of this that most people understand that there they're not full spectrum that broad spectrum which means that they're only attacking a small percentage of the cannabinoid system they're not giving you 100% high but you wouldn't be getting away with that you would be go with getting or smoking a flower but it does the job very tasteful a fruity definitely men cheese goes up by telling jokes anyway so next time I appreciate you between an inch please hit that subscribe button drop a comment like dislike be something man anyway until next time", "9B7dLmpAxNw": "yo what is up guys welcome back to another video this your boy

have all you cannabis connoisseurs and enthusiasts with me today I have a classic strain in vape cartridge form for you today pineapple express baby coming at you from the good people a good supply this is a THC heavy vape cartridge coming in at seven hundred sixty four point one milligrams of THC less than five percent milligrams CBD today about seventy six percent THC in less than a percent CBD so as I said heavy-hitting hybrid THC cartridge coming at you from good supply I'm very excited to try this out pineapple Express is one of my favorite strains of all time probably one of yours too it's classic its legendary they make goddamn movie out of this thing one of my favorite movies probably one of your students hilarious I was very excited to see this in my own cannabis shop even more excited when I found out this thing's going for 40 bucks 40 bucks for a 0.5 gram 510 thread vape cartridge that's the best I've seen in the Canadian market personally so far so I snapped it up right away very excited to check you know he's gonna show you here on the side of the package I'll hold it up for the camera hopefully it doesn't bore but it does let me know what is let me let you know what it says it says our oil what's inside cannabis distillate plant-based terpenes no additives our product the cartridge premium ceramic or anti leaked technology direct airflow system you know I appreciate this kind of information being put on the package I like to know that it's plant-based terpenes not artificial I like to know that it's cannabis dislike to know what's in the cartoon you know more information is not a bad thing I would like to see some other companies follow suit on this good job good supply I like that so without further ado I'm gonna break the seal on this bad boy and figure out how to open it again you know it is some kind of heavy little feels thick cardboard packaging here feels a little wasteful but yeah it's a Canadian market let's open it looks like you pinch the sides and push yeah there we go so here comes the reveal for y'all and there we have it um it's nice-looking let's rescue it from this package yes some heavy thick heavy-duty cardboard packaging for a little item this has got to change um yeah this is a nice-looking cartridge let me hold it up for you all there oh it's got a nice metallic finish on it silver I see a THC logo there I know as it said pineapple Express on that green band and good supply I think at the bottom hopefully that's not blurry for you more importantly though I know it looks great check it out that oil is nice and clear it's a good color hopefully it's coming through clear for you because it looks clear and good that looks smokeable I'm excited that mouthpiece condom and rubber nub oh look we dropped it and yeah it's a nice looking cartridge let's get it on the old standard 510 battery here and the excitement grows as intensifies as we screw it on I'm really looking forward to this everybody I talk know it's tasty hmm yeah that's pretty good you know his little plug there but first John just came out of the package tastes really good kind of a citrusy sweet taste on the intake there and kind of held up on the way out mixed with a little bit of a herbalist herbally kind of taste there kind of herbal and citrusy sweet wouldn't necessarily say pineapple but let's check it out again yeah it's yummy man yep so sweet citrusy taste he definitely tastes that on when they first take a drink and then the exhale it definitely holds up and yeah it's kind of horrible I like it kind of tastes like smoking flower you know it's not too bad it's a good taste in the vape cartridge you know a little distracted here because I've noticed you know this is only 1/2 fault here it's kind of a big cartridge it's dawning on me here that this must be a 1 gram cartridge because it's a point 5 gram you know this lid in there they must be making one gram cartridges in the future that got me excited so yeah breaking news one gram cartridge is coming up looks like from a good supply but you know back to the flavor back to the taste this is pretty good to get a pretty good vapor I see it's not harsh pretty smooth yeah very good vapor production and yeah that's a good flavor I'm really good to enjoy vaping this over the next couple days and as always come back but you know what I think then all right so the final verdict on the old pineapple express some good supply here you know I've been vaping the hell out of this thing the last four days I've run a readout and tell you what I like he didn't like about it I liked a lot about it to be honest favorite thing about it was a taste flavor was great out of this world spine Apple Express baby from the first drag to the last flavor holds up never waned and never weak really good really strong you nailed a good supply you did a good job I can't always say that about all cartridges the flavor held up throughout the whole thing we really get and the flavor that was there really loved it I'm big fat it's pineapple Express it's great you're gonna love the taste the effects really nice effects you know it's a little milder than you might think at a 76 percent THC level so it's not a super heavy hitter you're not gonna get blitzed big stoned out of your mind but it's a good all day strain it's a great way can be extreme it's a sociable strain very conversational motivate you get through your day really happy up with the kind of feeling throughout your day that's a good strain you know what I mean I love it it's a good strain of having a pandemic you got to keep your chin up your spirits up there's a little tank of getting your spirits up that's for sure so you know I really enjoyed it's a little milder than some people might like but I thought it was great really good all day straight it's a hybrid strain I find it to be a lot more sativa meaning like I say it's all day long stream it's not going to let you know you're not gonna feel really tired it's not gonna burn you out really good strain three four hits on this thing lasts about an hour hour and a half before you kind of feel like you might want to have another pull fantastic good job good supply I really enjoyed it only downer to this thing oh you know another thing I really like is I like the look of this I mean look at that it's just nice right it's really shiny really metallic nice look I'm a sucker for a good look looks good but let's get into the only negative I have here well I got one small negative this little green band that you got down here kind of blocks how much oil you got left in the cartridge that's a bit of a bombing event it's alright it's not that big a deal the biggest deal that I have with this is it doesn't seem to last too long it's four days later in a mountain you know what I'm saying I mean like I noticed it moved around real easily in there it's kind of a thinner oil and a thinner oil is gonna vape alittle bit quicker so might want to take that into consideration with your value proposition with you know hey it's 40 bucks 4.5 grand cartridge but it doesn't seem to last that long I don't know personally I still recommend it it's alright I mean you know I was vaping it a lot you know not as much as I have other ones that have lasted longer but you know your mileage may vary out there as always but for what you get I recommend it I'd buy it again if I saw it in a store I'd buy it again I really liked it really impressed I enjoy the price enjoy the effects enjoy the taste I enjoy pineapple Express from good supply good job I liked it so hope you like the videos thanks for stopping by and watching I hope you get something out of it fun in Ford of it informative entertaining I don't know thanks

"UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom

this is chakra the promoting chakra status so let's open the vape pen it slides out i'm so excited to try this uh it's stuck here we go oh it's just a charger with a sleek pen all right see it looks like this all right and then this is the charger that goes with it a usb charger if you had any of this before you just screw that in i guess do i have to charge it now is there any instructions oh here we go has a little bit of instructions they gave me silver i don't know if i chose silver specifically but on off settings push button five times change heat settings push button three times preheating set settings push button two times charging up to four hours or when light turns green okay so i don't know if it's charged yet doesn't say and this is my oil it looks like this they had this one that was called fruit fruity loops i was gonna try but i didn't know if this fit inside the thing i wanted to use but look it looks like this and the top is rounded and the oil is in there i don't know if you've seen that but um the oil's in there in the reservoir it's pretty cool all right let's stop this cheddar chatter and try it hopefully it's charged i really hope so i'm gonna go ahead and screw this in 0.5 ml that's how much okay okay i don't know how tight i'm supposed to why is it crooked is it crooked this is weird all right okay so what is it how do you do this charging press button two times i hope it's on oh on off one two three four five oh look it was red now one two it's preheating now it's preheating pictures of products are not to scale cartridge not included how come this tip is different from the other tips the other tips look like they're like more not not as rounded is it done now what do you do i don't know how to do this you have to hold the pen you have to hold the button i mean so bubble gum tastes like a weird light version of medicine let me try again it's like i don't know what it's supposed to do at the moment this is just interesting it's like i feel like it's something supposed to happen like right away it's light i taste a little tint of bubble gum but it's very subtle very subtle i don't see no nothing as of now but it's pretty cool i don't know let's try one more that's cool though maybe i'll feel an effect later i feel like i feel like i don't know if it's the placebo effect but i feel like a calmness settling or i could just be bugging out i don't know but this is cool i guess i'll do an update on another video to see my thoughts on it like some vlog type stuff so that's it that's all i have for you today i'm gonna do some more videos so check those out i'll see you next time bye you", "i_AALGrBmuA": "let's have a look at the herb the 5 G from Eric this simple to use one button device is a great little unit for traveling let's take a closer look inside the box you'll find one herb for 5 g 1 USB charging cable one packing tool 1 glass mouthpiece and one cleaning brush the first thing you'll want to do with the unit is sterilize it to do that press the button on the side five times to turn it on press the power button to get to the maximum temperature the herb for five G has a three minute auto shutoff so turn it back on and repeat this process three more times to complete this sterilization this will get rid of any of the manufacturing oils which may have gotten inside of the unit as a result of putting it together to load your unit first remove the mouthpiece from the heating chamber load your botanical into the chamber using your sous scoop once you have completed this replace the mouthpiece and you are ready to go the herb the 5g has three temperature settings that you can cycle between by pressing the button once Green is 390 degrees Fahrenheit Blue is 405 and white is 420 degrees Fahrenheit once you've selected your desired temperature let it heat up the light will glow a solid color when you're ready to go to wrap this up I'd like to tell you about some of the key features of the hurva 5g which make it such a phenomenal little device the hurva 5g is incredibly discrete hold it in your hand and it disappears and keep it on the lowest temperature setting for smaller clouds and even more discreteness the second is the ceramic heating chamber the flavor of your herb is not lost and it is quite a smooth draw add the glass mouthpiece and your flavor will be even better the third is the 5 G's ease of use with one button operation microUSB charging and a simple plug-and-play mouthpiece it couldn't be any easier to use all in all the hurva 5g is a great budget vaporizer that is a perfect starting point for any connoisseur I'm Alex 40 vape TV we hope you enjoyed this video and found it useful and for all you connoisseurs out there keep them",

extreme amount of euphoria and physical relaxation along with enough mental stimulation keep you active throughout your day given that it's named after a delicious dessert you can expect a beautifully sweet taste abide so if you have a sweet tooth this strangest might be the one for you [Music]", "_woZ8IzEH50": "dabbe connection here with the Eden diamond line gelato cartridge this one is a higher-end cartridge as you can tell from the packaging here before we get to the cartridge itself it's quite well done they've got a nice finish here so it catches the light real nice so even the cartridge itself is in a higher quality plastic tubes and the usual just plain clear plastic with a top top you've got yeah solid white plastic tube here that's got a childproof cap on here little difference that makes and the cartridge itself is a custom design according to their website that's a proprietary it's got these two air inlets here which while the cartridge does clog on occasion you'd think that the air holes would impede the ability to clear those clogs they don't at all the cartridge itself performs great you see it's got the Eden printed on the chamber here and they've got their symbol printed on the mouthpiece here overall pretty great job overall on the presentation and the cartridge itself it's really couldn't ask for much better it's gotten it's on the pricier side as I mentioned it's a higher-end cartridge but you get everything you just specked out of a higher-end cartridge it's got good flavor the high comes on quick and it's heavy but it's pleasant it's never overwhelming unless you take more than a couple hits then it can get a little overwhelming but that's your own fault and yeah it it's pretty great it hits pretty heavy too which you know kind of come to expect those that aren't see cells are oftentimes pre light on the hits but this one isn't as I'll show you right now as you can see is it's pretty heavy you almost couldn't ask for better than that hmm see cell itself sometimes doesn't deliver that also there's no burnt flavors at all toward the end of the card here taste overall has been really clean like very natural sort of flavor to it not any sort of bitter tones nothing chemically or unnatural about it you can see here that the fluid is a bit of a different color than the usual and that's not a trick of the light it genuinely is it's almost more like a rose color rather than the usual green or yellow and I it's probably has to do with the proprietary extraction technique of some kind I don't really know but overall the oil cell if it doesn't drain overly quickly and there's nothing to complain about with it at all and even at the higher price point that it is 40 50 bucks a card the thing elasti a several-day is easily and I'd say it's a great deal highly recommended one of the best I've come across hopefully that helps to inform your purchase and hope you guys all have a great day",

another one for you this is the insane gelato no I'm saying this is a strain review by the way you know it's been a while since we've done these but we decided to do that in-house in store and treat you to what we got on our menu and right now we're about to pop off the insane gelato it's a cross between sunset sherbert then mint cookies and it's you know it's that fire it's that gas what can I say you know I'm not just saying it cuz it's here but I am saying it because it's here cuz we pride ourselves on having the quality flavors here for you this is you know pretty much got all the characteristics and traits of a gelato purple trichome ish and white ash and all that good goodness that you would expect when you blaze this in a joint or a blunt or whatever the hell you know you choose to do it at come down try some for yourself don't take my word for it even though my word is good for it you'd be [ __ ] up to not listen but this is the packaging it will be an insane packaging right here for the insane gelato this has been another strain alert presented by b-real TV and dr. green thumbs peace the [ __ ] out stay blazing we're gonna blaze some of this right now in st. gelato strain alert we're gonna fire this one up joined by a zone many do piano DJ Nels here we go hey listen Pedro gets at 9 for this one yeah that one was not as R ok if an ID for this role right here but that you know the roles not deal today it is the in st. gelato and the taste jumps off on like smacking you in the [ __ ] face you don't how like it's creamy you know what I mean in your own bus yeah and it's it's it it's got that [ __ ] gelato impact man I gotta tell about that for you can smell it right when you lit it very well when you lit it it's right it's sweet but not in a fruity way of sweet more like an ice ice cream yeah I always felt a lot oh it was like a good coffee week yeah for sure yeah let me ask you this do you think there's like we'd use if you could smoke with tea that's better better with teeth and better with coffee and vice versa yeah there's probably components like just how mango has an effect whenever you're high - up you're high there's probably affects or that's please and coffee and antioxidant yeah edgy like be triggered in your body chemistry I don't think so yeah I think I think like you know some some strings like you said I think gelatos were the ones that complements coffee and [ __ ] yeah that things like the og is more tourists like tea she like green tea yeah [ __ ] like that no I'm not like the black tea black tea I think that goes up in them you do like a citrus one with the tea to like a chain but not awesome or is there like I can't you can't do awesome get off the subject but this Jihlava that's one you know work I'm gonna be honest I used to think that these are names of these weeds was like a just a gimmick right but the gelato was actually one of the first strands to like prove to me that like this [ __ ] actually does taste like creamy it's like tinnitus there's a cream to three minutes to the electrodes to eat it's old me but there's a that it wasn't a give there's there's like clean sweet like you know like ice cream and pastry tight ship then there's the Jolly Rancher type of [ __ ] sweet like that you know it's like Tory [ __ ] like that you know that's like what oh she is in and this gelato and and stuff you don't like strange like gelato they're more creamy and in my opinion in my taste to me nice move it's smooth like you said then there's something our tarp yeah sour taste in your mouth or whatever yeah a lot of people love the gelato look this nice purple with the full of yeah and it's hard to pass it's hard to pass that joy yeah yeah body this to your head you don't want the tarps for your coffee like [ __ ] that are you good those don't eat the bread you smoke that with your coffee you know because it's it's like having a biscuit if I lose joint is becoming like four number over 1000 that's the move I mean that's what my fused coffee if Darren already hurt did they already have no like you could take a girl out for coffee in debt I don't know what it is Oh joints and I like my coffee coffee gelato juice it's kind of like a contrast there though because if you did yeah because you would have THC in the coffee which normally boosts you up so you're gonna have that yeah coaster ride of ups and downs right there you know like we take it yes and we drink it but I need this to go up and that's it go down it's like a balance in a lot of gelatos produced like by a bunch of different folks you know to me because there's a lot of people to do it now it gets really good in the halfway point of the joint like it tastes good and on the top of the joint but when you get halfway to it that's where that full flavor comes labor just clumps in like you know cracking now I don't know if you've explained this to people yet but but the whole insane in the house it does that mean that everything's crossed with insane OG or is just insane family is just insane this is just plain July yeah that is a July July biasing yeah do not go by insane it's so smooth but that's you know it gets you man yeah it's [ __ ] heavy that that's what we do we do heaviness we're gonna go ahead and finish this joint and enjoy it it's been another strain with Murph make sure you

reviews team doclet middle of everyone and today we're going to be looking looking at the 5g vapor bottom feed mod the super squonk aramco or cruncher plunger there's my missus Kazem because that's the sound the main component there anyway we've got said I've got sent this one excuse me and just before the 1 inch for production so I'll know the manufacturer and they sent me this one to him other ways like calm and wanted feedback off me and on the rest of it and I've been using it ever since so I've probably had it a month at the time filming maybe three weeks let me have a quick thing I have to say of all the squonk is that I've tried it is right up there in my favors I fucking love it I like the wood feel it is wood real wood but I like the way the wood feels I like the short throw button I like the positive way the door fits and and Stacia you know it don't come out I like the super smooth 5/10 I like the way that it's I like every fucking thing about it it's a winner winner chicken fucking dinner in my book yeah so another quick thing stop with the basics look it comes in this lovely wooden box with the old scratch and sniff verification bit on the bottom and inside you get just Wonka Blanco obviously it comes in three different finishes you got the red word I was just vaping on this darker mahogany okay - I don't fucking know I've called it mahogany on the web summit and a beach call it one alight want more line the box which I've not got one in show you you get a spare bottle complete with this top cap and a spare pipe delivery pipe you get little bag of goodies which includes an allen key some rings that you can fit on top of the 510 if you having problems sealing your audio down and also you get a couple of different thicknesses of plastic little washers that sit underneath the 510 so you can adjust the i/o the center pin get it just fucking Bob on the audio you using the two that I'm running I've not had to change that but I've shit one down and put it back together it's a piece of piss it's gonna take you a couple of minutes with basic fucking tools yeah nice one you also get a little card it's got the old dirt scanning thing on there and details about to enter a competition through social media and you get your little bit of shredded paper there too to finish it off nice and I know you don't buy for call for the box but I was very impressed myself so I'm just going to look at the bottle because unlike most of the swampers out there these comment as standard with the bottle fitted under the spare and a load of fucking that's right at the bottom of that troops again way loads more plastic tube than you need and the bottles a super really super soft silicon so that's a bonus also this top stainless little ring really logo on nice George but it splits when you want to do it and the bottle goes through and over the top of it so it makes its own seal gives you something firm to hold on to while you're fucking about filling it up and all that shit my lovely lovely little touch so I'm pretty sure they do different finishes in the bottles although we've not gone it I'll have a word on to the main event I guess and real nice 510 with a brass Center in there thus adjustable is we said with its different spaces lovely sliding door that fits that's just beautiful of me just buta it's fucking great got the two magnets at the bottom and the two magnets in the bottom of the door so like I said before once you close it all it's not fucking it's not coming open you know already is solid and lovely bottle super soft silicon for your squonk including triple interaction have that out you've got this solid metal strip for your battery connector and you've got matching one on the top that goes under the 510 yeah so it's a fully mechanical mod super that's got silver plating it's got a raised point for your battery and it's got heat shrink it is but the looks of it it keeps it all from shorting out if your beautiful one come when it comes to your fucking back to her out don't be a little insulator come real get it inside the bond back into the botton to stop any heat getting through and your shorten issues or anything like that and I think you've got brass on the bottom of the 510 there as well live with rush delivery thing super thick wood and it's fucking really fucking solid chunky monkey bit okay like the best things really simple really solid lovely little touches like this silver conductors and insulated button and the super soft bottle a bottle - five tens gold-plated there look and the door just finishes it off a tree now there was one of the review of the Thomas filming and it was not impressed by a few things one of which you didn't get a spare bottle well there you go there's a spare bottle and another was battle don't really get any at all unless you can play tennis with the fuck up it's fine nothing wrong there the third which I agree with one of the members of the team knucklehead he did a review on the group and I've got to agree it did put me off a little bit is this supercar logo on the back there not vile I don't think they needed it and it doesn't put me off but it looks pitiful confuse it yeah that said you'll see realized and the mayor nice authentic and when you're holding it you can't see that and if you really fucking bother can you sand it down and recover it on you cuz it's made of real wood so how does it perform well very funky well yeah I'm running my usual 0.07 mate build in this apocalypse style with a bottom feed pinning obviously sits on a strong cock and it's okay does it you know it's easy to stock up on cough there it will squeeze in just a little push in and that will delivered fresh juice to your coils let it go he might blow a bubble and squonk he might no painted-on mistake of players it's on but either way you fucking ready to rock and roll and it does it it delivers it's just like they've been on any Mac but you're not dripping you know using the bottom feed function to give you fresh juice every time so the flavor is fucking on point this is the new fucking wooden cabinet in that flavour fucking town steam train or the steam train to flavortown even I love it I really do like it and we've had a few in we've gone from cop of apricot Calexico we've got the boxes I might have something else I'm not sure check the website how you'll see for yourself but at the time of filming this is definitely right up there as I've said it's a fucking joy it's not too big it's sound nicely you know nobody sits in there well and truly it's all good it held firm against the two mouse strips and let little action look just that's your luck just a touch on the button but it springs back gray and there is no lock on the button but most of the max I use don't have lockable buttons if you wanted to put it in your pocket or put it in your bag or whatever you could either I take the battery out no-brainer or our brother on their team naka ladies as he puts liquid plastic between the contact and the switch on it but I don't fucking bother you know let's just a polite on it if I'm taking it out in the car courier me and and put it down somewhere in the car from using at home then it's just that on the side it I don't have to safeguard against accidental firing but the smallest part of fucking common sense it's stopped the fact that the button doesn't lock being a problem and if you can use a mech device whether it's secure whether it's tags whether it's series parallel or a strong couple uncle you need to be little bit of common sense you know so there you have it 5g VAP supercar bottom feed mod in my eyes it's a winner winner fuckin chicken dinner it really gets you on that steam train to flavortown and it is fuckin Bob on highly highly recommended to make it by making em doc she's cheap as well you know showing these wooden squonk azar fuckin goods there are hundreds of fucking pounds or dollars or yen or fucking depending where you're coming from morning contrack Mars or fucking euros hundreds of fucking quid is we say that's not fucking $44.99 that's a fucking takeaway for a family that is and we're nowhere that ends up the next day you have this for fucking long time Jonah and still enjoy a fucking great babe check them out if you're looking for this sort of thing you can't go for fucking wrong as I say so there you go thanks for watching just a quick one from me just to say how nice is oh and give you a bit of a walk around and a bit of a show through so big love everyone thanks for tuning in as always and remember people smoking kills vaping saves lives which do you choose see you all again real soon yet [Music]", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to

cons of both and which is actually worth it one of the interesting things about pods is with the tax area you get pods that are licensed out to processors like abstract here in Washington but Stevie actually makes their pods under their own brand of Stevie but is working with local processors and flour I'm sure you guys want to figure out which one is best for you so let's just jump into it first up we have the steezy this brand started in LA but has started growing rapidly to other states I purchased a prefilled cartridge for $30 from a local dispensary and the battery was free with a pod purchase after you get through the one-page instruction booklet and the micro USB cable you get to the actual Stevie which is a little bit more difficult than it looks to get out with bigger fingers yeah the battery again is very basic no buttons no visible indents just their logo on the side and a place to plug in many people have issues with fakes TZ pods and batteries this can be extremely harmful to your health but as long as you purchase from a trusted retailer and not your plug on Instagram you should be fine but they pride themselves on labs tested premium quality concentrates unlike their packaging which is not so premium due to their childproof compliant packaging but if you're a rebel like me you can open it differently you can also spot fakes TV pods by they're slightly different packaging including black trays holding the pod I did have one incident where the gold pins on the bottom of this easy pod didn't allow it to connect to the battery overall the stevesie is a great option for taking your concentrates on the go it's a simple and discreet device that makes even seasoned divers think twice about pods now let's take a look at the PAX era my dispensary didn't have any deals on the battery so I paid the full $30 the packaging on this is great and really makes the product feel premium and hey the even has a cutout for a big ten people longer instructions for all the features they packed into it and a sticker to wrap the brand as I mentioned before I went with more of a premium concentrate with AD abstract cartridge local processor you sell pods for around 30 to $75 each this can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality around you the packs has this useful feature on it that shows you the battery life and you can use to change settings on-the-fly the packs instantly became my everyday carry and is the one I would prefer having out of these two I really do enjoy the airflow and the strength of a hit from a cz but the smooth reliable hit from a packs and the customization of your experience along with a beautiful design and a feature-rich device the packs also connected via bluetooth to control temperature hit size and even play games if you want me to dive deeper into either one of these vape pens have a suggestion for another vape pen or just a question let me know down below if you want to see more cannabis related content

and they have had a vaporizer out for a number of years now but today they are launching their new AeroPro it's a new vaporizer that actually connects with these specific pods right here to be able to give their users more specific precise information test results on the CBD content the THC etc in the strains that they're smoking not only does it give you more transparency in the information but it also lets you personalize how you take hits so right here you can see that you actually get to personalize how hot you want to smoke a given strain and also you get to choose how many doses you want to take for every inhale not only does it give you full transparency on the test results on the strains that you're smoking but it also lets you personalize how you smoke it straight so that app actually stores your preferences for each strain so maybe one you want to burn hotter and one you want to just sip on over time right and basically by storing that information and sort of adapting over time to how you smoke you gain sort of a more personalized experience to you're smoking houses right and the arrow Pro actually provides haptic feedback so when you inhale you get a certain amount a certain dosage and if you inhale hard or soft it actually still tries to give you a sort of adapt it tries to give you about the same amount and it actually vibrates it gives me kind of haptic feedback when you finish the dose so it's kind of a cool contraption here it adds it a lot of transparency a lot of smarts it's really cool to see this shift over time where they're adding so many smart and so much transparency to this burgeoning industry for more of the latest tech at CES check out our youtube channel otherwise thanks for watching [Music]", "iNcCGMXn2bA": "[Music] we're here with bloom farms and we have some trinkets that you can smoke we here my man my somebody we live in a time right now we're portable vaporizers are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "82lMc64LNzw": "[Music] welcome back to terpiaz this video will cover week four flower until harvest in the previous episode of this series we covered the first four weeks of flower along with defoliation of the plants where we found out that one of the three blue gelato 41 plants was a hermaphrodite so we removed it and replaced it with a white widow plant if you want to catch up with the grow i'll link that video in the top right corner for you to check out since the last video all we have been doing is watering the plants when needed and following the green planet gp3 nutrient feeding chart all four plants are really stacking buds nicely with great resin production on three out of the four plants both of the remaining blue gelato 41 plants are amazing phenos very happy we decided to keep a clone of one of them for our future feminized seed project at this point the colas are starting to get very heavy and a second layer of trello sanding is really needed for the next round of plants it's a must to add the second layer of trellis netting that at the same time as installing the first layer we'll install the second layer at about eight to ten inches above the lower layer this will not only help with holding the colas up it will help with the light distribution once the coals start leading they start to shadow other bud sites which result in a lower yield at harvest [Music] time you can really see the yellowing from the flush i like to flush from anywhere between two to three weeks i found it pretty odd that the plant with the least amount of resin production was the one to go fully yellow both of the white widow plants will be harvested for ice water hash and both of the blue gelato 41 plants will be harvested for flower if you're new to the channel i upload videos every week covering indoor and outdoor grows solventless extractions products and equipment so if that's what you're into be sure to hit that subscribe button and turn on the post notification bell so you don't miss out when new content is posted [Music] [Music] [Music] to go over the products and equipment used for this grow we used three gallon pots filled with pro-mix hp as the growing medium we used the green planet gp3 nutrient lineup the grow tent is size 4x4 with a pair of tsl 2000 led grow lights from mars hydro two six-inch clip fans from hurricane for air circulation above the canopy and a tabletop eight-inch fan for air circulation below the canopy a six-inch carbon air filter and fan combo from vivosun for exhausting the air out of the tent all the items can be found in the video description with links provided along with some discount codes for some of the brands provided so be sure to use those to save yourself some money [Music] like i said earlier the white widow plants will be harvested for making ice water hash so we will harvest those two first all that is needed to be done is bucking the nugs off the stem since we did the defoliation in the middle of flour there isn't a ton of leaves to get rid of for harvest time the best way to harvest for making ice water hash is to put the nug straight into the freezer bag and put that into the freezer the faster you get your buds into the freezer the better some people go the extra mile and trim the buds fully you will see a better result overall when making the ice water hash but that is really up to you for how far you want to take it at minimum you'll want to get rid of all the fan leaves as they don't help any for yields yes i know many of you are still waiting for the ice water hash video it is coming so just trust me i just haven't had my schedule open up enough to make it happen as the process needs a bit more space than i have at my own location [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] now that the white widow plants are out of the way and in the freezer we can get to harvesting the much nicer blue gelato 41 plants these two plants are have amazing smell and are thick dense buds covered in resin to harvest these plants all i do is remove the large fan leaves that we were left behind from the defoliation giving them a light trim also after cutting each branch off the plant i keep in mind how i'm going to hang them for the drying process you'll want to leave a small branch or small bud site which allows you to hang over a trellis net or string whichever you choose just suspend the branches during the drying process you'll want to slow the drying process down so that takes between seven to ten days to fully dry then the buds are ready to be put into a jar for the curing process [Music] don't forget if you enjoyed the video or found it at all helpful to hit that

video that is based on special requests from a lot of our viewers that want to know exactly how to pick out the best oil tank now this is normally not a video I would do because out of all this assortment of oil tanks that I have put together is basically comprising of about everything on the market on our website we probably sell about five or six of them now I have these in our testing lab because I'm always testing them we do have a lot of extractors that we private label for that we might be making this these cartridges for that might not be available but one of the common questions that a lot of our users are having that really wanted to see this video up is I have a honey stick battery when I go to dispensary and I have an option of picking out prefilled cartridges how do I know which one's gonna be good or how it's gonna work you know so this video here is gonna go through from you being able to eyeball an oil 5-10 disposable cartridge and being able to tell bass have a good reasonable estimate of how it is gonna be able to perform what it will kind of features it's gonna have so that you can pick out the best oil vape tank for your battery now what is a disposable 510 thread cartridge so there's a lot of people out there who purchase these 510 thread oil cartridges to fill themselves and they say but if it's disposable can I only fill it one time so the short answer is no most of these tanks you can take if you're buying them empty you can fill them up four to five times without a problem however some of them you can only fill once and we'll go over that other times when you go to dispensary most of them already have oil in them so just because you have an amazing cartridge if you're buying a bad extract not even the best cartridge can make a bad oil taste good so however you can have good oil where the whole vaping experience gets dulled down or made bad or taste burnt from a bad cartridge so what this video is gonna help you do is it's gonna help you make some educated decisions when it comes to purchasing and selecting either the cartridge you're gonna fill at home or the cartridges that you're gonna pick up prefilled to know how they're gonna perform so let's start off by starting from the very top of the cartridges of how you're gonna be able to start making some identification so let's do a close up here and start off with when you look at the mouthpiece to see what the hole size is gonna be let's start at the tip and work our way to the bottom okay guys so here we have a close-up view we're gonna start at the very top of the cartridge so we can go in and start making some determinations so you can see I put together what I thought was the best assortment of pre fillable disposable tanks so the tops let's go to the very top first things first generally the wider bore you have on mouthpiece which is the part that you inhale through the more vapor you're gonna get the smaller that hole is you are gonna get either less vapor or it's gonna have a smoother easier transition into your mouth so let's let's take a shot from the top here just to show the differences in the size of the bores so basically as you could see from this basic stylus plastic tip car it has a very small Inlet hole even these stainless steel ones here right they have relatively small and some of them are larger when we work our way down you have these wide bore mouthpieces which have very wide inlets if you're a person who really likes to vape like this one is probably the widest if you like to get a big cloud and a massive hits that you can really draw air through with minimal amount of resistance you probably want to get a cartridge that has a wider bore hole at the very top as opposed to having one of the smaller tips that are more focused on smoothness now some people have said that the wider bore the mouthpieces sometimes you get a little flavor loss because you're just going straight mouth to lung instead of kind of mouth to thrill to lung on your inhale it kind of focuses more on just going straight to lung however you probably get better activation and more of a hit now once you've figured out what size borer you want there's a whole multitude of mouthpiece materials as you can see you start off with the basic plastic mouthpiece which is very lightweight and then you have stainless steel and then you have ceramic which you can see here you even have wood and kind of an acrylic resin and then you have not stainless steel but more of a aluminum coated metal so I can tell you right off the bat if you are at or if you like tattoo on your cartridges like in high school I wouldn't want people to see what my pencil number two pencils look like but luckily I grew out of that but you know people sometimes chew on their cigarettes chew on their cartridges if you art or you know you have the plastic option that's not going to break your teeth but you don't want little plastic particles getting into your mouth so you're probably best off going with a natural wood cartridge so this is a natural wooden mouthpiece it's very soft wood it's not even sealed with an epoxy for coating however if you're gonna be refilling this a lot do get new tips because when you chew on them they are gonna get beat up and the moisture sitting on wood does not bode well you also have the acrylic and the metal ones if you chew I would stay far from the metal ones you're gonna end up breaking your teeth the ceramic what's a really unique offering with ceramic style mouthpieces is that they say that it's very clean very easy to get clean it also feels sturdy like the metal ones however doesn't feel heavy in your so it's it's very natural on to the lips and it offers again it's super easy to clean off it's much lighter than the stainless steel pieces and it just feels overall more natural to wear as a stainless steel one you know you are putting a little piece of metal into your mouth and what's unique let's say about the powder coated ones to where it's not like a shiny stainless steel and thick metal it's a much thinner metal and it's coated so it's never you know really gonna be cold to your lips if you pick them up if it's been in the AC or whatnot so when selecting your mouthpiece you have your the bore of the inlet hole and you also have the mouthpiece material now mouthpiece shape also makes a difference generally as you can see you're very wide bore ones are very cylindrical and that is to just allow maximum vapor to come up through them these flattened mouthpieces that look more like black and milds are gonna dull the vapor down condense it and make it a smoother transmission so again we're going back to wide bore more vapor flattened is gonna possibly be smoother if you're undecided and you want in between the two you have these kind of hookah style tips that have a relatively wide wide bore but they don't get flattened too much to restrict the vapor so mouthpiece shape and size definitely the first point of contact with the cartridge in kind of a first way that you can determine it now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take all these cartridges out and we're gonna talk about what the body of the tank brings to the game okay guys now before we move on to going over what the differences are between the body of the tanks one more notable thing about the mouthpiece is if you are buying your cartridges to refill whether you buy to a dispenser buy them from guys like us to refill the one thing that you have to know when you're dealing with tops is there is a new type of top which child safety is really big in the industry right now so there are compression tops that once the extractor or you fill them up and you basically crimp them down right you see there's no screw here once you crimp this down this cartridge is not coming back apart for you to refill so then once you go through your initial extract right on a childproof crimp lock here there's a pop top you're not gonna be able get back into this cartridge without breaking it and so you're not going to be all refilled so if you're looking for more than one use out of your cartridge don't buy the crimp tops this is also crimp top as you could see there's no threading and you can see this is one of the newer resin cartridge is actually very popular cartridge so once you push that down you're not getting back into it now let's talk about the body of these things now you have generally two types of outside bodies or reservoirs which house the oil that you're gonna be filling you generally have plastic and you have glass now things to look for is plastic cartridges generally they're not as popular anymore because people you know they want purity when you fill up a plastic cartridge it sits for a long time I don't know if it's true or not I'm not a scientist but they say they could alter the change the oil if it sits in there because the THC can react with the plastic and also the components in there so they say a glass is much better to store things in because it is going to be medically neutral to reacting and if you are going for a glass especially the Pyrex grade of glass is going to be perfect because it's also not sensitive the temperature changes so if you're going plastic tank where are the advantages well the advantages are is you're never gonna shatter your tank and they're super lightweight so they're gonna be much lighter so if you're taking it out hiking or sporty and you don't want to carry around the tank plastic tank weighs about half of what a glass tank does and plastic with a plastic mouthpiece it does not get much lighter and but if you're looking at already a plastic tank you have different grades of plastic and you can tell that from the clarity you see this is a little bit foggy this a lot of people would think is a glass tank but it is actually an upgrade plastic tank it just has a much higher quality clarity so this is an upgrade plastic tank that just has better clarity and among plastic tanks one of the most popular ones now is you have actually resin tanks which are like this generally they come in mouthpieces like this set up right here this is actually a resin tank you really can't tell the difference between the glass and the resin except the difference is is one will shatter if you hit it hard enough and one will not now if you are buying glass there are different grades of glass you know the company that does cartridges like this I'm sure you guys are familiar brassknuckles is a prime example of somebody who focus on cartridges like this this is a very thick grade of glass and you can tell that by touching it and honestly you can probably eyeball it to tell how thick the grade of glasses so you look at it it's gonna be thicker glass this glass this tank right here which is our cloud tank actually uses a very thick Pyrex certified glass so this is actually a very expensive good glass it's very hard you don't really have to worry about it breaking or shattering it's a very thick and sturdy and other tanks are thinner glass for example this one you can tell generally tell if the glass is very very shiny and it almost looks like plastic basically that is indication without touching it that it is a thinner glass so those are just some things out the body you want to be careful of now when also looking at the body center post that has become a big Arian debate within the market because generally plastic tanks don't have center post so we'll just move those over here if you look at a center post you can see some of them have wide bases some of them don't have a base some of them have rounded bases right they all have a different structure now what's the significance basically if you have a center post that has there's very thin it is more likely that the tank if you are refilling it that the center post will not be secure when you're securing the top piece down to the center post that it could wobble go out of place and possibly leak the downside so then people put in a wider base to make it more stable take up a little more space make sure that you can screw the tank down and you're not gonna have any areas of leakage the thing is with a bigger center post is sometimes oil gets caught on the transition areas or on the hills of the center post so then if you do have a wide center post base you want to make sure it's nicely rounded so you're not gonna get oil or any wastage caught up there that would make your tank less fuel efficient for example our ELF cartridge here in pink as you can see it's a wider center post but there are no slopes in there that the oil can get caught on so you're gonna use a much larger percentage of the oil that's not going to get caught in the center post transition however going right from center post talks down to the heater okay let's talk heaters most basically you have your wick cartridge as you can see it has a wick that stays up that is wrapped in a heating element wire usually those wicks are made of silica and what happens is it absorbs the oils and it burns them and these happen just fine however it's not going to do you justice and accentuating the taste of the oils and especially if you have thick oils that dry up around there you can actually taste the heater and burn the heater before you burn the oil so if you don't have a pre heat function you have a wick you could run into some issues with taste there so a lot of upgrades have moved to wick list cartridges this is a plastic those are beekeeper replacement tank it is same concept however it has no wick and it has a ceramic heating element a lot of cartridges that say they're ceramic and you can see they're ceramic generally with seeing a little white block through the inlet holes so you could see some of them have a little white block that means they are ceramic powered generally ceramic heaters mean that you're gonna get better taste better flavor notes better flavor accentuation now it's become really popular lately is this what a lot of people have coined as si cell style technology in heaters which means that you have a ceramic block inside of the actual heater itself let's find a nice example right there that is a perfect example of a cease tell it's a coated ceramic block they have good heat up times and right now they're probably considered a very nice performance tank on the market however your problems with these are is that once you've run through a filler to the taste can drop off with thicker oils if you do not have a preheat function they can fight they can heat differently so generally you want a more viscous oil with your C cells and if they don't have a wide enough Inlet hole which is the next area that we're gonna talk about you could run into some clog \u00e4j-- issues but these have a coated block it's not no rocket science abouts just a different take on a ceramic cartridge if you look this has a ceramic block however it is forced down so this is gonna use oils very efficiently this is actually an updated version of the cloud tank and half mil so that is a ceramic block heater you get good taste notes on these and then you have units that are wickless but they don't have a ceramic heater that have different sized Inlet holes now since we're talking about inlet holes what's the general rule of thumb on Inlet holes you go to dispensary and see different sizes and shapes of inlet holes as we showed the C cell had a very wide end lit hole and other tanks like a cloud tank has a relatively wide inlet hole but not overly wide so the general rule of thumb is is that the thicker your oil is that you are putting in there the wider of an inlet hole you're gonna need so that the oil can properly have access to the heater and vaporize if you have a thin inlet hoyle a hole a small Inlet hole and you have very thick oils it's going to be very hard for that oil to come in contact with the heater and actually burn so you are gonna want if you have thick oils to have a large Inlet hole so that that oil is always having contact with the heater however what if you have a large inlet hole and you have thin oils well your your possibility of leaking down through the post goes up exponentially so if you have very thin oils don't go crazy and get tanks with really large Inlet holes because then you could have leakage you could have wastage or the oil is gonna burn up very very quickly so I think that about covers what we would talk about with the inlet holes now air flow control air flow control is available on some tanks we have our cloud tank it has an air flow control here at the top this all ceramic tank right here has air flow controls at the bottom this tank has air controls atop certain tanks have this and what this is for is to allow you to control your hit when you open up the air hole it allows you to bring in air it allows you to bring an air from the outside to kind of dilute and aerate your hit if you have it closed then you can concentrate your hit to basically only draw the vapor out of the tank and out of the little air holes are located around the tank but if you open it you can draw more air so you can take a bigger volume hit but it some people like to concentrate their hit and not allow you to do that so what is the downfall of the air control the positive is you can control your hits and really tune in on what intensity of a hit you want the downfall is if you leave it open like it is partially open now then you put it on its side and it's tilted well that's an area where you can experience some serious top leakage out of the tank a lot of measures are there to prevent that but it could happen so if you're somebody who gets airflow control and you don't use it just make sure to always keep them closed now since we've basically covered all angles of how to evaluate a tank how to eyeball it let's go over one more piece that is about the bottom air holes so some tanks at a dispensary you're probably not having to see the bottom air hole so this is probably the least important part of our oil tank analysis here but an important fact for you to know is generally the larger the bottom air hole is okay a lot of these run on a ball bearing system so that when you draw or you vaporize a ball bearing moves out of place and allows the vapor to pass through and when it's not being used it goes down and creates a seal so no oil comes and down through the the tank however if you do not have an air hole it is not going to work with auto draw units and a lot of you guys have Auto draw batteries a lot of people have elves out there so if you are buying a tank for your auto draw battery make sure with your dispensary that you have an air hole at the bottom of the tank and that it is compatible with auto draw batteries we tell people this all the time it's one of the most common mistakes people buy a tank they have an auto draw battery or an elf they say my unit or my tank is a dud it's not it's just not compatible with the two so if you have auto draw make sure you have an air hole make sure that it's a decent air hole as you can see this unit does not have an air hole so it is not going to be compatible with Stylus batteries it's not going to be compatible with our elf you could see our elf replacement cartridge has a very nice pronounced air hole with even some side vents so you want to make sure that you're picking up the right cartridge now for the very last part of this because we now gave you all the tools that you're gonna need to keep in mind when you're out tank shopping now I'm just gonna run through these tanks and basically give you the rundown of what you can expect out of each one of these tanks so that if you see one of these tanks on the shelf you basically know what you're getting into so hang tight while we get back to this final shoot all right guys now we're gonna run through each one of these tanks and just give you a very brief description of what you can expect for usage and the pluses and minuses of them so that when you're out tank shopping and you see one of these things you have a good idea of what you're gonna get so starting off with really the basic plastic stylist tank with the flat head tip you're gonna get this cartridge and it has a wick so you're not gonna don't expect a big boy taste or big boy hits this is really meant to be a light on-the-go reliable non leak easy to fill tank these run on the blue plug fill system very easy to fill very easy to mass fill but if you have thick oils and they get coagulated around there you can get burnt silica taste if you're not preheating properly in here so this isn't really a flavor tank or a monster hit tank but what it is is really an Old Faithful tank that you'll fill super light is gonna take a beating so if you're into extreme sports this is probably your tank if you want to upgrade from that stay plastic but go with a wickless something that has a ceramic heater or beekeeper replacement cartridge with a metal mouthpiece same very reliable top blue plug fill not gonna get any leaking the ceramic heater is definitely to give you much better flavor notes and more smoothness over the traditional wick system and the stainless steel mouthpiece is a similar shape but it's a higher quality fit and finish and feel then we have basically the upgraded glass version this is a childproof tank it will lock in place after it is filled it has relatively smaller inlet holes meant for more viscous oils and it is ceramic so you're gonna get about the same taste but you're gonna have the purity of glass that your oils are interacting with over plastic basically same thing except it is refillable you can unscrew this top okay a lot of flavor rx cartridges come in come into this style it is not ceramic you have some decent sized Inlet holes however not too wide and you have good center post support so there's going to be a good reliable glass tank however the mouthpiece on these things is heavy and it is flattened so it is more focused on smoothness not hits you have our elf replacement cartridge full ceramic very lightweight ceramic mouthpiece that you have in different colors it's gonna feel good on the lips and it has the unique design center posts that is wide so it's still gonna give you good support however you're not gonna have any oil that gets caught up sitting on there you're gonna use a big chunk of oil really fuel-efficient nice power awesome flavor tank then you have basically a gold finished tank that is somewhat popular out there similar square tip design nothing really special ceramic heaters the one problem is is you have this really big flat top ledge a lot of oils can get caught up there that you might never be able to vape so this is kind of an old-school design but it does have good seals it feels good in the hand and its relatively light basically here's the updated version this one migrated actually to a CE cell style so you're gonna get a good heat up time it is light however still not a hundred percent feeling the center post because you are gonna get oils that get stuck up there now this is a more modern C cell with a bullet-shaped battery we sell these along with the ceramic mouthpiece style as our elf replacement cartridge you're gonna get some more performance out of these because they have wider heater holes they have that C cell Center and you're gonna be able to get good flavor hits off of them they have you have a nice air inlet hole so they'll run well with Auto draw batteries you're gonna get some good power out of this tank actually this tank right here is a brand new tank I haven't tested it yet it is a fully ceramic interior so it's good to put its advertising that it's extremely pure taste it also a ceramic heater I'm not a hundred percent sure on the bottom air flow generally to me bottom air flow could leak so I haven't tested this tank yet but my team does have samples these because some of our customers are requesting a full blown ceramic tank this is basically just a 1 mil version a different mouthpiece version of this tank that we were talking about so difference is you can have a ceramic mouthpiece it's gonna feel a little bit more natural and this one no air hole not going to work well with Auto draw batteries here and I can tell you from holding it it is a little heavier than I would like to see a tank this cartridge right here generally you'll see them filled in brassknuckles cartridges very good cartridge works with most auto draw batteries as well as battery-powered these have one mil fill size I like the bowling pin style tip it's not exactly a wide bore but still definitely wide begin nice hits and it is thin down for some elegance the gold finish that these guys have done is pretty cool so if you're looking for a good prefilled cartridge I mean these have generally been pretty reliable I haven't heard any problems of leaking they have good taste they don't really excel so much in taste they don't excel so much in vapor but it's one of those tanks to where it does do a lot of all those right it runs at about 90% ultra reliable I've heard here you have the resin and resin tipsy sell style batteries as you can see really improve the the groove there to burn up more of the oil and again our elf replacement cartridges are similar with the ceramic mouthpiece I like the see-through tops it's really cool when you're drawing vapor out of them and also they're easy to clean they're light in your mouth you don't feel like you're gonna break your tooth if you incidentally bite on them and it's a cool little reliable tank this one however it is a child seal once you push it down you're not getting it open so only buy these for the one-time fill unless you see it's got a screw top so ask him to specify same exact thing just a wood mouthpiece for those people who like the the natural wood this one is the same as the wooden except it has a different has a little air flow control here at the top it's kind of unique you just swivel the mouthpiece and that opens and closes the air flow if you want a little bit more control on your mouthpiece these three cartridges all come from the same factory it is I mean the same family it is basically the cloud tank here and they have adjustable air flow for these two the half mil and the 1 mil versions these are probably one of the tanks that I endorse the most i love the wide bore mouthpiece I like the ability to adjust especially for connoisseurs they have a nice ceramic heater with decent size inlet holes so you get nice big hits but you're not gonna lose out on that flavor I think the center post sloping on these were done right they're very stable I haven't heard any complaints of these things leaking this is the same thing half mil except it has a hookah style tip on it it's kind of like the top of a bowling pin it's like half flattened half widened tip and this is the glass version of the cartridge we showed you with a lock top not a thread you push it down and it has also has a resin reservoir this is not glass I have not tested this tank yet but it is very similar to the the other ones that we went over in that facet so it should be a good one so anyways guys thank you for tuning in I hope some of the pro tips and some of the analysis tools that we've given you are gonna help you make better decisions when you're out there looking for your prefilled cartridge to buy at a dispensary or looking to fill your own now one question I know is gonna be a follow-up is which one of your batteries basically fire everything so let me just come out and tell

chip the electronics and this thing it is I basically want you to find me a tank that this thing doesn't fire and I want to know it exists because so far I haven't heard one really nice powerful check out the separate video on that also our Gold Line battery these two batteries are variable temperature they're a little different in size and capacity however both really awesome should fire anything

milligram so it's not too harsh but um blood sacrifice and beats not throwing on the torch yeah it's not harsh at all it is a three milligram but it's smooth like it's a zero so that's really good i barely need any breaking time this morning nobody's [ __ ] we all ride each other's dick for crops nobody gets everybody hold yeah but i barely need any break in time so i might start um taking some blinkers this video since i don't have to vape uh too much to get used to it nobody gets you nobody [Applause] pretty much empty but i'm just going to hit it to make sure that it's empty in the wide

the [ __ ] are two separate lives but that's my jeter juice gelato cart i'll go ahead and hit a blinker see if there's any uh oil left in the cart that got soaked up overnight time so let's see like i am legend while the virus is spreading somehow i survive infection smoking mirrors cut you between both your [Music] [Music] that's pretty much the end of my gelato cart but it's pretty much the end of this thing but um that's okay because i brought out another cart i've got cheater juice strawberry cheesecake this is a hybrid by jeter juice you can see the cart in a little window it's also made to look like a juice box little straw on top press the button on the side and you open it but i do have to break the seal on the bottom but i'm probably gonna wait for one more video to open up that

guys know it's anything like any other other carts it should be a tasty cart and also potent as well it's a hybrid i usually prefer a sativa or an indica but um hybrid will definitely get me faded this morning see how it's barely anything inside of there [ __ ] it i'm just hitting it just to make sure there's nothing left inside get this cursed take another blinker cheers wasting your preference not as much as uh when i first opened it or anything like that but um definitely a good thing to hit the cart even when you can't see any wax left in there glad i'm used to vaping already so i can take some blingers and uh vape at the same time i don't warm up my lungs with the vape before i start smoking then the vape's usually harsh and i have to warm up but after i start smoking i

have it here i'll be doing an unpackaging tool just so you guys can get a real look at it and again this is thc delta 8 vape pen right here um if you guys are not aware yet uh delta 8 thc is actually legal federally you can get this at most smoke shops most gas stations a lot of corner stores um and you guys ask how is thc being legally sold so here's the deal there's delta 8 thc and there's delta 9 thc now delta 9 thc is the chassis that gets you extremely high and which is what is found in all of your marijuana and regular flour whatever you care to call it um so delta nine and thc a are the main psychoactive ingredients in marijuana and those ones are still illegal so you can't get any cartridges or vape pens that are just regular thc delta 9 or taca the main two active ingredients in marijuana that gets you high as [ __ ] basically excuse my french um so right here i have a delta eight one now the main difference is delta eight is missing a few atomic bonds is what they like to call it which makes it legal um it is a little bit less psychoactive but it still gives you a nice high and it's not cbd this is delta 8 thc this is not cbd but this does have some cbd in it and as you see here i have the treetop hem company it's a 700 milligram vape pen delta eight and one actually one of my favorite strains right there blue dream i love me some blue dream and that's cool part about these things it's just like your regular thc it comes in different strains um and again this became legal in 2018 it got approved by the agriculture improvement act here and the company i have here is a treetop hemp company that sells the delta eight thc pins and as you see i'll let you guys examine the packaging and i'll do an unpackaging so you guys can get a real look at it and again here's you must be over 21 to order this product um they as you see they have a suggestion date when they use it by so basically i got a year with this and they even have their website here this is shopyourthcbd.com so as you see this company sells cbd also um and also here too you see like i said um this product is in compliance with the section 10113 of the 2018 farm bill and it contains less than 0.3 percent d9 thc like i said d9 is the active the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana this is not d9 thc this is d8 thc and as you see where it says contains is hemp derived d8 thc it also has your cbd in it which is great cbn and contains like again less than 0.3 percent of d9 thc um i'm not sure exactly what cbn is i'm assuming it's similar to cbd but it also has that in it i'm sure it's just your regular hemp and the ingredients here as you see are contains canniboids delta eight and is flavored using terpenes and the great part of it is uh here it's domesticated i live in new york but as you see this was made in california so it's a domesticated product to see what's product i think these are pretty dope i already smoked um a couple of these before and it definitely gives you a high like i said it's less psychoactive the high might not last as long but it definitely does give you a high delta hthc right here we have um and i'll do it on packaging just give me one second so we have it here they put in a nice little concealed plastic packaging too again this is the blue dream strain as you see it says it right on it looks like it has it on the the pen itself too which is pretty cool tree top hem company shout out to the treetop him company let me go ahead and just open up this uh plastic packaging too all right here you go so it basically looks like your regular vape pen but um there's no tobacco or nicotine inside this ladies and gentlemen this is delta 8 thc like i said this is legal federally so you can get this at most smoke shops corner stores or even gas stations here in the united states [ __ ] i don't know if i can go ahead and just uh hopefully it's already working so i'm go ahead and hit it see what it does oh yeah that's a nice smoke oh that's like extremely nice smoke got me coughing so like i said guys next time you go to the smoke shop or gas station or corner store see if they have delta 8 thc there's a variety of different companies that are making them um the research i did on this company they're actually pretty good pretty good quality there's no nicotine in this no tobacco and all the [ __ ] this is actually a pretty good one right here 700 milligrams so i'm already i already feel it feels good too so again guys this is delta 8 thc vape pen um they're legal here in the united states this is not delta 9 thc that's the main the main active ingredient that gets you high in marijuana and um it is not thc a which is other main active ingredient in marijuana that gets you high this is delta 8 thc which is basically scientifically just different by a few atomic bonds if i want to get rick and morty on you guys and that's the main difference is just the main difference is really just how it's made what it's made out of and um the us technically has not uh made this illegal thc the thc that made it legal is like i said delta 9 thc and thc a and this is delta 8 thc and it still gets you high um and like i stated before it doesn't get you as high as your regular thc and when i say regular chc i just mean delta 9 thc and thc a but uh it definitely does get you high and um you can get a variety of strains i got this from a smoke shop a good smoke shop here in my neighborhood i live in new york state so um they had a variety of streams they had like i said as you see here i got blue dream they even had girl scout cookies they had wedding cake they had a sour diesel they had a bunch of them so you can even get your favorite strain out of this shout out to the treetop him company again that hit i took earlier definitely uh definitely did uh feel nice so again guys delta 8 thc is legal here um the main difference between the illegal thc is just a few atomic bonds so next time you go to your local gas station or corner store or smoke shop act if they got delta delta 8 thc and try it out yourself guys um these things are good i know they just don't have them in these vape looking things they also have them in cartridges cartridges excuse me um i actually have a cartridge myself and you look at the cartridge most of the the delta eight cartridges it's a clear liquid in size which is unusual um when you usually buy just the regular thc delta nine uh cartridges you're usually some type of color to them but every time you get a delta eight cartridges uh it's a clear liquid which i find uh i don't know i don't think about it to be honest with you i don't know if that if it being clear makes it a better quality or whatever you want to uh call it but this vape pin right here delta eight vape pen definitely hits nicely so hey guys that's my review shout out to the treetop hem company again and um as you see their website right there shop your thc cbd.com and now you must be over 21 to purchase this product ladies and gentlemen and that hit i took earlier i'm already feeling high so this thing definitely does its job it's more than cbd don't get don't get this confused with cbd guys this is not cbd this is thc it does have cbd in it but it's predominantly thc delta eight so yeah you guys have any questions or concerns leave your comments i've been smoking these for probably about over a month now so i can't complain too much and that's a wrap stay blessed ladies and gentlemen and stay high", "IxxQ4ZcXtTY": "[Music] hey guys what's the hotbox little

medication sessions I didn't get medicated so it's midnight once you're medicated okay all right guys so I got a brand new strain from Cara leaf one of my investment stocks did I have a shell over my money in and yeah they're good well they will be eventually sacrifice but flour wise does just give me fire right now um what I got is from the dental care leaf it's the UH guava gelato the guava gelato is basically just a cut of the gelato just a phenotype curve the gelato that like I just has a lot more creamy mango but it's upward like tropical flavor to it so should be interesting supposed to be kind of like an indica dominant hybrid and uh what's kind of funny was when I was doing some homework I know I was just recently reviews on [ __ ] Leafly and Chili's head and I guess this guy was at his dispensary and he was talking to his bud tender he's like I got a lot of [ __ ] to do today but I want to get high demonstrated for that Jesse can you want to try the quadrille a dose which I just thought was funny the way it was written nobody's thing I really do it will have to do oh my god what yes so let's get Medicaid yeah empty big cartridge thing there are grab from those grams of the sativa s I think that's I'm pretty sure it's still East Coast's our diesel from advance grabs the big grammars fire fire those gram countries are so worth it I know like 70 80 boxer girl always

are great so as far as the CTAP name goes this is called the fuchsia the fuchsia some period leaf again and I think it's clacking in somewhere around 22 percent THC yeah 22 percent THC all right so let's check the show I actually smell like a chocolaty smell if honestly doesn't have much of a smell to it it really doesn't there's not really much of a smell at all it's very very mild and smell but it looks like some fire it's weird it's almost like something stripped to smell awful I can't smell anything that a client knows maybe I don't know really no scent to it whatsoever whatever I was smelling on the container was just [ __ ] well she looks like some fire well okay yeah alright I can [ __ ] this [ __ ] all day so here's the 8th it's nice I mean the buds on themselves are nice I like it but look like those are stirring here look at that [ __ ] it's [ __ ] frosty as [ __ ] right it's not just me dish it looks like some fire let's just take a second look at that that's a nice butt that's really nice but it's so crusty white yeah there's a great jack record of all yeah there's a shitload of Triclops this [ __ ] looks like some fire I think pleasantly surprised right there all right nice butts do you mean they're different looks like a pickle right there hmm this [ __ ] yeah that's that's some [ __ ] [ __ ] I like gelato strains for my PTSD gelato strains do really well with me in my body um so excited about this could never had to claw with gelato know each other Jesus Christ that's nice there was one piece I saw right there yeah look at this guy he's having home from adhesion look at he was just just just covered covered Holmes it's nice you were here this [ __ ] so again this is just a bit just a cut at the gelato look look at that dill pickle and [ __ ] return oh [ __ ] nice Wow real real beautiful I mean Iowa is the first to smell wise wasn't really clocking up so much but I was mean it's just looks like I'm fire I'm don't Lee taking that piece traitor in the middle or each I take the smallest but there's a little small until I like let me take that and that I'm probably gonna have a obviously a little bit left over I'd say from B Street buds okay so there's my medication session I don't think I'm gonna need all that bug bought on the right but it sure looks like some fire right let's get chill out it out okay when you break it up there's like no smell let's be funny like you're gonna care leaf girl room of this strain you walk in you just don't smell nothing what the [ __ ] going on here baby I think it's just my dog upstairs

great way about shit'll that indica feeling all of my body instantly gave me a good smile I like that she just leat chill out or does read gelato makes me feel good inside so I don't really feel

strains aren't for Gregory they're just not my strains for my my symptoms I used like this I'm a taste for medical reasons and I don't really got to be like the guy the dispensers like I just want to get high man why are you do that's not only me um this strain makes me feel good though um this is a good strange for Gregory so when this is on a menu from Kelly I'll definitely be coming back to it

smooth and the any of them you really just feel the medical effects immediately like immediately just grasping out of your body literally good strain I like that the medication just stays in you it

paid $48 for this cartridge and they came in at 84.6% THC or 400 milligram the tube discards Wisconsin it's not only perfect for storage but it's also labeled with a strain name and a color red for indica this is a C cell cartridge that means high quality ceramic coils that make flavors pop out definitely we're on this card is sweet candy like fruit makes with a bit of pine come through the effects the first thing I felt was the inner joy hit me like a freight train of dancing and head bouncing happy to the point that my cheeks were hurting from smiling too much my body got tingly for a few minutes that's the rest of the effects kicked in once the thing Glee went away my body and muscles remain relaxed through the effects I kept looking at the cart and hearing Katt Williams in my head saying it's not supposed to sparkle and around that point the inner joy amped up for no reason then the wall of calm down sit back and relax that's that happened my pain lowered down to a 1 this was very nice Michael it's got heavy so I had to put down the cart since it was 11:35 a.m. and I had things to do that day 15 minutes after I had put the cart down I started feeling tired I may have to stop too late it took about 1 and a half hours worth of fighting sleep but I did stay awake that same night this card's just helped me go right to sleep and stay asleep through the whole night our cart doing that nice now with the night time those I did get a lot of munchies can I work on this dream yes and no if I stick to two hits max of 3 second draws every 2 to 3 hours yes I can work anything over that I'm unable to work because I get to read and I end up too tired or going sleep but if I limit myself to the to his max I'm able to work through the day with minimal pain happy dancing and calm I recommend this dream for mid afternoon all the way through the end of the night use I hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "5WvuUtXp77k": "[Music] what is going on guys it is knives here and today i'm back with another strain review this time for gelato 401 gelato 41 is a hybrid strain that's high in thc and offers a heavy relaxing body high without clouding the mind gelato 41 is made by crossing sunset sherbet and thin main cookies this strain has buds that grow in an array of colours from light green to purple with trichromes that put our sweet and earthy aroma alongside hints of lavender and pine new users should know that gelato is potent and the high is best reserved for those looking for a new heavy hair the strain comes from the cookies family in california so this is the nug that we're going to be working with today you can see that it's kind of a dark olive green with some lighter patches in there and some kind of bright orange hairs [Music] some of the green is dark enough that it looks a little bit purple in the light but it is actually green looks really dense it's covered in trichomes so i'm gonna go grind this up and we're gonna see actually no i do this every [ __ ] time we're gonna see how it smells now and then we're gonna grow uh go grind it up and see how it smells i haven't smoked yet today actually i've been up for like a couple of hours and i'm completely sober so i don't know why i'm tripping over my words so much anyway so for the smell on this this to me it smells like straight cakes um if you watched my wake and bake video from like a couple of days ago to a week ago maybe um i said i was smoking on a mystery strain i didn't know what it is but it actually smells exactly like this so i think it might have been some gelato it smells really sweet really like it smells like a bakery to me really sweet like i can smell the sugariness in it and there's a little bit of a gassy undertone so yeah i'm gonna go grind this up and we're gonna get the smell of it ground up so this is what it looks like all ground up you can see it's a nice light green little bits of orange in there i don't know why my camera doesn't want to focus on this lately um yeah so smell of it [Music] it's a lot more citrusy when it's ground up like i've said that i've noticed i've said this about a lot blood but when you grind it up it really does smell citrusy [Music] it's really sweet that smells really good there's a tiny little bit of gas in there but not a lot it's mainly just sweet and you can definitely smell like the sherbet in it so yeah i'm gonna go roll this up and we're gonna see how it smokes so this is our joint all rolled up [Music] in the elements papers if you haven't seen my review for these go check it out so i realized as i was rolling this up that i didn't give you a rating for the looks and the smell so for looks i'm gonna go eight because i like how diverse this bud can be like it's always compact and dense but it comes in like a range of colors from really light green to really dark purple and the colour doesn't really depend on the strength but it's just a nice thing to look out so yeah the looks of it's getting an eight i think for the smell open and closed um i like that as well so i'm going to go a again so both of those things get an eight let's spark this up now and see how it tastes i forgot again i i'm gonna taste it dry first i've got memory like a [ __ ] sieve i swear to god and that's before i've smoked that's a really interesting taste it's like really sweet but it's almost like creamy i could understand why they call it gelato like personally i've never had gelato but it's just like ice cream in it so it this tastes like creamy it's like fruity but it's also creamy just like ice cream can be so or gelato in this case so yeah um taste on this is really nice [Music] this might be the nicest tasting butter bud yet taste for me on that's getting a nine really sweet really creamy i i like a lot so i'm gonna show up and spot this up now i still haven't filled up my lighters i might even go as far as just to just to buy some new ones i've also started doing this um before i properly spark my joints just to make sure that the chair is even and i don't canoe [Music] do [Music] so this actually took me two attempts to roll um i don't really [ __ ] with the elements papers but i decided to give them another go for this video it took me two attempts to roll this i don't even know what the [ __ ] happened on the first attempt but it looked like a sausage lumpy finger skin thing it looked terrible so i just um unwrapped ended again [Music] so far it's burning nice white ash all the way around it's pretty even apart from there's a little bit just there it looks like it might run so so far this is pretty smooth i don't feel the need to cough at all um the taste of it weirdly um because this has never happened to me before the taste of it is like the smell of it closed like when it's a full bud that's what it tastes like exactly like the smell of that which probably sounds maybe confusing i don't know but if you know you know it tastes like a smell tastes like exactly like it smells [Music] so on the nose xl it tastes kind of floral um i uh kind of sweet but more like floral than it is fruity i'm still not the best at picking out flavors but i do think i've gotten better and it helps that the weed that i've got is good and flavorful instead of just like mids because it's hard to pick out anything other than grass cuttings when you're smoking meds you know the smoke on this is not as thick as some of the other weeds that's maybe why it's smoother um i don't know if you can tell but i can definitely tell that when i'm exhaling the clouds not really thick it's quite thin and wispy other than milky and that's not because of the hits that i'm taking that is just the smoke itself i'm struggling between a 7.5 and an 8 on the flavor of this lip i think i'm gonna go 7.5 because it tastes exactly like it smells um but the smell is not really what you want to taste if that doesn't make sense at all i feel really [ __ ] high this is just punched me in the face like just all of a sudden i feel really high so you know what actually we're going to go eight on the flavor for this it is quite nice that it tastes like it smells really sweet um really fruity kind of floral uh but yeah i'm enjoying this and i'm just really it's getting harder to talk i just kind of want to go sit down so i'm going to end this here overall gelato 41 is gonna get an eight from me eight out of ten um really nice strain leave a like if you like this video leave a comment telling me if you've tried the strain uh subscribe for more videos thanks for watching and peace [Music] you", "EdoUnJuENuQ": "I'm gonna meet up with John Dawson from kung-fu dates to make some custom flavors of hash oil but the guests can consume music bait pens this is what we call soil tool rental product and what we're doing here is instead of taking oil and putting it on a hot nail and ad average or digitally dabbing write this is the wave of the future well let's make some vape pen cartridges dude let's do it awesome I can't wait to mix and terpenes so give you some blanks all right so this is my blank right here Glo empty cartridge right and this is called a removable center post and urine and screw the top you find your favorite oil people go with some raw okay great I just want to fill it up to this line right here right sure okay so looks like that's almost up to the line there don't want to add terpenes what flavor do you want to do so let's try Wi-Fi OG yeah sounds good to me so for that amount of wallet you need such a small money like a half of a micro drop okay gotcha I'll just put a timer all right okay so I've got that in there and yeah so I could feel from this arrange that that wall was pretty warm so that'll mix up quickly and sure I'm already getting a crazy amount of aroma Wow yeah that's incredible so now I stick my plunger stick your plunger in you kind of move it around you're gonna tear that shirt and just push it down it screws into the bottom there we go how many hits of cannabis are in one of these so you figure when we're at a half you're looking at 500 milligrams of THC now 500 milligrams in the cartridge for average everyday users that'll last a week let me say this real go sit with epic hits man I mean the flavor on this is uh it's pretty epic yeah but like I said we're travelling around the city where we're going to and from this is how everybody's going to be consuming thank you so much for showing me this up I think it's gonna be a great complement to the dinner party absolutely [Music]",

it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch

boil looks a lot like honey but it's actually a potent mix of THC the chemical that gets people high diluted with additives and topped with flavorings to give it that taste and smell newly regulated cannabis oils are required to list all chemical ingredients inside and their amounts but health experts say one major safety check is missing we don't really understand that this is a different mode of delivery when cannabis vape oils are heated or vaporized they produce new chemicals so what goes in isn't necessarily what comes out Health Canada admits there has been no analysis done on those chemicals that means that they'll be going into people's lungs before they're tested in a in a vaping machine we asked leading cannabis companies if they're testing emissions from their products the answer was basically no it's not something Health Canada required them to do we work in partnership with Health Canada to meet or exceed all the safety regulations that they put out but at least one company is holding back hexo acknowledges common chemicals found in cannabis vape oils are under scrutiny for having potential negative health impacts it's testing different formulations in search of a safer product American doctors are now treating hundreds of patients with vaping related illnesses many of them linked to an additive called vitamin E acetate given all the unknowns doctors can't understand why Canada has rushed to legalize these products I am surprised that they're allowing that to happen I think that's where the jury's out as to how dangerous that can be that's why some provinces have said hang on a minute let's wait at least until the US CDC can finish their investigation so that we can have a better list of what should and shouldn't go in these oils his advice until the science is settled Canadians should consider sticking with dry leafy cannabis Kristine barracks CBC News Waterloo Ontario also as of today cannabis edibles are now legally available across most of Canada as well but people in three of the largest provinces will have to wait a little longer cannabis infused products from beverages to baked goods to gummy bears are now good to go

"okay so today we're going to be doing a review of the gelato gank apes and here's a packaging a lot of you get your PhD and whatnot up there best way to open this from the bottom all parties out best way to open some from the bottom though get it stopper good way to sell these are real it'll come with a see a stamp on the bottom with a K and in the middle I don't know if you can see but it's not gonna be plastic in there it's gonna be silicone you can see the K and the CA with the serial number so I'm gonna be using my I taste MVP Pro this is [ __ ] old I usually run six watts nothing high so right away you know real sweet aroma little earthy definitely some cannabis in there yeah I also have a couple different cards I got a cookies part this one the oil is real thick but I just it don't get me as I I couldn't tell you why but yeah it was real thick and party foul again but this will this will you can tell I mean it's not like super fast but it will do as you can tell that one just it just bubble isn't the slowest it's not bad and the oil the color of this isn't and isn't exactly bad it's just not as clear it's the other carts I I've gotten but yet again to clear is bad so let me just hit this again I see where I can get on the scale of one to ten on high level and right now I'm pretty sober so let's see it's so much harder in my head tiny air bubbles I'm sorry shaking yeah a couple other carts this this was fire cinnamon toast crunch that was fire recently that was my last flavor I had the skittles was fire that one's good for a while these were what we were getting we were getting the exotic carts and I was getting a couple flavors blueberry Kush purple punch and strawberry banana by the way that's cookie the cookie cart packaging it's of cool called grunts that'll keep up with it okay I wish I could but yeah I go through go through carts like crazy don't repeat ones well for the dank though I give it a good eight out attempt a lot of us one of my favorite strains cannabis why's this learn exactly tastes like the plant but does taste good and form hi it's this creeping in on me a little bit I got a hit a couple more times but I'll get where I want to get I'll rip it one more time and sign out and maybe I'll do a review and I'm finished with it and see my overall review of it these usually tend to last me like in five days if it's just myself I like to conserve it you know I can I can't hit it at work all the time only a couple times a day at work tastes real good though clouds always on the tanks nothing nothing like a dead kids man I don't know why all right well deuces I'll see y'all later thanks for tuning in", "4O1bMIAj3wE": "news interviews education we are tnm news news [Music] hey guys i'm christine slofani for tnm news and welcome to costa atlantica and punta cana dominican republic unfortunately i'm not here to report on the legalities for marijuana in the dr which by the way cannabis is not legal here but while i am here i did think to bring along my weed pen and this morning i placed it on the counter i turned my back for a second and it rolled off and broke and i'm heartbroken but it got me thinking about a few ways that you can salvage the oil in your wheat pen if you break yours of course breaking it accidentally is not the only reason a pen will malfunction sometimes when dealing with weed pens atomizers burn out from turning the temperature too high on a battery or sometimes the battery just won't hold the charge at the end of the day the majority of the vape cartridges are not made with the best quality batteries and technology so they're bound to break from time to time one of the best ways to remove oil from a vape cartridge is to take a small syringe similar to the ones they use to put the oil into the cartridge the mouthpiece on the majority of the standard pre-filled cartridges can be unscrewed once the mouthpiece is unscrewed you can then tip the tip of the syringe into the open cartridge from there it should be pretty easy to pull out all the oil next all you would have to do is just purchase an empty cartridge from a vape shop or online once you obtain that you can simply push the oil straight into the empty cartridge and you're good to go [Music] now if you don't have an empty cartridge to refill but you have a syringe full of oil well then it's time to do some dabs you can use any dab rig that you would normally use with the concentrates that you purchased from a dispensary just simply heat the nail or banger on your dab break let it cool and slowly push on the syringe until a drop of oil falls out and then inhale the smoke now if the oil seems to be too stable to push out of the syringe then try and heat the syringe so that the oil becomes more viscous but don't over heat or burn the syringe hot air from a blow dryer usually works best or you can even use hot water as long as there's a strong sealed cap on your syringe [Music] now the simplest way to salvage oil that you pulled out of a broken marijuana cartridge is to eat it that's right after you pulled the oil out of the cartridge you can actually eat it you can add it to any meal or drink to consume the concentrate since the distillate does not have thca there's no need to decarboxylate the marijuana as it's already ready to consume the moment you pull it out of the cartridge the other ingredients in vape cartridges are generally regarded as safe to consume by the fda so you're pretty much good to go and you can add the oil directly to any food or beverage risk-free another option for you is to simply put a small bit of oil on top of a regular marijuana flour bowl now you can use a pipe a bomb a bubbler or any other smoking device just put a few drops per bowl and that should enhance the flour you're smoking some people even like to put some drops of oil in blunt wraps or on joints um and it works like a charm and it makes the smoking experience just a little bit sweeter i think anyways now if you're thinking of using the oil to make your joint a super joint well then i recommend putting the oil on the outside of the joint after it's rolled then if you want to get really crazy and you happen to have some keep saved up in your grinder then you can actually roll the joint into the key basically making your own moon rock joint and lastly if the oil you have is thin and might have already been cut with polyethylene glycol or something similar it should work in an e-cig or an e-juice vaporizer and there you have it making the best out of a bad situation i hope this video helped you figure out a way to salvage the oil from your broken weed pen obviously you want to be as careful as possible with cannabis products because sometimes accidents happen but marijuana is expensive so don't waste it if you don't have to for more cannabis news visit us at tnmnnews.com don't forget to give us a follow on facebook instagram and twitter at nationalmjnews and

savvy g guys man today getting straight into this because this is this is gonna be one of the craziest videos that i've done in a minute okay guys so i have seven disposables right here okay disposables not cartridges all seven different flavors um varying from you know sativas hybrids and indicas we got them all man these are all by a company called lido i have one open right here let me show you guys real quick this one right here is the skywalker og okay this thing right here man is phenomenal i've been using it if you guys have been seeing my videos i have been puffing on it for the past couple of like i want to say maybe two or three weeks almost coming up on a month now and man do these get me faded every single time that i use them okay so what we're gonna do man what i have planned for today's agenda guys i got seven of them so i was thinking man why not go ahead and taste test every single one of them but with a blinker okay yeah we're gonna be taking blinkers off of all seven of these and we're just gonna be giving you guys a taste test alright so we got blue dream we got straw anna we got gelato we got maui wowie this hand we got strawberry cough skywalker og and purple punch so it is quite a variety of flavors boys and damn i'm ready to get into this okay so the first one that i have actually popped out right here for myself this one is the skywalker og i've actually been puffing on it so let me just go ahead and take one blinker so i give you guys the full rundown on this cheers yeah that is so good dude this premium distillate is just so far you guys know i'm a fan of distillate just because i like the flavor mostly you know when it comes to live resident things i'm not really too much of a fan of it but when it comes to discipline i always feel like companies especially as this one litto they do a fire job man i just being able to provide you some high quality distillate and man this is one of the newer ones in a disposable i usually rock cartridges but now the disposables are i feel like they're the new wave man they've been a lot more convenient to me than a cartridge and a battery just because i mean it's just one single-handed device you know you don't got to be carrying all that other stuff but all right so too much rambling let's get into the flavor review okay so the skywalker og phenomenal you get that earthy tones you get the smack you in the face og and it's just phenomenal man off of the first blinker yeah it's just so good i could probably keep hitting this skywalker og for me is one of my favorites of all time so yeah skywalker og tastes exactly like skywalker og next up on the list we got the maui and go ahead and open that up for you guys pull this sucker out so this one right here is a sativa if you guys don't know so i haven't smoked a lot of sativas lately and i'm kind of excited to try this one so cheers [Music] oh that one is so smooth bro holy crap usually sativas are a lot more smoother than indicas and hybrids but this one was flavorful it tasted let me catch my breath for a second and it tasted i can't really pinpoint um describe what it tastes like but it tastes kind of like a fruity cocktail nothing fake it just comes it just smells it smell all right it tastes like a bowl of fruit loops that's what i'm kind of getting an apple jack something like that i'm not too sure but you get really really fruity notes in this and it's actually a smackers man that just got me a little bit more elevated so maui wowie a little bit more on the fruity side but fire next up on the list we got another indica guys this is right here the purple punch purple bunch for me is one of those flavors that you just cannot mess up man and if you mess it up it just says a lot about your brand but purple punch you always get those sweet grapey little fruity notes and that's what i'm hoping for today so third blinker in man we're only three blinkers in and i'm faded already like it's not a crazy faded but yeah i could definitely feel the head change okay so number three we got purple punch indica uh you guys know me i love indigo's cheer um cheers dude i felt like that that that blinker took a look a little bit longer holy crap the flavor profile literally i just died after that blinker right there but it's all good i just had to go get some water because my throat was dry so that flavor profile guys it tastes it kind of reminds me like a stizzy purple punch it kind of reminds me like it they give it this hawaiian punch taste i don't know if you guys know the drink the red one the hawaiian punch but that's kind of what it tastes like to me without a doubt the high on this purple punch is it's smacking me i'm literally still recovering from it so going in on number four guys i'm literally just getting so baked right now we got the gelato this one is a hybrid so hopefully it doesn't smack me in the face too hard you know just pop it out the packaging give it give it a little sniff this time try to see if it smells like anything it doesn't really smell like anything yeah you can't really smell anything so let's just go in on the fourth hit a gelato hybrid let me give you guys a little bit of more of a close-up of the battery i know some of you are probably wondering yo that design is freaking sick bro why haven't you showed us a close-up and i'm just like man i was just trying to get high bro so there goes another little close-up for you guys very very sleek you can see that little that little line in the middle that's the oil it's very very sick so going in number four or five i don't know i don't even i forgot i already lost count so we got the gelato all right guys blinker time baby yo if you guys are hitting my bad my bad if you guys are enjoying the video so far let's try to smash over 700 likes okay we got seven different pods right here seven different disposables i mean so 700 likes just kind of seems you know on point so going in on gelato cheers [Music] okay okay that that was actually really freaking good that was super milky and cloudy i got a fat rip i remember guys with every different strain i feel like you get different hits because with different strains i guess the yield output the oil how it is it's not always going to be the same so sometimes you'll get you know less milky clouds sometimes you'll get really milky clouds it all depends on the strain but oh my goodness that was fire that literally tasted on point gelato like literally topped it and that was smacked me in my face i'm literally gonna die right now but i'm trying hard not to i know you guys can hear in the voice but we're gonna keep our cool we're gonna keep our cooler after four down we got three left boys we're going ham we're going him so next up i think i'm going with the sativa because i need a little light break from the heavy-hitting indigos and hybrids because honestly i feel like sometimes when they say hybrid or this one by the way is the blue dream sometimes when they say like hybrids i feel like eighty percent of the time it comes out to be a little bit more heavy on the indica side all right so a little bit run down so far we're four in and so far all the flavors are pretty smacking man i can't really complain that there's something that i can't smoke because so far i've been able to smoke them and at ease and i'm pretty sure if i continue to smoke those flavors throughout the day i wouldn't even mind it so next up on the list we got the blue dream sitting in at number five how many of you guys like blue dream let me know down in the comments below old school strain cheers boys hmm i'm sorry if you hear me smack it but i'm just trying to taste this that actually tastes phenomenal i can't i can't describe what it tastes like but it tastes like what a blue would taste like [Music] well that's so weird to say guys but it literally tastes like if the color blew like like just gave out a taste like that's so weird to you know kind of comprehend you know how do you even taste the color but like like a blueberry i guess you can say man it has like a blueberryish taste to it it's it's very very subtle but it's fire this one oh my goodness it has a very earthy taste to it too but it has the blueberry hint of sweetness and wow that actually surprised me so number five blue dream blinker fire literally see it in my eyes dude and my expression in the way that i talk that how faded i am i have not taken like this many blinkers in a row in forever bro like literally this is some [ __ ] i used to do when i used when i first started you know chief in cartridges it's crazy so i feel like a kid again i feel like a kid again so next up we got the straw nana hybrid i'm i'm i'm powering through this boys so quick little insider on this these actually are one gram pods okay they're not point fifty point twenty five you know usually disposables i don't know why companies put point 45.30 like bro like what am i supposed to do with point 30 like what am i supposed to do with that like take like three freaking hits and i'm done like you know like at least give me like half a gram but i don't know companies are wilding so first time i've ever seen a one gram disposable which is pretty freaking dope so straw nana man i am faded guys i am sorry i am sorry here man i got the dab sweats i don't know if you guys could see it on my shirt maybe in my armpits but i'm literally not drenched but i'm almost there guys because of these these dab sweats guys that's how hard these are hitting okay so straw nana enough of the stalling let's go okay so right now i think the issue that i'm having is that my mouth is very very my tongue at least you know my taste buds are just filled with so many different types of disposables that i can't even tell at this point but i did get a good hint of straw like strawberry i didn't get a hint of like banana too much but you do get that strawberry and now that i'm exhaling i'm getting it in like my like the back of my nostrils i guess you could say i get a get a strong sense of like strawberry but it's this is definitely a hybrid you could tell this is a perfect 50 50 because i didn't feel like i got higher but i also didn't feel like i got like you know like jittery so this is a good this is some good stuff man so next up i'm actually glad that i that i um i'm trying this so uh next up last one but not least guys i'm faded off my ass six blinkers in we got the strawberry cough that's that's all on this last one man strawberry couldn't have ended it with a better dessert guys while i personally love strawberry cough it is a sativa for those of you that don't know but i don't even think it matters at this point because i'm just so high like in my eyes like i don't know how i'm even gonna edit this video today probably gonna have to wait till the next day that's probably you guys probably aren't gonna see it upload until the next day we'll see we'll see so going in on number seven okay oh by the way i forgot to give the review to that one i just forgot it was oh yeah actually i did give the review you know that's how you know i'm high guys i'm forgetting about doing things that i already did so going on the last one we got the strawberry cough okay [Music] cheers dude what was that that thing did not stop i don't know if it was just in my head but i think i counted more than 10 seconds but i was literally power lunging it i had no more air in my lungs i promise you that was more than 10 seconds either way we killed it it actually tasted pretty good i i did taste strawberry again didn't taste too much stuff because i was dying but for the most part that was just a hitter bro seven blinkers in a row guys i'm gone look at my eyes i can't believe this so we're gonna go ahead and edit this out here we actually did the challenge all flavors were phenomenal i if you guys enjoyed today's video do me a favor leave a big like it helps push out to the algorithm and you know comment i try to respond to everybody if you guys have any questions let me know and last but not least hit that subscribe button alright i'll catch you guys on the next one", "qOa_EvfGSqE": "hey ladies keith richardson here today to talk to you all about the difference in the cbd oil and the cbd flour when you smoke it so whether you're vaping using the vape pan and oil cartridges or smoking the hemp flour in a hemp flower joint or pre-roll i'm going to go through the different effects and kind of you know the different just forms and methods of consuming the cbd in this way so let's get into it first i'm going to talk about the oil we just recently added the cbd oil cartridges to the site and the main difference with oil and flour is that the oil is extracted from the flour in my opinion it is more potent and it takes less for you to feel the effect so either uh when you're smoking the actual hemp flour bud like this like how these are this is orange gelato i have here so whether you're breaking this down and smoking the hemp flower buds or using the pen both of these methods are going to give you a buzz you will feel a high when you smoke it is not as intense as smoking marijuana but you do have a very euphoric to me the buzz feels very similar similar to drinking wine now for me and my tolerance the vaping the oil through the pen is stronger to me than smoking the flour like i only have to hit this like two three times and i'm good like good good so the oil is in my opinion stronger than smoking the flour but for you it may be different so they both work well for anxiety for pain stress relaxation for sleep the effects of it are the same and even the activation times are very similar so after you hit a joint a few times you know you're going to feel it the biggest difference in consuming is going to be that the vape when you vape through the pan like this it has no smell and you can really taste the terpenes so we have four different flavors this is bala berries i have here we also have plushers which tastes more like grape we have golden say banana and we have orange gelato so when you vape it in the pan you really can smell and taste those terpenes whereas when you smoke the flour you can smell the terpenes but you don't taste it as as well as you do when you vape the oil but they give you very similar effects so this is perfect for moms and even dads who don't want to let their kids know what's up they want to be very discreet with the smell you can have this in the car you can even take this to work nobody would know what this was zero smell the smell that gives off is actually very fruity and pleasant so that's the biggest difference this is a little bit um you know smoking hemp when you're smoking through natural methods isn't harmful for your health but this is a little bit milder on your throat for people who are concerned with smoking the flour sometimes smoking a joint is a little bit too harsh for people some people hate the smell of smoke they don't want to smoke in their homes you know it may be a little bit too loud to cover that smell up a lot of people don't like the smell getting in their clothes or on their fingers so this is what the oil is really great for because no smell very discreet and you're going to get all of the effects immediately so it's up to you and i'm going to show you guys really quickly too how to use the the batteries that we have on the site that go with the pins so let me grab a new cartridge so this is what a brand new cartridge will look like you have a little your oil thing in here so you get the oil in this one and then these are the batteries this is a five zero one thread battery it's rechargeable so you get the battery and you get a charger in the pack so basically the cartridge screws off and on and i already know a lot of you guys are going to want to know how long will one of these last based on research they say one cartridge should last from 50 to 100 hits but it depends on how often you use it so it may last a couple of weeks for some people it may last some people a couple of days for people who only use it you know sparingly a few months so it's going to vary from person to person but basically you would get your oil cartridge you take your pen and you just screw it in very simple very simple screw the cartridge all the way in with this pan right here you click it five times to turn it on so one two three four five the pin is now on then you click it twice to preheat the oil i actually had turned it off that first time my bad so that was turning it back on then you click it twice to preheat the oil and you see the light is turned in color so once it's green it's ready to go you just pull it you don't have to hold the button you just pull on it and as long as this lit up is ready you could probably offer each one pull it two three times say reheat it you just click the button twice that's it and then it's going to be ready to go within a couple of seconds so you hit it as soon as it turns and again very few fruity very mild but you immediately feel that cbd getting your system it's like immediately uh a gush of relaxation comes over you so you start to feel it get into your system right away and then to turn it off you click it five times one two three four five so now the pin is turned off and that's how it works very simple so we have all these products available for you guys via the pwlc online canon boutique you can visit us at www.pwlc.store make sure you like subscribe and share this video drop a comment below um let me know your feedback what you want to know next so just to tie this all up with a bow smoking the flour and vaping the oil give you very similar effects in terms of how impactful it is for pain for stress anxiety relaxation for pms but the major difference in smoking the two products is that the vape oil no smell you can really taste those um terpenes and with the flour is very effective as well but you're definitely going to smell it once you burn it and so you know to each his own i recommend them both for me my preference is the flour but you know the oil it's kind of something i'm still getting used to i'm such a flower girl like i think i'm gonna always prefer smoking the flower but the oil is beautiful it really is beautiful so let me know how you all like it and i'll see you guys next time", "NdJXVpPY6Ko": "how you doing everybody out there it's your boy Tommy jokes episode 68 strangers rich your boy boogie

time you make your oil cartridge purchase all Auto draw batteries need a cartridge with the airflow hole at the direct bottom of the tank if you're wondering why the new vaporizer you purchased won't vape your oil cartridge this is usually the reason cartridge tanks with solid connective bottoms will not work with buttons vapes this is the ex1 plastic wit cartridge with a flat head tip not really known for its big hits and good taste but it's a tried-and-true tank that's lightweight with the leak proof design and they easy to feel blue plug system be sure to preheat properly with this system as sticker oils can build up to a semi solid state on the wick so if you're looking for a cartridge that won't shadow around it though this is the cartridge for you the ex3 is a glass cartridge with a surco me of fiber heater similar to coils this cartridge gives a unique taste it feels heavy and very well made the big glass surrounding the heater allows for durability and will give you a truer quality of flavor this tank has been known not only to vape oils but ejuice to this tank features two dual Inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and because of the air hole at the bottom this can be baked with a south draw device the ex4 is a glass tank with ceramic heater it's great because of the rounded base the round base is great so that no oil or wastage get caught up there it has a wider mouthpiece than most cartridges so you'll be able to get more vapor production it features two inlet holes for lights and medium viscosity and yes it's Auto draw friendly as well next is the only tank on the list we need a push to fire base and will not work on buttons as vaporizers or batteries the ex5 ii need each pilgrim or epub done for inlet holes for mediums against viscosity the egg v improves on the cartridge game by allowing you to control the amount of airflow you get great for heavy hits and with the mouthpiece being the largest of the bunch the vapor production is completely customizable to your liking but if you're not going to use the cartridge for a while it's best that you completely close the air vent even more amazing is the baseless center post assuring that you get the most out of your cartridge and that no oil is left behind and last but not least the e a fix-all cartridge this ESL style cartridge is the best fit for even the thickest of oils it features four large two millimeter inlet holes ceramic oven thick glass housing and ceramic mouthpiece and yes it is Auto drawl compatible this glass cartridge is a ceramic oven so you know what's going to give you a greater taste than any whipped cartridge out there all these cartridges are no wider than any CSL cartridge on the market and can fit into any vaporizer with the bore of ten point seven five millimeters or less please keep in mind that the thicker your oil the wider inlet hole that you'll need so that the right amount of oil can reach the heater to be vaporized without getting burned keep in mind that you shouldn't refill the cartridge is more than three times to assure you're getting the best vapor production consider subscribing for more videos like this drop us a like if

this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got an exciting one for you today all right so a lot of you have asked me how can I get the oil out of my broken cartridge well if you've got an exotic card or a dead bank card or one of the many other cartridges that use this style of vaporizer cartridge I'm going to show you how to get the oil out of it first things first let's take it to the deck and introduce you to what we'll be working with all right so here we are first things first let me go over the utensils that we will be working with today this is a stand that I made myself to hold cartridges in while I filled in these are a couple of varieties of syringe that are available this particular style right here works adequately for filling and emptying most cartridges that you get on the market today specifically 1/2 gram cartridges and 1 gram cartridges this will generally empty most of those now this tip is a little short and as such I'm showing a few of the available sizes this is approximately 1/2 inch one inch and a one and a half inch tips right here in varying diameters for filling no next to it I have a 1/2 gram or 0.5 milliliter and a 1 gram or a 1 milliliter cartridge these are one-time use non reusable disposable cartridges these are also 0.5 milliliter or 1/2 gram and one milliliter or 1 gram these are refillable and reusable the mouthpiece screws off where these are a press fit and they have to be forcibly removed now these are the two styles that I recommend when you are replacing the oil into another cartridge as you will see the exotic cards uses a slightly different cartridge right there but I prefer when I'm refilling to go with a tried-and-true cartridge to ensure the failure does not happen again with that in mind the first thing we're going to look at is these tips now as you can see this is a one and a half inch tip right here this is an half inch tip right here no this is a half milliliter or 1/2 gram cartridge as you can see this tip would work adequately to recover just about all the oil in that cartridge very well in the 1 gram cartridge as you can see you would be able to recover most of the oil except for what is stuck around the chimney right there for that a longer syringe such as this is a much more adequate okay now that I've shown you a couple of the utensils let's get these cartridges open real quick and we can see what they look like all right here we are so this is a lemon berry Gang babes cartridge with a C cell with a pronounced THC of 90.9 9% here's a little bit of a close-up if you'd like to pause that to get a little bit of the idea of the flavor then this is a C cell cartridge right here just like it states C cell right there this one right here this I believe is an eye crusher cartridge and this is some fruity pebbles from exotic cars this has the hologram I'm right there and this is a hybrid this one here says it's been 80 and 85 all right okay and here we are now please bear with me this may take a minute for some of these I have found that on some of these cartridges this perfectly round tip right here does not always work and I have modified one slightly so that it is slightly oblong to fit down around that chimney a little bit and that's what I want to be using right now to ensure that I'm able to reach cover as much oil as I can I'll be working with this first one this is a fruity pebbles from exotic karts I believe this is an eye crusher cartridge what we're gonna do we're going to start off with just removing the lid it just twists off just like that right there you can see set that to the side now I have a custom-made stand right here that I tend to use to hold my cartridges when I'm filling them if it tends to stay pretty pretty good right there right and you're going to take your syringe and just insert it and start drawing up right as you can sort of these have both been warmed up a little bit to ensure that they do flow decently I definitely recommend that as you can see you want to try to get as far down into that that edge right near that hole right there as you can get and then lean that the cartridge as far away as you can and just try to recover every little bit that you can and don't don't be afraid to suck a little bit of air up in there I mean you really want to you want to be able to try to recover everything that you can there for sure all right there's a little bit there what I recommend you do at that stage is just set it on the side and let it gather on one on one side real quick heat that up a little bit let all that oil gather on that opposite side and then you can stick this back in there and and utilize it that way well this is warm I'm gonna put this into another cartridge real quick just to ensure that it flows pretty good like I said then just put this tip right down in there this is able to go actually down in there like this to recover oil from one of these are necessary and then all right there you go sit that put Leon that and remember this let these sit for a few minutes that then oil bubble down in his holes and if it's good and warm like this one is it'll get down to those holes no problem alright and that's basically how you do that one as you can see on this there's a little bit gathering down on that edge we'll just gather that up as much as we can right there and uh this here just set it right off to the side with the cap there and uh that's basically garbage now with the dank veins it's a little bit of a different different different ballgame here you've got to remove this mouthpiece this mouthpiece is a press fit on here it does not just come off so what you're gonna need to do you're gonna need to grab this with a pair of vise grips or a comparable pair of pliers and there you go alright pull that mouthpiece right off of there now we take our syringe we insert our syringe all the way down and get just down there see how far that went in and then we slowly start to draw that all out of there all right we want to put the syringe on the bottom edge and start drawing there we go he's just taking all that oil right out of there all the way down until there's almost nothing left in there she'll be able to empty that thing out completely alright and there you go that's basically one done unit that point you can get comparable unit exactly basically the same unit brand-new these cartridges can all be purchased at vape art smart comm there is a link in the description you simply take that cartridge you take that syringe you put it right in there just like you four set it right down near that inside down there just like that there's a fill up in there all right and there you go put the lid on that get that near the old vise press that in and WHAM bulb Lambo there you go let's get this back on top and I'll tell you guys how this works out alright folks well here we are back on top with the new cartridges we got the fruity pebbles crammed down into this bad chicken right here this is a refillable csail cartridge available in the description below at Bay Park smart dog on go ahead give them a click and I'll go check that out the syringes that I use also available

absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in this is John with CMC connoisseurs peace", "4AvISpz3z_E": "hey welcome to cannabase IG's today we're taking a detailed look at how to use 510 oil cartridges with vape and batteries this episode is brought to you by New York vape shop you can find all the devices that were using in the demonstration today at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with the code rough 3 first we're going to take it look at the anatomy of a 5-10 cartridge first I want to talk about the tip and the tips are pretty much a up to you like however you decide which is your preference is they come in all types of metal they're come in ceramic and they come in wood so the tips are pretty much straightforward next we're going to talk about the tanks the tanks themselves are what holds the oil and they're usually half a milliliter to one milliliter and sometimes the really big ones like the two gram or 2.2 gram heavy hitter cartridges can be really long but referring to the tank is the actual part of the cartridge where the oil is inside of it the two part and then there's the oil inlet and sometimes they come in various whole sizes you can see the one at the top there has a little bit larger hole size than the cartridge there at the bottom and generally for the thicker THC oils you probably want more of a thicker hole then there's the airflow if you can see at the very very bottom this is a bottom airflow and you can see that the airflow hole is right there in the threads at the bottom of the device other devices sometimes have them at the top near the tip and so generally one is either a bottom airflow in most cases sometimes a top airflow and then there's also what they call a variable airflow and you say the case here the airflow is adjustable at the top there so that's the one one thing to consider as well as part of your cartridge and the last and perhaps the most crucial part that we're going to talk about there's here at the base and that is the atomizer and the atomizers are usually either wick or ceramic and the wick they're okay but preferably you probably want to use ceramic today's you get a lot better even distribution better flavor and you see the ceramic heats the oil as it passes through now let's talk about best practices one of the most important things when it comes to using your 510 cartridges with a pin is to use the right voltage setting and you can see generally if it's a variable voltage for these kinds of pins that will vary somewhere between three and five volts and that's the appropriate range for most 510 cartridges but if you're using something like a box mod like the steam cloud that you see here that goes up to sixty watts it's going to be way too much so you're going to want to bring that down to like five watts or to the lower settings and to make sure that you're using the proper voltage or wattage another thing that you want to make sure is that using the proper airflow type you can see this is a bottom airflow device but used on this box mod if you pull it all the way in there there's no air inlet and so for this is the type that you'll need a top airflow so there are types of devices that may not be compatible with certain types of cartridges so that is one thing you want to make sure that for instance of this case you'd want to use a top airflow device and a variable and would be even better and you can see here - this is a bottom airflow and on the bottom airflow there will be a little bitty notch where the air would be allowed to flow through at the bottom of the device so you just want to make sure that you're using the right kind with the right type of device another thing is that when it comes to your empty device you probably just want to throw it and not throw it away but you want to refill it and not just keep hitting it because you're going to burn it out so when you get done with it either go ahead and toss it it's done or stop hitting it until you're ready to refill it or you're going to burn it out another thing is when you're putting in your pocket you really want to be careful with the tips especially with the ones that have an exposed tip and rather than sitting down into a sleeve because if you leave it in your pocket you can do something like this a lot of times it'll bend the tip over one way or the other can expose the electronics and cause you some problems so if you're going to be putting it in your pocket you might want to go with a device such as this where the cartridge sits down inside of it like a sleeve and the last tip we're going to go with here is to make sure that you keep your battery charged or keep a backup battery so if you have a nice pin that you like to use you might want to keep a little cheap on the side that you can have always kind of have as a backup by your charge in the other and that pretty much brings me to the end of my tips and best practices on

i'm pretty excited about this one today we're looking at uh gage brand again this one is brand new it is their gelato hybrid so this one is sitting at 21 thc gelato is an exclusive pheno-hunted hybrid stream bred from crossing girl scout cookies and sunset sherbet gelato is said to feature peppery citrus notes paired with hoppy pungency gelato gets its name from the fruity dessert like aroma buds are said to bloom in a dark purple hue illuminated by fiery orange hairs and a shining white coat of crystal resin gage is a small batch craft cannabis company they hand triamine are located in hamilton ontario and their parent company is a radical medical cannabis inc so this one's super fresh the store just got it in it was packaged on july 14th so super fresh excited to look at this [Music] okay now that we've learned a little bit about uh gelato by gage um last thing i got to do is test it out for the rating so i'll go do that and i'll be right back all right everyone after testing out the uh gelato really really enjoyed it definitely would be buying again highly recommend it so the effects were really good on the gelato the taste was great um it was super smooth the only issue i think i have with it was if i had if i had to pick one was the um the burn on it was was not great it was good um but it could have been a little bit better and the ash the ash wasn't it wasn't dark or anything but it wasn't super light either so the ash could have been um a little bit better on it but it still was very clean and smooth um so yeah like i said very impressed by it definitely will be getting again so i'm going to rate this one a 9.1 out of 10. until next time guys", "4N2nhPj4aok": "[Music] here's how to use forea and power before you start take a few deep breaths to wake up your lungs micro dosing is much more effective when you're relaxed and prepared for a new state of mind using foria and power is easy there's no button just inhale start with a short puff about one second long there's no need to inhale fast or strong just a smooth easy breath exhale and enjoy the flavor you should see some vapor a three-second inhale is about four milligrams of CBD one milligram of THC it's a very gentle micro dose the longer you inhale the hotter the vapor and the stronger the dose so if you cough or anything just take a shorter puff if this is your first time wait a minute or two to see how you feel before you take another tip [Music] you", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say about it this joint is pissing me off much love y'all seven likes do it do it all right go to twitch.tv link will be in the description uh go to my twitter man i'm trying to get my twitter up as well like i want y'all to be able to follow me and

"eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "tCU0L-60gSY": "all right so what's going on everybody welcome back to the channel so today I just wanted to be talking about a THC vape pen and cannabis pen and TAC vapor oil that I picked up at buy a cannabis club here in Barcelona so I just wanted to be talking about these today doing a quick review showing you all a little bit about how they work and how they taste and everything so let's get go and check it out okay so yeah just to check it out the vaporize that I picked up is the vapor and so it's the effect goes solo kid here so this has a 1500 watt battery built-in and also a 2 millimeter film capacity here you can kind of see it has a little outline on the box there but yeah it's really easy portable simple to use let me just show you what comes with it here so yeah you get the warranty of the paperwork so we got a rechargeable cord here as well and also so it does come with two coils that you basically need to go ahead and just add these to the vaporizer in here to add the coil it's really easy when the when the vaporizers not filled up you just want to release it or not release it you just want to flip it upside down untwist it and then you can unplug the coil take out the coil or put in the new coil and then screw it back in so so the vaporizer is actually really easy to use to turn it on you can just click the button five times in a row so one two three four five and then it'll start flashing you can just turn that on the same way to turn it off you just put your five times and one two three four five and it'll turn off the color on the light there that indicates your battery strength so I believe if it's white that's it a medium battery right now if it's red you need to recharge it and I think if it's a full battery it's just green and so yeah check it out see the TAC vape oil the PhD fake liquid that I got so this is coming in from the all science brand if you check out lead maps a common search for the brand all science this is the THC e-liquid it's a gelato flavor here as the one I picked out here this was by far the highest THC content I believe if the club they told me this was 56% THC it's pretty cool they also do have CBD involved in here as well and I believe some other cannabinoids as well so it's not only just the THC mix you do get the CBD and other cannabinoids in there as well but this was the the highest THC concentrated about 56% additionally they do have banana cush and also a actually a Heisenberg goji kind of fruit red berry blend as well so this is a lot of flavor I think that is kind of a mix between the flavors like a mix between the Girl Scout cookies mint flavored and then they try and throw in some skunky citrusy flavors from like a sherbert it's pretty good actually it's not bad it's my first kind of a liquid vaping experience typically I just fade flower dried flowers so this is kind of something new for me I wanted to try it out but yeah we see the other flavors the banana Christians are going to be coming in it is you know kind of a tropical banana flavor and then the Heisenberg you're going to be mixing in like I said the berry berry tones there I believe they have some vanilla flavors as well but yeah I'll post some links below check out on the weed maps they have all the information about this this all science come pretty cool so yeah again this is super easy just to fill it up basically you just have to unscrew the top part here and then you can just fill it in directly just filling in it so yeah it's super easy let's just go ahead and fill this in so again this is the gelato all science THC vape oil of eight liquid here so you just put it in there and we're just gonna fill that bad boy up super easy [Music] and you just screw that back in super quick and easy so I think I turned it off and gonna just turn it back on again so again you just click it five times fast [Music] so yeah basically to maybe just hold down the button and just start inhaling [Music] yes oh the flavor is very nice it's very smooth from what I've noticed from having baked this last couple days usually in about 30 seconds to a minute you kind of get this wave of the TST going over your head and down throughout your body so it's very fast-acting I can definitely notice the higher THC content already right now usually like I said I used to bacon just leave somewhere between 50 and 70 percent THC typically not much more than that so this is definitely a step up in nearly knocking like I said I can definitely feel that already but let's take another we're trying here [Music] so you have to give you an idea I'm trying to sing appellative a pen at my club this was coming in at 25 and then the CTO at 30 CD vol THC oil was coming in at 30 but yeah I just wanted to check this out this is something new it's definitely it's been intense kind of high like I think like I was saying if it washes over you pretty quickly it's pretty intense the high just seems to spin out a little bit quicker than the least so when you're making dried leaf it does seem to kind of get you high for a little bit longer but this I don't know so far to me this seems like it's a bit more intense and maybe a little bit shorter than high but definitely kind of nice and fun nonetheless so check out the links below and you can check out more about the all science THC oil bake oils gelato banana cushion heisenberg berry and i'll post some links below get your own vaporizer this is pretty cool and then i guess until next time thanks for watching thanks for liking thanks for sharing and subscribing I do appreciate it and then yeah so next time stay vaping stay happy stay high and take care everybody peace out", "daMbJ7rTOK8": "youtube what is up what is up what is up it's your homie

episode of Bob's BOM buds we have the very amazing gelato 33 or aka Larry Bird has another bomb bud to add to Bob's bomb buds collection gelato 33 is a cross between Finn mint Girl Scout cookies and sunset sherbert it was created by a cookie fam and sure bin ski gelato 33 has also gained the nickname Larry Bird it's a well balanced hybrid being about 50% indica around 50% sativa it boasts an average THC level range between 18 and 25 percent THC the intense high from gelato 33 can be powerful but not overwhelming an almost balanced high that tends to be more like an indica high it might be too much for beginners to handle and is recommended for experienced smokers first-timers beware the buds from gelato 33 are very tight and dense small sized buds the popcorn size buds are very similar to other indica dominant strains the buds are dark forest green with orange hairs and a hint of purple the buds from gelato 33 smell very earthy and has that familiar cush smell to it mmm cushy buds it's intense but not overwhelming high is best for treating chronic pain nausea PTSD anxiety and depression have you had the chance to try a lottle 33 aka Larry Bird if so let me know what you think of this amazing cannabis train in the comment section below well that's all for today's episode of bob's bomb buds if you like bomb buds and this video please like and subscribe to my channel for more great bob's bomb buds content and remember stay let friends", "jVJzhCQ2wng": "[Music] what is going on welcome back to the I smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene so this is episode 4 about 2020 strain review series and today I'm gonna be taking a look at sunset sherbert let's talk about the background of this caliber strain I've been excited about covering sunset sure but for some time this is an absolute powerhouse of a strain that crosses Girl Scout cookies with pink panties and indica dominant hybrids it captures the complexity of the Girl Scout parents and its appearance it captures some of that magic with both these parents in the tert profile and it is a really nice strength interesting fact it's also been bred back with the Girl Scout cookies to create gelato so if you're a fan of gelato any of those Cali strains that have come from the gelato lineage once that removed in the sunset sherbet super interesting that stuff big up to Roadrunner this batch of sunset sherbet has been organically grown using the no teal growing method and this gives some of the nicest tasting cannabis that I have had the pleasure of sampling today I've already reviewed the skittles grown with the same method and this week it's all about the sunset sherbet you can also check back on our previous strain reviews going all the way back to 2016 via this link I smoked mag Cote UK forward slash strain reviews we've got all in the data they're organized into a table so you can catch up with what you've missed learn the lineage of some brand new strains and generally enjoy some of the previous smoke reports we've put out on the channel really famous breeder this one mister shipp in ski he has been a guest at several UK cannabis club events taking place over the last couple of years he bred the Girl Scout with the pink panties to create the sunset sherbet let's talk about the appearance of this cannabis strain looking at this bud in detail I love the complexity of this bud it reminds me a lot of the Girl Scout cookies I've tried Girl Scout cookies on numerous occasions it's got these lovely deep mottled green with the darker leaf bases and the lighter color raishin of the bud underneath this got popping orange yellow pistols and they just look absolutely fantastic the blood structures are amazing especially considering this is organically grown in living soil so no nutrient use the soil is fed rather than the plants it's nice and dense it's got a solid bud structure and the complex look and coloration of this bud is lovely the calyx is a stat but not overly densely stacked into one nug so you can separate it quite easily I would rate this really highly in terms of look there are still some basis of Leafs left on there but it just adds to this different coloration and complexity I know if you'd have got this from a dispensary in California they're probably trim all of that off and you'd be left with these little boulders that probably didn't resemble this as much this is more than natural form of what the flower looks like before it goes from that really strong trimming process and I actually like this the smoke that it gives will be nice it's not going to taste data from the leaf bases because they're covered in trichomes as well top marks from me in terms of the appearance I would say that this looks nicer than the skills that I've reviewed last week and that got pretty much 10 out of 10 for every other area and that covers the appearance let's talk about the smell of the sunset sherbet let's get some of this jar slow whoa it's deliciously sweet and pungent this one again reminded me of that Girl Scout cookies flavor there's earthiness there's pepperiness and it's kind of like a sweetness underwriting all of that it's kind of a lot of really nice sort of smell just creeping in with a deep inhalation pungent offensive you know what I mean offensive if you don't like the smell of cannabis this is gonna piss you off instead of citrus but it's not like a sour or tart e-types no it's just hint there a little bit like hops really nice smell to it guys again nice and complex led with that pungency let's break it open and see what it smells like inside these mugs cor blimey the pungency just shut up the pungent notes just shut up to the level of blue like not Gorilla Glue like actual super glue when you open up a super glue so parents of this one include og cush Durbin poison so it's got that kind of gassy power to it and you really do smell that coming very super rich super strong smelling strange Oh lovely smell to this sunset sure but top marks from me but how does it taste my favorite bit of a review is upon us we are gonna taste the sunset sure but guys I've got brand new grinder here I've got a brand new lighter here I've cleaned the bong ready because I know in my last video featuring the skittles it wasn't as clean as it should have been let's grind up some of the sunset sherbet and put it into this nice new grinder should have definitely watch the grinder at first got a lot of new grinder smelt going on here smells like a bit like a pencil case I'm like I don't want that oh wait some ground some up let's put it into the bung and smoke a bowl of this fantastic smelling cannabis strain if the smell comes through to the flavor we are in for a treat guys we're going to test it out if you're joining me for this one you know what to do get those joints rolled bongs ready dab rigs heated up hit that pause button if you need to and I'll see you on the other side [Music] white ash deliciously smooth no bite actually pulled it further in than I normally do with a bomb because I wanted to bubble it at the end you noticed as I pulled out the bar we actually pulled the down stem up no need to cough no acridity the flavor that's coming through is kind of like the leading part and a flavour is the sweetness and the pungency is kind of gone it's sweet hoppy sort of flavor yeah really nice it's just not as strong is there the smell that was coming fro let's try again Bowl number two of this sunset sherbert and I'll see you all on the other side Cheers [Music] it's got a nice sort of cookies taste on the exhale very very clean no bite no acridity sort of sweet berry but not so pungent in the flavor and the bomb smoke I've got my agro vaporizer here this is a vape by a riser it's their most portable smallest vape heats up nice and fast the agro vaporizer I like the Arizer products you don't really have to do any cleaning because of the way that they are built you just make sure that the tubes get it tonight so now and then alright the vaporizer is ready let's try some of these sunset sherbert war you get a really really strong taste coming through that and what is it it's complex it's lighter that's more definitely more pungent there's more skunk enos in that flavor when I talk about pungent I'm talking about that classic skunk type flavor a lot more guess in that than less of a delicate that I've got rid of smoke interestingly some users reported it tastes a bit like sherbert and I'm getting like different sweet notes but not that fizziness that I would expect from like that the word sherbet but definitely like hints of berry skunky earthy pungent gassy tonight I mean all of those nice vapor let's talk about the effects at the sunset sherbet so as I was vaping this the bongs hit me and I can tell you this is a strong indication my body my eyes feel like this sort of closing a little bit and it's got a very very bright in here actually nice and relaxing but feels that I could be creative and with this sort of mood this mindset that is putting me in you know so so I like that about it yes a heavy smoke yeah I can feel it in my head but like not as in my mind in my head you know like feel it in your body but in my head I can tell from my voice that is on the indica side as well we sort of slowed down my talking a bit and to put a little bit more base and and took a little bit of the energy out of my voices well at the same time so solid indica effects there and that about wraps it up so let's sum things up today I've been enjoying that sunset sherbert is a lovely strain growing organically no-till living soil by Roadrunner big up lovely smoke and everything from the appearance which was complex in this different coloration nice trichome coverage as well but just the different colors of green making it look fantastic smell wise absolutely lovely really like those sort of under sunder tone berry notes in addition to that pungency and then flag well this is what I'm trying to work out is it better food through the bong or is it better through the vaporizer I think I prefer smoking it I'm just gonna I'm just gonna smoke one more bow and we'll we'll see win a mummy relax my main man [Music] Wow some smooth really nice clean smoke from that organically living soil growth week yeah they're smoking it to vapor there's nice through both methods effects wise the indica dominant highest is certainly kicking in nice and faster it's a strong strain suited for an afternoon or even in warm weekend smoke definitely got some creative energy there too as well I'm feeling good relaxed in my body and my mother what do you think about sunset sherbert and did you enjoy this strain reviews

and just try to keep it going like you guys don't already know what we're gonna be doing in this video but guys getting straight into it man we got the legendary all right the long awaited buddies liquid diamonds live resin cartridge review all right boys so for those of you that don't know what but it is it's a liquid diamonds live sauce cart all right live resin cart you should say and pretty much there's no distillate no additives none of that bs it's just straight up live resin slash liquid diamonds you know this one in particular is legend gx watermelon skittles sitting at a 71 percent thc all right boys so by the low thc percentage i could already kind of tell you know it might be a true light resin because live resins in general re shoot really really really low and thc percentages for some reason so i'm assuming this is right on there man if it was a distillate cart it would probably be over 80 all right boys so before we break this in though i do want to let you guys know they do have a cannabis drive terpenes one so be careful when you guys go to dyspo's and things like that because i almost got that one that one does have distillate i believe it has this i'm not 100 sure but this one right here is the true 100 full spectrum live resin all right so on the side of the box right here let me go ahead and read you guys this out right it says our full spectrum liquid diamonds extract is harvested fresh frozen and processed at sub critical temperatures to preserve maximum with the fudge they did a little typo there to preserve maximum cannabinoids and terpenes all right boys so this is just a fresh cart bro so i'm gonna go ahead and peel this open go ahead and peel the little sticker back boom take the card out open it like this lift the little box out boom out comes a clear little tube and as you guys can see through the tube man that oil is looking a little bit dark right this one is looking a little bit darker but go ahead and take it out the tube it honestly looks really really good for some live resin men i've seen some live resins that are just super super dummy dummy dark and brown but this one has a little bit of a lighter tint to it obviously it's still dark but it does have a lighter tint to it man i'm kind of excited to try this out all right boys so go ahead and take the tops off make sure you guys have those on if you don't it's probably a fake man go ahead and slap this on the trust worthy ooze variable wattage battery all right boys so i believe live resins usually have to smoke them at a very very low temperature so i'm going to have this one the lowest one it goes to is 3.3 so i'm going to go ahead and just go in on a hit man i'm hoping that this is good i'm i'm hoping it falls under the same category of ursa diamond cartridges man you know they're both live diamond live resins so it should taste kind of similar all right the only difference is obviously bunnies has different strains ursa has different strains and i'm on the hunt to see which strain is the most potent all right this one is an indica like i was saying so you know your boy's a fan of indigos man i'm ready to get faded right boys cheers yo all right i think i'm gonna have to go in on another hit man because honestly i that was a very very very distinct flavor so i can't tell you guys what it is right off the bat but if i had to try if i had to try it tastes freaking earthy it tastes like very very earthy like i don't know how to explain it man some very very oh genius in there and i like it i like that first hit but we need to get into this deeper man a bit uh before basing it off the first hit all right guys so let's go in on another one choose yeah sheesh i'm telling you yeah that tastes like a freaking dab so for those two first hits man i'm telling you guys that the legends og it has a very very very heavy flavor profile in this cartridge okay so i taste a lot of the oh genius like i'm talking about as soon as i inhale like it's just straight up punginess straight up earthiness and it's super super good if you don't if you guys have never tried an og man they just have this very very distinct flavor and just smacks you across the face okay and this one in particular i've never tasted legends og but it's a fire strain off basing off this car alone and the watermelon skittles so far i haven't really tasted it man so maybe i just have to keep breaking into the cart so it's going on hit number three um honestly after those two first hits i kind of am starting to feel a slight head change nothing crazy but i can see i can feel like you know i'm starting to chill out a little bit more than i'm already i already am so that's upside that's definitely an upside that's definitely what you want to see out of a cartridge menu you want to feel the difference you want to notice the difference you want to see the difference okay so going in on hit number three man i want to try to take a blinker out of this i'm gonna die actually i don't know if i'm gonna die but either way let's go in and get even more faded man you guys could see it in my eyes just starting to progress slowly which is honestly really really cool it it all falls into the full spectrum live resin honestly and that's why live resins are just a whole lot better than distilling man so cheers guys the blinkers for the boys i'm gonna keep it real with you guys that blinker just altered my whole game bro like i literally just my head change went from like slowly progression to oh 180 bro i feel the high now like it's just setting tingling sensations down my body and it feels good it feels good i must say like honestly like all right when it comes to cartridges guys or any just weed in general okay depending on the strain you know and depending on the terpenes that it has all that stuff it just it it's gonna cause you a whole different high every single time man and this time this legends og slash watermelon skittles this combination their terpenes their flavor profiles is just an awesome conjunction of you know of like mixtures man and it it just it just tastes so good it makes your body feel good it's just the overall taste is like fire it doesn't taste like live resin you know like like i always complain about the the statistic of the tasting live regular tasting live resin man like stizzy has the same tasting life resin friendly farms has the same tasting live resin i don't know what other cartridges come to a select or is another one of those companies um their live resin is just so ugh like it's just so weird dude it's just the taste is just like it's not an enjoyable taste that's why i don't go to stizzy and cop live residence i'm sorry suzy i love you guys i love everything about you guys except you you're like resident pods are just man you know they're not the best friendly farms you know same thing they're like resin carts or man their flavor profiles on them like you'll get a cartridge every now and then that's all right yeah this is a pretty decent flavor but for the most part the flavor profiles on some most of the live resin cartridges they all kind of taste the same you know when you exhale you just get that really really nasty taste in the back of your throat and like for me personally it makes me want to gag and throw up i'm one of those who's like if i taste something nasty i'm just like oh no it's a no for me boss so this one does not taste like that one it has a very very distinct taste like i was saying earlier in the video um the legends og stands out a lot and on the exhale i do get a little bit of a sweetness i'm not getting a crazy sweetness you know so i'm not really tasting the skittles too much but the high man the high is just so relaxing so relaxing what so i'm going to hit number four because i just cannot stop enjoying this if this video speaks for itself you know when i keep hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting a car it just means that it smacks bro so cheers guys that's fire dude and i don't get that sensation of wanting a cough like i was saying with distillate i do get only like like for example today this is the first smoke of the day right it's currently like eight o'clock in the morning or something like that so i don't know about you guys but when i wake up in the morning my lungs are not they're not 100 you know ready to go because they still have to wake up take some big fresh breath um air and then um after that you know then you start smoking it's just more smoke going into your lungs and it's like i said it's the beginning of the day so it's not used to it and um it's just it just irritates a little bit more than it usually would you feel me but with this one i'm not feeling that sensation um i don't want to cough like crazy and the flavor is fire like i was saying but overall this this quality the quality of the cartridge is fire i just kind of wish someone will come out one day one day they're gonna come out with the live resin cart man that's at least the 85 percent thc bro at least the 80 i feel like i've never ever seen a live resident card that goes that high so maybe one day man any cartridge companies that are watching this please make it make your boy a 85 cartridger at 90. because you know i've we've only ever seen those in desolate cartridges and i we don't we know f with distillate cartridges no more boys we're on the live residence live ros and wave slash liquid diamond wave i think a lot of companies are trying to you know put diamonds inside of cartridges which is starting to work it's fire um like i was saying buddies i'm so glad that i was able to try this out i'm going on another hit i'm talking too much without hitting it boys blinker number two yeah dude that blinker just oh man you feel like like when you take the blinkers off of this you feel you getting more faded honestly like i'm just like stay i just stared off into space like i was like started thinking about like cartridge and food and stuff and i'm just like wait hold on dude i'm making a freaking video that's how you know this cartridge is hitting man because when i'm faded i'm just like i'm just uh in my own zone you feel me so with that being said guys this watermelon skittles legend og buddies cart fire the liquid diamonds i'm starting to appreciate them a lot more so i think soon if you guys make it to the end of this video man i want to see all right if you guys would like to see my top cartridges of 2020 since none of them are going to be really distillate anymore it's going to be all li resin live rosin it's going to be a banger video so if you guys want to see my top cartridges of 2020 let's go ahead and hit 600 likes all right i know we could hit over 600 likes easily you guys do it all the time man when i don't ask you guys to smash that like button you guys are over here hitting 400 500 likes so i know this one time that your boy asked you for a like we could run it up to over 600 right boys and once we get that i'm gonna go ahead and go out and cop my favorite cartridges of 2020 put you guys on game all right boys so with that being said let's go ahead and narrow this down buddy's cartridge fire um you know i'm sad that it kind of took me so long to hop on this buddy's wave you know i was just stuck on raw garden so bad but um that i just really didn't want to pay attention to this but now that you know this i know this is not distillate i know this is some fire i'm going to be definitely copying these a lot more copying the earth is a lot more i want to try a 710 um pod again uh tier one possibly and just see how how that gets me i could already like imagine dude just how fire that one would be right so 600 likes we'll get that cracking buddies super fire i love this strain legend og watermelon skittles even though the tc percentage isn't too high it still does what it needs to do the full spectrum high is on point and the flavor is fire too it's not the best tasting i'm not gonna say it's like crazy insanely good tasting it's live resin so but um for this one in particular it does taste pretty decent you know um and with that being said guys this [ __ ] is fire eight out of ten for me if it had a little bit more higher tc percentage you know that that would be the nine out of ten for me so um yeah

multi-strain review of tyson ranch cannabis now i've been able to collect up five strains i've got two here in los angeles and i've been able to get three from las vegas and i tried them all and today we're going to talk about them and decide which one is worth our money we love iron mike iron mike is a bad ass little dude he lived the life of 10 people already even went down with the sharks how crazy this guy is man and i'm telling you mike if you see this video that's the most ballsy thing you ever did crazy crazy [ __ ] right so today it's all about tyson ranch and look what i've got in my hand this is the winner but i'm not gonna tell you what it is and i'm telling you i tried so many flowers i really really really when i like something give it props and this flower gets props it's good so let me just load up my little vapor cup straw real quick i've got two scoops in there already we're just gonna put a little bit more in there to make it three it's about the same as a bong hit and when i get to about a minute and a half from the end of the video i'm gonna stick it down into this vapor cup and i'm going to enjoy a little bit of tyson ranch with you guys the very best of tyson ranch that i tried and i'm not saying that i even have the best i keep trying new strains so always looking for better and from wheat entertainment i get some great tips and once i get those tips i run down when they drop those flowers and try and get them and really put them in a list because you can't remember this stuff you gotta have lists and lists of lists of lists to really remember how you like stuff so today we're going to talk about tyson ranch and the one i like the least to the one i like the most and the one i like the most it's got to be strong with focus and with the possibility of euphoria to grin me out all the way to perma-grin smile and that's really hard to do so coming in today as we start at number five and my least favorite of all the tyson ranch strains that i tried is something called triple o g and triple o g is an indica and this flower has 26 thc and i got it at planet 13 in las vegas and if you haven't been to the planet 13 that place is packed well before the uh pandemic it was packed and i'm telling you you could wait an hour to get in there the lines are all the way around the building to get in it's just crazy and one day this will be the mecca of flower in las vegas lounges bowling alleys restaurants hotels and then when real uh recreational legalization comes in when the there's cannabis uh clubs everywhere las vegas itself will be the wheat capital everyone's gonna go in there every weekend it's just fantastic pre pandemic i'm telling you vegas is the funnest place for weed i'm an insider i know i go to vegas every two weeks pre-pandemic and hang out with all people smoking weed just smiling it's the greatest thing ever coming at number five triple o g and one thing for the record it's not just tyson ranch triple h i tried maybe three or four different triple odgs and none of them really did it for me i think i gave this flower 7.5 pretty low on my scale if it's really really bad i don't review it and sometimes a review a bad one every once in a while because i just don't want people to buy it it just depends anyway i try not to review the flowers i don't really like them so moving up coming in number four also vegas strain tyson ranch sour diesel this flower has 25 thc it's sativa and i gave this flower a rating of 865. now it's funny with sour diesel sometimes sour diesel can be good or just okay this is one of those hit or miss strains sometimes good i would say it's even more not good than good but it can be good and this flower got it uh 865 and it was my fourth favorite of the tyson ranch strains but we're moving up and i think the flowers start to get better here at number three coming in at number three we have something called tyson cookies and this flower has 25 percent thc it's a hybrid and i got it at cookies woodland hills and i gave this flower in 875 but i was joking about it because i think they should have called this is their tyson cookies they should have called it tyson jackie meaning it's jack herrera now if you smell this and you put jack herrera five jack rays right next to him you couldn't tell any difference and my nose doesn't lie i'm not sure what this thing is you're not sure what anything is but the nose is jack herrera so i'm going to call it jackie i've been joking about that after i did that video i'm going you know tyson just called tyson jackie such a good name after this seinfeld carrier impossible so anyway i thought those flowers started to get better and this is where the flower flowers for me started to get better with tyson cookies and this flower got 875 meaning it's a good strong flower if you got this flower you're not disappointed but for me it was uh a jacquerash flower and it was my third favorite of all the tyson ranch strings but we're moving on up so now i'm going to stick my straw a vapor cup in there that amount get your two bong rips or if you stick it down into this vapor cup you're going to get 12 flavorful drawers probably if the flour doesn't give that then it's not a flavorful flour some flowers that are really crystallized can give you 20 draws and i love this thing and if you're looking for ways to make your flower go farther i'm telling you this thing will make you use a lot less flour you'll like the experience better you don't stick up your house and that's one of the reasons i see a lot of people grabbing this right now people are grabbing it because they don't want to stink their house and also like oh my god how much weed did i save and you save so much weed it's awesome you save enough sweet weed that you can keep those stash buds and i'm telling you you're watching my videos because in 2020 excuse me in 2020 20 i'm going to ask people to break out their stash sashbot so we can use them together it's a lot of people with vapor cup right now grab one of these things 2021 is going to be virtual it's going to be unbelievable and you can join in all right so coming in at number two we have something called northern toad and i went to get the toad there's another string called toad and i ended up with the northern toad but some posts said northern toad was better than toad so you just never know if you're gonna win or lose in this game you never know northern toad has 32 percent thc making it the high thc out of the tyson ranch strange that i tried it's an indica i got this at la cush just a few weeks ago and i gave this flower an 8.75 meaning it didn't grind me out but i like this flower and if you haven't tried northern toad it was good it was only little little buds and it was dry in the jar but forget about all those things this is all about the vape was good the something something was good enough and it was enjoyable so if you see northern toad and you like tyson ranch you should get this one it's good and it was my second favorite of all the tyson ranch strains but we're coming up to number one and my favorite of all the tyson ranch strains it's not even close between them it's something called rainbow cookies and this is a vegas strain this flower has 24 percent thc it's a hybrid this flower was bought at planet 13 and this flower got the nine and this was my favorite of all the tyson ranch trains it wasn't even close this flower at a certain point put a smile on my face and if you want to try the best of this ranch that i try the best is rainbow cookies now rainbow cookies is in this cup right now and you can see it is the vapor is gathering i've got this cup set to 320 and we're gonna check it out rainbow cookies at a vapor cup at 320 degrees i haven't done this flower in a long time and i know it's gonna happen so i'm very looking forward to this this is the end of my day today after this i'm gonna have some good food maybe i'll even stick my tub into a hot tub oh my goodness days just starting everybody thanks for joining in it's really fun for me i really do this for myself i do it for tips i really enjoy giving the knowledge to people this journey won't last forever i'm telling you to do all these flowers so i don't even say it's a lot of work i would say that i do more than i have to because i want to get the reviews right for the cultivators this is all respect for cultivators it's not easy to do this so even if you don't get a high score not every batch gets a high score right i'm in the know with this so you can get a really good thirty percent marijuana the next time you grow it the bulbs are older the air conditioner has got some dust in it and you're gonna everything changes next time it could show up in a 20 flower it's not an easy game if you get a chance to get tyson ranch rainbow cookies it was fantastic i love this it's smooth and wonderful and it will make me feel happy

"z8Ga2A0sTwQ": "[ __ ] Boise man and today I got a wee review I was gonna post this up yesterday but I enjoyed it too much and huh I liked it anyway so today's strain is a Thin Mints Girl Scout cookies and the cartridge is a distiller 1/2 gram and it's made by Burano I believe that's a Maryland company that's one from and it's a hybrid so THC percentage is 80% and I don't know how I think CBDs got 3.11 and yeah so it's got a good taste yeah unbelievable I mean I after like through two seconds I'm coughing my ass off like this is for all the people that said that my cookies cart was fake right but i'ma show y'all this one right and y'all gonna see oh hold on hold on why I said look the same okay so this is the box right y'all and that's right yeah Girl Scout cookies yeah 60 bucks four or five or you know for a half a gram and here we go right here so look at that beautiful oh yeah I'm beautiful too so beautiful man so perfect so I'll just drive it right I'm a little pen so we're gonna do a pre I think this is dead it would die on our view huh so", "90WDhrnrSZA": "what's up airbrush - boy you had them here for how cannabis live and we're back with another review video make sure you like subscribe and watch to the end for a chance to win a free prize also check out my website that be dead without Ohio canvass live.com enjoy the show [Music] what's up everybody employed mastermind here in Valhalla cannabis light and we have a very special review today this is the botanist has now put out products and they actually did a project with you guessed it would word make a fire rock and so now they've created a vape cartridge this basically fire rock or woodward flying cannabis flower or trim and they've used this to make TAC baked cartridges so here's some material that I received when I purchased my product and it says here the botanist babe Carter's art strain specific makes feature complex cannabinoid profile is crafted to unlock the natural benefits of the cannabis plant this is a targeted recipe our craft extraction techniques achieve a uniquely potent and truly flavorful product only one ingredient cannabis the botanist cartridge features a highly refined distillate based enhanced with a complex minor chemin of cannabinoids I can never say that right kind of annoys viana TC unlocking minor cannabinoids our distillate is refined using a proprietary post extraction process that captures beneficial minor cannabinoids that enhance the effect of the TC resulting in a smooth and highly potency product mmm purity no fillers or botanicals our base will never use any harsh fillers like vitamin E acetate or I like this one both technical terpenes I learned a lot about those recently our oil contains one ingredient cannabis okay this is single source terpenes stay true to distrain each botanist vape highlights the natural turf pain profile of its cannabis strengths our small batch extraction process gently recovers her opinions truly reflecting the plants full flavor profile in the finished product traceability know what you're buying our oil is made using ingredients that can be traced from sea to sail to ensure transparency testing results for our products are always available ok botanist and here's a close-up of the card now you can get this at the botanist I'm not sure if in a dispensaries had this yet this product costs fifty four dollars with tax in Columbus Ohio I purchased two products I purchased wedding cake cuz we've all heard of wedding cake right and I purchased the sunset sherbert we've all heard of that too also another great fire rock wood wood product so let's talk about the expects here the specifications the total THC on the wedding cake is three hundred and forty eight milligrams of THC 0 milligrams of CBD and then the other cabin noise it says CBG 11 milligrams this was manufactured on April 24th and packaged on May the fifth so this is literally just hit the market so you know today is May the 6th so this just got put in the box but it was also tested back on April 29 so it was also recently tested on the Box on the front it says 348 milligrams and it also indicates this is sixty nine point six two percent THC these are half gram cartridges so basically for $108 you'd have yourself a whole gram and you can obviously mix and mingle that and get a couple different ones now they also had another strain there which is by Buckeye relief called ninety two cookies I didn't try that one yet because I haven't tried to flour yet so once I tried to flower from Buckeye relief on a 90 cookies then I will try the cartridge so I can give you a review on that also one let you know that there are some other products that botanist will have these are the tinctures and that will be in a different video so we're not going to go too far into it now but I will tease that for you my car got a little wet you know how it be it happens when you're trying to wipe it down with with a wipe so you don't get any germs on it anyway so I have not opened these so imma let you guys get the same unboxing experience then I'm gonna have we're gonna experience this together and like I said I'm gonna hold this back so you get a little bit light on it but like I said I'm gonna turn this here and maybe we can see a little bit better and there's a little wood there on the box so there's a tab here and then there's also a seal there I don't know if you can see that on camera now but there is a seal there and so I'm gonna go ahead and open the one I want to open the one I've been rushing to open is the wedding cake so I'm cracking this seal baby doc at this crack with my nails and then I'm gonna I'm gonna pull out this little brown tab here I'm assuming that's what you're supposed to do so we're going to try this together folks and no-knock whoo-hoo now here's a surprise guys here is the cartridge interesting enough they have put a piece of styrofoam in there not sure I think that's just to stabilize it so that it doesn't get moved around I think that's good to keep it from being disoriented up close I could show you check it out now there is a washer on here which a lot of you familiar what this is for a different type of battery that has a magnetic mechanism on it so I'll show that again and then obviously this just screws off okay now it's just a regular 510 thread many of you asking me about that this is it guys this is a cartridge only product surprise no battery oh my gosh how are we going to hit this thing so we have a couple of different options first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to try to use a battery that came with the Cure Ohio cartridge for comparison here's a cure Ohio oil half a gram and here is the botanist Woodward oil obviously there is a color difference don't let that concern you oops good thing I didn't break that would be all that so many of you know the cure Ohio battery is reusable so I'm just going to screw this on here and we're gonna find out if the wool it's a work for us so here we go wedding cake by Woodward processed by botanist and here we go it does work impressions this is smooth it is not harsh I can taste a little bit of wedding cake but not a whole lot so I like the packaging I think it's smart to have a little styrofoam in there to keep it stabilized so it doesn't fall around in there and maybe get turned upside down the package is designed to hold it so that it doesn't have anything going on with it as far as its orientation I mean there are a few little bubbles in here but honestly folks that's not uncommon with vape oils especially when they're loading them hot so there could be able to few little bubbles I am but it is a very smooth bait but I'm looking at terpene taste and flavors I'm not really tasting any wedding cake terpenes that I'm familiar with and you know just for reference I currently have some wood wood wedding cake folks so I'm sure I'm not tasting turps on this so we've went through that one and you know I don't smell in terms either but what I could also do is I could put this on an aftermarket battery just to be sure and see if we get any difference because those batteries are pre-configured at a certain voltage and I've learned that sometimes having something at a different voltage will affect your experience in your taste so I have to set at three point five volts it's still very smooth it is a very smooth like this doesn't hurt your throat this is very smooth but I just don't really taste anything so I'm set that aside for right now this is a vision to spin our battery by the ladies man these are like tanks the next one we're gonna go ahead sunset server so I again box is the same same packaging specs comparing it to the Woodward let's see the total TAC for the sunset server is 346 milligram point 95 346 point nine five milligrams and also the CBG is 11 milligrams I will talk more about what CVG is comparing to CBD in a later video so or you can just you know look it up we'll talk about CVG and CBN as well okay this one package exactly the same way the oil quality is the same a nice clear gold color and I'm gonna do the same test I'm gonna put it on the trusty cure Ohio battery but you before I do that OPSEC removed a little magnetic adapter which comes in handy if you have one of those devices that has a magnetic battery and I go guys now lift the sunset server I taste I taste it I can taste a little bit more Terps terpenes with the sunset server it reminds me of the flower so I would say both of them hit smooth I would say there's even maybe a little bit more I mean this again maybe a little bit more of a bite then with the wedding cake feel a tickling my throat a little bit but is it art trying to sit on this and hit this all day probably so yeah I'm gonna do the same thing before I'm gonna swap it with my vision here and I'm gonna see how it tastes with the vision like I said and I've got the vision at the lowest voltage was 3.5 volts if you want to know I have no idea what the state has their batteries and hopefully set could be higher could be less we'll have to find out so here we go okay did we get our malfunction well that's interesting guys it's not working so let me try to turn yourself and this is a fully charged battery so let's see okay there we go interesting I had to turn my battery off and turn it back on all right so it's been a couple minutes and let's talk about effects so what did I notice because I'm familiar with both of both of these strains personally overall I don't have any immediate psychoactive I'm not overwhelmingly getting a head rush type feeling which is good I don't want something that's just gonna take my head off and make me feel like I'm getting ready to have a headache so I want a balanced effect not looking to just be you know out of my comfort zone I want something that makes me feel comfortable when I I'm very picky about fake cards and if you know me and watching other videos how many babe card videos have you seen so I don't do very many so whenever I do do one is because I want to find out if things are improving or if I'm gonna learn something about it and so other bait cars that I've tried I don't quite remember them having the CBG in it and so I need to do some more research about CBG before I start trying to tell you about CPG so I'm gonna do some homework on that and when I come back with a 92 cookies fake card that's when I'm gonna have a little bit more information about the CBT other than what I currently know now which is what it says on Wikipedia so I want to know some more about it and I want to have some more experience with this product that way I can tell you a little bit more details about what I'm feeling overall over time but immediately this definitely helps me with a little bit of my anxiety and this is actually a little bit relaxing to me and that's what I'm starting to feel as this video goes on normally I will take a break and come back but the effects are more immediate with this cartridge so there's no need for me to take a break and come back I'm already feeling some positive effects of the product so what I think the feedback will be is that the packaging is great I'm very satisfied with the packaging I think this is just big enough I like the slide out factor you just have to get used to pulling this brown part out to slide it out I think that was smart I think putting a little piece of styrofoam in there was a smart idea guys so if you guys have the botanist owners of the botanist if you're watching this I think you did a good job with your packaging the only concern I might have is that if we have a lot of these stacked up like this depending on where they are in a dispensary that the oil is gonna lay down and then you know I guess we need to find out it's getting this box stand on its own and I don't think that it can and so what I'm thinking is well let's see yes it can't stand us home so part of with for me I keep all my oil Carter just a nice write up so you know the easiest thing you could do you know is take maybe one of your other containers and just take your battery and set them in there and this is an easy way for people to keep your cartridges from being like you know all weird-looking when you pick them up never let your cartridge be stored laying down sleeping so I think botanist is showing me right here as I'm moving them around on my desk that this cartridge box can stand up on its own and so it's a product good idea when you're not using the cartridge maybe keep it stored in a box standing up near where it's not gonna have a lot of activity you know I'm a bum push it up against my desk I'm hitting my desk and the cartridge does not fall that the box is not falling over and so you you're doing better than I thought bottom this with the box I mean because size and dimension matters when you're trying to have something stored and something convenient so the box is standing on its own even though it's empty I have a good thought that it will probably do the same thing even if we put the cartridge in there so my opinion I think this is a good product for you to try if you're a person that likes bait cartridges if you are someone that is looking for a lot of flavors I think there's still some room to roll I think that they should work on adding a little bit more terpenes I want to really get that cake flavor when I hit the cartridge but at the same time I'm very satisfied with the effects of how I feel the house affecting my middle and I'm glad that is not overwhelming me or causing me to feel like I am just so impaired that I can't speak properly and I'm glad that is helping me with my anxiety and also with a little bit of focus and concentration so with that saying I'm gonna recommend that you do try these products and give them your honest review and your honest opinion and you can also send in your reviews to me at Ohio cannabis live at gmail.com or you can send me your videos through the messenger and I will happily share any videos or be glad to do an interview with you / zoom or Skype or messenger so that we can have an honest discussion about how you feel about this product because that's gonna be the new thing now as we're gonna start doing things together since we're all at home or on limited restrictions in some cases we have to start doing more stuff to interact with each other instead of just watching videos on videos are great but just the one sided video can get kind of boring so going forward we're gonna try to have some interaction and have some more people in these videos besides just me and I want to hear what other people's feedback is it's not all about just my feedback but your feedback matters too and that's why I added the feedback section on my website wlky.com and you can go there and give some growers some feedback and let them know how you really feel and I think that's important for the companies to grow so make sure that that like subscribe button I'm gonna go ahead and wrap this video and we'll see you again next time [Music] [Music]", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace", "5t-gmr0Opa0": "[Music] hey what's good

what's up guys it's your boy savage back yet again with another review for you guys if you guys didn't know every Friday we try to come out with the banger card tree bu dropping is what is the hottest on the market right now what am i using you know what's poppin what's not and usually we try out some of the best stuff and sometimes we get really really unlucky and end up with some crappy cartridges but for today's video men this video has been a long awaited video I've had a lot of viewers telling me go try this you need to try them they're the best in the market and you know your boy after long time in the works we finally got it coming to you guys so tell you boys without further ado we are gonna be reviewing friendly farms true full spectrum live resin cartridges true full spectrum boys you guys heard that right so for those of you that don't know or have ever heard of friendly farms they're a company based out of them it's where is it somewhere somewhere in San Francisco I believe and they started off just I think they started off from what I believe when I first started following him they were making these sauces and they were popping off man you know that was big and then they switched over to UM cartridges they have dabba related applicators you know all that good stuff and they're just killing it man they're just killing it so after you know having my viewers tell me you guys a guy that I needed to try this I obviously went out hit him up and they were super super nice and generous meant to be like yes for sure ma'am you work together we kind of want you to try it out because they even themselves believe that this is some of the best stuff on the market so I was like kind of happy you know it's good working with the company that that is so friendly you know it's just in their name so what they did though this isn't just a normal you know here's our product give us a good review this guy was like here's our product men give give the gift that make the video and give the people a real review don't sugarcoat it know that stuffin you already know your boy ain't sugarcoating [ __ ] so we're gonna get into this man way to be reviewing some of the best stuff so before we get into this video though they dropped the one new product it's it's not new Prada just a different style and it is hold on hold on one of the worried is that we're gonna lose in truck so it is this one right here so this right here is their cured resin cartridges so basically going to offer their Instagram this is what this is what their cured car cured resident cartridges right so our fresh cured liquid is just like our liquid live except this oil is made from cured cannabis plants rather than freshly frozen as with all friendly forms product zero additives zero dis list so you guys know for sure you you're not you don't have to worry about vitamin E may you don't have to worry about all this fake BS stuff that can possibly get you harm and when when you guys are smoking distillate I just hope you guys know that that you you don't know what's going on because distillate they're adding they're adding additives or added preservatives all this stuff to try to make that oil you know vapor Bowl dude and these guys what they're doing is just straight-up squishing the plant just adding it to a cartridge and shipping it out to you guys and of course your lab testing and all that good stuff so you guys know that you guys are getting some of the top-notch quality like in the game right now that's for sure so without further ado man all that rambling I think it's time we get into the cartridge tasting right so busting out a new battery full unboxing for you guys man so these are their batteries right here the this battery right here has three different heat settings it has a low heat as a medium heat and as a high heat all right so taking it out boo you get your charger in there all that good stuff but I think this is my favorite part right so hopefully this is focused in for you guys and give it a little second but when you turn it on a little rainbow colors so badass right so like I said the three different color settings I'm not really going to get in it's every every battery has has variable wattage at this point but this specific battery is you know prioritized for their own cartridges they give you the best temps and it actually it's actually pretty amazing dude because instead of just having one temperature like most [ __ ] cartridge batteries they switch it up with three and every single eight all three of them is a super different here I'm not even joking you could get a very very subtle hit with the lowest one and then with the high hit you get like a massive dab so that's something that you know how is very very happy with and actually you know what this is the cured resin we're gonna hop I have not tried the cure guys and I have not tried the cured resident all and I have tried the liquid life but I think I'm gonna try a new flavor so this one right here is dude these guys are killing also with the collabs man they've been doing collabs with connecting cannabis and they'd have been doing cold eyes with alien lab so if you guys are fans of those companies already you guys should definitely try out these man because it's literally just the the connected and alien labs cannabis just squished up and put into these cartridges man like friendly farms is doing their thing bro killing the cartridge game so look at this look at this packing around me show you guys the packaging because I feel like not a lot of you know what it looks like so hopefully that's focused in and yeah dude so in the fact that got the lab test results all that good stuff on the on the top they got the manufacturing date all that goody-goody and let's go ahead pull this sucker and then all this way to grow I need to smoke so white to all that good stuff and boom the black tip cartridge so before I get into the actual cartridge I'm gonna show you guys what comes in the box so in the Box you get this little paper right here it pretty much tells you how to use it how to get started with using your cartridge all the good stuff of how it's made why does it my cartridge to look full because as you guys can see right here there's a little gap but it has a lot to do with these cartridges and you know the headspace that it gives you and so this is the most important thing this is the most important thing that's cotton atten before but I haven't really looked into it and I think I might tell you the truth man because this is something pretty amazing I haven't really seen a lot of companies do it it says for every gear for every grand purchase $1 goes to a homeless or youth program in your community and it says thank you thank you you know what man thank you for any farms for being so friendly miss you got to have more companies like them and people who care about the community other than just make it a quick buck and that's something that you know says a lot it says a lot from a company so enough with the BS talking does it get this get the chief and boys so this one right here is the animal style if you guys have ever had the animal style but from connected cannabis it actually looks pretty [ __ ] crazy slap it on there so it's on the green setting I didn't even use it on the green setting right so first look into the animal style friendly farms cartridge Braille collab so let's get it boys hopefully you guys are enjoying the content so far go ahead and leave a like comment subscribe all that good stuff man it helps you boy more than you think and if you guys haven't already man go check these go check this company out if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you already know that the oh man some of the best of the best in the game cheers boys don't fail not sure why they didn't work all right I don't know what was wrong with the other battery but I think it was dead so we put it on a new battery he got it fully charged all the good stuff still on the green setting so let's go ahead and boys first in first try of this animal style so I'm actually pretty excited tell you guys to choose so let's get into oh my goodness oh my goodness well that was like a dad boys oh we did a good thing I need to take a big hit because not that was gonna kill me right immediately immediately off the bat boys the reviews coming in hot get ready so me off the first hit I haven't smoked at all I haven't done anything so I'm already getting a head change in my eyes are getting low I already feel it that's something that you instantly want from the cartridge you don't want to be having to puff and puff until you actually feel something so off of the initial rip your boy is gone no I'm not going but I don't want to say so that taste of that taste was like a really really really like medium to low temp dab just really really tasty in the oil and not even I'm not even talking about like do you know how when you taste distillate you can taste like the oil like this is this is like a good oil man this is like something you really want to tell you so see it's fire dude all right all right let's take another hit and get a full flavor profile see what the effects are going on then what is this I think this is a hybrid right all right this is a hybrid I'm hoping that it's a little bit more indica dominant than any you know animal style seems more like a sativa by the name mmm all right boys Cheers oh man that thing just opens up the pathways bill that literally the lung expansion is immediate and it's smooth it's so smooth like it's smooth but it makes you want to coughs just because you know your lungs are so full your lungs are so full with the greatness oh man in the excel it's just like a relief of stress but when you're exhaling it just like exhale you guys ever heard the term of inhale the good [ __ ] exhale the [ __ ] someone probably was chief in this and made up that quote because this is what it's doing and oh my gosh I'm just in awe dude this is amazing an amazing feeling it went from straight-up head to a full body in full head and I'm just in straight-up chill mode man after a long day of work man this is definitely something enjoyable something I look forward to chiefing on you know with most other cartridges I'm not gonna lie it's like it's there you know you have it you could just have bought it the other day but do you want to hit it probably not what this literally as soon as you can you you're gonna hit it row as soon as you get that a single opportunity to hit this bad boy you will I'm in complete love man there's these days we're gonna have to taste another one so this is a hybrid let's move on to the I think we're gonna move on to another hybrid well no wrong with the sativa so tan G tan G is one of the og strains in the game if you guys don't know the hand she's been around for a while I think oh you remember when I started in here nothing but I'll see what the city was there about usually cities are a lot more like pungent a lot more flavorful I've never tried a sativa in you know in live resin form or true full spectrum light resin form some let's see how that how that tastes us this one's a little bit more full to the oil bro the oil is so crazy looking you guys a little close-up of the oil real quick hopefully that's focused in ya know and I know a lot of people are gonna be like oh I'm turned off by the oil the oil why does it look so dark to like do just understand the concept of what um you know marijuana is a whole man when it comes to making these products like people think people have this you know this natural we're not even natural it's probably just been a rumor that's been going around that people are like oh that clear it is the better when in reality that's not the case at all you know there's rosin and stuff like that that are like white and clear but that's a whole different thing room this is this is literally full spectrum light resin in a cartridge bro and this is what you want this is what you want I'm telling you 100% coming from cybg himself this is what you want in a cartridge you don't want distally you don't want oil man all the other stuff that people are cheating right now is it has it's nothing close compared to this if you guys are able to get your hands on this 18 and over 21 and over whatever it isn't yearly will say if you can even get these just try it just try it so we're going in on the tangi sativa see if it's any any different than the hybrid I feel I'm already fated you I'm showing them but we're gonna do this for the tube cheers boys Oh oh my goodness that was unexpected that is good bro oh my gosh I've never tasted @anjghie that tasted this good like I've tasted tangi before but this is [ __ ] phenomenal whoa in full spectrum mode it's literally like a whole different experience man I'm not gonna tell you guys like you literally can't go out and try anything like this is for this friendly farms cartridge is like something I've never tasted before it doesn't taste like plug and play doesn't taste like city it doesn't taste like wrong guard and this thing is so distinct and so good and my lungs are just so happy because it's like so smooth too and just like it hits the hits in every single aspect bro like the smell the taste the smoothness the from the from the inhale to the exhale everything about this cartridge is phenomenal definitely great so I'm gonna turn it up there you see or think it's premium as a preheat function to on it so this is purple setting I'm not too sure if this is lower hot but what's going on the purple side oh yeah the big boy setting boys that's that put you to sleep sending holy moley yeah that's that punch you right in your face whoo that was a dad with I was phenomenal oh this thing is kidding I'm not even a fan of [ __ ] sativas but this is a hit tangey killed it all right so I guess we're gonna end out the video with where the hell is that I'm tripping all right the blue dream right here so this is the cured resin right this is going to be their newest addition and their newest them yeah their newest addition to the lineup so this is um the cured resin instead of the librarian yeah the liquid live I mean right so right off the bat this is their that then this is their new um cartridge within you well it's the same tip and everything but it's just actually I think it is an encourage holy yeah definitely upgraded well I think it's the same one looks like the same one just a new tip they added a little I mean yeah let me show you guys let me get a little closer yeah so it has a new there this is our logo up here up on the top and the bottom if you I don't know if you guys can repo not because they're reflection but it says friendly farms and the oil and in terms of quality of the oil it honestly comparing your right right away it looks very very similar to their liquid life except this one the liquid live looks does look a little bit more thicker in terms yeah definitely their liquid live looks a little bit more thicker a little bit more um definitely something you would see from a squish plan this one this would like a fresh frozen pie if you guys I've ever seen different types of planets getting squished are like if you guys are into that stuff I know it's kind of weird for me to say this but you guys should definitely go google that in terms of how different types of libraries and suffer made and you guys would really get a really Indian detailed look of how how things look of how things can taste of their their flavor profiles you know their aspects of what what they bring to the charts in terms of TC percentage to body lock you know all that good stuff so I mean get right into it I'm gone I'm faded so cured resin coming in hot boys this is the blue green by the way that blue dream a blue dream when I saw that name it was kind of like you brought me back to like I don't know why Blue Dream has just been one of those things that you know one of those strains that have been around for a while even like I feel like I heard about that straight in like junior high so I'm gonna lie though this new cartridge with the logo on top is it definitely some swag hopefully that's what you're saying alright so cheers boys cured resin let's see if it tastes any different Yushu show you guys a whole difference right I always think that can be able to tell too much about the high I might save this cartridge after hitting this and make you maybe make a full review we'll see about that but cheers boys was gonna do it hmmm I honestly can't even tell the difference in terms of taste it tastes pretty good obviously I can tell the the flavor the length of strain flavor but in terms of like you know when you get a cartridge like even if it's different flavors you still get the same that same little taste like because it's the brand taste you know it's what makes the brand the brand so finally formants did a good job so if you guys want to know like pretty much the Cure they made the cured resin lion just in terms to appeal to more of the consumer base because people I guess were saying that it wasn't too budget-friendly their liquid live and honestly like you know and what I personally have to say if you're going to be doing you know consuming all these cartridges all these all these things you're gonna have to spend the bulk and if you're willing if you want to get some of the best stuff this is a right here man this is it like you you should go out and definitely get this because this is designer weight men you know this is that good stuff this is that good [ __ ] and they made this when the cured resin - like I said appeal to them to people with the lower budget you know people who only want to spend like I'm guessing like thirty thirty-five bucks on a cartridges instead of spending for like 45 so whatever the case is and honestly it's amazing like friendly farms is definitely doing their thing they're killing the game man if you guys are interested their Instagram is gonna be linked down below and you guys can go check out their product they've won multiple awards man definitely I can see why now I'm glad I got to test this out if you guys want to see some of their dab stuff you know these are their DAB sauces and we also got the the applicator we can definitely do something like that if you guys want to see some crazy ass challenge videos man like hitting for friendly farms at once or something like some something crazy man let me know in the comments below what you guys have as an idea and we'll probably do it so yeah get in the video I hear if you guys enjoyed it like I said leave a like comment and they", "HaLQwWEs3ic": "hi this is tina for thc tina reviews and today i am going to be uh testing a vape cartridge and it just goes on a 710

which is really high really good should be a really good vape i'm going to go ahead and try to open this box i'm not quite sure how open at the bottom [Applause] gosh this is really hard to go down and tear it okay there we go there's the cartridge there there's some really difficult packaging to open yes there's another barrier to the packaging [Applause] there we go there's the there's the cartridge the select a light live uh indica hybrid i'm going to go ahead and put it on my leaf buddy battery which i've had for eight months i think it usually works pretty well and i like that you can just charge it with uh just with like a phone charger oops so then screw that in there i already charged the battery should be good to go so so so uh it's a nice smooth draw um tastes kind of uh it tastes kind of like the wedding cake strain um not fruity but uh almost vanilla flavored um it has a really nice taste to it and it's uh pretty powerful so i definitely would recommend this again and if you guys have any questions or comments uh leave them in the comments for me and i'll try to get back to you thanks", "OyDk3o2pDSA": "how's it going YouTube this is Alex from T vape TV in this

description below cuz I made an Instagram for this channel look in the description yo find me tag me add me peace", "ljcGrFxwTRo": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] what's good youtube it's your boy cbd smoke doctor back with another review yes and let me tell you guys something man i really appreciate the support of getting from you guys out there i really do and if you're here for the first time welcome to the smokers room aka smokers lounge all right so as you can see from the shirt this review is coming in from dr ganja so dr gonz is kind of a big deal all right when you go on the website these guys got tons of things that you can choose from not only can you choose from dr ganja products but they also have a large variety of other products on their site and this is being one guys okay we got 95 delta eight thc oil cartridge all right and it has five percent terpenes added to it also this is the uh one milliliter cartridge and i already plugged this bad boy up just so y'all know i have tested this cartridge out and it is the bomb okay so let me just tell y'all guys a little bit about delta athc and um it's a little bit of magic inside here because delta eight is a little different than delta nine thc and um it's like the sister to delta nine it gives you mostly the same effects you won't get the paranoia uh what else you won't get that's basically it the paranoia um some people they do get anxiety from smoking regular thc you won't get that either okay this is a scaled down a little comma version of delta 9 thc okay but the effects are a lot similar so the difference between that and cbd now you know cbd we're only allowed to go to 0.3 on a thc scale now with this it's called delta 8 thc for a reason uh i don't want to get all scientific with you guys but i'm gonna tell you like this it it just seems like it's uh the highest closer to regular thc than i've ever experienced other than smoking regular thc if you mean if you know what i mean sorry about that so uh we'll get more in depth into it if you guys have any questions you really want to ask you can ask me in the comments all right because this is fairly new um i think this is a great area in our community whereas that uh we're able to exploit certain um scientific methods um that are used the genetics that are used but um this is awesome so delta 8 is the new boom this is not my first delta 8 cartridge matter of fact i am going to post another video um and i really enjoy them i love the euphoric feel that i get from them they're awesome so you head over to dr ganja get you one guys check it out telling you this one right here i'm really liking that all right and um this is called three shot and i love the company's product so far guys i really do and um like i said i've been smoking it uh sometimes other than smoking flour you want to get a little bit over the 0.3 threshold so that's when the delta eight comes in play because it can get me where i want to be guys okay and like i said i don't have um to deal with any paranoia anxiety sickness none of that stuff like that um it's just something that i really enjoying guys okay so this is the card here got it from dr ganja y'all guys go check them out and the taste is great like i said i only have five percent added terps into it so it's not major but it does have a great taste to it uh i love the natural taste also so that's just me when i do these vapes and um the oils and stuff like that i actually like that natural taste so they didn't have to add any terms any flavors or anything like that to make me enjoy it okay so um this one here has a more natural taste and i have this on the lowest setting okay because if i turn it up i'm gonna cough up a lung that's how potent this is and then also you have tons of medical benefits that you're gonna get with a delta eight card all right so i'm just letting you guys know i will have a discount on the bottom in the description so y'all guys can check out also the link to dr ganja's website and then if you guys come back in a day or two you should see a review on this okay this is the sour blue berry cush all right so i'm excited about that so i got both these products from dr ganja's website and they carry tons more so yeah guys go ahead and check them out man all right use my link use my link why not all right so smoke doctor is signing out right now guys but i'll be back shortly because we got to do that blueberry cook all right so y'all guys stay tuned smoke doctor signing out guys peace", "7sStGqkMli4": "CIGARETTES, THE

Canada basics today we're looking at the best Penn batteries for 510 THC or CBD cartridges this episode is sponsored by New York vape shop you can find all the devices use in this video at NY vape shop calm and get a free gift with a code rough 2 with a growing trend of THC and CBD oil 510 thread cartridges out there you may find yourself in the dilemma of wondering which is the best kind of vaporizer battery to use for it there's almost as many types of devices as there are cartridges themselves we're gonna look at the stylist type the flat micro a variable voltage a mini compact as well as it box mod vaporizers [Music] first up is the stylist now the stylist is the most simple of all of them it doesn't have a power button does it have any controls or anything like that is air operated and it's just usually a simple stick with a 5-10 thread on one end they are compatible with most types of cartridges and are really really easy to use you just inhale and it automatically works just by inhaling through it the pros of a stylus are is they're simple to operate and usually like I said the most affordable the cons are you have very limited temperature options and usually they're small and they have a small battery capacity next up we have the micro or the flat style and you can see it's flatter it's not round like the other ones and it still has the 510 thread at the top and it fits most different types of cartridges one thing I like about these is that they're usually charging by USB and like I said they are adaptable with many different types of the cartridges pretty much any kind the difference between this and a stylus it does have a power button and many times not always but many times it also has multiple different power settings this is a Z steam cloud micro available at NY vape shop comm and it does have three different settings for temperature the pros are the micro Penzer they're affordably priced usually about 20 bucks for these they usually have micro USB charger rather than the the kind of you plug into the USB adapter they're very compact easy to hide a problem again is that they're usually small and have a small battery capacity next up we're gonna look at the variable voltage pin now much like the other ones this is a style like a pin style vaporizer but the big difference on this is that it has a variable voltage and usually this is at the bottom sometimes it's at the top though but usually at the bottom there's a little dial that you can use to set the voltage at different types and then you could use it for different temperatures different types of cartridges or just to get a different flavor intensity when you use the vaporizer these usually have a power button and rather than having multiple settings it's a variable control at the bottom the pros of these type are is that you can dial in the best voltage for your cartridge that you're using and you can use them with other types of add-ons as well - and usually they have stronger batteries than the other two smaller the cons are is that the height of it leaves the carts vulnerable and they're larger and they're less stealthy and can't really put them in your pocket as easily and this brings us to the compact style pin or them this is the actually of the Steam Cloud Mini 2.0 and these are like a side-by-side the cartridge actually goes down beside the battery they're USB charging usually and you can see that there's a little cut out there where the cartridge will go down into it they do require usually some sort of magnetic adapter that will help you adapt the cartridge and so it'll stick into the device when you stick it in there and they also require or they don't necessarily require but they work better with the cartridges that are a little bit longer and unless they have an adapter that actually extends it which some of them do I really like these kind because they're very pocket friendly the pros are that they're compact and stealthy and that insect connection it protects your cartridge because your cartridges handout in the device cons are it does require a magnetic adapter they're usually included but they're small and easy to lose and it's best suited for the longer cartridges as the small ones might get lost out inside and now we're going to look at the box mod you might consider the Box mod sort of the helicopter uh vaporizer pens it's a little bit more complicated most of the others it has a power button it also usually has a an up-and-down button to control the variable voltage it also has a compatibility with sub ohm tanks so you have a lot of vast compatibility here and you also have a lot of functions on these that you may not ever even need to use with a actual cartridge pin because they work with a lot of other kinds of add-ons and adapters and sub ohm tanks and such like that but they are so very effective for the cartridges they fit most 510 threads just fine and you can lower the voltage down to suit whatever kind of cartridge that you have in the device at the time I really like using the Box mod especially this one this is the steam cloud and it's the steam cloud box mod it's a lot smaller than some of the other ones it's very compact and really easy to use with these cartridges the pros and cons are the sizes 510 cartridges and sub ohm tanks it has most options for the power and resistance and different settings and it usually has the strongest batteries the cons are is that they are bigger and less stealthy although this is a small one and usually they're more expensive than the standard types of vaporizer pins so when it comes down to it it kind of depends on your needs if you really want simplicity and affordability one of the micro or the stylus is probably best for you if you like adaptability then you probably want to go with the variable voltage at the minimum I personally like these compact ones because they protect the actual cartridge itself and they're really really pocket friendly and stealthy and if you're a purist or if you really want to get the most bang for your buck you might want to get with the box mods and use it with lots of different devices if you want to pick up any of the devices that we use today be sure to check out NY vape shop comm use the code rough 2 to get a free gift and thanks again to those guys for sponsoring this video I hope you enjoyed this video on the best pen to use for your 510 thread cartridges if you did hit that like button and make sure to check out Rafal studios comm hundreds of cannabis videos made just for you this is Matt Roth how stereos thanks for watching [Music]", "9HLGL5fEt2k": "[Music] hi guys I'm van Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we are doing a helpful Pro tips video that I have been getting tons of email customer service requests for which is basically how to clean and maintain your tank or how do you get the most usable life out of your throwaway tank several people are refilling these and you want to get the most number of uses or you want to get them cleaned up so this video is basically gonna run through how to clean up your tank maintain it get it back to you level whether it's a complex tank like our sub old carbon fiber a Cannabis Cup winning tank or whether it's a simple 5-10 thread thing fact the matter is as you use on certain oils certain terpene profiles get in there certain areas get gummed up they don't get cleaned you want to get the taste out get your tank back to new level and this video is going to give you some really useful tips on how to do that so Before we jump into the video I don't know what type of level of Pro cleaning you guys are into but I'm gonna go to the extreme and basically supply all of the equipment that you will need in the worst possible case scenario so you are prepared for everything so let's go over what I have here I just have a couple tanks so I poured some dark eliquid into I don't believe in wasting CBD or medical oils I let them sit for a week so that so that they they get a little bit discolored and they go and get on to the gaskets and get all over the insides of tank I had my guys keep them upside down and whatnot so we can get the tank dirtied up a little bit just enough so we can show you guys how to clean it so we have our example tanks then over here let's get a nice little shot I've had this for a couple of years this is actually a little coiler kit that I bought off of Amazon anybody who's into vape mods vaporizers or small things for 10 bucks or 15 bucks whatever I paid for on Amazon it is super useful I use it in here in my office taking apart vaporizers - tampering with small things constantly I mean for 10 15 bucks you can't beat it it's called a mod coiler kit it comes with these really useful little ceramic tweezers so there don't conduct static electricity they come with these almost like like a little dental tool so you grab little small gaskets and little bitty things you can play some with small screwdrivers with all different types of sets scissors thanks for 10 bucks if you're tampering around these things definitely an awesome investment we have our tanks always good to have rubber gloves before you start cleaning your tank these things are gunky some of them are borderline gross you know the oil gets slippery the rubber does give you a good grip when you're taking the tanks apart much easier to throw away the gloves than to you know try to scrub off your skin afterwards the key component that you're gonna need whether you need any of the other things or not is isopropyl alcohol there's over 90 percent purity this stuff is not going to mess up your electronics do not use soap and water to clean your tanks or anything they'll come in contact with electricity only use isopropyl alcohol this stuff kills all the bacteria will definitely break down any type of oils that are stuck to the gaskets in your tank it's gonna give it a nice clean smell it's not gonna mess up your electronics this is your best bet to getting your tank close to you you can pick these up at any grocery store any type of you know CVS Walgreens little convenience shop usually will have this or you could order it online then I bring some styrofoam cups some thick styrofoam cups this is what I set out my bets are basically my little quarantine centers in two and then I have paper towels they do not particle eyes you don't want to use the types of the types of paper towels or napkins that once they get wet and you and you try to turn on them like almost like a toilet paper that they can particle eyes or fuzz up because you don't want that stuff in your tank coming in contact with your electronics it is just not going to be good so any type of paper towel that doesn't really particle eyes once it's gotten wet that just absorbs will be good for what we're doing so let's jump right into it let's get our gloves on and let's perform some open-heart surgery here all right first things first my first cup is gonna be like tobacco chewers not a big fan with polar spit cup where I'm going to dump my residue is it getting wasted or CBBC here we are simply using discolored thick and hardened to e-juice so I'm gonna get out whatever I can get out there upside down then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to start disassembling the tank into as many parts as I can while I wait I don't want to get my glass all dirty so put on paper towels so then I'm going to start a little isopropyl alcohol bath where I'm gonna take these cups and put some isopropyl alcohol in them for the various parts as you can see I fill them up about a quarter way just so the components can become submerged now make sure that when you disassembled your tank you remember kind of what you're doing so that you reassemble your thing properly so now that this has pretty much soaked away I'm going to remove the glass piece and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take off all gaskets and separate them put them into one of my little bath cuffs I'm gonna have one of my bath tubs b4 gaskets that gaskets off could need my tweezers to get this one out make sure that you remove all of your gaskets because a lot of times if you don't remove them and you get them lost when you're assembling or disassembling your tank and then you put your tank back together you're missing a gasket you cannot have a good connection or you can have leakage which you definitely do not want to do now when it comes to the sub ohm tank you don't want to remove these bottom gaskets here because they are your seal between your glass and your base and just removing them wears them out a little bit more so you want to keep those as good as possible so we're not going to remove these those are tight on the base we don't want those to become looser now you're gonna remove your heater you might have to put some muscle into it you might have to get some pliers because some of that residue might have been down there it might have hardened and this could be oily and slippery this ejuice propylene glycol I'm definitely feeling that slippery on my gloves so in the event that this is hard to unscrew a bigger set of pliers or you know or you gonna get a really put a little muscle into it yeah it was definitely on there pretty tight so I'm going to take this away now if you are cleaning your heater make sure that you get it into an isopropyl bath but most of the time when people are cleaning their subloan tanks they're just gonna want to switch it off once they clean it with a brand new heater to top it off so we're actually not going to put the heater into the best since we're gonna give it a brand new heater since we're essentially rebuilding the tank here with this so we're gonna give the bottom base a nice little bath and that is also going to bathe with the mouthpiece make sure it's fully submerged if it's not always just add a little bit of isopropyl we're gonna drop the glass in with the gaskets because it's not that dirty heater we're gonna throw away and the top piece which has the airflow control we're gonna put into a separate uh separate bath there now this guy is not fully submerged so I'm gonna add a little bit I'm gonna make sure that it is fully submerged there you can see and while I let those absorb generally what I like to do is depending on how dirty the tank is I'll leave it in there for probably four hours it's just to really let it soak up let is sterilized let the parts break down you'll come back and depending on what type of oil or CBD you have in there you'll come back and it will look like the eye so the clear isopropyl is now like Coke or coffee or something like that you know so depending on how dirty is what you had in there but I would say leave it in there for a few hours on the minimum and go from there sometimes people even say you know if they set this up at night they go to sleep and then they put it back together in the morning the longer you let it sit in there generally the deeper of a clean you're gonna get for cleaning purposes we're just gonna let it sit while I set up and show you guys how to clean a 510 threaded tank so we're gonna take our 510 thread tank that we have filled up with some yellowish ejuice here all you could do is you're going to unscrew the top piece there's any residues in there you're going to take the spit cup here and you're going to dump it out this is obviously thickened and hardened so there really is only a little bit of drops coming in and out now there we go it's kind of shaking out the is really much thicker you can remove the mouthpiece here because we will clean that - no you're gonna do is reassemble is appropriate we were just gonna let the tank submerge the tank body submerged in there and next to it we're gonna have a little mouthpiece submerged in there then we're just gonna let it sit and we're gonna let it bathe with these generally it helps because you can't take the tank apart in the cept several pieces like we can wear sub ohm tank it comes apart into about four pieces this is only one piece and because that center post that you have in the tank there's not a lot of area for that liquid to get into so when you're cleaning this it's not a bad idea to just kind of slosh it around for a little bit kind of wiggle it around to make sure the alcohol is working its way into the tank and into the heater is generally you gotta just I just spilled that isopropyl all over the place but you just kind of wiggle it around and then let it sit make sure that there's isopropyl getting into there now the next thing that we're gonna do off is before you would start any type of reassembly is you want to make sure that you clean off your tools because you just use these tools this is the one that I really used that was dirty I don't want to get the dirty residues back into a clean tank that is the last thing that I want to do so clean your tools you simply take a nice clean paper towel soaking a little bit of isopropyl you can clean off all the areas that you would have touched make sure it's nice and sterile now to be extra extra cautious while I'm cleaning my tank I'm actually for the final phase I'm going to remove my dirty gloves that have eliquid on them and all different types of tank residues and I'm going to give my tools here a little final final touch always get a little smell test that smells like clean isopropyl let that dry and we are gonna get some new gloves and we are gonna come back and now we're going to talk about reassembling the tank alright guys we've got some fresh clean gloves and we are back to start reassembling the tanks so as you can see here you can view the cups you can see that my isopropyl is definitely discolored and we didn't let it sit overnight I said we let it sit for like 10-15 minutes while we're showing you the other tank if that and this is just strictly an example but if you let it sit for a few hours you're definitely gonna get a lot more discoloration the liquid in the more discolor it is the better sometimes if you want to go the extreme once a liquid becomes discolored you take the components out and plort it into a clean isopropyl bath you know again that depends on the magnitude of cleanliness that you want to go and how you really want to let this stuff sit but now what I do is I set up what I call a little drying station well I take the paper towels that I had and I fold them up so I can basically take the components out of the isopropyl bath and allow them to dry Oh as much intro track as you can and for our little tank we are actually going to take that out and with 510 tanks what you want to do you want to try to let them sit upside down just let all the isopropyl to drip out now this this guy wants to tip over a little bit so we're gonna do these and this guy we want him to be upside down as well it's a little isopropyl drip down and that's going to take a little bit of a while if you want to spread out speed up the process of getting the isopropyl out of tank you can always use a hairdryer use either the hairdryer if you have it only take each setting from a distance or use it on the non heat setting on just a cool setting because if you hit it with a heat gun or something like that or hiking you do run the chance of compromising the integrity or warping the gaskets or the rubber pieces of tank so do not use any of those natural drying is usually the best or use a hairdryer but don't use it on a higher heat setting or each setting at all so now what I do with each one of these little components I haven't given it much much of a chance to dry put this guy off to the side I haven't given it much of a chance to dry so I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a clean cloth clean rag and I'm actually gonna clean and dry the glass and all the components within the tank to make sure move any residue and all so that I get it as dry as possible in the short amount of time so we can do this video do it properly okay that's nice and clean the base it looks brand-new it's nice and dry I'll see any isopropyl so this one's ready to go now if my gaskets I'm also gonna dry them off whatever you do don't pull on your gaskets like the rubber bands that weakens them it shortens the life of them it does compromise the integrity of the gaskets so be gentle with them don't flex on them in other words that's nice try it's back to white it was pretty yellow before we clear it into the eye on the alcohol that there so that one's done clean up this long these aren't exactly the most form-fitting gloves but you get the picture never clean off the mouthpiece generally a lot of residue with these sub ohm tank builds up around the edges so if you want to you take a little bit of isopropyl you just dip the cloth in there to give her a real final scrub you can really get a nice clean on it there even kind of fold up the towel towel a little bit clean the inside yeah you get that as good as new see no it's much better there you go now let me get a dry paper towel I can even clean the internals here a little bit oh yeah that's nice that's basically bringing you there and again you can use a q-tip you can go much more extreme I'm just really trying to give you guys the basics now we go dry long dry this guy off here okay now let's get to the bottom base a lot of times oil will set up in there the isopropyl actually did a really good job of just getting that out as you can see I haven't touched it since we pulled it out of bath so for this one you can take some isopropyl a really scrub down but in this event I don't see that as being necessary I'm just gonna go ahead and just dry it out give it an extra little clean I mean this doesn't look bad at all I suppose I mean the e-liquid and the ISO the isopropyl got rid of a liquid stains rather well just by even dipping it into that sometimes with different oils or CBeebies you could have a little bit of a tougher time you might have to give it a couple baths and a couple cleans but like I said case-by-case basis you will know exactly how far to make it so that's done there now we're gonna get the top air flow piece for this you want to twist around the airflow piece sometimes you get residue caught in the middle there or on different ends always good to twist it around to get the inside this gasket also removes because we didn't actually use this tank much there was really nothing caught in there it looked pretty new but you can actually remove it also so you can see because we didn't use it there wasn't any residue trapped in there but you could have removed this gasket also and dropped it into the bath with the gasket so we're just not gonna best so we're just gonna clean off the outside of it it's sat in the bath this will be fine get this we're going to dry off the inside and again if you want let these sit out natural air dryer more it might be better or if you just blow dry them off we're really doing an express job just to not make this video seven hours and for us to get it done so that now the most important part is is not to forget your gaskets so you want to make sure that you drop in your gaskets now with the sub ohm tank what's very critical about it is that you have a gasket that goes into each side of where the glass interacts so one of your gaskets is gonna go right here into the very top of the mouthpiece let me get these form-fitting gloves a little bit better you want to go in there you can take your little tweezers I'm gonna push them down to make sure it's in the crevice nice and easy just kind of go around don't poke the gasket to compromise it that gaskets in there nice you want to take that put your glass in there you gotta feel it line up then your other gasket is going to go inside the crevice on your bottom base you're gonna want to make sure you drop it in there it drops them there good because otherwise that will give you bottom leaking because your tank most the time sits upright so if you had to pick one of the two to do perfectly this is definitely the one the top gasket really compromises only if you leave your tank upside down or on its side with the air vents over so you put this one is good to your bottom base now we could have cleaned up the heater but in this event I just grabbed a new one this is a sub ohm heater you can pick them up on the website they come in five packs I already took the liberty of removing it out of five pack that's brand new then you're gonna want to screw it on to the tank you want to get a nice tight screw you're gonna feel the two pieces of metal connect you don't need all the time if you when you're cleaning your tank the next time you're gonna fight with it that much more get a nice good hand tight where you feel the metal connect and it's making electrical connection you're not gonna get any bottom leakage and then you're going to connect the glass and you're gonna screw the actual body of the tank together with screws into here and you want to get it tight don't want to over tighten it don't want to put too much pressure on the gasket is completely unnecessary then you're gonna take it you're gonna fill it prime it that's the place you do it but before you do that you want to do a quick atomizer check to make sure you did everything right in your tank works screw the top piece on and then you can do an atomizer check this is a brand new tank out of the box that hasn't been used and I gotta say if we do a close up even though we rushed through the cleaning procedure I mean this is this is pretty closely it's not a bad job for doing it really quickly and we could have done a little bit better but basically looks brand new so now we're gonna do an atomizer check before we fill it up because the worst possible thing you can do that we've gotten a lot of angry phone calls and we don't want this to be an angry phone call if somebody just goes to the process of cleaning their tanks takes a gram of very expensive distillates or something puts it in there and they didn't do something right or the heaters not working and now they're in a big dilemma where they just dumped a whole syringe in there and we don't want to be the cause of your frustrations so do a quick atomizer check to make sure you put the tank together properly you're all cleaned up and dried out what you're good is you just screw it onto a battery of 510 battery you're going to turn it on in most of the time when you turn it on it'll already give you an atomizer resistance reading right here it says point 5 ohms if we get good close up of that right here in the lower corner you'll get a resistance reading you see that resistance reading generally that means that you have an electrical connection now what you're gonna do then is you're gonna turn your wattage all the way down all the way is down as far as it goes then you're gonna push the fire button and as long as the timer starts don't leave the timer on a long time because then you could get a burnt taste in there burn up the coil but as long as the timer starts you know that you did a good job and that tank is gonna work and you put everything back together properly the atomizer you put in there's legit everything is good on that end so now you can take this tank and you can go through the priming and filling procedures that you would as if you purchase the tank from us a brand new so now that showed you exactly how to maintain and clean the most complex tank that we offer and it's not is only going to be easier than that one I promise you so we're gonna jump right back to the tank that has been sitting upside down now what you're going to want to do with this is now it has an isopropyl in it so you can see there's still a little isopropyl in it so you have two real options you could do here is you can take a very nice thin piece of thin piece of napkin and you can use your tweezers and actually get inside there to get it out to kind of spin and twist it around that might take you a while or you can use a blow dryer trip on this one - is he use make sure that you get it nice and dry on the inside I actually take my glove off for this one because this is a little bit more delicate than these gloves weren't exactly sized for me the glove does not fit so what you do is you take your napkin sorry not a napkin your paper towel you can roll it up into a nice little fine braided string so it has a little bit of substance and it's ultra thin then you get this string in there you get it between the center post the inside of the tank and you can actually kind of move it around and get any remaining pieces of the isopropyl out it's working just fine here it's gonna take you a little bit of time because a very thin very small very delicate so I honestly suggest using the blow dryer method or letting it sit upside down for a few hours that will definitely work for you too once you've gotten basically all of the isopropyl particles little droplets out of there you know that you will be all set to check to see if the tank works and get another fill on it including these little 510 tanks if you're putting different strains in there or if it stops not performing but it still works that's because there's residue gummed up in there you want to get a better taste out of each one to make sure it's a taste neutral and you get Paul residues out definitely good idea to clean your tank before you fill it this one I can still feel my hands it has a little bit of isopropyl on so it's good dry it off get inside the mouthpiece get the air holes now when you screw it back together and we're gonna do the atomizer test we're just going to use this mod battery remember when using your honey stick carbon fiber that carbon fiber battery you're gonna use a five ton tank on it make sure you flip the ego adapter upside down otherwise it won't read and it won't work so you flip it upside down let's turn it off move this little silicon protector screw it on now we're going to turn our battery on as you can see now it's registered at one point three ohms which is actually the factory specs for the tank as you get residues and they're dirty the resistance will actually go up on the ohms so now we push it oh wow I even heard it hissing there actually burned off some of that a little isopropyl and I still be trapped in there but now we know we clean up the tank the resistance is back to the factory specs on the original heater and it is ready to vape so this is a good way to clean you little 510 tanks get a little bit more life out of them get a little bit more usage out of them and when you're going in between tanks to make sure you're clean and pure so for this and several other cool pro tips make sure you subscribe to our channel

outside because it's a nice day and I just got this brand-new stand that I bought so I can record on my phone easier it's a nice little thing you can just stick your phone in there using that right now and I'm already loving it just because before I was just [ __ ] around with she putting shine on top of [ __ ] this is a nice little thing that about that today I'm reviewing my first disposable with a pen this is called ace Valley and it's indica vape that's the first time buying a disposable vape pen at the dispensary about a spare leaf on in Calgary our rate across from co-op on all 11 pass yeah anyways he I wanted to try a vape in because I tried a nexus one so I just loved it it was like literally just inhale it and that's it you don't turn anything turn anything on I got to recharge anything you use it until it's empty and then you throw it out this weight is two point two eight grams hope this isn't I don't know how it's gonna turn out sound wise but to to plane grams I think was fifty bucks so perfect the dollar thing and she has a pretty surprising amount of weight to it too so I'm surprised at how much there's weight like I want to get a vape pen that's just like this but I could mean we use it like I have one almost like it very close I should go get it but I want to go again but this is a straight-up indica let's see THC they're saying 180 milligrams CBD so we got anyway just try it out it's crazy it's so weird you just like take this thing that like doesn't have any connection or anything electrical on it that you can see you just inhale it and out comes feet and I can't like that I can hold up a cigarette as someone gonna get smote years the vein production is pretty good too it's like it's just good just as great on thing indica right they're getting a bit of a aftertaste to it and cocktail is not a weed advertised that almost like a mechanical or like new device that when you buy a new vaporizer and sometimes you gotta like burn off the smell it's coming [Music] that's the thing you can't burn you can't wash another 50 bucks Oh I got lay em and one last game all right I swear I bought like reusable weights that are like gee business I think I have forget how much my keep in know who was that anyways for like one of the most discreet pens can't really beat this all right maybe you can get ones that a little smaller that one so that local must exactly like a cigarette but we don't really need to be discreet big neon the whole book like that and just baby sweet though I love that and and it's like it's always lived you know put some ice good night indica starting hitting me the sun's still out I gotta be here so so the device is off I love indica in it I'm getting a weird sticky stickiness on my lips I'm like can there seriously be residue build-up already from like three puffs don't miss Fergus residue the building up I'm getting something that's like sticky the bit of a stickiness coming on the end and the mouthpiece I don't know if that's just for the first couple uses or every time but I'm already getting a sticky residue on my mouth my lip set I didn't get to like one or two puffs we'll see long-term use we'll see what happens I'll still on this lass I should note the date to see how long and anyways maybe I'll get back to you to see how long this lasts whatever but for now that's my review of the indica yeah even just at the end of eight that's the only thing let's just straight up man to go you're not getting like you know flavor or whatever you know like a high strain name this way anyways guys you gotta turn this off now so peace out [Music]", "Az3rNy3LDdk": "what is up world Chris dad's age 4:20 here the YouTube channel for weed lovers and cannabis patients alike today is the 11th I think the May I know I can't see very good but this is just a video of a gelada it's a lot of Kush vape tip by CG extracts so we're gonna do these I'd make these videos for the people of these 19 years or 21 years and older I should say unless they have a ballot card to possess cannabis matically and I just like to say I do these reviews in four categories looks smell taste high in effect but for the look since Melbourne I can't really do the greatest job because it's a vape so I look at it like concealing the the look of the concentrators bomb it's very clear it's the way it's supposed to be at last for a while it's not right runny it is very good so I'm gonna say it's got to be a 10 on look now on smell there's no smell at all to it unless you get right up here and smell the tip and then you can smell the citrus tree of the fruit I remember exactly what their tastes like because my friend had a sunset sherbert so it's right citrusy so I can taste that and it but I can also taste the maintenance of the cookies right so I almost think the two of them combined perfectly for a gelato taste the citrusy ain't over it very like I found the sherbert the sunset sherbert one was very citrusy and the mix with the cookies and overpowers that citrus so it's like you're just getting a little bit of citrus and the rest of the cookies so I really like this it's to honor I'm gonna have to say the smell you can smell the citrus worried away first thing is you can smell it's like almost like smelling a cleaner likes very citrusy right but you can smell the citrus right off the bat that's about all I can smell some give that stiffer smell its gelada it smells like Johanna 100% I'm gonna give the smell of 10 as well so now we're on to taste min Tina's I can taste the citrus very citrusy very loved bit of a mint taste which is the cookies it's weird how the Girl Scout cookies tips that were like minty not overpowering like menthol just a little minty so I really really really like that so I can definitely taste the mint and I can definitely taste the citrus beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful taste very said to see quite a good little view here they do gotta say he's a quite a good little view see the trees in the background I'm outside you hear the nature putting the vegetable garden in right over here I grow some watermelons and some cucumbers and some squash and some I don't know what else corned peppers or whatever we can very minty and citrusy to all the taste is nothing straight but I'm gonna give it for a gelato I'm gonna get it at an Italian taste I can't understand guys why all these are tens but like I've had a few puffs off this before I did this and I don't know here I know the first time I opened it put this tip on I imagine the first couple puffs one puff two puffs but I'm too what a third pop art Bank and so I'm gonna rate dot the high and the effect off that and how high I get right now each pot for two I just can't feel it more hands my eyes are like chain very citrusy that's the last one I'm gonna take you guys to look at me though I am fake G totally so we're getting right this high in effect on this product at 10 as well and we're gonna read it overall fact the fact that ends well so two thumbs up Chris tabs is 420 gelada by C G extracts roof you can see that symbol right there anyways wicked stuff beautiful beautiful product it's got to say all of it all of this distillate whether it's in syringes I got a little bit of bubblegum oh gee at home a little bit of bubblegum oh gee at home and that bubblegum oh gee I'm gonna do a video on it and review it not only is it bubblegum it's bubblegum oh gee that's why I liked it I never knew that bubble gum was bubble gum oh gee it's like Bruce Banner it's really Bruce Banner oh gee comatose is really comatosed oh gee bubblegum oh jeez a good stream tastes really really really a lot like hubba bubba and if I could find some polyethers likely or whatever to mix my distillate syringes into this stuff and you can put it in mix it in a little shot glass and suck it up with the syringe and squirt it in there you can get them on my site for two bucks one of my sites the clean little one CC insulin syringes I just use one of them technically I'd use one of the glass syringes I was using but I want to make sure it was cleaned out good first right I think I'd rather get a brand new syringe even one from the drugstore get a little syringe one for medicine suck it up because you can unscrew these tops right off so I don't go to buy new ones if I was just taking the gram of my bubblegum distillate and making it into a tip but I don't know where to get that stuff there's no dispensaries around here no more maybe I should ask one of my sites if they can get it trying to get him to make Terp sauce good Terp sauce I got good Terp sauce it's good get you baked but it's not the right stuff it looks like melted shatter so I'm not overly you'll see a review of that coming up yeah so yeah this is it nice little peaceful night here's some noises in the background no more at music playing this is just a straight up old school strain review no music just me and the outdoors this how I used to do it when I started I made a lot of my videos with that little table right over there set great here doing hooped I'm prominent a lot of people like I look at him they got v like like what's her name silence tippy I saw it was silent hippie it's silenced sigh lensed et hippie and she has like [ __ ] tons in her own [ __ ] her own temper box her own bongs her own pay everything and the truth that matter is I got way more videos than her I'm gonna get out from this summertime I'm gonna walk a lot with my iPhone walk a lot with my tablet I'm gonna shoot my videos outside I'm gonna probably have to do it with my phone so I can have Internet actually I could just record it on my phone's camera and then upload that to Facebook YouTube when I'm home but uh yeah it's nice to be able to sit here and man that citrusy and minty which makes a wicked it tastes just like to Otto just like the weed identical there right smack on when they make this stuff I've ever had such that sherbert that was that citrusy is this weed it is this this is sunset sherbert tips I just said regular sherbert it was probably oh somehow it got clicked five times and turned off oh so my family's home so I'm gonna end this video for now singing stay medicated stay high but most importantly stay safe ten out of ten cg extracts a lot of peace", "zXvIqpVzO7k": "[Music] thank you for watching ganja runner TV I'm Jake Gloria and today we have Lauren from heavy hitters here with us and she's gonna tell us all about their vapor cartridges yeah so heavy hitters is an awesome cartridge company it's all a distillate so these are distilled eight times total and on the 8th time they actually take the temperature almost to the point of freezing what that does is really just takes out all the plant fats and lipids that don't need to be in the product it just makes it a Lord clean and compact hit for you guys so would that be why is very clear yeah basically the clarity is a lot better it's also a little bit more fluid so you're gonna pull a larger hit a lot faster so how do I use this ah so we did just introduce the button battery just for a heavier hit we actually did invert the button so you're less likely to accidentally use it so how does one get a heavy hit what constitutes a heavy hit so to get the heaviest hit we actually do suggest holding down the button for five to eight seconds just to warm the cart just so when you pull it's immediately pulling the concentrate not warming up the cart the first one is Jack Herer this is our most uppity cart it's gonna keep you the most awake and kind of buzzing so it's actually five times to turn it on and then you would just hold down okay [Music] yeah so these don't automatically turn off say about that amount of time would be good the test actually you really taste like what yeah yeah so that's definitely a string specific one FARC we use all natural flavoring nothing artificial so the strain specific cards are going to be flavored with specific strains from the plant the plant champions and then our flavored ones will actually be using the fruit dripping Wow all right we can do a pineapple express this is on my favorites because it's fruity as well as string specific so I just feel like it's overall you have like it's a good hybrid good for any time of the day and it just strain I'll never get tired of [Music] and almost tastes like a like a little bit piney yeah so I just think it has a little bit of everything in there do you want to try it yeah okay this is one of my favorite self yeah it's kind of like excuse me oh man okay so we're back just a pineapple express and that was pretty heavy there's no 104 it's a button so just hold down in here [Music] Wow let me think very very sweet doesn't hurt my throat very smooth tastes great irritation this is Malibu og so it's super fruity fruit salad [Music] oh yeah let's taste like face like boysenberries it's all going to my head quite different I feel good Phil yeah definitely high but still like I can take on the day alright so now we're moving more towards the fruity into cos pink push I love this one just say like like pink lemonade or what is that fruit maybe game fish so diablo super strain-specific has a little kick to it like almost peppery yes button [Music] I think that would go great with like a

fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive what's up guys back here for another [ __ ] video and today you guys already know you can tell from the title today i'm gonna do another informative informative video um if you guys clicked on this video it's probably because you guys have bought a select card and you guys are wondering is that thing real or is it fake because select had a lot of fake cards going on back in the day but that's back when that's back before they had live resin guys back in those days they only had distillate but now guys man they faking they faking the live resin now guys so today your boy is about to put them on blast because um i recently got a select from flower co and um my friend he recently got a select off the streets and he came up to me with it and it was pretty much the same box but totally different and you could just tell it was fake and i felt so bad for him so he let me borrow the he let me borrow it i got the cards and i'm going to show you guys the difference between the real and the fake you probably could kind of tell already from the box which one's real and which one's fake but um before we get into this guys hopefully you guys can hear me it's kind of windy today actually but um let's take a freaking bong ring boys all right guys so to start off off the back we're going to do a little close-up you feel me so you won't see my face for a little bit we're going to do a little close-up talking right quick so check it out all right off the back this is the real one and this is the fake one and let me tell you guys why this is real and this is fake off the bat you can tell it's fake by the colors all hybrids are in the orange box and it's a dark orange it's not this light orange you see the lettering the lettering it's in light orange um the name of the strain the thc content and the amount in there is a lighter orange as you can see also let me get a little closer this color scheme thing right here the yellow orange red pink purple the color scheme is lighter than the one on the rail box those are off jump ways that i knew as well as you could tell by the print they're using different fonts as you can see it's more bold up here is more popping on the real one more plain it's more pop it gives it more of a pop like it's coming out at you you'll see the difference okay and then another way you could tell guys is the real one off jump a real one's gonna have a bar code there you go barcode fake no barcode no nothing sealed up nicely it almost looks almost looks real another way you can figure out that this is fake guys is when you push it out to open see at the bottom you could see that it just pushes straight out when you push this button in on the side guys that i have my finger on right here that i'm tapping you can just push it down and then push the cart straight out you can see from the bottom the box comes straight out on a fake cart it's just a flat bottom you just pop that off this is a flat bottom this has no use maybe after you pop it off you can slide it but it has pretty much no use as you can see the difference the actual box pops out from the bottom when you rip this tape off another way i could tell guys is also from the bottom it's a hybrid and it says indica on the bottom it could obviously be an indica hybrid but it just says hybrid on there and if it doesn't end like a hybrid it will say indica hybrid like this one says sativa hybrid it's a dominant sativa because most you know strains you get these days they're hybrids so um usually they're either sativa dominant or indica dominant this one's a sativa dominant as you can see but this one it just says indica on the bottom and just lemon hash diesel so that kind of threw me off that new that that's what made me know that it was fake basically a lot of things did but also you could tell by the font the font is different as you can see it's a light orange color just the real one's dark orange feel me and the font is way different guys this is a fake just look at the font you know give it a couple seconds make sure it's hd now look at this font you could see that it's much different font but it's very similar they did a good job on it but some of the font stuff is different like the warning sign should be yellow there's no yellow and you can see that the font is different boom boom all right guys those are the ways you can see just by looking at the box this is the real one the tropicana and this is the fake one it's too light like you can tell it's fake guys come on now um another way you could tell is um by the actual oil you see the lemon hash diesel it's a little too light you feel me you can see how light it is i'll take it out the package later but your oil is going to want to be dark like this like the tropicana cookies you see that dark consistency you don't want that you don't or no you want that sorry guys you want that dark consistent you don't want the light consistency you see that it's too light you want that dark because live resin is usually darker but yeah let's pop this open but yeah guys you know there's a lot of you know fake carts out there that are easy for you to you know realize that they're fake because they're mario karts they they got fruity pebbles on it they're named after some kind of cereal brand you know different brands that are trying to entice younger people to buy it basically but you know select it's a little harder to um just drop the box it's a little harder to tell because you know they try to make it look as legit as possible and select is actually a real brand mario karts and those luigi's and all those other carts that are out there the skittles and stuff like that those aren't real brands nintendo is not gonna let you put theirs name on a car guys let's be real so we're gonna open up these boxes real quick there we go so it pops right out guys the real ones you can actually use the button and it pops right out there's no cardboard on top it's just like a plastic thing you have to cut off and then boom you got a cart the fake one as you can see you have to actually peel back a box you feel me you have to peel that back and actually open up the box [Music] then you can slide it out after you already open the box [Applause] the real one it's already out you can already push it out the fake one you have to rip open the actual box bam so like i said guys look at the oil the real one is going to be much darker than the fake one as you can see the fake ones are super light it looks like fake wax usually fake wax looks like this looks like this or clear this is real it's a live resin this looks like a distillate this looks like this joy with this live resin baby so make sure you know what you're getting guys the last test honestly the last test to know if your cart is real or fake is to taste it but i know for a fact that this one's fake as hell so i'm not gonna be hitting it let's inspect the cart see the fake one the fake one sorry guys i'm not even done yet the fake one as you can see has no stickers or nothing a real one is going to have a ca sticker on it my guys as you can see let's see what kind of cartridges they use the c cells look a little different too hopefully i can zoom it in good enough the c cells look different [Music] way different but they're both cell i guess but the writing on this c cell looks more bolder as you can see the writing on the real season looks way smaller but either way we know we know that yellow stuff is fake in that dark stuff this is the real this is the real deal guys fake real you can just look at it and see the difference ca dark color no ca light color looks like a disc joy all right so thank you guys for watching the video though guys more content to come i had to get you guys another fake card review and i felt like select one of the biggest like companies out there other than raw gardeners dizzy so i had to do one of them and my friend came through with a fake one so i had to make sure he ain't smoking that fake [ __ ] but um guys i found my battery with my cart on it so let's hit this card quick little blinker hit for you guys and then let's put this real one on just a real live resin i was gonna do a review on this maybe i'll still do a review guys if you guys want to see a review on this cart comment down below but right now i'm just gonna hit it smoke it i'm not gonna talk much about it and i'm gonna end the vlog [Music] i would hit this but it's it's so blatantly fake so thank you guys for watching this video don't forget to like comment subscribe more videos to come thank you for always being here shout out to everyone who

and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well hello everybody welcome to a brand new podcast today again we got another cartridge of you but today we're gonna be doing something a little bit more different I've only tried this brand at least like once and it is the king pan brand honestly the reason why I really I wanted to make this I had to make this video like I have to make this video I have to show you guys exactly what I really think about these and the only issue that I have with these but other than that I think King pen is hella fire it's I guess it's one of the world's most awarded cannabis fate I mean I guess I could believe that because this [ __ ] is it's pretty far is it better than raw garden heavy hitters you know what it's on its own it's on its own level so today I got some Cali oh it's eighty-three percent THC checked it out and I got a Minuteman I mean the design of this is pretty sick you know I think it's pretty dope it's powered by loud pack if you got you guys to see that right there and it says right here a 1 3 second draw as I see while serving so like always everybody you know a 3 second drag that's gonna be equivalent to one hit and let's seize cartridges king pan cartridges are available in indica sativa and hybrid proud to be the most avoided cannabis bait in the world okay in the world but hey man you guys better be cool watch out cuz you know seven 10 laughs who knows how their cartridges are gonna be raw garden to a man everybody's trying to come on big fan of raw garden because everybody that I know that smokes cartridges and I'm talking about like you've wired from like different cities and stuff they're all going for those rock garden songs oh man you better watch out cuz you might not be the most awarded soon so bono so I've actually tried a couple of these before I do have another flavor King Louie Oh got some King Louie og but I wanted to save that for another video but shout out the packaging but let me just show you guys one thing because these are just again everybody I do not condone the usage of these products I do not promote the sales of these products and I don't sell anything on this channel or I don't push anything it's just an educational review it's for cannabis patients 18 and up you know people that are just wanting to look for a review so let's go right here oh so got myself a little half not too bad not too bad I do want to take this sticker off Rennie let me say [ __ ] it maybe take it off there's a little sticker right here sometimes the sticker kind of kills the color it doesn't get you like that full color if that makes sense you know kick off that sticker there you go slowly nice and slowly BAM oh okay look at this this looks kind of fired I do like the logo right there you guys see right there okay you guys see the logo and it's just some clear wax - and this is clear - like the liquid inside is so clear look at that look at that let's do a little test there you go it's not moving at all we got some sativa on our end so you know I'm trying to wake up but like just one thing I can't everybody I've talked about this in different videos don't get me wrong man these King pens are fired I like them to me they're kind of like equivalent to like a heavy hitter so cheers everybody let's try it out whoo that flare mmm that [ __ ] is so fiery literally just tastes like gum kind of like an orange that's like an orange e flavor and you can just tell us a tivo right off the bat honestly sometimes a lot of people could smoke a sativa and they feel like they took like a shot of coffee you're like a little cup of coffee which is kind of crazy to me it's the other way around I feel like sometimes I could be slumped but smoking sativa it kind of does kind of wake me up like mentally it's like a it's like a mental wake-up type thing you know the physical wake up I feel like I'm a little [ __ ] little tired just cuz I smoked it you know but here like hey I'm show you guys king pan BAM eighty three point zero three percent THC so oh well like how these hey the design is pretty cool you know it's kind of heavy notes made I'd like a little likes a little type of metal but one thing I really do like about the kingpin is that some other flavors are just like lose it they got they got a good taste you guys like I I completely like I approve of the taste the taste is pretty nice hmm oh yeah let me tell you guys one thing though and I know I feel like a lot of people are gonna be able to relate to this but let me know in the comments down below but check this out so if you guys see the very end of this so yeah I see the bottom of it right there like this bottom right here I feel like some some of the liquid stays right here you know it's it gets stuck right here and I feel like you don't 100% complete like you don't want a hundred percent like all over the juice doesn't go inside the you know like the little coils inside if that makes sense you know there's always like a little bit left over that's just stuck in there and that happened to me like two times already I bought two cuz back then I used to like the king I used I select heavy hitters brass knuckles and King pens those were like my two daughters before I even knew about like raw garden and all these other cartridges it was always it was mainly brass knuckles I don't really like the brass knuckles and the heavy hitters see here and there I came across a king pin but actually I think yeah cuz my first cartridge ever was a a brass knuckle it was some sv og I remember that I was the SF vog and it was the full gram and I remember when I first bought it I first bought my first pan I was so excited I was like bruh I'm gonna get so late sigh my room while watch a movie watch a show I'm like ooh it's gonna be sick and that's exactly what I did you know I freaking got my home chart I mean I spent without any somewhat charge but I thought it was in charge so I kind of charged it up you know put it in and I was just like oh dude I'll if I can get it can I can remember to lose and it was in the next room it was the next the next door room I switched rooms in my apartment but back there I was inside yeah this is a tea but I feel like I'm kind of like can look creative you know get a little bit like let's [ __ ] get this bag baby let's look in yes but I remember that's - I freaked I think I watched the epic movie you guys remember that movie those like dumb parody movies the epic loot it was like scary movie epic movie disaster movie [ __ ] love these those lows those stupid parody movies I think they're so funny they're so interesting cuz I'm late half the time but in reality they're they're [ __ ] shitty movies but I always thought they're hella interesting the one that I really like oh my god you guys should go check that one it's called Stan Helsing it's a parody of Van Helsing but that [ __ ] is just ash it's just so funny honestly damn I feel like one thing about the King pens is I feel like the airflow is really nice like there's a way too much now way too much air flow but the air flow is just like on [ __ ] point what's my name before I do remember it was like I forgot what 2014 what was one out like I was first introduced to a couple pens no yet no 2013 Oh 13 or 14 yeah I think it was 13 or 14 one of those years but it wasn't like a it wasn't like a cartridge like a wax cartridge you know like like like distally you know it wasn't stuff like that it wasn't like live resin - it was more like a little globe it was like these little globes and inside was like a little like a tab it was pretty much like you're taking a DAB and there was like a little piece like a little coil in the middle there's like a globe and inside it was like a little coil and it was like heat up so you don't have to put your dab on that stuff you'd have to put your down on that and then you would hold it and I should the coil would heat up and then that's when you take it out that's what I remember the first pens that's that's that's what I'm I'm you know like what the hell is okay to smoke out of a pin likewise and after that that happened and I made like a year or two after that that's when all these like distillate that's when all you got all these like wax cartridges all these like random cartridges coming out and they were fired you know I I came across like for sure a lot of real ones but I'm not gonna lie I didn't come across maybe here and there - three of them that were for sure fake and that's cuz again I've talked about this I say this in every single cartridge video if you guys if you guys are buying those fake-ass $20 cards to stop buying that [ __ ] man don't just just cuz you're you okay right now you're in your head you're part like all 20 bucks bro [ __ ] that I'm not gonna go buy a $35 half gram or a 55 or $60 a full gram at the club and I could be buying a full almost a full gram on 20 bucks just like you guys man you guys are smoking those deadly pesticides you guys are smoking that fake [ __ ] I don't care if you're like local drug dealer or whatever selling guys now man this is some fire that's just the real [ __ ] nah man [ __ ] that if he's selling that [ __ ] I got 20 bucks unless you personally know the person and you know that he's making it and you know exactly what's going on that [ __ ] don't trust that [ __ ] bro cuz if you're paying 20 bucks even 20 bucks for a half gram bro I don't think so no but hey sometimes you guys could get I mean I mean I'm not gonna lie something you guys could probably get like a nice little there's probably people out there that get some nice little plugs or you guys you get some real [ __ ] for really low shout-out to you but majority of the people out there hell nah man you guys copy nothing [ __ ] just save your money and just go buy yourself a [ __ ] full gram of like a heavy hitter you know raw garden you know like cuz I know a lot of people that just mind some fake [ __ ] say it and say this real [ __ ] but I don't [ __ ] I don't think so I don't know I would I wouldn't risk it because at the end of the day she guys's body you're not gonna feel the damages that don't see your body right now but you're gonna feel it like maybe 20 30 years down the road when you're like and then you're 50 60 s you're gonna be like tan mask [ __ ] I smoked all that fake [ __ ] this [ __ ] sprocket effect is 2-1 like 50 60 who knows hopefully now but [ __ ] that's what we're doing that that's why I'm doing this review you guys so [ __ ] makes you guys drop alike man drop a comment what you guys have favorite flavor if you guys have tried kingpin and if you guys are new hit that subscribe button click that bell so you guys can notified every time we upload but sure y'all want to take a hit like what's up I bought a when I first found out that there was fake cartridges out on the street that's why I kind of like completely I'm like [ __ ] that dude I'm not I'm stopping I'm not gonna buy off the street I did a couple times here in they're not gonna lie but this was like maybe like three years ago yeah this happened like maybe three almost four years ago I bought a [ __ ] cartridge it was a brass knuckles cartridge and I bought it for 30 bucks at 30 for a $30 full gram and I'm like okay this guy that I knew at the time on this guy probably bottom and bulk got him super [ __ ] cheap he's just adding another extra five you know another 5 10 bucks to the price to each cartridge so that's that's cool you know he's making a profit I smoked like maybe like one third of it in like the bottom of this she started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] was it getting black I started getting black I'm like what the [ __ ] dude this [ __ ] is not normal she's starting it I like what the hell's inside this cartridge so I showed one of my other friends but if you like it's obvious I doing this is fake bro you're smoking like fake wax fake this to it you know you're smoking fake distill fake to steal like he's like nah bro just don't [ __ ] away so what I did I was like [ __ ] the [ __ ] grabbed it screwed it off I just did that [ __ ] away and from there I was like dude I can be something you can't be something that fakes you do I did know some [ __ ] one girl though I'm not gonna lie like she [ __ ] oh my god I'm just disgusting but I mean she wasn't disgusting what I'm saying like just she just had no idea one time like [ __ ] I met some girl that had a cartridge that was so [ __ ] dark so cheap you can tell the plastic was so cheap like I asked her I was like what you are this [ __ ] I bought it for my friend house like let the [ __ ] how much like it's like 20 bucks and I was like bro what though it was so dark she was smoking like black tar [ __ ] wax or some [ __ ] ha and I was like dude throw this [ __ ] away and she's like nah and I was like okay cool you know I wanna I want to like taste I'm not gonna inhale this [ __ ] so I took it here oh hell no my mouth too blew it out as [ __ ] tastes like plastic oh she pointed and she part finished it knowing her knowing that chicks you pod killed that [ __ ] she got laid off her ass how [ __ ] all these deadly pesticides all these like chemicals and [ __ ] I have no idea but I don't know I just don't think it's worth it honestly I think it's just it's best just to go to the your local club you know like just go to the local dispensary these brands I know it might not be like 100 percent safe but they're free share you're way better than the [ __ ] that people caught cop off the streets and I talked about this in almost every single cartridge video because it's just so important to not be smoking these book these nasty like chemicals because it's not it might not affect you right now but it's gonna affect you down the road so [ __ ] a lot of people say they leave comments down below saying that I need to take I need to hold in my heads for holidays but your lungs instantly absorb all the THC one day when the smoke goes in your lungs it like instantly [ __ ] absorbs all the THC you know so it's not like you have to keep it in there for it till I grab the most tasty you know but oh that's why usually I hit it I hate it make sure it goes all in the lungs and I just blow it out right away so I'm like yeah I got all the teasing I needed I don't need to keep that smoking my lungs I'm already I should that's about to be wow I'm lit can't even talk anyways everybody at your price cut it off right now makes you guys drop a like a comment subscribe if you guys are brand new and

machine is designed to fill small disposable vape cartridges such as this quickly accurately consistently for long periods of time if you're currently filling these vape partridges by hand and looking for a better way I invite you to keep watching as I break down this durable and affordable piece of machinery first let's start off with a discussion of exactly what this machine will not come with that you're going to need to make it work number one is an air compressor you're going to need to buy an air compressor separately and make sure that it is at max 125 psi with at least a 10 gallon reservoir tank a good rule of thumb is the longer that you intend on running your machine the larger a reservoir tank you're going to need so that your air compressor doesn't work so hard to keep up with your machine now the second thing that you're going to need that we don't provide which likely you're going to need for both the machine and the air compressor is electricity so pay your electric bill and you'll have a happy machine and a working machine which means a happy business the first piece of equipment there we're going to focus on here that you will receive with your order is this pressure pot now this pressure pot is very important because this is where your material your liquid or oil will go in order to become pressurized and ultimately feed into the machine now this pressure pot is comprised of three individual pieces that all fit together number one you have this hood and through this hood it goes the feeding tube as well as this air pressure regulator valve the air pressure line which is feeding from your air compressor is going to feed pressure into this valve become regulated to a hundred psi fill up this machine and inside of this there's actually two other pieces number one you'll see an inner container here this inner container ultimately can hold your source material or hold a bottle that has your source material in it if you don't want to cover the inner container with your my source material and have increased loss then it's fine to just keep it in the bottle that you have it in the second part is of course this lower holding container once you have put the inner container with your material inside you have placed your cover on top you're going to then make the whole unit airtight by placing these four very heavy-duty wing nuts into place tightening them down in order to secure your top to the pressure pot and then you'll release the valve on your air compressor and begin to pressurize the tank in preparation for running your machine the next important piece of equipment that we're going to focus on is the pressure gun this will actually take a supply line coming from your pressure pot feed directly into the pressure gun which controls the flow of your liquid or oil into each cartridge as it moves along by the machine assisting the pressure gun in doing its job is this third piece of equipment here which is the temperature control unit which controls by degree the temperature of the entire head unit helping and assisting you to process thicker viscosity oils and liquids without encountering any sort of clogs in the needle or head unit as its processing through the machine now the fourth piece of equipment that we're going to focus on here is probably the most impressive as well and that is the filling robot itself it has two control panels that a user should become very familiar with one of them is this handheld controller right here it allows you to program all parameters for this machine as well as containing all pre-mapped programs that will become preset from the factory to work with the cartridges that you want to process through this machine now once all the parameters have been set in this handheld control unit there is a very simple front terminal interface that a new user can step up and start using immediately with a minimal learning curve it only consists of five buttons one is the on/off button number two is the start pause button number three is this stop reset button for use in an emergency number four is this program reset button for whenever the machine becomes out of calibration for any reason and number five is this line purge button this button is used to hold the air pressure gun in place and purge the line of any air bubbles or clogs before you start the machine the final piece of equipment we're going to focus on is arguably the most important and that is this custom cartridge holder we call it a jig it's designed to hold 100 cartridges in rows of 10 by 10 now you may be wondering how do I get one made for the cartridges I use and how do I fill it well these come pre map from the factory to fit transferring cartridges and one of the advantages of ordering transferring cartridges is that they will come in these wonderful foam inserts these foam inserts are designed to match the machining of your jig exactly so that you can simply lay them on top press them down into place vastly reducing your loading times and saving you time and money throughout the life of your machine now as I stated before the front panel has a dead simple user interface so that a new user can immediately step to this machine and get it working to begin the action here I'm simply going to press this lighted start button in order to start our filling now as we zoom in for a closer look at this machine as it begins its filling program you're going to notice how quickly it fills each cartridge it's currently programmed to fill each 1 ml cartridge in under one second meaning this entire 100 cart jig can be filled in under two minutes now as we move in for an even closer look the second thing you'll notice is the incredible accuracy of this machine no cartridge is under-filled no cartridges overfilled and there are no drips between cartridges this helps eliminate human error reduce waste and ultimately increase your profits and yield over the lifetime of this machine now I spoke before about the dead simple operation of this machine let's say you're a new user and you'd like to pause the action well all you need to do is come over here and press the start pause button pausing the machine allowing you to restart the action from where it left off at your leisure by simply repressing the start pause button much like the start or the play pause button on your DVR or DVD player now let's say that you would like to stop the filling completely and reset the machine back to its original starting position all you need to do is press this start button and with a simple twist the machine resets back to its original position releasing the jig and allowing you to address any issues so now that we've seen this machine in action I'm sure that you have a lot of questions including how to order one well I can answer all those questions and more if you contact me directly by emailing me at USA at transferring comm or by giving me a call at 925 four zero five five five eight to offer the only us-based sales and service for this filling machine and I have warranty service that is back directly by the factory so I can answer all your questions about ordering customization installation and ongoing maintenance for this machine also in the meantime be sure to subscribe to our channel as we post more videos about how to clean this machine calibrate it and customize it for your particular operation I want to thank you for watching and stay posted for more informative videos about the transferring vape cartridge autofilter

on wheats a good old-fashioned 510 cartridge i've got my trusty battery here nice and plain and then the product we're actually reviewing which is napalm we are reviewing uh our first cartridge anything from the folks at napalm uh and this happens to be their napalm o g um strain so both the company is napalm and the strain is napalm og that we are taking a look at uh so i picked this up at a dispensary in long beach it is 43 dollars for a gram uh which is um about average maybe a little bit cheaper than average uh at this dispensary that i um pick up from um so uh you know keep that in mind with the review 43 bucks uh for a lot of people i know is very cheap for a one gram cartridge but not so much here in long beach um as i said standard 510 so this is no special pod nothing different or weird your normal twisty battery is going to work here uh so i don't know a lot about napalm i know this dispensaries had them for a while i couldn't really find a whole lot of online presence for them outside of listings didn't see a lot but let's go ahead and get this open um and on the back before we really get started here let's go ahead and take a look at the lab testing results if it'll focus up there um there we go uh looks like it's coming in at about 75 thc or so uh which is about average for a cartridge maybe on the slightly lower end but um which is you know maybe commiserate with the price so uh now we know our laptop results we got about our 75 thc let's figure out how we open this somewhat elaborate looking packaging here there are a lot of flaps on it that's glued pretty tight oh we've got a little um authentic holographic sticker here i'm not really sure what they think that putting a sticker that just says authentic on it is going to try to solve but you know i assume anybody can buy that sticker but maybe some psychological assurance uh let's rip that effing sticker off there we go pull it out voila here we are here is our one gram napalm cartridge ooh that is a very different design uh this is not uh this is totally unique never seen anything quite like this i'm not even sure what material this is maybe aluminum some kind of metal here on the tip the oil actually looks pretty good there gold rich um yeah it looks way better than i thought and i'm curious about this cartridge design it's just got the one big intake hole there better than that pretty standard looking heating element all that stuff so let's go ahead and plug it into our 510 thread here and give our napalm og from napalm a try here we go oh wow okay um that is a very different tasting uh strain than i am used to uh it is very extremely piney piney a little slightly bitter earthy um not bad just um a lot more uh aromatic than i guess i was expecting it's quite tasteful uh there's there's a lot going on there um and even pretty robust like bittery aftertaste i'm not usually a huge fan of bitter uh it's not terrible here it's that very earthy kind of bitter taste not sure i love the cartridge design kind of hard to get your like mouth around it it's very short little mouthpiece here uh you know most cartridges have a much longer sorry for the juvenile humor or uh images uh you know much larger place to put your lips and all that uh this is very small it's it's can make it tough to draw from it is unique wow yeah that is just extremely um terpeney there is just a lot of piney earthy bittery taste to it uh i usually like a lot of flavor this one uh i'm not gonna necessarily say it's bad i don't i actually don't think that it is it's just not the kind of strains that i normally go for um and this one is just heavy on the terpenes wow um the cartridge design again a little weird uh the draws are fine i'm getting draws okay but it's hard to sort of get a good seal but in terms of potency no problem saying this is 75 i've taken quite a few draws here feeling the effects quite strong um in terms of the that being the most important aspect is it really going to get you high uh that seems to definitely be true i think this is pretty good oil it's just um you're gonna if you're gonna go for this napalm og you better like the piney earthy tastes of the strains um because this one has it in spades yeah i'm just uh uh so far i would say i have mixed feelings about my napalm og experience let's get another one in here nice hit smooth um you saw i drew for a while excelled for a while and i'm not hacking a lung up which is a good sign um but again that taste is very strong wow uh so uh right now i'm kind of um up in the air about our napalm og experience uh i would say if you really like the napalm as a strain maybe give this a consideration me i'm gonna uh finish off this gram i'm uh looking forward to it actually it's it's a bit of a different strain for me but a bit of a different experience can lead to some fun new uh experiences let's hope maybe who knows um it is different napalm og um let's give it a little bit of a wait and see i'm gonna finish off this gram and then like all our wheat's reviews i'll come back to you guys in the i don't know five days or so it'll take to get through this and i'll let you know exactly what i think of this whole experience i am a little worried about this cartridge design it seems like it might get clogged really easily with this very shallow hole um and there's not like a lot of plastic or anything sort of protecting stuff going in so uh i could imagine this novel cart design having some issues but we shall see it'll take me a couple days to get through it i'll be right back here to let you guys know exactly what i think when we finish this napalm og in just a few days until then stay high stay healthy see you right back here bye guys [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about four days a little over four days since we started our journey with napalm and their strain napalm og uh just a little bit left there so i could have one or two more hits to share with you guys like this one here and well i gotta tell you my thoughts experiences really haven't changed much in four days um i didn't hate it there's nothing fundamentally wrong with it it's just not my favorite cartridge not what i'm gonna go back to um primarily what i found distasteful was the taste um that sort of acrid vaguely burnty piney earthy taste of the napalm uh it just wore on me i never sort of grew accustomed to it as a matter of fact the more i did it the more i kind of didn't want to do it um kind of even had to make myself get to this point to finish this one off i would have moved on to something else um it's not that the oil is bad it feels like the 75 percent as listed it's just not the highest quality the cart design is also so top-heavy i mean most cards are top-heavy by design but this one with this like heavy aluminum tip it's just so hard to keep it balanced um and also if you keep it in your pocket it's guaranteed it's going to turn upside down on itself and it's got that shallow intake hole which got clogged on me more than once had to clean it out it's just not the best experience it's certainly not the worst experience uh you know it's somewhere in that middle of the road and at 43 dollars it's cheap but it isn't the cheapest um and i have had even cheaper cartridges that i have had that i've enjoyed more so i can't give this one a big thumbs up i'm not even sure i can give this one a tepid recommendation uh i do think that there is better stuff out there for you um i may in the future try to review one of napalm's other strains they're not napalm og itself and see if maybe i have better luck uh but that's only if you guys are really curious otherwise there's plenty out there to review we'll take a look at those and we'll take a look at those on our next review whenever that is sometime in our near future i hope you guys will join us for that one until then stay high stay healthy and we'll see you then docs",

sales of marijuana oil cartridges used for vaping they've soared 400 percent between 2015-2016 so in one year quadrupled vaping has made marijuana use more discreet it's more convenient and it's free from the STONER stigma attached to smoking weed but and this is why we're talking about the jury's still out when it comes to the safety of vaping marijuana some studies suggest doing so may be toxic dr. sue Sisley the president of Scottsdale research institute they do conduct clinical trials on marijuana she joins us now on these findings and I'm glad we're talking about this because I will openly may I don't know about the three of you but the whole concept of vaping with cigarettes we understand but I am oblivious to the health consequences benefit whatever it may be when it comes to this so people think it's healthier but maybe not so fast you're right we don't have any data about the safety of using or vaping these marijuana oils and those cartridges up there are great exact Emma Colette when exposed to heat these chemicals can turn into formaldehyde so you talk about propylene glycol yes so you're more concerned about the additives then the marijuana oil itself exactly right yeah these chemical additives have never really been tested for safety the FDA has confirmed that they're safe for consumption but just because it's safe to eat doesn't mean that it's safe to heat up and inhale it's a different story and the fact is if there's all these flavoring chemicals in there as well you know these they try to add flavors to the cartridges to make them more palatable but what happens is that those flavoring chemicals have also never been tested and for heating this is part of the concern as well is that they look more glamorous so again it really reduces that stigma it makes it seem like it's a really fun kind of upscale thing to do right safe um and it popularizes it which i think is part of the problem right until we get more data I mean what's the take-home here for for people that are that are vaping on a regular basis the good thing is you have all kinds of other options now in these regulated markets we have the opportunity to vape natural flower so if you can find you know the the actual plant material that's not been grown with pesticides which is a common now because we have the the newly legalized states I'll have you know required lab testing so they don't allow products to the shelf with with pesticides or other chemicals but the problem we have is these older states you know the states like California Arizona Michigan that legalized marijuana years ago they did not require lab testing that's why it's so important that you're notifying your viewers about this issue because they can still find these vape cartridges so I just so I understand this if you're in say Colorado and you are a recreational marijuana user where you can go into a store in virtually any city and purchase it vaping there is in your opinion probably safer because they've actually tested the chemical additives that's right yeah and that's what we're trying to do with all these legal medical cannabis states is force them to lab test all of their products so that we can make sure to protect patient safety because you know the issue is that they could be picking up a product that does have these chemicals and and so I'm grateful that you're alerting your your viewers to this because they can avoid this they can pick up a vape cartridge that contains nothing but the what nature put in the plant now that would be the ideal situation pick up current and eventually these cartridges will not be bought by people when consumers get smart about this they'll bypass those products and eventually they'll go away I want to ask you this off the cuff because marijuana legalization is so new people who are naive to it maybe they go to one of these states where it's legal and like you know what I want to try it and they have the option between smoking marijuana the old-fashioned way they have edibles of a whole host of different types of edibles they now have vaping as an option in your opinion what would be the safest method well you touch on you know two big public health problems right are the overuse of edibles and the excessive vaping of these oils I mean the truth is these oils are hyper potent some of them contain 70 to 90 percent THC so people can easily get intoxicated on them so the key is always start low and go slow yeah - and that is buyer beware", "880TLs3fjmg": "okay so I'm gonna show you how do you save my oil transfer this is just a small kit that can help you transfer your oil from one to another and it's kind of small so you could keep this anywhere you want this is what it looks like when you open it up what you want to do is on most of them you can unscrew these tops if not you have to figure out another way to actually get it off and now I just want to place this one down here sometime these are gonna be a little bit tight when you first get it because once used to last for a long time you'd see there and they'll stay in there so that's the one that I want to actually put in another one what I'm gonna do is take this cylinder filler and you could use a toothpick if you have one put that in there and now what I'm going to do is pull this out a little bit put this on so it keeps it straight connected and then put this right on here now we have it connected and what I'm gonna do is flip this over sometimes I like to put it on a little bit of an edge so that way it will stick to that glass and that is how that is set up right [Music]", "iX7Zcy6J0-Y": "if you guys clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose we do not condone the usage of these products and we do not sell anything on this channel as well welcome back everybody to a brand new video today we got another educational review yet again everybody we do not condone these products this is an 18 and of Education review from the cannabis patients out there but today everybody we got another King pen I decided to pick two up just because I know I noticed that I've reviewed King pen before this is a King Louie og by the way some indica I've noticed that I've I've only copper King pen like once now I just had to review a second one and now this is my third one that I'm reviewing on this channel I think this is the third one that I'm gonna be on the channel but this is some King Louie we got it right here shout out Disney's for sponsoring this video this is actually a glow-in-the-dark shirt but it fits perfect for the King Lily so shares everybody oh wow this one makes a lot more fatter clouds in the cartridge video I did before so you guys have watched the Kali the Kali oh oh I wasn't actually make able to make big clouds and I'm like okay maybe it's just the airflow of the cartridge but this one is the exact same size and last time I actually didn't have it on the lowest temp so let's go back to the lowest ten I like taking them low temps just so for the flavor the last one we did was Callie oh and again let me let me take another hit Lucy oh yeah something's wrong with the other cartridge that I did haven't talked about at all like damn is this what happened that color went out of the airflow this one I'm already late with this one with the King Louie just literally like to dress oh that flavors nice mmm has like a cereal taste to it like if you guys ever tried um what is it rice krispies or crispy rice crisps you know there's Cocoa Krispies and the other rice krispies the colorful ones pebble pebbles I think pebble crisp dude I honestly don't even know like a fruity yes I got like a sweet fruit type of type of flavor which is pretty nice and I'm not gonna lie damn King Penn what's up with that man I mean we got the callee oh that [ __ ] did not hit well you know what's funny to some of them actually don't hit well like I've noticed that this that wasn't the first time so if you guys watched my previous video on the kingpin Caleo review um I wasn't able to take like big ribs like this one like I wasn't able to make some time like you know nice clouds oh this one you can make some nice clouds and it tastes nice just the one thing is indica so this just about having me slept but damn that's funny cuz I remember I had a I had a friend that actually bought a half game card to we're hearing it and we're both like what the hell it doesn't really have like good like it has air flow but you can't really make clouds and you don't feel like you take a nice hit out of it so I'm just like maybe just something with the cartridges that maybe they're just a little they're just a little delicate you know kind of made this flavor does taste really good though the King Louie I had this before the King Louie og hell yeah [ __ ] like it kind of has like an OG taste to it I mean its own g-get also supposed to taste I go dude but you can kind of you could taste say you know like I said before I've talked about this before King Penn was one of those brands and I first started when I started buying cartridges and [ __ ] days ago so it's always nice to go back to the roots you know and that's what I was talking about in the last year too like I was just saying that come pretty much like it's always nice going back to the roots you know I wanted I actually the review of brass knuckle cartridge just because brass knuckles was one of the first cartridges that I've ever you know smoked before so that's for sure has to be here on the channel but I don't see those allow anymore like right now it's all it's literally select and raw garden selecting wrong our name but rock garden is my all-time favorite everybody and the select is pretty nice too that she gets me baked um but check this out you guys so it's kingpin it's the world's most awarded cannabis vape is this still up to date is this still the most important in 2019 let me know in the comments down below the alien labs is also my favorite when it comes to like some sauce diamonds ooh ooh shout-out look the lights are matching the shirts kind of matching huh let me know in the comments down below if you guys have ever tried kingpin and if you guys have any issues with kingpin cuz I've had one one issue with kingpin before don't get me wrong the taste is great you know the flavors are great to have a bunch of flavors you know I got I mean every time I hit this [ __ ] I get pretty late you guys said clearly see you have to like my second or third drag I got [ __ ] lit but again last time my previous purchase was a Cali oh and that one had too much air flow like it had good airflow but it wasn't really burning like this one is burning you know so I didn't get me like it got me lit but it gave me super lit you know it tasted it did taste good though but we're gonna find out I'm gonna have to remake another video and um see exactly if it doesn't because if you guys can see it right here look let's see right here I didn't show you guys a cartridge yeah there you got the cartridge this one for some reason this one doesn't focus that much like either tell it clear or who knows but you guys see towards the bottom of it it's like okay towards the top it's a little bit more yellow than the bottom because in the bottom it's like really tight down there you know so not a lot of like I'm not a lot of the liquid is going down there so you guys he usually right here in these areas right here it gets stuck I feel like some of the liquid gets stuck so when you finish the cartridge it's like literally like you feel like there's like a layer that just won't be smoked no matter how many times you hit it it just won't burn because last time when I got one of these this was a while ago this is maybe like a year ago when I got it I got myself a king actually no it was the first king no that was probably maybe like maybe like three months ago three four months ago we had a king pen cartridges are the same half gram in it we got it all the way to the bottom right and they were just like a thick nice little layer and I'm like okay cool it still has a lot started hitting it and I was like dude it takes burnt and I looked at it and I was like dude that layer is just stuck right there it's not going in and it's not going in the coils you know so I was like what the hell I was like I hope it's just maybe like a the thinnest little leftover layer like [ __ ] I don't mind but it looked pretty big it looked like almost like 1/3 so I'm like dude in any other cartridge that's gonna fall all the way to the bottom and it's gonna get soaked up into the coils and it's gonna give you a hit you know is that I know a lot of people you guys I'm pretty sure you guys know how this works right there's like little coils that heat up inside this so this kind of every time you take a hit it burns the it burns the liquid that's in there already and then it leave it kind of you can see like it dries off the cotton or dries off the coil and then this liquid goes in there it gets soaked up and it's like you know it's the circle of life until it's gone but if you guys hello if you guys are enjoying these cartridge videos make sure you guys go down in description go follow

more of like the the details of the cartridge you know the information the stuff that's in the cartridge you know I try to do my research on that but I looked at the details and you know unlike the stuff that's in there and I'm just like okay this is kind of clean this is pretty uh this is pretty safe to smoke and it's fire you know it's probably a good review you know is that's why you know

and taste it tasted good but those I was pretty cool it's just that one thing the airflow this one had great this one had great airflow like I could make clouds the other one the callee oh that [ __ ] did not have good like it had good airflow and it felt the same but it just was not making clouds so I don't know what's wrong with that I was gonna get a full gram but they didn't have full grams so

getting put in those vials good evening and thank you for joining us I'm John overall dime Angelique Lizardi some may think vaping is harmless but the Centers for Disease Control might have data to prove otherwise here in Pima County the counter-narcotics Alliance says violence can also be associated with sale of certain cartridges or carts used for vaping our digging deeper team uncovered information about some recent cases here in Tucson news 4 - sauce Lupita Mario shows us how bad the problem has become this is a vaping cart it contains THC found in marijuana it's also sold at dispensaries and sold on the black market for half the price that's where the trouble begins in January three masked individuals went to a Tucson home where fake carts were being manufactured counter-narcotics Alliance officers say the suspects beat and robbed the homeowner of cash marijuana and the illegal carts he was manufacturing we've been to several home invasions this year where individuals have been shot because of cartridges sergeant Alfredo Meza is with the Tucson Police Department assigned to CNA his unit investigates violent crimes associated with narcotics a lot of the

what's getting put in those vials vial such as these all of them fake sergeant Meza told the digging deeper team these were seized during a home invasion the homeowner was shot and a CNA officer found evidence he was making the THC vape cartridges inside his apartment there's not a lot of consistency in the manufacturer of this stuff anywhere there's no FDA regulation that goes through to make sure that they're not putting in cases in California they found cyanide in vape cartridges Captain John Leavitt is also with the Tucson Police Department and heads CNA and it's extremely dangerous it's toxic to your system and it can not only make people sick but it kills people according to the latest numbers from the CDC 2290 cases were reported from 49 states 47 deaths have been confirmed in 25 states and the District of Columbia the median age of the people dying is 53 it's an extreme health hazard and if you look at the guidance from the CDC they they vary circumspectly suggest that you don't vape most of the carts come from the black market these are pictures of the fake ones authorities say the active ingredient in the carts is THC that gives the people the high but people are now adding other ingredients to the carts such as mineral oil and vitamin E a toxic combination the CDC has discovered that is causing nearly 3000 people across the United States to have lung issues all we know so far is that in its infancy it's caused the terrible problems for a lot of people in his destined to do even worse investigators say that the raw THC oil is brought in from California because it's legal there and then smuggled into Arizona to manufacture the fake carts police say just days ago a 17 year old was shot in Tucson and is in critical condition at a local hospital they say he was buying carts and when he realized they were fake there was a dispute and shots were fired digging deeper Lupita more real news for Tucson", "P1TkKEDw8uI": "it's been found in neighboring states now it's arrived in Northeast Ohio an old drug with a new twist the feds now seeing a lot more of it on streets across Northeast Ohio and Tracy Carlos live in the newsroom with another story you will only see on News 5 Tracy Frank tanita its THC an active ingredient in marijuana and it is now being used for vaping we're seeing a lot of it a lot of THC cartridges for vape pens cartridges similar to these that we found on the internet are now in the hands of DEA agents here in Cleveland it's illegal its THC it's marijuana the vape cartridges are filled with THC oil it's a chemical out of marijuana from marijuana from the plant it's extracted and it's mixed in with another substance and then placed into a cartridge and ultimately sold on the street recently DEA agent seized more than 15 thousand of them that will not make it onto the streets I would say we were surprised at the amount you know that's a lot when you're seeing you know thousands of those on the streets there have been seizures like this in neighboring states as well Indiana Pennsylvania and now here in Northeast Ohio assistant Special Agent in Charge Keith Martin told me once out of the box the drug is nearly impossible to detect can be smoking it and it's it may not be present in other words we wouldn't know you could be sitting next to somebody who's smoking a THC cartridge and you might not even know it and big bucks come along with a THC filled cartridges in Pennsylvania for example police seized not only the drugs but 3.5 million dollars as well live in the newsroom Tracy Carlos news 5", "d-CQWkbLw-o": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis Somali eh I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of product reviews today I have a wonderful product I've put it to the test I've been using it relentlessly for the last couple of weeks and I'm really excited to unbox and show you another one what is it it's a 510 threaded vape battery and it's from vessel the people at talk belief were nice enough to hook me up with two of these at lift and I am absolutely in love with this unit to be very honest with you I've been looking for an upgraded 510 thread battery for a while I've been using the classic C cell battery for quite a bit of time now I have lots and lots of them lying around lots of different carts doing R&D and I'm gonna tell you all the benefits of this because it is really quite great so let's get into the unboxing you can see this is custom branded four top leaf and it's really nice nice packaging 20:19 vessel brand powered by vessel dadada performance air intake smart battery plus LED indicator three power settings two point eight volts three point two volts and three point 6 volts long lasting 240 milliamp battery we'll get back to that magnetic charging port all fantastic designed for people who know built by people who care the craftsmanship and performance of your top leave vessel is obvious from the moment you pick it up fits most 510 threaded vapes there's a one-year warranty and again this is made for top leaf sundial so let's cut into it it's got the shrink wrap on it which is really nice and these batteries are 79 to 100 dollars on their website I think they're on sale right now got the handy dandy corkscrew knife go [Applause] Thanks packaging sleeve vessel that's our actual vessels this is the you know custom branded one here's the box they all come in this is the black and gold and that's what it looks like as soon as you open it underneath the lid underneath the lid we have the warnings 5-volt or they're only press the button five times to turn off three times two cycle power levels for additional information visit vessel brand but there's really nothing more than that it is a simple ease of use piece of technology which is great get started charge we recommend fully charging your device before first use blinking red lights charging no lights fully charged low and remove the black cartridge and replace the you choice of top leave 510 thread cartridge you not overtighten the cartridge you can use any 510 thread cartridge enjoy power on and off with five rapid clicks press and hold the button your inhale three times spree rapid clicks helpful tips start the lowest setting with any chalk leaf oil your device will power down after 15 minutes charger that the duck tada and that's French because we're in Canada nope our neighbor will say even though I see it absolutely every single day here's our unit really really beautiful unit I really like the color scheme of this one the talked leaf black and gold is really slick you can see that they put the top leaf custom branding on it so a really nice piece of technology it looks very handsome this is the black and gold to me is very manly I really really like this piece it's like a nice pen for me it's like holding a bought Blanc pan or something really really slick so sitting in here just like this this is our unit behind there we have that piece and then we have the charging cable let's check out the charging cable first there's nothing left in that box there's nothing under there that's just a piece that's our box nice box so our charging cable is proprietary it's a magnetic charging cable and what's really interesting about this is that it actually attaches to the bottom because if you've experienced any other 510 threaded cart the only way you can charge these is by twisting it into this port I'm looking for a charger on my desk somewhere like this you have to take your card out now with the vessel there is no taking your card out you can actually hit it while it's charging and you have this nice magnetic port and you can twist that down and it locks it in pretty good not all the way I haven't found a complete lock with that to be very honest with you but I like that aside from it being proprietary which is always a hard thing with charging cables I personally hate proprietary charging cables but this one's pretty cool yeah I hope you won't lose it it's nice and magnetic it's pretty slick and that's how it charges now on to the rest of the unit this is where your cart goes it unscrews do not use this one it's just a burner in its place but what you can see about the unit and what I really like is if it focuses that's probably best there's air holes there's one two three four air holes right down here and these air holes allow for a really really beautiful pull absolutely beautiful to be completely honest I told you I had two so I have one right here I'm just gonna turn it on five presses let's see if this comes charged oh box yeah and it's on the lowest setting there you can see and I can do one two three you know change colors one two three now we have it on green and let's just uh you can see how nice the clouds are and the rip is so nice there's so much air coming through it so what I love about it I'll take this off and we'll put it on the other one just to show you what's going on and how great it works so I'm really a big fan of this unit not a paid endorsement at all just love the unit there it is with the fresh battery right out of the box you know it comes charged out of the box which is nice big things that I found with this battery with this with this fantastic unit is even though the C cell battery claims to be a 310 milliamp this battery actually has it claims to have smart technology and it's a 240 milliamp battery but it's battery-powered that's more efficiently being used and I really have found that with this battery I've been able to smoke a half car at half you know probably 75 puffs if not close to 100 puffs maybe 75 I don't want to exaggerate too much out of the pen before it needs to be recharged and it's really great what I've also noticed is the cartridge itself is not getting hot I often notice with this battery if I have two or three puffs if it cartridge gets really hot and the unit itself shuts down this unit I can rip it over and over again well I wasn't too big of a pup and it doesn't get overly hot the flavor stays great stays consistent and big thing about that air is it actually is really giving me a much better flavor it's not getting as hot I'm getting more air and I'm finding I'm getting bigger vapor clouds I really really enjoy everything about it so the airflow the design absolutely beautiful the way that the battery works that technology and the battery is fantastic but it's because it really is making everything last longer from my cart to the actual battery life love how slick it looks what else can I say about it I think it's a great unit the only knock is the proprietary charger but I see why they did the proprietary charger so that you could use your vape while it's charging and that you didn't have to screw in and screw out your vape dealing with all that nonsense just to charge really really cool really cool unit for a hundred bucks if you use carts all the time 510 thread carts this is the thing to get they have lots of different styles very feminine looking ones very masculine looking ones really enjoy this unit that's my review you know what 9 out of 10 haven't found anything wrong with it yet the way it would be 10 out of 10 is if it had and app and I could control to the exact degree what temperature the car was being vaporized with and seeing all of my data and my analytics behind the scene that's the only way this would be 10 out of 10 is if it had Bluetooth and it was connected to my phone 9 out of 10 loved the vessel battery if you smoke a lot of cards I definitely think you should get one thank you so much for watching I hope you make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and until next time Cheers what's my name what's

my village update one", "t5Mtbx-W0D4": "hey guys dr. Shawn Mira vici here and I'm gonna do another cannabis product review for you despite all the craziness happening in the world right now with Koba 19 I'm practicing very strict social distancing but that doesn't mean I can't keep doing product reviews for you so today we have the another vape cartridge product using the 510 thread system today is going to be the sundial Zen very also known as shish kebob and so this comes from sundial growers they're based in Alberta some things of note about this company is that they really emphasize that they're putting out pure products meaning that they're free from additives fillers and artificial flavorings so you know you're getting a really pure product they do a glass and ceramic cartridge so a very high quality cartridge and they use single strain extracts so it's kind of like a single malt scotch meaning that your extracts just coming from one strain rather than a mix of different strains a lot of the other cartridges out there are really a mix of a bunch of different strains so kind of cool that this is a single strain extract it comes in at around 72 to 82 percent THC meaning that it's very strong THC level it's available on the Ontario cannabis store retailing for about 49 actually it's exactly forty nine ninety-five putting it into sort of the middle midpoint range in terms of price for for a vape cartridge but I don't mind paying a little bit extra if I'm getting a really good quality product so let's open it up it's also got a sort of a unique box most of the other fake cartridges I've received come in this paper box this one is this plastic round container and you open up by you see those notches you match up the notches there and then you pull it open or at least you try to pull it open yeah there we go okay let's pull it out you could take a look at that looks really nice it's got their logo there a nice glass container and the tip feels really nice too so you could tell it's high-quality and that just fits into your 510 cartridge battery system you screw that in there okay and then you're ready to go one thing I also wanted to mention about this particular strain is that they're terpene profile includes cario Filene Mersin and humulin and alluding to its name they say that you're gonna get like a nice sort of berry flavor with this vapor and I agree so you'll notice like it doesn't really taste obviously like berries but there is sort of this hint of barrenness in the flavor i had previously ordered the aurora indica cartridge and that was just like really just straight-up like cannabis ii flavor this one definitely has a hint of barrenness to it so i've been using this for the past three four days not a huge long time but but I do like the vapor it's nice and smooth it's got that sort of berry finish to it it is quite strong and it's a creeper meaning that you don't really feel this one right away it sort of creeps up on you after about 10 minutes so definitely go slow with this one because it will sort of creep up the effects and they are quite strong so it is quite calming it hits Li you like in a whole body way but it's very short-lived like it only lasts 60 to 90 minutes and then you kind of feel a little sleepy afterwards so I wouldn't recommend this as a daytime strain definitely best suited for evening nighttime use and that's really what I've noticed about this product is that it's strong but the effects wear off quite quite soon after so like an hour to an hour and a half taking all of those factors into account so you know a good quality product stressing that it's added to three which you know is what I want in a vape cartridge it it's that single strain all around like a high quality product but the effects are short-lived and the price is sort of mid to high range so taking all those into consideration I'm gonna give this one an 8 out of 10 good product a couple limitations with it but but there you have it the sundial Zen berry thanks for watching be sure to subscribe if you like this content and want to see more content like this and i'll be back with another product review for you shortly", "JHuSstnceBE": "do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail one mil or one gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges let's take this to the deck okay well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sell brand we're going to take a pair of vice grips common rice clips and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this caller right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged all right I will show you again on this one here you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it", "CcqVbopKY2c": "you know I do ladies and gents we are back with another review you already know it's been a couple days since my last review I just wanted to say real quick that that's because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw

you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made

video which is gonna be on Wednesday maybe even sooner [Music]", "adEpr6jUq1Q": "Good day guys, Matt from VapeFuse\nAustralia here, back again with another introduction to Vaping Video, part of\nour Vaping 101 Web Series, where we introduce our Aussie VapeFuse customers\nto what vaping is all about. Now, on my first couple of videos, I touched on what\nvaporizing is and how it's better for you than smoking and now we're going to\nsort of delve into the different types of vaporizers that are available. Now, the\nmost common vaporizer is the e-cigarette, which is basically just another name for\na liquid vaporizer. Now the Vivant Incendio, which I've got\nhere, is a dual liquid and oil vaporizer, but with this atomizer on top, it's used\nto atomize the liquid tobacco or liquid nicotine, that will go inside of it. So\nbasically what that is, that is the blend of vegetable, glycerin and\npropylene glycol I believe, those two mixed together with a base flavor and some\nliquid nicotine. So, that's obviously a lot healthier for you than a cigarette,\nas it doesn't combust a tobacco and many people use that sort of as a lead-up to\nquitting smoking or quitting ingesting nicotine. So, the liquid vape as I said\nmost common. The second most common after that, is the Dry Herb Vaporizer. Now,\ndry herb vaporizers which we specialize, here in VapeFuse Australia. I used to\natomize herb substances like Damiana, Chamomile or even Lavender, which we have\nhere. So, this is done just by inserting herbs into the chamber, preheating the\ndevice, the device anywhere between 50/ 70/ 80 degrees Celsius around that point\nand what it does, is that will extract the essential oils from the herb\nmaterial and result in a vapor like substance that will emit through the\nmouthpiece. So, Lavender what that does specifically as a herb, will help you\nto relax, if your'e having trouble sleeping you have a crack vaping some Lavender. Now,\nthe third type, which is probably the least common and most unknown especially\nin Australia, is the Oil Vaporizer. Now, here I've got the X Max V One Plus and this\nis one of our best oil vaporizers,  my personal device, this can be used to\nvaporize essential oils like Lavender, Oil, Peppermint Oil,  even Bergamot Oil.\nSo, pretty much what you do is, this one's got a atomizer in the middle. A\nlittle different to the herb and liquid. Liquid is more like a tank, the\nherb chamber is pretty much just a little basket for the herbs to sit in\nfor the hot air to pass over and the oil tank, has a little oil insert, which you\njust put a few droplets of oil in and that'll help you match your desired\natomization temp. So, that's pretty much it, guys. We've got the Dry herb vape,\nLiquid vape and the Oil vape. Thanks for watching and remember to\ncheck out the rest of our Herb Vaping 101 Videos to get in the know about\nvaping.

products for your pleasure so that when you go to your dispensary you know what you are in for because a lot of people tend to go to dispensaries and always have questions about what product they're what they're using so hopefully with these different videos that we offer you you'll have a little bit of knowledge on the actual product and hopefully you'll enjoy them as much as i do now today we're going to be reviewing a vape now the vapes by dime dime right here is a vape cartridge as you can see right here dime is by dime industries they focus on different types of vapes but on other products as well but today we're going to actually be reviewing their vapes as you see we're going to be reviewing an indica now this packaging is super super huge it comes with its own little dime sticker fantastic love stickers and this is what it comes with the user guide and look at this packaging for this cartridge fancy isn't it now as you can see here this is gonna be the dimoji indica thousand milligram thousand milligrams usually just means one one gram and then 500 milligrams means half a gram or 0.5 grams there we go we're gonna press the child lock bam yes i do alrighty look at this bad look at boy guy pretty hefty oh this is actually a pretty fancy cartridge let's find out anything more about the cartridge be signing saying indica think higher i will elevator might be able now this is for other people that want to verify the products to make sure if it's a legit product a lot of companies actually have to go through this process to show that the consumer knows that this is the exact product that they know that they're getting it's always helpful let's see what their user guide says [Music] wow i was not expecting that so the user guide shows the different flavors that the that they actually do that that's available apple gelato delicious watermelon wedding cake sounds daisy bubblegum kush forbidden fruit nice we got the dymo g perfect let's see what it says the brand signature true fire pure og extract widely regulated or regarded by many as the most powerful og kush strand known to man enjoy responsibility i'll try peach kush is the next flavor jackfruit blueberry lemon haze and strawberry cobb are the different players that they offer fantastic let's see what else they see welcome fantastic that was a consideration okay now this is actually a good consideration for a lot of people that are going to be vaping although our hardwell will allow you for a 10 second hits is recommended to do a 5 no more than 5 second draw because if you drop more than that you're going to be creating a little more of a smoke and that's all great and all but you're wasting instead of enjoying it so it's always good to do in small intervals i always recommend three to five seconds but it's really up to you because with the little intervals that you do you create the smoke that you want and you create the high there you want instead of taking one big inhale which kind of wastes and with the dime cartridge here's the dime battery sold separate and this battery is at 650 milliwatt all right it's the packaging right there that looks nice right there very fancy gold white has a regular base of a regular phone charger a micro usb this little box has a little charger fantastic as you can see micro usb and it's always recommended for a lot of these cartridges not to be charged in the car obviously if you're on the road and you don't have anything that should be your last resort but not charging at your home that way you can use it be mindful with this cartridge since cartridge is not plastic this is glass so be careful with it when you you drop it or you might shatter so please make sure you have it in a nice secure place when smoking it now as you can see the tip on the inside is it's actually very big compared to your common tips now if it ever gets dirty just get a cotton swab and alcohol and just clean the inside of it because you do want to make sure it's clean because if there's debris when you inhale it you're going to handle the debris you'll be choking and there'll be all this big mess so please be mindful always clean the cartridge now these cartridges are recommended to be used by their dying batteries but i'll reading into their user that they suggest this battery or 410 milliamp battery so that always comes into consideration now a lot of people are requiring a party to ask how long is this cartridge going to last me well it really depends on your smoking style if you keep on smoking smoky smoke smoking is obviously going to go down if you just use it maybe throughout your day maybe a little here maybe a little there it's obviously going to last you a lot longer so also do it in short interval hits because if you don't you're going to be wasting a lot more of the oil than you should now it's connected and there's probably going to be a little troubleshoot for example if for example if you ever get to a point why is there's no smoke or why does the battery blink three times probably just not making the right connection or it's probably a little dirty in there so just clean it up with a little a little alcohol as you can see in here this little middle part this is the connection to this guy right here so we want to make sure these guys are clean when you make the clearance and always make sure you charge it don't leave this in your car or it will leak don't always leave it upside like this way you don't leave it like this obviously if you're in a store somewhere it depends on depends on some people i've tried with other cartridges that you can store like this and it won't happen but we're going to test this cartridge and see if we're able to do that but other than that instructors say leave it like this leave it in a cool place dark place cool yeah let's try this ladies and gentlemen now people when you're smoking a pen you have to treat the oil as it was flour do not inhale and automatically excel try to keep it in as long as you can obviously the choking and the coughing that's the common side effect of cannabis so don't be alarmed but take a little bit of intervals you'll get the smoke that you need so obviously you'll be able to judge it if you take the 10 second and inhale you won't be able to judge in your those massive clouds there's gonna be a big waste and you're like oh no come back so little intervals enjoy them and what's fancier about this cartridge and what i love about it see these little holes right here these are airflows a lot of cartridges don't really have that can when you connect it to the battery because usually for the standard battery it's just a battery with little holes and the cartridge covering so it gives a very little air hole this gives it double the air hole so not only does it have the big air holes to give you a smoother hit also has a little one so it doesn't overheat the cartridge nor the battery which is a good thing because you want this to last let's take one more and within the burst head i was able to feel something because i'm inhaling it i'm trying to enjoy it before i release it for my second head it's kicking it up a little more now people might be asking me is this a live race cartridge it is not it is a distilled cartridge excuse me if it was a live resin it would actually stay on the actual package that it is live resin now if it doesn't say anything on the package of this live resin it is the majority of time i distill it now your priority will ask you what's the thc count what's the cbd count well i'm gonna get to that right now let's find out at the little facts now total percent of the thc 79.16 now the thc content 79.16 the cbd doesn't state it but roughly it's around three point something percent because the total cannabinoids eighty three point twenty two percent i'm gonna do math right now because i'm not a mathematician but you get the idea now so far from my head from this cartridge it was phenomenal now it's not too much doesn't you don't take too many of the terms so it's actually just right now obviously i didn't get the flavored ones so i can't really tell you if it's going to taste like a fruit or anything but the daimuji itself is a very nice cartridge it is there is quite enjoyable the device doesn't overheat i am able to enjoy the cloud that i'm looking for especially for that smooth hit so if you ever see the dime cartridge as well as the battery i advise you go get it because it's fun i would like to thank everyone for tuning in with me showing while watching this product of mine now if you ever see it get it and i like to give big thanks to atrium for letting me try one of their products that they're sampling and i would like to make a big thanks to you because it wasn't for you with this well i want to be here right here because i wouldn't be able to show you the knowledge and i want to make sure you're knowledgeable in what you're looking for now if you have any questions make sure you comment on the bottom below my name is roman and i'll see you guys next time", "-gdysmn5LEE": "well Aloha brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your man Kimo back to do another review for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there this time I've got a 5-10 thread of a cartridge coming to you from Palmetto cannabis that's sundial cannabis company it's agent orange it's a sativa hybrid stream it's coming in at 800 milligrams THC and one point two six milligrams of CBD so that's about 80% THC and less than a percent CBD so it's gonna be a high THC heavy-hitting cartridge really excited when I bought this I'm gonna admit I cheated a little bit I did buy it a few days ago and I was excited to try to open it up I've been faking it the last few days stuck it back in the cart in the container here to show you the package I'm gonna hate this packaging it's awful I'll show you on the front it shows to open the package you push it on the sides and you push open the top it's easier said than done like I was pushing pushing pushing I'm glad I didn't record the initial truck time I opened this package because it was real futile effort took me a while but after a while I just find out that usually if you play enough pressure on the sides and push in and pop you can open this packaging is horrible I can't stand the packaging and then when you do open it up you got your car to gene there it's nestled nice and safe away in this foam little cutout but it's straight through for me because you want the orientation of your cartridge to be upright and by having it designed in here you know this is probably gonna sit on the shelf like this or like this and your oils gonna be you know on the side it's gonna potentially clog or plummet your device not a cool design choice Palmetto I don't like that at all you know and strike three for me is this packaging big hard plastic and flung away what do you need all this packaging for this little device I don't like it you know it's it's horrible to me so packaging no good Paul metal so once you open it up though you do get this lovely little cartridge hopefully that's coming in nice and clear you see it says Agent Orange on the bottom and what I think is a really cool retro font I'd it the big bold letters you see the oil in there it is pretty dark doesn't move around a lot as you can see I've aped a lot of this the last few days it's a little dark almost kind of orange I'm wondering if the glass is actually tinted orange to go with the whole Agent Orange vibe I don't know let's get these rubber nubs off here with a mouthpiece condom get the battery put it on we're gonna vape a little bit here I've been vaping a lot of this I got some opinions on it but let's just take a rip right now as you can see is not a lot of vapor production it's not like a lot but it's enough gets the job done it is a little harsh so you can tell you're taking a drag that's one of the downsides to it after about four or five drags it gets a little harsh on the throat and I have coughed a little bit using this over the last few days but the taste you do get you're expecting orange oh you're expecting well Agent Orange gonna be citrusy orange II yeah not so much there's a little bit of a citrusy orange on the inhale and on the exhale it's a little tiny bit is there but it's mostly a kind of spicy peppery flavor cannabis flavor mixed in with the orange so it's a little bit sick you see with kind of spicy on the inhale on the exhale you lose a little of citrus and it's mostly just kind of a spicy peppery flavor it's not bad it's just not orange or really citrusy it's alright but like I said it's a little harsh so if you're going if you're really reefing on it you could COFF a little bit and you might feel a little irritation in your throat that's kind of the negatives the positives are the effects this this hits really good I find it to be a bit of a creeper strain don't really notice the effects for about 10-15 minutes and then all of a sudden you feel a Deadhead band effect come on and it comes down over and your smile comes up and I travels down your body and you feel energized and focused though like it's a really clear high you feel really focused and clear but you feel kind of happy and just like an overall general mood you're not really hi you got a bit of a headband effect but you're really focused and clear and just happy and conversational sociable it's a good get things done strains 50 times training good wakey bait string good any time stream however I will say that if you really refine it it kind of overdo it a bit start getting into you know quite a number of drags when the effects do kind of start to take over they're pretty intense at first and you know they wear off after a few minutes and they they develop into that sort of really focused clear high but you can make this pretty intense high it's kind of fun if you really want a refund get a little stone this is a great anytime babe because like I said it does dissipate into sort of a clear head in it you know certified so you're not all stony all day this this is great anytime Cape I would recommend it it's a good value it's forty five bucks I paid for it and you know it's point five grams it's gonna go about as far as any other 510 0.5 gram cartridge out there it depends on the use depends on your mileage mileage berries with you know how much you use it in your experience so thumbs up I recommend it I really like a good job Palmetto cannabis changing down packaging I can't stand your packaging I really like your cartridge I really like your oil I really like the Agent Orange pick it up if you see it it's a good deal that's the end of the review hope you all liked it leave me a comment let me know what you think that he tried it do you like it do you not like it what do you think you think I'm right

lp on the alberta market has uh forbidden fruit for its cartridge i'm really curious to see how it's gonna do and uh how it's gonna taste you guys so let's get this intro in here and dive into this cartridge before we uh before we go into our friday sativa strain review i'll see you guys on the other side of the intro where we're diving into the forbidden fruit cartridge by back 40. cheers welcome back you guys so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into forbidden fruit from back 40. i'm really curious to see how uh how these cartridges are going to do they aren't a company i heard very much about but the packaging is very interesting and unique to this company the cartridge feels like it's got kind of a unique shape um forbidden fruit and cushmits being um the end of oh i i almost forgot about the super lemon haze so the super lemon haze forbidden fruit and cushman's from uh back 40 seem like really interesting strains come out with really rich flavorful strains potentially and honestly it just seems like a fun company to dive into and see how it's gonna do and after we did the sativa last week we're gonna be diving into an indica this week so the only information that i was able to find quickly for this strain review is on the global news wire it's an article about the back 40 company and it just has a little bit of information for each of its cartridges so we're just going to quickly rattle off for all three leading off with the forbidden fruits the one we're going to dive into before we go into the actual information on this package and then into our full review you guys so forbidden fruit is an indica with citrus and earthy taste notes from the d limonene and maracinine botanical terpenes cushman's is their hybrid option with a refreshing burst of mint taste with menthol and d-lemonine botanical terpenes and super lemon haze is a sativa packed citrus and floral taste with botanical terpenes of d-limonene terpinaline maracinine and carefully so this one we're gonna be getting a uh citrusy earthy combination i'm really interested to see how that combination is gonna do you guys we uh have that package ripped open there we are going to get the urban scale intro in here right after we give the information off the package 80 thc 00 cbd and a package date of september 19th you guys it's time to get into the full-blown urban scale i'll see you on the other [Music] side [Music] get this open comes with a nice simple package on the outside and all in all the cartridge itself is nice simple design good really interesting red mouthpiece on it but i don't mind the overall design of the cartridge we can get this thc sticker off you guys so you know exactly what i'm oh this one doesn't want to come off easily okay look at that clear sticker off let's try the other side i don't think this one's going to come off quickly and easily guys okay let's just forget about that and we're going to dive right into the taste from a g pen you guys just because like i said in the last one the fireside battery died on us so we are stuck just with the g pen until we can get some more 510 batteries in stock at the shop for me to be able to grab one but the way we do our taste through the vape is we run it with the lowest temperature talk about it a little bit then the medium temperature talk about it for a bit and then we run it to the highest temperature and finally talk about it through a bit there i find each temperature has a little bit of a different experience a little bit of a different flavor and that's why we break down like that after we then go through the glass and do the exact same thing all three temperatures through each piece of glass to see each experience and overall development of flavor as you dive deeper into the cartridge you guys and after that we give it the score for the g pen the glass and a score out of 10 for the high we are going to be using the more updated score the scoring system where that one to two range is gonna be non-smokable that three to four is going to be on the harsher side but it can still have some enjoying points five to six is going to be the tolerable where the enjoyment is starting to outweigh the negatives that seven to eight is going to be the enjoyable and more optimal place for these to want to aim for and the 9 out of 10 is pristine and that's really going to be my personal preference the my upper echelons of the buds this was recommended by some viewers and it seems like everyone enjoyed it the last time when we dove into it with the concentrate so we're gonna do it with the cartridge this time you guys but we've got the bak 40 forbidden fruit indica dominant cartridge on here we uh we should dive into this you guys and see how it's gonna do i'm really curious haven't heard much about this company but i enjoyed this strain when i smoked it from quest in the bud form so now it's time to see how it'll do in the concentrate form from back for you guys cheers and i will see you on the other side when uh we've got the first taste of this forbidden fruit cart down and out cheers wow you guys so first experience on this you did kind of get that earthy almost even kind of leafy that urban herb kind of taste the green greens of a plant kind of taste and then it hits you with this really heavy um citric not necessarily um not necessarily like a sweet lemon but more like crystallized lemon or lemon juice like the really tart and almost cool lemon citric attack for the flavor and that really was what it was it was an attack on my taste buds and i enjoyed it quite a bit you guys but it was different for the experience i've got the second temperature loaded up on here let's dive in and see how this forbidden fruit crossover of that kind of earthy leafy taste with the lemon is on the second half you guys cheers and i'll see you on the other side hey guys so i found it had a really similar experience at this level too it really does balance a little bit better at the medium level it wasn't so much of an attack of that lemon flavor but more of a rush like it was like taking a drink of a lemonade that has too much too many lemons squeezed into it not enough sugar was really what it was or um like the straight lime curse out that you get in the bottle but they let like an extra sour tart edition of it or just straight lime juice like that kind of flavor and honestly it's it's enjoyable to have that wave of citrus but i wish it had a little bit of a sweeter touch to it just honestly for my purple personal preference but it's been enjoyable so far we've got the highest temp now ready to go let's dive into it and see how it's going to uh taste and overall how this g pen is going to score you guys i'll see you on the other side of this last rip before we dive into the glass side of the review guys um okay wow that actually kind of developed or deteriorated depending on the person that's looking at it i personally really am enjoying it and it does have an overall quite enjoyable experience but it's leaning more to that asset licorice flavor for me at that highest temp which was not something i expected at all it was not something i could have expected from this cartridge especially when we were getting that really earthy flavor into that really tart lemon combo i i didn't think a kind of an anise licorice combo would will come out of that but it's not bad it's just all in all different so i'll give it us you know what i am going to give it a 7 out of 10 because it wasn't enjoyable it definitely was enjoyable with the 7 out of 10. it just at the last one it was a little bit kind of like what so i would i would definitely enjoy hauling out of this at the lower temperatures as more of a sipping cartridge not really a like the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's a haul cartridge but for this week this one's a sipper now we're going to sip our way through the glass we've got six rips to dive into you guys i think i'm gonna cough a lot on this one but uh what what can we do about it let's uh dive into it and see how this cartridge does when you add a little bit of some water filtration on it first two rips we're just gonna press the button and haul the last one we will preheat before we press that button so that we are taking it at the highest level because why not experience it all this ain't pokemon but it's a good hell of a good stoner close-up don't try and catch them all let's try and smoke them all cheers y'all let's dive into it so we pre-heat that last one let's dive into it y'all cheers okay guys we're about halfway through this and i've got a theory i'm working on it we've got three more wheat three more weeks we've got three more rips that will really make the determination on uh whether my theory is right or not um i'll let you guys know at the end but uh hopefully i don't get too high and forget i don't think i will but i'll see you guys on the other side of the next three reps cheers well folks let's let's dive into it again cheers lowest highest i'll see you on the other side and we'll talk about my theory let's dive into it last time preheat it and dive into it cheers okay guys now should i give you the score or should i give you my theory first you know what i'll give you the score and then i'll work it into my theory afterwards i think that'll be the best way to do it so the score is going to be a 6 out of 10. so it's right on that top upper end of the tolerable side now that actually does feed quite well right into my theory so most of these 510 cartridges are going to be heating up to 0.15 of your oil in the chamber that actually has the wick and he is heated and vaporizing every time so with a review like this where i'm pounding out this many um this many rips between 20 to 30 minutes i'm breaking down the terpenes and not giving the cartridge enough time to cool down and really have everything balance out um to give it the optimal flavor between rips however i think this is going to be allowing me to review the the cartridge a little bit more honestly because if the flavor is just as good on the 12th with 12 13 14 15 rip of this review if we have the second battery 12 if we if we don't um if it just there's there's just disappointment when the the oil and everything starts to break down earlier and that's that's really why i think the way i'm smoking it is going to give you guys a more more honest review because that oil and the flavor should hold up and really the tropic girl scout cookies from last week that's going to be my card to compare because not only did it hold up on that review it's still holding up today it's a little bit softer on the flavor but not much definitely a lot less loss in flavor than i was originally expected so it's still doing incredibly well in a lot higher standard than i was originally expecting but it it did really well you guys and that's why this cartridge is going to get that 6 out of 10. now moving on into the high i'm going to give it a 6 out of 10 as well it was somewhat enjoyable until we got about the second rip into the glass you guys and then i started to get this creeping headache and every time i sipped that a card out afterwards it just built and built and built and now it's a really heavy kind of back of my head headache that creeps into my neck and it just kind of tension my shoulders and in my traps and it just it's not enjoyable you guys and i i'm not having that bit of a time however on the lower level this is a really nice card i am feeling that this card would do incredibly well as a complimentary or a balancing card where you're smoking it and there's something else that there's something else that you're smoking with it to get that heavier high and honestly it's it's enjoyable and it is something that i would consider trying again but it's not something i would consider buying again you guys um but the other two cartridges from back 40 definitely would be interesting to try out i've heard the cushions is quite minty quite menthol experience and i was a fan of the house too that was like that and i'm just a fan of that really cooling mint experience so we might have to go and check that one out as well but for the time being you guys we're going to wrap this one up tomorrow it is looking like we are going to be reviewing the uh mimosa strain from wink i'm really excited to try that one out it's been a while since i've smoked the most strain from a new lp or a new producer so let's see how it holds up because we've got citizen stash and best buds to compare it to so let's see if it does well you guys but for the time being we're going to wrap this one up when my end card slides in all you got to do is hover over my logo and click that subscribe button when you do click the bell notification beside it so you know anytime one of my videos goes live and i really do appreciate it that you can uh check it out six days a week worth of content what we're aiming for you guys and lately we've been getting damn close to hitting it every single

those videos if not both of them and uh enjoy it guys but for the time being cheers y'all and i'll be back later with some more content you", "OygOZEm7DM8": "the use of e-cigarettes also known as vaping is becoming what school leaders call an epidemic and new at four the Seminole County school district is out with a strong warning for parents if your child shows up to school with a vape pen and it includes any amount of THC they could end up with a felony on their record new success Erich von Hankin joins us now live outside a middle school in Longwood and Eric you spoke with Altima police about the growing issue and Lisa this was eye-opening so e cigarettes were originally designed for adults to wean them off smoking off nicotine but more and more kids are getting a hold of these not just in high school but even in middle school parents if you don't know what these are going to explain I learned a thing or two about these today so this is a vape pen you've probably seen that but this seems to be the e-cigarette of choice that kids are getting ahold of and using more and more because it looks kind of like as you can see a USB Drive and you can also put th C in here that's the drug in marijuana and apparently more and more kids are doing that a felony conviction could ruin your child's life it could ruin their adult life corporal Evelyn Estevez of the Altamonte Springs Police Department says a felony conviction is serious and it's happening more and more to young people using e-cigarettes like this but filling them with THC that's the ingredient in marijuana that gets you high law enforcement is not going to have a choice what the law says is that that THC concentrate constitutes a third-degree felony does it matter the amount we're not it's not like the traditional flower marijuana that people are used to seeing Seminole County Schools put out that same warning on Friday in this letter emailed to parents district-wide it warns that a student caught with a vape pen or jewel filled with THC any amount of it neither the school nor the school resource officer or deputy has any other options or course of action but to charge a felony for this type of drug incident on a school campus that means possible expulsion and it's punishable by up to five years in prison five years of probation and a $5,000 fine when you talk about a felony I mean as an adult you know that when you fill out applications whether it be a college application an employment application they talk about these have you ever been charged with a felony so it's a pretty serious thing this is not something that you're just gonna deal with as a juvenile so why does this look like a USB Drive and why does it smell like in some cases roses really or some other fresh scent well police tell me it's absolutely intentional coming up when I see again at six o'clock tonight some really good information additional information for parents I'll see you then but for now in Longwood Eric Vaughn Hank in getting results news six Eric thank you and new six investigator Luis Bolden spoke with Brevard County school officials where they are also seeing a spike in vaping on campus you can see his full report at click Orlando dot-com / investigators", "8cY0ZiKxBZI": "[Music] welcome to wheat entertainment we really enjoy looking for the best flowers and today is a special day because we're going to do a multi-strain review of shibinskis and that flower that cultivator has a lot of notoriety in the market so if you're interested to try scherbinski flower watching this video will definitely help you at least guide you towards what the doctor thought was the better flowers or strains from scherbinski's at least the most euphoric because my hunt is for heavy flowers that have focus that maybe can grin me out or at least they're on the euphoric side and so today we're going to talk about the four strains i collected up and this beautiful bud is the winner and you can see scherbinski flowers are very beautiful i think that scherbinski's plus alien labs have just unbeliev and connected unbelievably uh beautiful flowers and this one is just no exception and in the end i'm going to enjoy a vapor cup hit of this and we're going to load it in and then i'm going to stick it in later so you can see this straw has two scoops in it already but we're gonna add a third this is about the same amount as a bong hit and that amount you can get 12 to 20 draws and it takes about a minute and a half to heat up in the cup but we're going to stick it in there in the middle of this process because we're going to talk about number four and my least favorite of the shibinsky flowers now because it's the least favorite doesn't mean it's not good it's it's just if you have a if you're a cultivator and you have a building with 50 strains in it you know which one's the best so this is really the hunt for the best and for us as a group to be able to use the information that we have so we pick better so inch bitsky is my least favorite of all the strains i tried so far was something called acai berry gelato and this flower has 29 percent thc and sherbinski's all the flowers i bought have high thc but we know it's not about the thc it's about how the thc works with the cannabinoids and whatever else the process is i'm kind of lucky i'm an insider i know a lot of people in the marijuana business the legal marijuana business i only actually know about the legal marijuana business and i would say i know a lot of people scientists phd doctors and these are people that we all respect each other and we share information and so as we get into this no one really knows what makes to something something you think by now someone had figured it out but they haven't and so anyway this was my least favorite this flower was a hybrid i rated it a 7.5 and for me the sour was rough and it was just okay and it was my least favorite flower of all of them so coming at number four acai berry gelato but we're moving up to a better shrbinsky's flower and coming in at number three we have something called jello gelato it's jell-o g-e-l-l-o and this flower has 29 percent thc too crazy huh all these high thc flowers this flower is a hybrid and actually all these gelatos shibinski's is famous for gelatos and this also is a hybrid and this flower got a rating of 8.5 which is a good top shelf average flower it's a gassy og this flower had a head high but again it was just okay for me but we're looking for the best so my third flavor favorite was jello gelato and we're gonna move up and now we're gonna stick this straw down into the vapor cup and i do it now because it takes about a minute and a half for this thing to give off the water vapor the terpenes the cannabinoids and the natural oils in the plant and they all gather here in about a minute and a half and this cup's gonna be ready to go and to use vapor cup the best it really comes down to letting the cup heat up long enough when this light turns green it's ready to go but if you do it then you have to let it sit in the straw longer if you let this cup heat up longer even at the temperature of 330 but now it's hot to the touch you will see that it vapes in the straw much faster so you'll know it's ready when you see the vapor cloud right here and you can see it happening right so this is in so let's go to number two so my second favorite of all the scherbinski strains is something called bossio gelato and people had me looking for this strain and this flower has 32 percent thc and this flower is a hybrid and i rated this thing in 8.65 this flower had a light uh og taste and it was good but it wasn't really euphoric and that's and also not really heavy heavy because to get an 875 you've got to be heavier than this but this flower was good and if you're a lightweight i can understand i don't want to say a lightweight if you are a regular user not a heavyweight like a lot of people that watch these videos this flower is good but for me i rate it in 8.65 which means it's a good solid flower anyone who bought this flower they're definitely going to like it but we're moving on up and my favorite flower of all the shibinskis that i bought so far is something called much gelato and this flavor excuse me this strain was gassy og taste but the reason it got the top dog for me is because it made me happy and that's what this thing is this whole hunt is looking for happy euphoric flowers this flower 30 thc it's a hybrid i rate it in 8.75 to get the nine you got to groom me out but it didn't do it but if i was going down to the store and they had all these strange the one i would pick is moochie gelato now with that said there's been some comments of something called uh celo gelato which is c-e-l-l-o i have not tried that strain not gonna put it in anything but there's been comments on that so i'm gonna note it just for what it is but if you're going down and you want to listen to the ones the doctor has tried the one i would try is much gelato and it's good and that's the winner today and the muchi gelato is in the straw right here and you can see the vapors all gathering up on the straw so it's time much gelato by sherbinsky's at a vapor cup at 330 degrees that's a lot of vape for me crazy i'm telling you vapor cup is so good you don't stink your house your wife doesn't come and look at you the bong going what's wrong with you you're not in college anymore i'm telling you this thing is a game changing item now we have the right to use flour whenever we want to i'm telling you if you get this you end up go to wheat entertainment.com look at the reviews on not excuse me on vaporcup.com look at those reviews those are all real buyers of vapor cup number two this thing's incredible every day i just can't wait for i don't usually use flour before four except on the weekends and at the weekends it's fair game but during the week i've got to get stuff done and i'm telling you this thing is great and makes lots lots of opportunities to use you can see it on vaporcup.com if you're looking for strains i posted all my favorites on wheat entertainment.com go take a look over there i'm gonna update that list it's i've done a lot a lot of new strains so there's a big giant review coming uh you're gonna see it real soon i'm telling you it's going to give everyone a good chance to grab some new flowers thanks for joining in i'm the doctor i'll be back tomorrow thanks for all the tips join in party on my friends [Music] you", "4k0qumqCKYQ": "hey guys it's Jason from best friend this is a demonstration video of the best one guys cartridge fill the gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "MF3_LCwzHd8": "I don't want to get too morbid in the beginning of this video

code you're gonna have everything you want on Eve if your app if you're where I am ease is not the way I'm not even gonna front when I was on ease I did see a couple things that stuck out to me number one heavy hitters heavy hit sucker heavy hitters pineapple express cold filtered high posts and cannabis concentrate from heavy hitter labs are coming in at eighty nine point forty four percent total active cannabinoids eight hundred and fifty seven milligrams of THC two hundred point eight milligram CBD this was packaged for sixteen twenty twenty now when I had Saudis on ease I was like alright well I gotta get it because it's pineapple Express my favorite strand right now is pineapple express vape juice anywhere vape concentrate whatever favor one is pineapple Express from schism not even gonna front it's literally the dopest dope I've ever smoked but when I saw heavy hitters pineapple Express I was like I gotta do the one-on-one I have to see not that I have much of my pineapple Express from Suzy left I probably got maybe one good hit two good hits but it's enough to try to do a little bit of comparison for you guys and because you know what truthfully you know we don't really have much to tell us what's different about different oils to different companies I just want to know does the pineapple Express from heavy hitters tastes just as good as the pineapple Express from Stacie I dunno companies use their own little formula but we're just going off of whatever right now so let's just enjoy the moment let's go I hope you guys got your apparatus is out once you

lot of you go to be legal dispensaries so don't be offended but the illegal dispensaries that I've went to the heavy hitters were always so sucks you know what I'm saying a little bit more than your average dizzy so I was just like you know if I'm gonna fake anything it's gonna be as dizzy you know I'm saying so I usually just bond with the stitches because they're 2530 dollars to where this would be like maybe an illegal dispensary forty five fifty as low as 40 but you don't want to cop this when it's 40 dollars bro you know I'm saying sometimes it's too good to be true so let me just shut the [ __ ] up and open this bad boy up this is a first for me which means it's probably a first for you so let's respect it as such all right so I'm gonna take this off at the bottom [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'll get that in mind then we get that bubble of air bubble Dan this is a big cart and it's heavy too and look at that Teen Mom look at that rise cloud oil liquid roll mine and it got the little California emblem it's it's small it's not distinctive enough you know what I'm saying it's not out there or it's not a sticker so I'm not gonna front that got a little bit more taste than this dizzy first wins first play I mean that first taste first try all right so I hope you guys got your [ __ ] out man cuz I'm trying to smoke I'm trying to smoke this [ __ ] so let's take this wild ride together this little adventure and a little 510 thread nothing crazy I mean and I charged the [ __ ] today have the charge the [ __ ] today let's take this wild ride together like I said if you're 21 or older make sure to LIKE comment subscribe this is a say for 2020 salute Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] that was good I liked it I'm gonna do one more hit the four of you let me real I expected a little bit more taste more flavor here's the thing this isn't a flavor cart do you know what I mean so I don't think it's meant to have a lot of flavor now - it is kicking mmm it's good I like it um so okay so the review of how to be a heavy hitter like I said it was one of those brands that it felt like it was just a it was just one of those brands you saw an illegal of dispensaries and for whatever reason I just was never comfortable with purchasing a heavy hitter until I had the money to hence this video now I got more of a taste off of the dry hit than I did off the actual legitimate hit which is a little bit funny to me it's not bad does it have as much flavor as beast is e off of first R it can't really talk and I don't want to over a judge it when I shouldn't so let me just go in for the second hit and we'll see heavy hitters Pineapple Express saalu to [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so I've hit the heavy hitters enough at this point I'd like to think now to go head to head pineapple Express dizzy I want to see how well this can hold up in a fight against the heavy hitter he's not a heavy hitter that's gonna knock you out it's a heavy hitter so let's see where we can put the stygians blinkers only come on [Music] [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] Nega no way no [ __ ] no [ __ ] one [Music] that's busy has a lot a lot more teeth then that pineapple Express to us from heavy hitters wow this was a heavy hitters video that [ __ ] knocked it out of the [ __ ] park now I don't know what I think it was the taste which tells me either they put a little taste in this dizzy and this dizzy distillate and it has some pineapple flavor and this may be the true version of pineapple Express with Noah did it I did it with no additives so either stygius pineapple Express has a more flavor I don't know this should hit this [ __ ] pumpkin hit this dizzy they both hit let me make that very clear but with the the pineapple Express like the pineapple eat like you get pineapple from it I got pineapple from both but nah man wow this is a great product don't get it [ __ ] up but pineapple Express from steezy one I gotta try someone other heavy hitters [ __ ] this is great though I don't want to make it seem like this is like the same you know what I mean totally not the case I [ __ ] with this this is good if I didn't have this if I didn't have the pineapple express some sticky this would have been the next up but I don't know man that's tizzy pineapple express got a little bit more taste to it a little bit while I was eye-opening to say the least holy [ __ ] I'm baked right now - Wow didn't think that was gonna happen I really thought this is gonna win I wanted it to I didn't know if I wanted it to but I just was like this is okay this is gonna be it I gotta try other heavy hitters [ __ ] let me just say that this oil moves to compare that steady oil this oil totally moves if you leave it I mean you give us some time I mean it's gonna move you know what I'm saying it's definitely but it's all good I'm not really I'm just shooting the [ __ ] with you guys I'm just seeing what's better what's not better you know what I mean I'm really not doing this for the old five out of ten you know what I mean like it's good you should try it bro it's all [ __ ] weed at the end of the day let's be real here you know what I'm saying so I mean I understand the comments of people in the comments like oh is it better than Vince it's better is it better than this is it better than this I mean to answer your question this weed I mean unless you get in hot dog water which I would like to think that you're not at this point you know what I mean I would like to think that it's all weed and it's all gonna get you [ __ ] up you know some have a little bit more than others but I mean I mean to ask me I would never ask me I would never ask me I would never ask me what is what's the best hard car to get you hot I would never ask that cuz it's

and Saturday and then adieu I'm off I mean this is the Pineapple Express and heavy it is [Music] [Music] is", "35Gz8pCLf6M": "a few weeks ago synergy extracts who are now known as hi kind cannabis Co reached out to me on the old interweb to see if I'd like to try one of their starter kits so yeah they sent me along a kit to try and we will take a further look at these in a moment so as some of you may know I do actually vape I was a smoker in the past now in the UK cannabis is still classed as an illegal drug however CBD part of cannabis the sort of non harmful parts or what at least not be th see partly gets you high on its own is not illegal here now there has been a bit of an explosion recently about CBD based products coming to market so we've got various things that come to market such as these oils you can take and tablets that sort of thing so of course one such products is CBD based a liquid and this is of course is where a high kind cannabis code come into play now they can't be sent me out one of their starter kits containing the pen style ecig and a cartridge to the limited edition turbot enriched CBD just elect to try so let's take a closer look at the device so they come packaged like this they have since updated the website quite a bit there new ones seem to be based on a white cartridge design I think the older ones actually have branding on it so these ones is actually an AVD plume stick guessing that's a pronounced that plume stick so yet I think temperature control not I mean it's drawer activated and temperature control not really it's got sort of high-low settings etc so you get one of these little devices in the Box we have a little tiny USB micro USB charge and lead I think that's also magnetic so you can soar fold it over like that takes up less space and you get the little pen cartridges oh so this is quite small ideal for transporting around in your pocket that sort of thing so we've got charging on the bottom we do get a light to the lights up it's not very clear but you do get a red light and I believe that turns blue we've got a switch between high and low so I think that's what their meaning by temperature control it's basically just sort of high voltage low voltage effectively and what sort of strength you want now this does actually have a 5-10 compatible thread and that will be useful to know now the the stuff they sent me is this limited edition grade aid so these come packaged like so now these are what they call their cartridges so compared to other companies that do a cartridge style system for just normal ecigs where you're kind of locked in these I do prefer because like I say they are 510 thread which is ideal because if you've got your own little 510 thread based tank you could pop that on top there so these are little cartridges they come with the prefilled and you can just screw them on as you would any other device now concerns and criticisms with this and the airflow is this teeny tiny hole here so they say no you can like you know restrict the airflow by putting your finger over it but what I'm finding is it really doesn't let much air in at all I'm used to using a device with much better airflow for standard vaping and so yeah it does feel like it's a really tight draw not really my sort of thing at all to be honest with you now the liquid itself this stuff they've sent me out this is 54% CBD based I don't personally like the flavour it's just I don't know just funny bit sickly for me it is a very dark liquid and it's very very thick now this has been sitting in here for about a week was sitting upright and it's been left lying down for a bit now and it's it is literally thickened up in there so that is a concern because that means if you're not using this enough or quickly enough then potentially this is gonna form this thick goo like this and it's just going to clog up and yeah you're going to end up with you know clutter all half of the cartridge that's not usable excuse my notes falling off there so yeah that is a slight concern about this one now what about prices so their kits itself which will contain these two parts they did start at currently around $44.99 UK British pounds replacement cartridges they start from $29.99 now interesting enough with these ones which I quite like you can actually unscrew the top helpfully and yeah unscrew the top you can then potentially refill them I don't think there's much you can do about coils but you could refill them with your own choice of liquid or by one of their packs of liquid and refill it a couple times before replacing the whole cartridge you can also buy empty cartridges if you just want the names you want to use but that's a bit of an expensive way of doing it the device itself is drawer activated as such so once you start sucking on it then it will automatically fire up the coil it's like I say rechargeable battery pack in there did they just ate what the battery is no so I'm quite short the capacity the battery and that would be the yeah it says like the voltage setting you the low is two point four volts the highest three point six yeah I like I like the main device itself I do like that nice and small ideal and could be like I say if you get your own little 510 thread tank that can fill on the top you cannot use it for your own purposes this liquid wasn't for me like I say taste flavor just not really my sort of thing to be honest with you and I think because I didn't really like the taste or flavor obviously I've not really noticed if there's any sort of beneficial effects to using this or not now they do also sell a variety of high quality CBD based products from concentrates to oils as well on their website so do check them out prices are not cheap but I will say in comparison to having tried I mean I've tried other liquids before which have not been very good quality again I've not really liked the taste of them but they've been very very poor quality they're just cut with a load of like propylene glycol vegetable glycerin etc so you're not getting the real good quality stuff this stuff is properly you know extracted from the cannabis based plant itself purified distilled etc for you so yeah they are expensive but obviously you're paying for quality as opposed to buying something cheap that you don't know what it's being cut with or anything else so yeah to sum up on this one like I say device nice like the device nito a look-see what am I actually have a five tenant tank somewhere that might fit this so that I can reuse the device liquid wasn't for me but they do have a wide variety of different ones when actually sent me this limited edition while I couldn't actually find it on their website now they have since updated their website as they've obviously changed over names of the company so yeah they do do a wide variety of different types that you can get on there so do check out their website and you might just find one that you actually like possibly if I tried lots of different ones there maybe one that I like I don't know but like I say for me this one it thickens up too much and yeah taste flavor just not really not really my cup of tea unfortunately anyway thank you very much - hi kind cannabis Co for sending me this out - have a look at hopefully that's given you some information about the product and what they offer I can say links are in the description below for the website if you like this video guys please do give it a thumbs up if you haven't subscribed please do subscribe and I will see you soon for the next one Cheers you", "6jBvgTATN5Y": "hey y'all trevor here with ready leaf and today we're gonna be tapping into the vape cartridge thursday we've got the spark torch from trailblazer here i'm really excited to see how the sativa dominant strain does i'll see you guys after the intro and when we get into this [Music] hail welcome back so we're tapping into a sativa dominant 510 cartridge today from trailblazer it's the spark torch it came in with a thc total of 70.7 percent a cbd total of 0.325 percent it was packaged on march 18th 2020. i'm really excited to see how this one does let's pull up a little bit of information on it and see what we can find hey guys so we've got the lift and co website here with the spark 510 thread cartridge info so trail blazers point five grams sativa sativa dominant spark 510 thread cartridge is terpene rich it also has ceramic atomizer for an optimal vaping experience its earthy switches citrus and sweet flavors stem from its terpene profile which includes meristening presented in mangoes lemongrass hops and thyme alpha penine which shares with pine and conifers rosemary and sage carafeline found in black pepper cloves and balsam and lemonade also found in citrus fruits and juniper so the top four effects typically felt oh i'm having a tough time getting through this one today you guys the top four effects that are typically felt are going to be happy energetic creative and focused the top activities that it is used for are socializing cleaning listening to music and working the top method consumption is via the vaporizer and the scents are going to be citrus sweet and earthy i am really excited to tap into this and try it out we're going to do just that let's get into it you guys we're going to start out with the fireside 510 vape cartridge and battery combo got the cartridge out let's get going on this review okay we've got the cartridge loaded up and on the fireside battery to start with i'm really liking the use of a half gram cartridge here from fireside here let's get you guys to focus there we go i don't know you're not gonna focus until i do that come on come on yeah you guys won't be able to see very well sorry but we got the cartridge here thc logo nice half gram nice glass or plastic tip it looks like i'm really excited to try this out so we're going to start out with the lowest temperature work our way up see what kind of flavors we're going to have presented through here and uh only way we're going to get to try this is by trying it you guys see on the other side okay that first one was quite tasty you guys really really flavorful so uh let's keep this going and see see if we're gonna have that strong citrus orange flavor all the way through this battery you guys cheers okay guys so it had continued to hold on to that really nice orange citrus flavor it does have kind of an earthy touch to it at the end a little bit of a spice but i'm not minding it at all actually it's um a nice light combo to match with that strong citrus flavor i found but let's uh keep trying this on you guys and uh see how she tastes on the highest temp see on the other side okay guys so we've swapped it over onto the g pen let's get that sucker set on the lowest temp and try it out through there i'm uh gonna give it a nine out of a ten for the taste of the fireside it's got that really strong citrus flavor but it's not something that makes me want to stop smoking bud and that's going to be the big carryover if it if i want to smoke this rather than bud you're going to get that 10 but if i'd still rather smoke the orange cookies from gage or something like that for the flavor the the cart can't quite get the 10 you guys or if it's comparable right alongside it like it doesn't need to be above it just at least equivalent i'll give it a 10 then so a 9 out of a 10 for the fireside vape battery let's see how the g pen dudes dudes you guys let's see how the jeep hand use jesus i need to get burnt my first little sip wasn't doing it cheers we bumped that g pen up to the medium temp i didn't get quite as strong of a citrus flavor through the g pen but i got more of an earthy with subtle citrus flavor and it's not bad it's definitely going to have something that uh that's gonna be unique at every temperature i think with this g pen and the only way we're gonna find out you guys is by tapping into it cheers okay guys so this is going into more of that earthy citrus realm it's got a little bit of a grapefruit tinge to it it's it's really interesting and really unique and i'm i'm looking forward to seeing how well this this continues to die it continues to does continues to do through the last temp on the g pen and then through the rigs it's it's gonna be interesting you guys but uh again only way about finding the only way we're gonna find out is by finding out let's tap into it i'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 you guys for the g pen it had a nice flavor but it definitely wasn't comparable to the fire side here let's get to come on i want to switch temperatures on you there we go it wasn't comparable to the fire side with how strong the orange flavor pushed through it had a little bit more of an earthy tone that was still enjoyable it's just not as good as that orange flavor i'm definitely more of a sucker towards the citrus flavor if it is present but we've got the rigs ready we're going to take it through this little bubbler here at the three different temperatures and then we're gonna take it through the 420 catabolics rig as well for three reps with the g pen and we'll give you guys an overall score with that after we do it see you guys on the other [Music] side [Music] okay guys last rep preheat the sucker got it preheated put in the rig and get to it cheers [Music] hey guys so we're gonna tap into this let's uh let's start out with the g pen on the lowest hem and get up to the high one see on the other side [Music] hey guys so we're on that last vape rip through the rig that means we gotta pre-heat let's get to this cheers [Music] hey guys so i'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 for the taste for my glass it has a really strong citrus flavor that doesn't go too sour or too tart on ya it stays relatively sweet it does go into that earthy side and it does have a touch of a pepper as well so that's gonna knock it off the two points there really it just there were some other rips admit mainly that middle temperature on the two batteries that was really harsh and really disappointing and i definitely didn't enjoy it as much as through just the fireside battery itself the best rip though was actually highest temp on the g pen which is really surprising for me but overall it did really really well there it's going to get a 9 out of a 10 with a high and that's just because it comes in with a really strong cerebral uplift and energetic eye it sits nice and smooth behind your eyes but it's not so strong that it's distracting it's kind of that let's go get up and do something and enjoy it like it's it's very motivational and uplifting without being intrusive and obstructive in what you're wanting to do at the same time it's it's overall really enjoyable high but i do feel the potential headache coming in and and lingering in when the initial hit of the high passes and i think that right there is going to be a big thing on why i'm not going to give it a 10. with the high i know pretty early on in the uh in the video if i'm going to give it a 10 out of a 10 and this one i was questioning right from the right from the first rip but with all of the nines and tens that i got nines and tens and all of the eights and nines that i got this video ends up getting a 34 out of 40 which is a solid score for this vaporizer really really nice it's got a good flavor just a little bit inconsistent through the different temperatures which could make it unenjoyable for some people but overall it did really well and it's definitely something i'd recommend checking out if you're looking for that mid-range price point um i believe is 45 for this cart regular price right around there in alberta and it's it's not bad for a half gram it's it's pretty good quality but we're gonna wrap this video up hope you guys enjoyed youtube stick around i've got an end card just for you but

at weeds reviews we appreciate you we thank you so much for coming and rocking with us today figure we take a look at platinum vape trying to finish off the rest of the strand for you guys me and elon have been working hard shelter in your co-host elon musk kind of smug prick but hey you win some you lose some right this one here i'm gonna look at black cherry og one gram it's coming in at 77.44 with 1.1 cbd and then the next one here is detroit cookies this one's coming in at 76.79 with no cbd both indicas now i i've said this with um the last few that i've reviewed a lot of the indicas from this new platinum vape strands uh they seem to be real peppery and citrusy for some reason which is odd because platinum vapes even their indicators usually have a deep variant you know like i'm saying like platinum are not platinum but like select um elites and stizzies and certain brands have their own signature kind of taste to them and i don't know if that's what platinum vape is trying to do now with their uh endico line but if so i i kind of want them to back down off it because it i don't want every indica that i taste or try to be real citrusy or peppery i like a little bit of a balance and a break between that [ __ ] so let's hope for the best with these ones especially with this black cherry lg because you know with b and og i kind of want you to stay true to og roots so let's hope they did that here and let's hope i have my connector handy for my battery because it drives me crazy i have to have this thing to screw on my battery now and i tend to lose it all the time i tend to lose it all the time like it just did there it's what helps having a table here you know i can put all my stuff on but with that being said still rocking with what i got you know but it's working you're still making it happen i'm sorry elon you're right you're right you're right bitching at me already all right so fingers crossed they didn't go too peppery that one tastes good not real peppery thank you thank you platinum vape thank you this one is real piney and it got a pine citrusy herbal taste to it nothing like that spicy in the catch definitely stays true to an og taste it's got that nice piney smooth earthy taste to it like og should yeah definitely good cartridge here like i said really well balanced smooth it's real herbal piney citrusy it's got a good taste to it doesn't have a lot of peppery taste to it like the other like the other cartridges i'm glad that they got away from that i was hoping that it wasn't gonna be like that every cartridge i was like man you know it wasn't bad because it was just three of them and they were balanced good it wasn't terrible but it was like man i hope not every indica is going to taste the same you know i'm glad that they put a deep variant in being in these yeah that was real smooth real well balanced and i got my battery up kind of high too so let's drive a little lower even better really well balanced this is or berry black cherry oh gee black cherry og i'm gonna give this one five stars like i said this whole line that they came out with sorry guys i'm gonna take this thing i told you it's a pain in the ass it really is i can't really i mean the battery is really cool one good thing about the batteries the life of it like i had to charge like once every three days which is really cool i enjoyed that but the bad part is taking this damn thing off and putting it on all the time i lose my car keys you don't have no idea how easy it is for me to lose this damn thing yeah i'm sweating okay i'm sweating i'm moving around jesus christ this one here is our detroit cookies excuse me i'm gonna hope hope for the best with this one as well like i said they've knocked it out of the park with all these um strands so far there hasn't really been one that i disliked the last strands the previous ones now there are some in there i didn't like that watermelon ziddles that was [ __ ] i did not enjoy that at all oh wow this one it reminds me a lot of the god snapper whoa that's just making me sweat this one hits good there's one really sweet smooth pine taste to it god this one tastes really good oh yeah this is definitely one of my favorite ones definitely detroit cookies so far and platinum mimosa have been my favorite favorite favorite ones they're really well balanced really well tastes they taste really well tastes really well they taste really well tastes really good um all of them are good though like that's what's crazy with these new strands that they got even with the sativas if you go and you buy one you're not going to be disappointed they're all good they're all good cartridges the swimmers like really good and some are just good some but some are really good that platinum mimosa and these detroit cookies really good five five stars check out let me know if you had have this let me know in the comments um the lab testing data and this one is two three so if you get one that's lab tested two three because sometimes it's weird because sometimes you can get one that's the same brand are not the same man but the same strand and excuse me it might not taste the same depending on the lab testing dates because a little bit can get you know can be different from this batch to that batch you know they could have mixed up the recipe a little bit or just move this thing around or this thing around that could cause you know a significant change in the taste i know that happened with god stoppers the first couple god stopper strands the first one that came out was incredible after that it was kind of like no one really tastes the same there's a big variant between the first one and the second one that they came out with so that's the direct cookies if you get one that's lab tested around 2 3 of 21 that's what i'm smoking on so that way you can kind of get an idea if we have the same thing this one here though really strong cartridge really really smooth fruity piney taste well balanced herbally i really enjoy this cartridge it's up there with up with my top probably 10 cartridges i've ever had so far i'm sitting there shaking it like i got palsy or something yeah definitely a really good cartridge like i said so far the platinum mimosa and the detroit cookies have been my absolute 100 favorite let me know what you guys think in the comments if you agree with me um i i can't say none of them have been terrible there hasn't been one that i've hit and i disliked and i can't say that that's been the same uh with the previous um batch or previous trends that they released because they released uh that one one uh strand that they dropped those strands that they dropped back in the summer when they dropped like god stopper and some of those other ones there's a couple in there i know for sure at least the one i can it resonates with me was the watermelon zittles it tasted nothing like zettles it tasted nothing like a watermelon it was really bad it was kind of like i couldn't even believe platinum put something like that out so i'm so happy that all these strands have been what they've been excuse me because i was really worried about that having tried you know a few of the other ones or not a few i've tried all of them but having had a few of the other strands in the last batch being bad i was wondering what we were going to get with these ones because they released quite a bit another thing that stinks too is gosh that tastes really good another thing that stinks too is you know i don't understand this and i work like i said at dispensaries so i don't get it but there's other strands from recreational to medical that we can't get if you're medical that recreational can get you understand what i'm saying and with that being said it kind of pisses me off because they got some strands that i want to try like their cornbread and their um zappa they got a few strands that i'd like to check out but they're for recreational they're not ford medical it kind of bite kind of bugs me because i don't understand anything that's recreational medical should be able to obtain that as well and they said that it has something to do with covid i don't understand that neither like you can't blame everything on covet guys you know what i mean you [ __ ] get a headache nowadays and people are blaming on cloven i mean covet is covered be be safe wear masks wash your hands do everything as you're supposed to do you know but like you can't blame everything or everything you do everything that's wrong everything that's [ __ ] up can't blame it on covet you know what i mean you got to find the real answer to it can't you say oh that's because of covet oh yeah i didn't do that because of code we didn't do this because of covet it's just it's run its course using it as an excuse i mean and i'm not saying anything negative about the virus because trust me it i don't want to get it i don't want

from CVD inside and today we're going to be discussing Debian's versus fate Ian's dead pins and baked beans are both convenient and effective ways of using CBD they are very similar but there are some key differences that you should know about so let's get into it baked beans often contain thinning agents so babies must maintain a consistency that allows the oil to sprint evenly over the heating element thinning agents are a common additive to achieve a liquid like oil CVD can be refined to achieve the needed consistency but this way is a lot more costly than anything agent so for this reason a lot of the time fitting agents are added they pins contain Flay the editors Soto beans eventually found in plants and that's what actually gives them the unique sense so researchers found that even when matching the original term he started him adding them from an external source does not provide the same benefit 7 times advertised as boosting the bacons effects can turn into really harmful chemicals when they vaporize and this is far from beneficial baby temperature so what disposable bedpans they cannot be adjusted and sometimes the high heat can actually cause the pan itself to burn and Lee rechargeable wet new batteries often have a temperature adjustment button to get the perfect temperature for each drop their pins usually offer the highest degree of temperature control so some people prefer a hot emulation and others like to use an extra low-temperature death so they can preserve as much flavor as possible even if that results in less paper their pins are very discreet so they Dean's are used for a number of substances and a lot of the times they're indistinguishable from nicotine band-aids and for that reason they pens allow you to use your product on the go discreetly and the level of privacy vape pens are the most portable so disposable bag pens are the most portable option for consuming CBD oil but there are no secret charges or pots to carry around and there's also a very little chance of the oil leaking another great thing about disposable late hands and rechargeable bed pans is they'll easily fit into your pocket or your bag dad Pennzoil we usually have several pots and they will need frequent charging Deb hands have a learning curve deaf hands can't take some practice because it is a multi-step process first you have to transfer the CBD concentrate from its container and to either the pan or heating element and then you have to time the vaporization with your insulation and on the other hand vape pens on they have one step you just have to breathe in however the simple choice isn't always the better choice given CBD connoisseurs often prefer the dabbing experience defconn's are the best value but at what price so Debian's definitely provide the best value if you plan to do a lot of baking the device can be used to be a concentrate and it can be recharged indefinitely and buying CBD concentrates individually or in bulk also saves you money that you I bet cartridges or disposable pans with that being said dad pins can't have multiple parts that can be a little complicated to take on let go and they will cost more money up front ma pian is a fraction of the cost and it can last for weeks if you're an occasional user okay so to put it simply if you're new to see mini vaping start with a simple single use statement however please be extremely careful that it's very high quality especially since the recent news of the contaminants and sunbae products so as you become more familiar with the process you might decide that baby pants are the best option for you or you might even want to invest in a dev setup thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you on the next video", "TaTiQYm0DT4": "hey what's good everybody jp here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test review featuring scherbinski's jello gelato so this strain comes particularly hyped out of the sherbinsky's family out of the team they have personally expressed that this is arguably one of the best batches one of the best strains one of the best phenos out of the whole group of sun ground that they just released here in california so we're gonna dive right in i took some pictures of the buds thus the bag being open and i saved the best nug for this review and for you guys to see so check this out all right you guys i personally was very impressed with the nose the like the smell the terps the moisture content on this on the outside of the bud it's covered in trite it smells good on the inside there's a very healthy snap the moisture content the dry is very much on point there's solid trichomes and then the smell actually improves on the inside which we like to see that in the realm of sun ground sun grown buds so we're going to do a quick one bowl review i'm going to break some up here kind of talk to you guys a little bit and um we're going to dive right in i love i love gelatos i've been very impressed with scherbinski's ever since i stopped smoking their pre-rolls um i think the buds that they grow i think they're very good but it can be tough sometimes to watch out for seeds obviously in terms of like pre-rolls and you know just a bunch of big batches and stuff like that here we go higher standards keith herring fresh bong shout out to the alcohol plug here we go one two three all right all right so on the inhale you get piney creamy gas on the exhale you get fruity creamy piney gas this all of a sudden the fruitiness you can taste on your palate when all the smoke finally uh you know clears out of your mouth so i think you know jello g-e-l-o gelato i don't know what that's supposed to taste like at the end of the day aside from gelato when i hear jello gelato i think fruity creamy gassy and i know gelato has some pines so when i think about this it's doing all the things that it's supposed to do um score score wise out of 10 in terms of the taste i i like i like the smell of the buds and i really think that the actual bowl i mean i think it tasted quite similar to that of the actual flower i'll smoke the rest of it that we have here in a little joint and i'll let you guys know if that experience changes and so be sure to read the description on youtube but for now i think the final score that i'm at on this is going to be a 9.25 we're at 30.7 on the thc um it's potent it's definitely potent i've got a solid body high i'm kind of energized i'm also not sober in the head anymore it definitely kind of has an intoxifying effect um or intoxicating and toxifying i don't think that's a word so i think that we definitely works because i'm over here creating words and [ __ ] um 9.25 out of 10 is going to be my taste and my final score overall for the product is going to be a 9.4 because it is very potent the flavor is very good um and it's a gelato and so it's smoked it tastes smells it's so i still have the stickiness on my fingers like this is very impressive big shout out to sherbinski's let me know what you guys think if you guys have tried other gelatos or this jello gelato please be sure to drop a comment let us know about your experience so you can help some other people and of course be sure to like follow and subscribe to respect my region on all social medias facebook instagram twitter tick tock pinterest

structure of this - it's like black it's just nice it's just it's different you know and like always everybody we're using the regular select universal battery but yeah that's the logo right here we got some Eden Oh one thing about this - that I do like about this brand is that they have this brand hold on Cheers hmm tastes just like it bro tastes just like jacker and his/her area shout out man shout outs of eating bro this is my first time ever trying this brand whoa that cough came kind of late whoo my first hit Tom wants his brand-new Club this cannabis club and they have freaking like sauce diamond cards dude oh dude let me [ __ ] I want to search that [ __ ] up but I want to see a thing is instead of searching it up I'm gonna just have to reveal it but some guy was like the bud center I was like oh so out of all these brands are here man which shouldn't like do you recommend what should you like he's like this is a new one you know he's like a lot of people like that raw garden cart so I'll select cards sneezies they got the pax pax is a little bit different I think that's that's a little bit different they got some one will caught a battery or something they calm darts the darts or something like that something like that and he told me that this is like the necks of up-and-coming brand and I'm like okay you know what I gotta test this [ __ ] out you know first of all let's do that quick little test yup stuck no one oh [ __ ] so you know we're not smoking a hot dog water cuz we smoke that [ __ ] once the one like oh oh the state just like decorate honestly it really just tastes just exactly like the [ __ ] like distrain to be honest with you guys like so little piney some five sativa 81.4 six percent THC so we're getting to the low where the low 80s right here so it's just cool you know it's a nice little wake and bake I did actually smoke a little bit earlier this new dish with the foot I did actually wake them back using this and I got a man the high is not too strong you know it's not like crazy you're not crazy lit you're feeling it but you know you're definitely so it's cool you know especially like for like morning jobs and sure you don't want to get too baked but you want to kind of get baked just to kind of like you know go on with the morning you know does that make sense it doesn't matter because I don't I don't make sense you know but you know cuz like against like rock garden real raw garden is a cartridge that you're gonna get [ __ ] baked but like I'll take like two three roots of that [ __ ] and I'm at all cloud ten there's some [ __ ] cloud 22 have you guys ever known as I hit this is it like a blast I'll grab the shell be that she kind of packs a punch the taste tillow piney little bit you know little piney come out with like a lot of new cartridges and stuff like that and I to be honest with you guys and I'm gonna be real with you guys man I don't think cartridges are healthy for you whatsoever I mean if you think about it hers has you know some flour that shit's been around for a minute and wax and all that shit's been around for like would they see like 3040 years or some [ __ ] you know like 40 years I think so it's like with all this new [ __ ] coming out and all these like chemicals are sick of man I you know what this is 100% cannabis you know it's 100% but sometimes when you guys buy certain brands I mean these are cool these are cool these are all like you know I think they're they're they're FDA approved you know they're like they're legal you know 100% legal it's been tested all that [ __ ] so I can't do like no crazy arm obviously smoking wax can cause like can cause harm over time you know I can [ __ ] damage your lungs all that smoke no matter if it's bait cigarettes whatever smoke [ __ ] I suppose being your life mashup fuk so but as I was saying like I feel like a lot of there's probably a lot of companies [ __ ] [ __ ] there's a lot of companies out there a lot of wax cartridge companies right we're gonna sell you some fire [ __ ] you're gonna be smoking that [ __ ] but little do we know man that has some type of chemical that could cause cancer like 30 40 years down the line yo and that's what a lot of people are saying to like when you guys are smoking try not to like over smoke trying to get all crazy with them because again these cards bro we're smoking them these cards came out I was even [ __ ] high school Bravo's out of high school these [ __ ] came out I first came I first got my first card back in like 2016 honestly like in 2016 and I'm just like damn it's only been out for like five under like six who knows how many years let me know in the comments down below like what year was the first year you guys got your first cartridge but I was like oh it was 2016 I got my first brass knuckles you know I got it off a plug - so a little did I know spice smoking some fake-ass [ __ ] you know who [ __ ] knows I've never seen a cartridge none of mine but besides the one that I reviewed on this channel - super Lemon Haze that fake art besides that one other than that you know I've never had a cart that it was like watery inside all the carts I've ever had in my entire life always had you know it was always thing but again you never know so it's just like I think about it somebody that smokes cards I can tell you guys a story right now man the time I apply some fake cards I don't even know it one time I bought six cards right cuz it was like a deal was like a hundred and something for like six like six cards right so I'm like [ __ ] it right let's put my plug again this was like two or three years ago for my playground like lucky I bought six cards dude's albums [ __ ] it was the first time to where I was like walking in my house and [ __ ] and I was just puffing on the shamino was all my [ __ ] but you know and you know when when I had the family [ __ ] I'd be in my room just puffing on that [ __ ] you know gaming watching the movie getting [ __ ] baked in my room and I was like bruh it's just sick I don't stink I don't go I don't lose I don't gotta go out of my way shit's a row sum up you know and [ __ ] go song something stink you know era like [ __ ] this shagging I could just get kicked back slap charge my charge my battery put this [ __ ] on take it [ __ ] bag Jesus whoo anyways I suppose six cards and under like like a week and a half or likes imagine that six cards for us like a [ __ ] full last gram for like two days smoking but I would wake up in the middle of the night coughing I would cough cough all the time especially when I would I would wake up in the middle of the night in my throat would be so itchy I had to take off medicine and I would always cough all the time bro all the time and I was like look bud and I stopped smoking Carson are like you know that bro mm-hmm to be honest with each other I think I was smoking them fake cards all right but uh bless my health right bless my lungs and I was like [ __ ] dude but anyways like stuff like that right I'm thinking about that there's still [ __ ] little fake cards being sold out to like a bunch of like high schoolers and [ __ ] like that like people who shouldn't even be smoking in the first place it has like it's batch number and all the shit's like it's manufactured the company their license you know it's just snatched and it's just all natural you know it's like natural cannabis you know and it even talks about here so what's the company has a license and all that [ __ ] then you should be pretty [ __ ] good you know you got a as our license you know but a [ __ ] man has a lot of warnings out here man I would just say my advice is try not to smoke a [ __ ] load of cards you know limit your self to like two three quarts [ __ ] a month you know what I try to do is I try to limit myself to like I would say maybe like a half gram cart this is me halftime cart like every like 12 to 14 days so like a week we can have two like two weeks you know around there you know that's what I would say I'd give it maybe like two weeks sometimes if I if I another notice when I caught carts I caught maybe like three a month to be honest with you guys and they're not even four grams you know this month I would say let's see what did I review I've reviewed probably one 1/2 gram of select 1/2 gram of bra garden and then a full gram of all pounding this thoughts about like teen Rams and a half you know I'm not bad I guess [ __ ] I'm telling you guys man I know hello people that bro no [ __ ] kill a [ __ ] half Grammy today and I'm like although [ __ ] me eyes imagine you know so that I'll be here bro and I'm puffing a [ __ ] Sasuke I just can't take big hits bro my the way my body to my lungs whatever the [ __ ] the way something going on whatever is inside my body man like I don't know if you guys know this about I washes when you guys watch these videos I do not take the fattest drags ever like I take little tiny kick back drags um cuz if I'll take fat drags man I'm [ __ ] dying like I'll take a couple minutes for me to like recovery shake you know song like look you know but honestly how I you know how I see it is I do I'm taking just normal-sized hits bro my tolerance will not go super high cuz again I got other friends man and they take fat ribs and they're like bro my tolerance is so high they gotta take like [ __ ] point for size dad's and I'm like damn bro you you literally could [ __ ] kill the whole Grammy like four or five dads you know for them it's just like whatever and I'm like but anyways everybody again I hope you guys are enjoying these videos man these are all just reviews you know there's literally just educational videos like I'm not not convincing anybody to go smoke or anything like that this is just for people that already smoke cannabis users you know cannabis patients just for the knowledge you know just a relaxing perfect high you know I mean I hit this [ __ ] by like seven eight nine times already and I'm [ __ ] bait you know but one thing I do gotta give it to you guys man is I like your guys as a design man this even design is dope I like it like it doesn't even feel cheap it doesn't at all like the car is a little the carts pretty heavy now Cano I mean all carts are heavy but this car just feels like I just like the material of it you know and I feel like you could screw this off you could refill it you know I think you can do all that [ __ ] and eat and I think Eden's new to let's see if it has three that it's next to the company name no it doesn't show it apply online but I'm Way too [ __ ] lazy to get my phone you know so Eden so far you guys is regular cards okay I enjoy them especially this one and right now I feel like I feel creative you know I feel like I could go on my computer in shock I start getting down I start writing down ideas I start editing videos cuz again I do have a main channel go down to my description it's called I'm crunchy one we're at 120 one case ups or 120 cases around there you know um but the next step is gonna be your guys as you guys is diamonds cartridge second it's a soft diamond there's something like that but I saw up close and I was like oh [ __ ] this looks like some sauce divers it filled with diamonds little tiny diamonds and just like sauce no Mike I think this is some sauce to this is something I was just like [ __ ] here we have it everybody eatin fire I'll show you guys I'll for sure get the Diamonds cartridge because that's gonna be like the first honestly that's like the only cartridge I've ever seen that has diamonds inside I'm like oh [ __ ] are you gonna be able to smoke this but you do need to buy a eating battery that comes with it you can't be using I guess the ordinary you got to use the battery that they give you see that means you gotta buy that [ __ ] so I'm like okay I'm down I'm down you know depending on like this one and I like this one this one's far you know it doesn't get you like extremely [ __ ] like oh my god I can't function high but it gives you like the [ __ ] right high like it's just as cool as to this fire I like it looking everybody we do not condone the usage of these products I'm Marti warning you guys and shit's not healthy for you even though you know it is it is approved you know it is government approved and all that [ __ ] but I do not condone the usage and I'm not promoting any sales or I don't even sell anything on this channel it's literally just a personal review and a review that could be used just for an educational purpose you know this for someone else you know for like a cannabis patient a patient a new let's you can see like a new cannabis patient they don't really know much about cannabis and they don't really like smoking smoking but they do like baby you know there's like you know what it's [ __ ] crazy man it blows my mind how there's so many people there's another like a good there's another group of people that are older they're like you know London late thirties in [ __ ] and one time like it's like kind of I got a family party right family friends all that [ __ ] right and one time I was just like we're just drinking whatever again everybody this is all an educational you know we're [ __ ] we're inside we're in the backyard you know cousin's backyard I take out a pen and I'm puffing on actually I'm like and I started coughing like I'm like I had a heavy hitter I think yeah I was like a heavy hitter right and I was like dude I'm like oh I'm [ __ ] I'm like damn so lately my cousin hit it again he's older than me he was like at the time he was like 26 and I was like 21 or some [ __ ] yes I said he starts coughing and one of our uncles like he's hella cool whatever you know he's cause dude he comes through he's like smoking his cigarette and he's like he's like what is that and I'm like oh this is a he's like he's like is that babe and we're like nice it's teach it's pretty much teach THC vape 16 C babe what the [ __ ] Hey they have [ __ ] like that and he's old school you know so I'm just like am I like Dan you never had this sheen there he does you know that he's like yeah and that we're like ganna try this [ __ ] out and he takes some red Bull he takes a rip oh [ __ ] [ __ ] man but think about it this was a Stoke head this guy loves stones anyway he's like this will [ __ ] um he rips that [ __ ] right he [ __ ] starts coughing all that she's like - his spies I would you get that she's I just go to the club you know go to the campus club he's like oh she's like I just and they're like oh we just like looked out of mass and [ __ ] were telling the Machine run and what's the crazy part about it is that now when he has like little get-togethers or some [ __ ] you see this fool with the [ __ ] battery like he doesn't really suck cigarettes anymore I'm like oh my head I'm like down we could have potentially like saved his [ __ ] life that day literally for him like this would like see his [ __ ] body because he says that you could smoke these anywhere and you get like a head high and my head I'm like oh my and I had were like no that's you're literally just high you know he said well it feels like it feels like you know I've smoked a cigarette but it's like the beginning the beginning feeling of the cigarette which is the head high he's got but I feel like that for like two hours and in my head when I tell you know he's sick he's like fallings an animal you know we're like we're like down but technically shoes go from smoking cigarettes every day to smoking this [ __ ] and he doesn't in any sense doesn't really buy a lot he says he only smokes maybe like like three or four of the big ones at a month big ones so it's like a gram you know he smokes like three four grams I'm like you know what back there needs to smoke like two three cigarettes a day so I'm like you know what that's cool I mean [ __ ] it's still unhealthy as [ __ ] this [ __ ] but hey you know what better than smoking tobacco right it sounds like damn dude we could probably we just [ __ ] expanded his life his [ __ ] life right there dude like who could've who knows [ __ ] crazy man 20 30 years from now bro he could have had lungs all [ __ ] up brooch and but then again you know 20 40 years from now bro [ __ ] knows what kind of what what what the what the wax would do to us I say you know I'm just I'm just trying to speak the truth you know it's like who knows you know in reality like getting it go good or could go bad you know hopefully it goes good you know cuz this is all tested and all that [ __ ] but hey sometimes man some companies bro the labels you just can't but then again if you buy it at a

because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "U3ZldGnlGvw": "what is going on guys it's your boy 7g back at it again with another review for us so for today's review guys we're just gonna hop straight into it man we know we haven't done a review and so long I've been kind of trying to like you know since its first of all it's the end of the year so there's not really too many other cartridges to try out and plus I am if you guys didn't know trying to evolve my content I'm not only doing cartridge reviews anymore because I kind of want it I want to do more you know I want to do more stuff so that's why I've been expanding so I've been doing a lot more collabs and more hablok sessions a lot of [ __ ] that normally wouldn't you do right but I do miss those reviews man I do definitely miss doing reviews because I don't know I feel like since that's my thing that's my thing there's there's so many people out there that tell me what like you're you're the originator of the car reviews brother like I've been watching you you're the first one to with your car because I was like I mean I didn't say the people said it man I'm kind of happy you know that people kind of know me for that because you know that's that is where I started technically some reviewing cartridges and I'm kind of I'm so happy that you know I built I built this platform from literally just reviewing cartridges but like this thing is pretty amazing he's pretty amazing so it's getting straight into the room you guys today we got a special call I have a special collab man I've been waiting to review this for the channel for so long and if I was able to go out and comp a couple of these because these are not easy to find man these are not easy to find anywhere if you're in California if you're over the age of 18 or 21 whatever it is in your legal state and you just have this make sure you guys try it man because honestly it's pretty crazy so happening - they're so friendly farms cool friendly farms X alien lab - Cola this is the area 41 hybrid and then I've I've already achieved if you guys haven't watched my top 5 cards of 2019 that video is up in that video will be down in the description below but yeah like I said I cut I copped a couple of these and I already like I literally just started chipping around this this is by far one of my favorite cartoons you know just because the taste is phenomenal everything about this cartoon is phenomenal and all right so like I said I'm gonna slap it on here when you guys get it you guys are gonna get the black tip with a little alien engraving in it and full spectrum you already know the oils gonna be a little bit darker no need to worry though full spectrum if you guys don't already know what it is pretty much you're getting every single spectrum of the cannabis plant from the taste to the feel to every pretty much everything row all inside of a pen so that's pretty amazing so I know a lot of you like to see the packaging and stuff so let me go ahead and give you guys a little closer the close-up look honestly dude friendly farms is doing some sick-ass things with with their packaging because mostly all their packaging looks like this but this alien labs co-op specifically is pretty damn sick dude I'm not gonna lie this alien labs co-op box is pretty unique dude honestly in in terms of artwork it's pretty sick it's pretty sick alright now that you guys saw the close-up of that man let's get to chief and boys I'm pretty much in this review we're gonna be media as the full taste test with a full body effects high head effects all that stuff what I like about it what I don't like about it what I wish they would have done all that good stuff you guys already know how we get down with the review guys so I'm excited man I'm excited like honestly this is this is so this is a whole different type of cartridge like honestly the taste in this is such unexplicable like insane it's insane like I've never tasted anything like this so give me you guys the full rundown on this review so area 41 alien labs ex-friend firms let's get it cheers guys and by the way if you guys do end up copying the proprietary battery from the feliforms I do recommend using a green setting anything higher than that which is I believe like the orange setting it's too hot it's too hot you're burning it too much you're wasting your oil it's always good to get such a little a little lower temp but obviously you're still going to get the clock so cheers guys if you guys are over the age of 18 21 whatever it is in your legal state I don't want any little underage kids in our that stuff in here you know we can't even enjoy it so choose [Music] so tasty bro all right so that my battery literally just died after that second hit back with that first hit so if you guys didn't see too much of clouds it was because that my the battery is dead so when also that brings up to another topic if when you use it as battery I do recommend charging all the way because it makes such a difference man that hits our way Milky Way flatter when it's fully charged compared to when it's obviously low and low and battery so let's go ahead and test hopefully this is fully charged simple choosers you could definitely tell when it's fully charged man the hit is just so much more strong I dude I'm telling you alright if I had it compared I know I said that the taste is not it's very very distinct you know I can't really compare it to anything but if I had to compare to something it has to be fall under like the lines of the cannabis drive terpenes from Suzy like those pods are so Turkey and so flavorful and when you hit them they're just so gassy and you honestly only taste like the straight-up but dude you just just trade it like straight bud no no preservatives no additives into that [ __ ] whoo shout to hydro hydro flaps if he has her oh geez on the challenge guys know I've been having this thing since day one right so uh for that first first two second initial hit you know right off the bat I feel my eyes getting heavy and that's that that has a lot to say dude because those two hits were very very very small in terms of the vapor products that you know yeah so for it to have that much packing so it's such a little hit it's pretty crazy so and the taste like I said super gassy super Turkey you don't taste no oil as it doesn't taste boilie and all I can like dis lids they usually do and it's something that you want to keep on hitting honestly and something's just so distinct that you're like hmm well you just want to keep tasting it because you've never tasted it before so cheers guys let's go in for another hit and then right away you want to enter your lungs they're like the longest benches instant dude it instantly guy I want to coughing so and on that exhale I'm getting like a little like some undertones of you know how like when you take like a pretty wanna temp tab you get those little it's taste like Turkey dude it tastes like turkey warm Turks in there you know and it just like fills up and lingers in your mouth and it's like cow like like like if you just baked some lie president you feel me like not not not cooked it bake it it you know when you bake something you get that aroma you get that full flavor taste that's kind of like what like you know baking out here boys I know I don't know if that makes any sense but you know making up new terms every day so when you go in on another one man because this thing is phenomenal I can't get off of it so even what I know I said let's not go to higher setting but I just want to see I just want to see how it compares on this cartridge so choose oh yeah that is what that is definitely way too hot like it tastes a little bit more burn so than anything not even burnt but a little bit too hot in my opinion like a hot attempt ugh I like those little lower temp ones and honestly man I know I keep saying dab and this is a pimp but this pen literally makes you feel like you're taking a DAB and the funny thing is I've tasted their full spectrum salt and it's literally it tastes exactly similarly super super similar like this taste that this taste that friendly firm produces is very very unlike be replicable and like it's kind of like like just just straight-up fire dude I don't know how to explain it like the taste like I keep trying to like bring out what the what the pinpoint tastes this but I just can't I just can't mmm so like I said the hi man I'm definitely feeling it more drawn my head than I am my body and then again it we've only been pinning in for like five to seven minutes so I'm pretty sure the longer I wait the more I'll feel their effects and it's a good smoke man it's a good smoke definitely you know and something's so exotic this isn't something gonna be picking up on the regular man definitely not getting picking up gonna be picking this up on a regular bed because the price there the price range is a little bit more up there you feel me compared to other cartridges that's why a lot of people don't really mess with with filming phones because they go into the shot they see the prices and then they're like the bounce I'll go to rock garden whatever whatever the lower end price is you know so but if you guys are in the market you know got a little bit extra money that you know is there the Christmas and maybe you guys got some extra Christmas money and you guys are in the looks for new cartridge alien laps X from the forums definitely check them out so we're gonna end this review out here guys I know it's it feels a little bit different reviewing this time I don't know what it is I just maybe I'm falling out of the reviews you know I feel like a lot of people have been coming out of cartridges so there's not there hasn't really been a lot of search for a new cartridge reason I feel like the time that I got into it was perfect because I was when cartridges were popping you know I got my I got my people and I got my viewers locked down you know things like that I think it's time to now progress on to the next thing which is you know going out session event doing big big whole lives with bigger people mr. TC you has seen that collab with Edwin sparks you guys having go ahead and go check that I'll put that description below and you know which is we're just working man we're just working we're just we're still trying to find ourselves in this little wee tube thing because I wanna say this is still as a hobby I'm not taking this thing too serious and I don't plan on taking it too serious because honestly I have bigger things to myself and then just only YouTube if you me I got way big things I hope hopefully you guys get to see those things I'm pretty sure I'm gonna be able to bring them to YouTube soon enough and see ya guys well we're gonna have that video here if you guys enjoyed it go ahead and leave a like comment support let's try to reach 500 likes of yours Kim and they'll be amazing so we'll catch you guys later you do", "7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't already um this channel is not all about reviews i mean we're going to be hanging out too so i have a lot of stuff in store for this channel and yeah i appreciate you guys now i will recommend this cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "SLihlyzlkHE": "hey guys new cat discount vape pen and today we're gonna help you answer the question what is the best voltage for my cartridge [Music] alright guys so here we have two different kinds of batteries for you as well as two different kind of cartridges to kind of meet up a couple different scenarios and you could kind of just get a good idea for yourself what might be best for you to hit your cartridge at so I think the more important part of this is actually gonna be the batteries um so you can see here we have a spinner type battery and for those of you who aren't sure what that means is if you look here you have a little dial with varying numbers um so you can see start at 3.3 volts that's that's your power selection and you see what I did there how I could spin this little dial on the bottom you could increase the power up to different settings or come down so as you see I'm scrolling up to 3.8 this would be 3.9 ok 4 and so on so you could just keep increasing it decreasing it and go into different settings in between pretty much exactly what you want to do make it very customizable the alternative method would be a battery like this which doesn't at first look like it has any adjustments but what these are is gonna be a click style adjuster so we turn it on which is already on you can see that the color is green that's gonna signify a set voltage if we do three clicks just see the color flash and now that's an it's next setting so you have three three three presets of voltage increase all right so now just more - talking to that Oh like we just saw this guy is gonna have your three presets where you know you can scroll between three point four three point seven and four which is nice to be able to adjust but again with this spinner battery we can we can really change the dial and do the in-betweens of those settings so it's a whole lot more customizable and if you really want to pinpoint on exactly where you want to be this is gonna be your way to do it you know here you can see three point three and three point you know look that would be like consider to jump but here we can go in between I really do what we want if we want to settle it down or turn it up a little in between those presets of this guy that's what's great about the spinner batteries now how that's gonna affect your cartridges as you can see we have two different cards is here this is gonna be a ceramic type cartridge and you can see the heating element with with the way the wick holes are versus this guy which is gonna be one of your more old-school wick cartridges now the ceramic is gonna be able to take more power these are gonna be better at higher voltages the very low force is where you're gonna want to cap these out at so like you know four point two really should be the highest you're gonna consider going with these there are a few out there on the market that'll need more and at that point I would say just keep it at four point two and then if you feel like you need a bump turn it up just ever so slightly you know possibly with a spinner battery cuz that's gonna be your best way to do that and just come up and don't be afraid you know but also you know don't go too high can't start and then we have the alternative which would be your your cotton wick cartridges these guys aren't gonna be so good on keeping a higher power setting you're really gonna want to try to stick to around 3.6 3.7 3.8 I wouldn't I really wouldn't want most of these into the pores I have seen one or two in the past that have needed a little bit higher of a power setting but it's very rare so yeah just to kind of realize your bit your best way is gonna be keep it low see how it feels take a solid hit and then if you feel like you need a little more turn it up ever so slightly whichever way you may be doing that whether it's with your spinner battery which would be a little more I'm coming up in the small lengths or you can do it with your click button adjuster which that guy is gonna bring you to the next preset hopefully that next preset is gonna be in them after that close up hopefully you have a better idea of what the proper voltage to hit your 510 cartridge job would be um like we said it's really gonna depend more so on the battery um if you have one of the ones that has an adjustable adjustable slider on it like a spinner type battery it's better for finding exactly where you want to be because you'd go into the in-betweens that a 3 click wouldn't provide you so for example like we said this guy you click 3 times and it goes into one setting and the next setting in the next which is great because you can kind of take high medium low depending on what kind of cartridge you have but if you have a spinner battery it's really gonna allow you that freedom to go in between all those different sights you really find the perfect setting for your specific cartridge now the cartridge also does matter to like you know if you have ceramic which is going to be you know you can tell that it's ceramic if you look at it to see little Whipple's in the bottom that can be hit at a higher setting those are okay the low fours you know three point eight four four point two those are all going to be okay for most of the ceramic type cartridges if you have a conduit cartridge like this guy where you can see cotton exposed to through the center that's going to be on the lower head where you're at you know 3.6 3.8 maybe 3.9 again different company different cartridges by different companies they're gonna have the power requirements so there's a little bit of play play wiggle room on you kind of just figuring out based on what you have but either way these batteries will also provide you with the perfect hit depending on you know what setting you want to keep it at that's the partisan brand other than that I mean you just kind of use a little bit of common sense - depending on if they hit feels like it's enough you know that that's it you don't need to go any higher try to keep it as low as you can know what that being said that should really give you all the employee to know about that if you like the new these products they're

"PTlwxjeW9u8": "what's up in the following video i'm going to be reviewing two delta 8 thc vape carts by the company arita hemp so this is my first time trying any delta 8 at all so i'm excited to see what happens let's check it out and this is the official unboxing so here we have a cool postcard here special note it's pretty cool what else we got in here this is the sticker notice to law enforcement customs and all regulatory authorities i'm not going to be taking this any crazy places so i don't really have to worry about that you have the research lab of this specific strain and all the data here so maybe i'll probably check that out in more depth later the piso resistance however you say it i'm not french oh nice durbin poison kush i didn't order this i just guess they threw that in there which was awesome smells like bud to me so what i got here were these two limitless cartridges og kush and blue dream so i'm gonna switch up camera angles here in a moment i have both of these sitting upright just so the oil settles in i'm going to do that for let that happen for about 30 minutes i believe o.g kush is the indica and the blue dream is the sativa so i will be back in a bit to try those out and let you know what i think this is kind of funny not really since this is a review video but i put the cartridge on and i realized i said both of them next to each other so i don't know which one's which i have no idea what i am vaping right now it's either og kush or blue dream so it's either an indica or a sativa but whatever i just took one hit i just got this pen so i was making sure i was preheating it properly so tastes good i've never been one to uh you know care so much about the taste just really the effects but give me a second here [Music] you know i always do that i was under always underestimate with these pens here but initial thoughts um i'd say similar to my experience with like you know cbd hemp flour at least right now i'm going to do a separate video on that that's a product that i tried in the past say a month or so ago and i want to give a breakdown on that but anyway as i'm talking i definitely feel like i'm a lot more you know kind of like getting in my head a little bit almost like that feeling of you know if you had uh number nine it's kind of calming down so it's that little kind of initial oomph and then just kind of oh nothing else is really happening but i know this is much different because this is not just you know cbd hemp bud or whatever i never had the delta eight before but i'm definitely feeling that nice you know calm effect really [Music] hmm [Music] well i do like this for sure my plan was i haven't eaten dinner yet i'm gonna walk to the store so i'm feeling good still just like a little bit more of i'd say more of an intense feeling than the uh just like you know cbd bud so it's interesting i'm interested to see what it will feel like if this feeling will continue to kind of build and it's just uh pretty much an a stronger effect as the feeling i described before i'm not feeling like i'm just completely baked or anything like that i mean i know that's not gonna happen with this stuff anyway but just based on the amount because i know there's a lot of people have said that you know if they don't have a certain tolerance to it they aren't used to aren't used to this specifically this delta eight it you know it could be a bit different until you build up a tolerance versus you know how many hits or drags or whatever you would uh take on it and yeah i guess i've noticed that that you know that voice always going on your head not in a you know schizophrenic sense but you know just that constant voice of you know saying anxiety whether it be i'm not really experiencing any anxiety you know before or after i was or not after i don't even know yet but before i film this you know i haven't you know had any you know say bad anxiety today or anything like that really to speak of in the first place but it's one of those things where now even though i was going to cut this video off but i feel much more i'd say much more aware and in the sense that you know we're always we can always be this aware in the sense where i feel very present because it's a matter of being able to let go and detach from that voice that's going on as far as you know even the anxious voice or whatever however kind of plays out in your head whether it be the voice or just that big jumble of scenarios and images and everything that's like uh like a very low tv volume in the background that's always going and sometimes it's pleasant sometimes it's not so pleasant but that has calmed down drastically and it's almost like when certain as i'm speaking right now as when certain thoughts or things would come up that would allow you to just kind of go on this thought track whether it be good or bad i can almost sense them in a way of kind of rising up but then i don't attach to them and that's a really nice feeling so hope that makes sense it's uh i feel like it will to a lot of people but that's just my initial thoughts on it now i don't know what's going to you know be the case say an hour from now two hours from now but i'm going to as i said a little bit ago walk to the store just grab some food come back make some dinner and just go about my evening and then see what happens all right it is about two hours later and i think that was the blue dream i mean if i were to take a guess it's going to be cool to tomorrow try the other try the same time same circumstances and see so i can actually see a difference because i literally don't know which one was which but overall absolutely fantastic it's one of those odd things that happens to me like as i'm say walking to the store or for the past you know hour or so i was i tend to do this when i you know smoke or whatever and you know whether even with uh the hemp bud but you know i was getting way out there and in a good way just like thinking about like these different goals and nature of like reality in my life and perception and how all these things are tied together i watched a lot of actualized.org leo stuff so if anyone else watches this stuff then you probably you know know what i'm getting at and that you know you probably vibe with what i'm saying in some way shape or form with that but the other than that you know feeling great it was that very just nice positive mood type feeling and then also not in a not in a fake way just a very real just you know positive mood but yeah so overall a thousand percent i would recommend trying this out i think it's fantastic you know while this stuff is great it's not something i would suggest doing every single day or anything like that and i'm gonna you know make sure i try to not do that at least to that higher extent because as with anything i feel like we'll all build up even just a mental dependency to something but that's my take on it right now because that's been my take on that with certain things in the past so that's my overall experience a thousand percent i would check it out for yourself if you're interested at all this is my first time with using any you know anything with delta eight in it and i think it's fantastic so i will be back for day number two when i try the other one whichever it is the og kush or the blue dream leave me any comments below if you've tried this stuff before if you thought about it whatever the hell you want to say subscribe for all that fun stuff you know hopefully this will kind of get me going in the groove of like oh yeah maybe i kind of want to post videos and do more videos more frequently in this realm and i'm going to shoot this next one tomorrow and compare the whatever it was to the whatever it was so yeah see in the next video thanks for watching", "mDgypPehDRQ": "getting ready for summer man we're getting ready for summer there's gonna be a hot [ __ ] summer so you know

for the CCC 4:20 and my name is Nick this episode we're going to be looking at a pretty rare strain that's actually a great example of some Bay Area genetics or San Francisco genetics this is the acai by sher bin ski for15 and I'm really excited to be smoking on this up or vaping on this stuff actually it's super super tasty super exotic and before we get into their view let's take a nice draw from the vape speaking taste flavor and get medicated cheers guys hmm that first draw is always so incredibly tasty but yeah this is the oxide yeast by Stravinsky and sure Pinsky is part of a group of breeders called the cookie fam who are based in San Francisco and they've developed strains that are really famous now such as the Girl Scout cookies sherbert gelato they're just mastermind breeders who really really are producing some incredible terpene profiles and strong strains as well so this the acai I'm not too sure of the genetics but it is definitely a challenge there's a few other gelato variants out there mochi a few other phenotypes of gelato but I'm not too sure the genetics of this stuff but it's definitely housed job 2 and look e to it and a lot of the gelato aroma as well but let's get into the smell of this stuff because this stuff smells quite fire it definitely has a strong in the background there's a very strong gelato nuttiness I'm a few smelled gelato it's that creamy creamy ice cream nut aroma and that's definitely in the background but your nose gets hit by this strong when I first mount another jar it almost smelled like a a jack pine enos but after you smell it more and more it's so much more of a tropical really I don't know if you smelled like an acai juice from the acai berry but it really is true to that I eat sort of a sweet blueberry sort of flavor but a little bit of a variant to that almost like a strawberry blueberry it really has a crazy aroma definitely backed with that gelato fuelly creaminess but it's just this tropical guava like I say yeast that just comes totally through and it really is an exotic twist on the gelato aroma and when broken down oh I just screams like a loud skunky fruit aroma really that sweet acai smell oh my god it smells so so dank there really is that few leanness in the background from the cookies and the gelato such an intoxicating aroma in such a tropical twist on the cookies aroma really but this stuff just smells awesome it's definitely a 10 out of 10 it's just super loud and that minty hue Lee acai aroma is so so dank and powerful Wow let's take another trip here of the bait to get nice and medicated cheers guys mmm and now let's dig into the flavor there that is nice especially on this vape again Wow really comes through definitely got that gelato cream in the background that fuelie cream it's definitely present in the background but you taste that sweet sweet tropical mist that just hit your tongue and sits on it and definitely a really an exotic flavor strong notes of minty feeling estefy in the background you know totally taken over by this sweet sweet tropical and pungent oxide flavor that completely coats your mouth and sits there for a while definitely a strong flavor and a really really tasty one as well but let's take one more ripping of the bait guys Cheers oh wow these rips are getting me medicated and they're tasting amazing but let's uh let's take a look at this bud because it really is some pretty cannabis definitely has a very unique look that you can see where you know it has the cookie gelato background but it really does have unique color and nug structure as well I mean to start it off it has a very distinct purple hue throughout the cannabis that you know many of the Kansas's are this strong purple hue and it's really an interesting spectrum because the tips are more of that blue cookie purple where'd you get inner more in ons inside the bud and it's definitely more of that you know true GDP purple color the nubs are incredibly dense they definitely take from that sherbert gelato density some of the densest you know cannabis there is the pistols are pretty true orange a little on the copper side and the nut structure is definitely similar to gelato you know and it's a it's a mix between gelato I'm sure we're very very tight nuts but there definitely are some cases for treating out and making you know a more more bulky nug but when you break this stuff open I mean the color is just amazing like I said completely some characters are just completely purple really has sort of that sherbert inner look where it's just with that ruby innards of the the nug and this canvas it definite looks like it's been handled a little bit but still the trifling coverage is pretty good very small trichomes you know trichome stops and trichome heads but it has pretty decent coverage throughout similar to no cookies or sherbert for sure I probably have to get a nine and a half out of ten even a ten out of ten it was just handled you know a little roughly so some of the trichomes were definitely flaked off but otherwise the color like I said everything looks pretty nice for sure let's take one more rip here the SAE so we can assess the effects cheers guys mmm really silky smooth vapor and Wow I think I don't know I think that was for grips but I am just super medicated now really strong effects for sure it's definitely a strong indigent hybrid it really really relaxes you each hit just as another level of potency this stuff really really packs high TC and it provides just a very very relaxing effect definitely sedate of definitely drops your eyes a lot and will definitely make you go into a cush nap if you ingest too much but definitely some powerful indica dominant cannabis really really relaxing really strong effects that match up to the gelato you know gelato and sherbert I think are probably the strongest strains I've ever tried and this cannabis is right up there with them I would recommend this stuff for just you know evening use later in the day night use definitely just when you want to relax chill out nothing to do and just feel really good great pain relief throughout the body and just great you know relaxation in your mind as well well I'm really stoked to be vaping on this SAE or just enjoying it it really is some quality cannabis I love anything that's growing by strabinsky or the cookie fam they really just do their cannabis excellent though they're amazing breeders and this acai is just another example of their incredible work but I hope you guys enjoyed this video of via a review of the acai I really love this stuff as you guys can tell I probably have to give it a 10 out of 10 again you know I mean there's nothing really wrong with this cannabis that I can see it's just really exotic amazing genetics amazing growing amazing flavor effect and it smelt so 10 out of 10 for sure but please stay tuned for more content guys I'll definitely be back for more if you like this video please give it a thumbs up and drop any comments or questions in the comments section and thanks for watching guys stay Stoney peace [Music]", "mztVAwkufdc": "was going

of calls coming in with customers who think that their battery is broken when they go to draw on the cartridge it appears the battery's working but they're not getting a vapor from the cartridge generally when this happens it tends to be the connection plate so what I have here is one of our push-button 510 thread batteries if you look down in between the threads with the cartridge off in the middle you see the circular connection plate so what happens is that generally gets pushed down when either a you screw the cartridge on too tight or be when you go to screw the battery on to the charger and screw that on too tight so a very simple fix what we often tell people to use is just a paper clip and if you stick the paper clip in between the connection plate and the threads and you just pry towards the middle it starts to raise that connection plate up be very careful because it comes up extremely easy you don't think of it a lot of pressure what you're gonna do is you're just gonna walk around the battery and bring that whole plate up to about the middle of the threads once you go to put the cartridge back on after this you should have a good connection and your bad we should be working in it thank you guys for choosing o to vape and have a vape filled day", "oHhzsm8OXVE": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy mixed up place you call your local dispensary today we are taking a look at a vape brand that is quite huge and one that has managed to escape our attention

they partner with packs and make um different packs pods uh with their under their legion of balloon bloom line as well we are taking a look at their mendo breath indica 1 gram here today on the back

terrible at that 45 bucks for the one gram uh cartridge uh at a dispensary in long beach which puts it right smack dab in the average cost range for uh uh vapes at this dispensary mendo breath uh is a

cannabis oil the result is a full spectrum experience unmatched in flavor and purity we invite you to join our legion nate let's join so let's go ahead and open this bad boy up uh let me go ahead and mention this packaging really beautiful packaging by the way uh it doesn't look that um crazy opulent either in terms of materials it's just very neat looking i really like the design it's sparkly and gold and i guess i kind of um uh you know um have the uh the sort of uh brain attention of a bird and like the shiny sparkly things gets my attention like this does uh i want to build a nest out of this legion of bloom cartridge packaging so we've pulled the little tab here let us slide open now is easy not too bad more uh marketing materials there and then in here we have got the thing itself wow okay a lot of materials nice thick plastic there and we're finally to the cartridge itself oh that is some nice looking oil guys yum that that oil actually looks incredible uh very thick looking uh incredibly pure oh i'm excited to give this a try this has got me really amped up uh it's got like the ceramic uh tip with that well it might be some kind of plastic it feels like ceramic um but it is a nice material i've seen a lot of uh the newer cartridges using this either higher quality plastic or some kind of ceramic uh it works a lot better than the cheaper acrylic tips so here we go let's finally give this mendo's breath a try hmm uh oh well my battery was showing that it was drying but i'm not getting anything let me try a different battery i have one here on standby let's give another shot well looks like i've got a bum battery sorry beloved um raw gardens battery you look like you're finally gonna have to join the collection in the sky uh but this battery works fine and this cartridge tastes great i forgot to mention they call this the monarch um with a hundred percent cannabis derived terpenes so this is uh triple refined cannabis oil and then all of the terpenes that are added back in are the terpenes from the mendo breath strain itself um it tastes like mendo breath that i don't know it's a very hard to describe taste almost spiced in a way i like it i like it a lot um and the oil itself is uh appears to taste as good as it looks uh quality wise so smooth um wow man that is quality stuff um yeah that just vaguely spiced taste that uh some mendoz mendo breath strain has this has in spades uh quite high already uh after those couple of hits you saw how smooth it was too i didn't really feel it at all going in um but rather big hits off not very hard draws as well um nice cartridge design seemingly as well from uh legion of bloom or they use a nice cartridge so far so good here oh wow guys i i i mean i barely feel it going in uh certainly feel it in the head as it's going out uh strong tasty um and just some really quality quality oil um this is a big old thumbs up so far for legion of bloom i can see why they have are a ten times award-winning company good for them uh great tasting not bad uh affordably priced right in the uh average price range at the dispenser i go to so so far this is a big thumbs up for a legion of bloom uh with their mendo's breath strain uh i am really really looking forward to finishing this one off uh as like all of our weeks reviews i'm gonna review the whole cartridge not just these first couple of hits because these things tend to leak they tend to clog they tend to break down all these things can pop up as you guys know so it'll probably take me about five days or so to finish this gram off uh really looking forward to doing that and as soon as i do i will come right back here let you guys know our wrap-up thoughts of this legion of bloom experience but first half so far so good anyways we'll see you guys right back here for part two in just a bit thanks for watching [Music] welcome back to weeds guys it has been about five and a half days since we started our journey with the monarch from legion of bloom their mendo breath strain this one gram 45 cartridge five days later my impressions are just as rapturous as they were before i really really really liked this one i like the quality of the oil like the taste of the strain that sort of spiced nutmeg cinnamony vague taste of uh the mendoz breath here was great um that oil as i said quality top to bottom never got that burnt taste never got that never started to burn that uh or get those big cloudy sort of vapor heavy hits nothing like that um just fantastic quality uh cartridge design worked incredibly well no clogs didn't have to get that like big first draw to get it going just a fantastic uh product really happy uh with the legion of bloom system not sure again why it's called the monarch it's got the mendo breath strain and the name the monarch but we'll forgive them we'll forgive legion of bloom we'll forgive the name the monarch because it's so good big old thumbs up here just as i had hoped and anytime we have a thumbs up this big we like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that you can enjoy that is not necessarily weed related and you don't necessarily need weed to enjoy although this recommendation might want a little weed beforehand because it's going to make that penis all the better that's right we're talking pen 15 on our cherry on top a show that just entered its second season on hulu a phenomenal show hi thank you a phenomenal show that just entered its second season on hbo and by hbo i do mean hulu uh it is a one joke premise it is about two uh 30 something year old women who pretend to be middle schoolers around the era of y2k and they act with a bunch of 12 13 year old kids and say a bunch of foul-mouthed inappropriate things it sounds like it should get boring very quickly but it's actually hysterical and if you are like me in your early to mid 30s you're going to be very very at home in that aesthetic so check out pen 15 or as i prefer to call it penis on hulu and check out legion of bloom the monarch at your local dispensary two things that i enjoy having in my mouth a whole lot well", "Xe392pnkXbA": "what's up guys welcome back to another video it's Michael back again with another guide part review today we are reviewing gko karts yet again and we are using a lot of apart which is a hybrid of course for ping it off the wall same canal a background nice will you kind of darker then the other ones but that's just probably because of the flavouring that they added to it sometimes the flavouring can counteract with [Music] the outers and then he did dry hit I already did before I got it it's a llama Hyjal I've had geladas and things NGOs and other flavours 50 parts yeah with dads the scene sometimes the Durban poisons and the berry lemon I never tried that will be a third video this is preheated nice huh prominent teeth first thing off bet you can definitely teeth the July the difference nice and smooth a little bit of coughing but not as much because it's a hybrid hybrid don't usually cause you to cough but they do good I overall experience before I'm feeling hyah buds coming on sensation do you know I mean it's smelling good originally I wasn't the biggest fan of gelato much because it's a basic flavor it's very good I though more indica based I believe I think then the Kadam in it hybrid by indica dominant I think I really do because it gives you more relaxed chill the Barry lemons was away more sativa wise and the Durbin poisons definitely sativa Shia's pen likes to give me problems right I'm just a pen or if it's a cards but sometimes it doesn't want to hear to going on I would just think I regret more of a hit there which I really did like for example I would hate this which is their poison I will pride you so much yeah maybe my tender oh [ __ ] sorry about that guys um pretty good hi I like it [ __ ] wait yeah the any suggestions on any videos that you would like me to do let me know if you'd want to be in a video let me know - totally down to do a sesh for someone chill listen to some music me and make a video smoke some swish some crazy always totally down so uh peace let me know down in the comments section like what you want it to be called I kind of want to change the YouTube channel name from my name to like something so let me know if anybody watches these what you want it to be called and uh I'll name it whatever you want me to but think of something tough alright peace out and it was good seeing you guys again", "tB8SWgoX-HA": "[Music] hey guys close here with great counter crafts so today what I'm talking about is Delta eight THC so Delta a THC is one of the many cannabinoids found in the plant which there's over a hundred but the well-known the best well-known cannabinoids in the plant are the only two of them that are is THC which is Delta 9 THC tetrahydrocannabinol and CBD which is cannabidiol so THC is gonna give you that big psychoactive effect where what where CBD is gonna be more for inflammation non psychoactive but Delta 8 THC is so this cannabinoid was actually released in 2017 but was known about it since 1975 so Delta ATAC so the differences between Delta H and Delta 9 THC so Delta 9 THC it binds to your receptors so so cb1 receptor and cb2 receptors where Delta 8 th see only mainly binds to to your cb1 receptors so cb1 receptors are mainly in your central nervous system and central nervous system where cb2 receptors are in your immune system your organs throughout your body so what has been what so what what the difference is - with Delta 9 and Delta a THC so Delta 9 is gonna give you that big psychoactive effect and get you high where Delta a THC is gonna help more with anxiety so people that that smoke sometimes they get anxiety when they smoke this will not give you anxiety it'll just get you high but it won't give you that ah Guinness on in your head we're also the m''i THC is found so little in the plants that they actually I has to be done with it has to be through concentrates so you're going to do cartridges or any other concentrates that they do and it's really clear where Delta 9 THC about 25 percent is found in the plant Delta a THC there's only point zero one percent that is found in the plant so that's why they have to do it has to be in concentrates but yeah this is awesome for anybody that that doesn't that sometimes gets hot it gets hot but it gives them paranoia anxiety this is perfect for anybody to do anybody that wants to get uplifted but doesn't want to get that anxiety and I've heard a lot of people that get high and get anxiety so usually it's in cartridges but so I'm one of them that I've seen is about 80% Delta a THC and 5% Delta 9 THC so yeah the biggest difference is that the where it binds in your body and doesn't be it helps with so a Delta a THC it helps with nausea anxiety it said said to be helpful for Alzheimer's I've got this I've been reading about this so it's like I'm not getting it out but I'll put the I'll put the link of the article and down below so you check it out because it's it's a new cannabinoid and it's supposed to be really how go for like medicinal purposes so yeah check it out and we'll see you later Church", "IBB1abU3tBo": "hey what's good everybody jpeg here checking in live respectmyregion.com here with another west coast we tour review today's special guest jazzy reviewing the flav rx or i'm sorry it's no longer a flavor rx just the flav one milliliter premium refined cannabis oil ultra slim disposable and rechargeable i said it disposable and rechargeable all all-in-one oil pod and battery so this is lemon hey sativa convenient yeah this is this is super cool it is basically a disposable pen that is a full gram and it is rechargeable so we are here i'm going to open it up you let them know what the what is the say on the like the strain the the lemon haze okay this classic packaging pretty dope and then we look and dropped it here we're looking at the uh the actual device you can see the color of the oil a little bit is gold outside see if we can get out there and there you go nice little gold paint it's beaut it's a beautiful little vape almost looks like a usb drive nice and slick you know it reminds me of jules it honestly does it just reminds me of jewels so one hit review i'm gonna talk about it two hits four out of ten full review available on respectmyregion.com slave doing it big coming in hot working too hard rip it too hard yeah it doesn't say it doesn't oh it does have ingredients uh it says ultra refined cannabis oil so ultra refined is going to be distillate uh just as terpenes and then it says instructions press your lips against the mouthpiece and begin vaporizing by taking a three second drop oops so too big of a draw there that was probably fine misusing it is a common thing in vapes so here we go so you get a fat rip it's definitely potent you can taste the fruity terpenes tastes botanical does not taste like weed yeah definitely tastes like fruits and whatever else natural terps it's a little harsh it's a little harsh i'm sure it was hard for you because you took a long one yeah um i think someone who likes flavored things would probably like those products it rips i mean manufactured 722 it's going to be good until next year 7 22. i'm high you're high off that first i mean 86.84 total cannabinoids is a potent product in regards to you know thc in the best of the world it's not in the 90s by any means but when you combine some good terpenes um it can really get the job done so yeah it's so light it's very it's very light i i like i like how it feels i like how it hits um i like how it's branded i like the flavor there on both sides i think it's super dope it's a little slick for me i would like it to be a little bit more coarse and it does light up here in green when you do hit it on the second hit it's still pretty harsh for botanical terpenes and a disposable vape i think yeah it's definitely harsh look at the quality product would i recommend it not to anybody that wants live resumes or someone that wants the best of the best i think this is great for someone who's on the go very discreet maybe a cbd distillate vapor someone who is really looking for that super lemon haze like if super lemon haze is your favorite this tastes really good doesn't taste like real weed but it does taste really good so i'd say it's worth checking out score out of 10 though a flat eight for me i'm at a 7.5 maybe even a seven it just comes down to the packaging doesn't say what kind of terpenes it is doesn't give you the terpene profile and then the harshness like it just leads into this slippery slope of if you would have just told us that it was botanical terps and i would know in fact what it is and why it's happening oh nothing too just rechargeable disposable on their instagram um price point wise it's not even that expensive either so i mean if your you know disposables are your thing and you want to recharge it and um i don't know why you don't want to i mean i don't think you can change out the pod on this so i'm keeping my eight because it's just like it's convenient it's a full gram so maybe it's gonna die before you rip through the full ram i guess it's rechargeable but it can still die you just have to recharge it that's what i'm saying i feel like 7.5 final score for me i think it is what it is shout out to flav dope product uh definitely go check it out you guys this is

it's me the Bubba XLT back again with another ejuice review this time we have the gelato Veit red velvet cake this was interesting because when I bought it and I broke the seal on it it kind of smelled like booty hole am I gonna lie I've never had any Jews do that and I'm assuming it's the residue on it but other than that I've had no complaints about it tastes like red velvet cake smells like red velvet cake this [ __ ] awesome it smells so good I want to eat it again we're with zero nicotine today we're rolling old-school at least with the box like a little r2d2 scheme my wife gave me but she actually got the whole box for me like that but this is a sigelei 150 the old-school box ones that are freakin indestructible when we're rocking the BFT today wanna say I've got just a simple 22 gauge in there might be a Clapton I'm not sure I can't remember that's beside the point if you all want coil builds tutorials hey let me know in the comments I'll be happy to help you with what I can but rocking the BFT today I'm gonna hit it and I'm gonna tell you what I think about it Bruce move not real strong on the taste it does taste like red velvet cake not real strongly though it's muted and I've tried it on multiple things I've tried it on my goon tried it on my mutation with an alien Clapton build it's just not that strong of a flavor but 120 milliliter bottle if you like it it's not a bad deal I want to say it was like $35 $40 something like that you know Tennessee State Tax and all that horseshit but the density is what gets me on this stuff it is I've choked on it it's a very dense cloud I'm only no I'm saying only 100 it's because that's not that high for me because I like high wattage builds but with the BFT the thing is the coils are pretty big I say that's your normal build in like a TF v8 on the build deck this is your BF T coil it'll be a trap Clapton vs a5 rap Clapton almost anything else but it does take more waters to eat it up anything else I'd prior run run where your coil range is recommended especially if you're running a prebuilt but I'm rambling you saw the density on it it's a very smooth vape not that good at o-rings ain't done no tricks yet so but mmm would I buy another bottle of it probably not but they want to give me a sample oh yeah I'm sure I'll take it but I'm gonna have to pass on taking it again just not not my thing once this bottles gone I'll probably never get it again but don't let that discourage you if you're a red velvet cake fan give it a shot it's worth the money if you like it if not find something else that's been my review of the gelato and as always keep it real fans peace", "aJToQGUJNfo": "[Music] hi I'm Dan Hoff CEO of honey stick and today we're here and very excited to announce the official launch of our very first stand-alone dryer vaporizer the honey stick hrb now this is really special because one of the most common requests that me as CEO of honey stick has gotten for the last two years is when are you guys gonna launch a stand-alone dryer vaporizer we have our ozone tank which is a dry herb mod attachment that attaches to a battery and because everybody liked that so much they wanted something that was a little bit more discreet and standalone self powered so you don't have to walk around with a mod battery and that so we launched the hrb and why did it take us so long to launch a unit like this well because it took a really long time for me to get behind one personally to me what does a dry herb unit really embody first of all it has to be something you can easily transport it has to be of a good size this unit is very nicely sized and I'm gonna use our cush Army knife which is the size of a standard pocketknife multi-tool to show you exactly how big it is this is very easily fits into the pocket it's a very light unit but it still packs big power what other features are very important to me is that it be affordable well there's several units on the market there are great units you know made by packs or by Firefly but to me they're they're a little bit priced out of the market so it needs to be compact size affordable it needs to reflect what I would say the true taste of flowers so it has to have a really good high quality ceramic chamber so you can actually taste the differences but what you're vaping so you're not over burning it or cooking it now a lot of our patients one of their most things that they request is that the units also be simple to use that you don't have to be a rocket scientist or some type of a vape nerd to be able to turn these things on and use them effectively and what's the fourth feature that's most important to me is it'll live true to the honey stick name and still get the job done of hitting hard and we believe that this little unit embodies all of those features and I have an office full of samples to show you guys all the ones that have not so we really like this unit we're very excited about it so let me walk you through some of the features and how it works first and foremost it is available in three colors right now I'm holding my favorite color is the red I think it's like a Ferrari red we have a classic black which is a nice high gloss and then we also have a white each unit has side grips and also cooling air vents on it now what does each unit come with now when you get your unit it's gonna come with the dry herb body the mouthpiece you're also going to get a quick and easy to read instruction manual a USB charging cable a extra glass mouthpiece we'll get into what this will be used for a cleaning brush as well as a little dab tool however this is not a dab tool use for dab so you'll get into what this this little let's call it a little shovel is used for so you're gonna get your new honey stick here in the mail what is the first thing you're gonna do and what do I always tell you guys to do is make sure that you charge your unit and how are you gonna do that you're simply going to take the microUSB cable that's provided with the unit on the bottom of the unit you have the microUSB point of entry you're simply gonna plug that in and then plug the other end of this into a good wall adapter and I'd recommend you always use a wall adapter to give a good current and also I recommend don't use an apple because not all Apple wall adapters are compatible with other electronics that are not Apple so just to be safe if you have another one use it the charging time for this unit should usually be about between two and a half to three hours from dead to full and when you get your unit garrote on the charger and how does that get indicated when you plug it in your light will illuminate saying that it is on the charge and that color will be red once the red light goes off which was probably about two hours later that means your unit is fully charged and ready to vape now when we do ship your units they do have a small charge that they come with generally about 30% of the battery life so you get your unit now is talking to filling your unit this is a magnetic mouthpiece magnetic mouthpiece that has a little bitty filter over there just to make sure that you don't inhale any particles you're gonna simply pull back and that's gonna remove and then you're gonna have your heating chamber which is your ceramic heater you can see there that you have airflow holes which will help give you good hit and allow you to inhale and also allow the unit to cool I tell people it's not good for a unit to dry heat it to where you don't have substances in the chamber those substances actually absorb the heat and you do not want to you know just keep heating your unit up with nothing in the chamber I mean it's not gonna kill your unit but in order to stretch out the maximum life of your unit avoid dry heating you know I tell people also this is a dry herb unit don't put oils liquids or concentrates into this unit strictly use it for dryer another question a lot of people have is can I use do I have to find grind the herbs well grind up the herbs or pick them apart you know don't overfill or don't too tightly pack the bowl but make sure that it is loosely filled and once you have that you just reinsert your mouthpiece and then you're ready to turn the unit on now all of our units come locked to unlock your unit you click the power button five times repeatedly and when you do that you're gonna see the lights start blinking in green that means that the unit is actually heating up to temperature so it's heating up to temperature and this unit has three different temperature settings on it the default which is indicated by the green light is 390 degrees Fahrenheit while it is heating up you can push the button once and you see the light turn to blue now it has gone up to the next temperature setting which is 405 degrees Fahrenheit while it's heating see now it is solid so it has reached temperature once the light stops blinking it goes to solid so now it has reached temperature and you can feel free to vape if you leave it on for one minute that's solid the unit will automatically shut off and stop heating and go back and you would have to read start with the five click process you click it again and it goes to the highest temperature setting so you have a total of three temperature settings that you can choose from witches our favorite number 420 degrees Fahrenheit and then once it is done at any given point you can click it five times to turn the unit off and lock it if you're done vaping once it's hot you can feel free to make polls when it stops pulling or there's not like a taste a different taste out of flour maybe you can open it up gently use your little shovel and rotate around the materials and once the material changes from the color it was before you put it into it to more of an ashy kind of a color or or changes in color then you'll know that your substances have been used up in the unit now this is a small unit it is very lightweight so if you use it extensively it will get hot and sometimes that heat will travel up to the mouthpiece like we just took it to temperature and to me honestly to my hands it is not even let's say warm to the touch it's like my cell phone after I've spoken to somebody for about a minute or two to where it just feels a little bit warmer than room temperature and the inside that was 400 some degrees so but if you're using it extensively you know at a party or whatever and a lot of people are using it sometimes that heat will travel up to the mouthpiece so what we did is we have this glass extended mouthpiece that you can simply interchange with it and what that will do is it'll allow you to more extreme use the unit and not have it be hot to the lips okay so make sure that you always keep this around especially if you're gonna go heavy duty usage on the unit or not and you have those to choose from so don't lose those now how do you clean the unit so the unit comes with a cleaning brush so what you would do is when you're done using it first of all you make sure that your unit is off and you also make sure the unit is cool because if it got to be 400 degrees in there it is hot you don't want to be tooling around in there you don't want to burn yourself or do whatever is to make sure you let it be let it cool down make sure it's off so while you're cleaning it you're not accidentally firing it don't want to melt the brush or hurt yourself so you just take off the mouthpiece and what you do is if there's a lot of particles in there just simply you know knock them out don't bang the unit against anything just let gravity take its natural course and allow the particles to fall out and then simply take your bristle brush and using a little gentle twisting motion just scrub and twist and work the particles out and that will get your unit to basically looking as close to you as possible and definitely cleaning your unit after sustained usage definitely does help the life of your unit so if you guys have any questions or comments please definitely do get in touch with us it is all the commentary that we've received as to why we launched this unit in the first place and I thank you guys in advance so for this and several other cool items visit our website vape honey stay calm use my special promo code honey 420 for 20%

here with ready to leave and today we're actually gonna be diving into a cbd dominant vape we've got the 20 to one ease cbd vape from sundial that we're going to be diving into today we've got that right here i can't wait to get into this and all the other goodies that are involved with the reviews today on the other side of this intro so i will see you guys over there when we've got the intro in and out and uh we'll be tapping into some information on this 20 to one cbd ease vape from sundial y'all cheers and i'll see you over there back you guys so as i said in the intro we've got ourselves a 20 to one cbd dominant vaporizer from sundial this is the only pure cbd cartridge on the market that i am aware of there may be other ones but i only know of this one right now so before we go into the actual information for this cartridge we're gonna dive into the information that's on the box so this came in with a thc total of 3.5 a cbd total of 70 percent nice and rich and high with that cb d on this cartridge it has a package date of the 20th of july 2020 and it came in right around that 49.99 plus tax so at 50 plus tax you guys is uh what the price of this 510 cartridge is going to be i do have the sundial cannabis website pulled up we're going to dive into that a little bit and cover this 20 to 1 vape information that they have there before we actually get into the urban scale and start smoking on it so the cbd 20 to 1 vape is a part of sundials ease series which is going to be primarily the cbd dominant strains so the cbd 20 to 1 is a natural cannabis extract high extract rich in cbd with a good concentration of cbg and cbc and only minimal thc this non-intoxicating vape is ideal for any time fitting into your cbd routine sundial vape produces sundial vape produce okay let's try that again sundial vape products are grown and extracted at the care of using co2 processing and packaged in a c cell glass ceramic cartridge that flows smoothly with every draw so you can get it in a 0.5 gram 510 cartridge which is what we've got screwed into the fireside battery here we've got a 510 car starter kit which is going to be the cartridge a power supply and a usb power charger then you get the all-in-one or disposable vape pen you guys so i'm really curious and excited to see how this vaporizer is gonna do um the missus tried it out last night one big thing i've noticed from last night to today is it looks like it's crystallized in this cartridge here and i might have just gotten one that's a little bit wonky but uh we'll we're gonna see if it functions i took one quick haul at the lowest temperature on the fire side you guys to see how it was the misses definitely really enjoyed trying it out last night so it's my turn to dive into it and really see what it has to offer so we're gonna start out with the fireside battery you guys after that we go to the g pen battery we throw in a little bit of glass to find the final taste to see if the water percolation changes any of the flavors that we experience then we talk about the high and the overall finally to wrap up the video we've got all of that we've got to dive into you guys but first we've got the urban scale intro before we actually get into the fun part the smokable part of this review i will see you guys on the other side when uh we're diving in with the fireside battery on this cartridge cheers and i'll see you over there [Music] welcome back you guys so as i said we're diving into the fireside 20 to one cbd vape we're starting out with fireside battery so these containers at sundial puts their cartridges in are quite unique if you guys haven't seen the way these ones work you actually have to push that lid down and rotate it to line up right there before you can pop it off there we go come here line up and there you go pops off it just sits very deeply in there and i'm this type of packaging personally i would say is a little bit extravagant and excessive for what you're going to need but it isn't the worst one i've seen you guys now going into the cartridge we're going to dive in with the fiber side battery first and see what we get through here we're going to take a haul on the lowest temp medium and then the highest before we do the exact same thing with firestep battery then we bring it back to or the g pen battery you guys and we bring it back to the fire side we do it all over again but through the rigs so we've got a 16 holes on this no a dozen we're gonna be taking a dozen rips on this pen and maybe one extra at the end but uh the only way we're gonna find out how this cartridge does and uh overall experience is by tapping in and smoking you guys so let's tap in and start smoking this cartridge cheers and i'll see you guys on the other side of uh the lowest tampa rip we'll chat about it a little bit then we'll go to the medium and the high change you guys okay guys so it had a really light earthy kind of flavor it's nothing overwhelming it's not really it's actually reminding me quite a bit of the shish kabari the fireside cartridge you guys where it doesn't really have any strong overwhelming flavors or leaning towards one way or another with the strong overwhelming flavors but just kind of hit you with a really nice and light cannabis flavor that i'm enjoying quite a bit you guys let's take the next rip see if it continues along this way [Music] still really smooth really mild for its overall hit when you do haul off of it it is just honestly a really nice and light experience when you're smoking this it's not harsh by any means and it doesn't hit you with that heavy vapor lung that i found some of the other cartridges do but again it's just kind of hitting you with that generic cannabis flavor which personally i don't mind but i could see a lot of people looking for more that flavored kind of experience too where you get more that with the heavier thc stranger guys but we're uh gonna go ahead and take a rip of this at the highest level and see what experience we have to look forward there cheers you guys [Music] okay guys so i've got the fireside battery marked at a 7 out of 10 for the score it really wasn't overwhelming with its flavor or exciting or anything along those lines it was just kind of enjoyable and light and just that mild cannabis flavor there's nothing really special about this it's enjoyable and the cbd is definitely where i think this is going to be the beneficial factor of its where it doesn't have that heavy duty thc hit with it it's just the cbd and i think that's gonna be the winning point the flavor itself although enjoyable isn't really memorable or exciting in any way so that's why seven out of ten is the best i can do now through the fire side we've got the bigger ports on here so we're able to usually get a little bit of a heavier haul which typically helps with the flavor so i'm hopeful that we get a little bit more flavor and experience through this cartridge you guys but we will not know until we actually dive in and try it out let's start doing that right now cheers and i'll uh see you guys on the other side of the low temp through the g-pad again stage really smooth really easy to draw through definitely one of the smoothest carts i've had to draw for functionability of the the cartridge itself and how smooth the concentrate in and of itself is now we're going to bump up to the second temperature on the g pen you guys and see what it does through there before we finish it off in the high cheers again it's just staying that really light mild cannabis flavor that hints and leans towards one another but it doesn't like it it hints towards a sweeter canvas flavor but then it sits that on that earthy side hints towards a more earthy flavor but then it sits on the sweeter side like it's very mid-range non-memorable enjoyable but nothing really exciting you guys and even on the highest it just doesn't have the oomph that i'm looking for in the flavor to really get me excited and looking forward to it you guys i think i'm only going to give it a 7 out of 10 still for the g pen just because there wasn't any different experience between the g pen and the fireside battery honestly it was just overall kind of a midline experience you guys and i although i enjoyed it i didn't although i enjoyed the smoke i didn't experience i didn't enjoy the experience that's the better way to go it's smooth it's nice to smoke on but it's just not exciting but we're gonna see if the glass helps out with that at all we're gonna take our way through all three of the rips starting with the lowest temp working our way up to the highest you guys and the way we do that is we preheat the last temp and we just quickly flash through three ribs so i will see you after we are done our three rips through the glass on this and then we'll uh be chatting about it before we move on over to the g pen you guys let's uh let's get going on this cheers almost running on the highest temp let's run on the lowest actually to start off choose you guys still incredibly smooth you guys and um but nothing really that exciting there's a little hint of mint on that one you guys interesting interesting that this is the first time i'm starting to get it but let's uh tap into the highest temp when it's preheated cheers all in all you guys not that bad not overly enjoyable not overly exciting but not that bad i'm uh impressed with the flavors that i'm getting off the cartridge for overall experience but they lack of like a memorable flavor is disappointing so it's enjoyable to smoke while you're smoking it but afterwards i think you guys will forget it quite quickly and it definitely seems more as a complimentary cart so it uh it would be great to smoke this and then start smoking something else that you have that stronger flavor stronger thc effect that you're looking for but if you just want the cbd this is definitely an interesting card and worthwhile checking out you guys i'm uh i'm enjoying it so far now we're gonna take our rips through the g pen before we move on over into the score for the taste from the glass and the high before we wrap it up with the overall yike guys but uh oh excuse me i'm getting ahead of myself let's dive into this cartridge combo with the rig see how it does y'all cheers and i'll see on the other side of these three rips we will be pre-heating the last one like we normally do there's the pine starting to play a little bit of a factor what in the [ __ ] now we've got cart issues you guys and this one that's exactly why we had the crystallization in there is what's going to cause the issue on this cart you guys this whole cart has just solidified with the crystallization overnight what in the hell i thought we'd be able to get through this whole review you guys but we're not not getting anything through there let's preheat the water the hottest and see if that helps anything or is it that the batteries just dead we'll see we'll see [Music] okay that's all it is folks battery's dead cartridge still works um honestly i'm not that worried about diving into the other two um temperatures on here you guys i didn't get anything different from the g pen the first time i don't think i'm going to get anything different through this other two temps um the taste from a glass i i am going to bump it up to the eight just because that pine flavor started to play a factor and i'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt i am going to give it the benefit of the doubt with that g pen to be experiencing a little bit more pine a little bit more flavor in that uh in that rig you guys but it wasn't overwhelming it wasn't really anything that memorable about it but that little bit of pine makes it enough to go i enjoyed it you guys and i like i look forward to smoking some more through the g pen more so than the fireside battery just because the extra large ports and the easier the mobility of the vapor through there but the amount of flavor that i did have just doesn't constitute anything higher than a weak eight out of ten for the fire side on the the glass and the g pen on the glass you guys that the little bit of pine flavor that i was getting through the glass is the only thing that really can justify that eight now going on with the high i am i'm not gonna give this a 10 but i will give it a nine it is extremely clear-headed extremely easy extremely relaxing just a nice clear-headed medicated type of smoke you guys if you're looking for something to just give you that little bit of emotional support and emotional pick-me-up very very worthwhile cartridge to look at for an all-day smoke um saying that you're not going to get the benefit of the thc in there so if you're looking for the pain relief or anything along those lines you're not going to have that benefit as big of a factor as it is through the cartridge however they've each got their use they've each got the purpose they've each got their intention now using the cbd in correlation with a heavier thc strain is something i personally really love to do i really do enjoy mixing my heavy cbd and my heavy thc i find the highs are a little bit more balanced it's a lot more encouraging uplifting that like very much more of the assisting versus the recreational dosing that i tend to experience with just pure thc strength um the pure cbd are gonna be that raw medical that that just assistance kind of smoking experience that i have and that's really the big difference between the two you guys is i find that the cbd is more medical more supportive the thc heavy thc is more recreational it does have its medical place for certain people myself i like a combination of cbd and thc to kind of alleviate all the uh all the stuff that i like and prefer to use cannabis for versus pharmaceuticals or anything else you guys but um for now we're quickly going to wrap up i'll be back when i add up the overall and uh let you guys know how this cartridge did 31 out of 40 it ended up doing for the cartridge which is surprisingly well it's not quite in that beautiful garbage i think it's only a point off but it it just lacked the intensity of the flavor that's really what brought it down if it had that pine experience and flavor throughout you guys i think it would have done well i really do i think it would have had eights throughout the flavor because that light pine flavor was enjoyable and hinting and just a nice and unexpected performance for a cartridge that i wasn't all in all expecting that much flavor really that well over performance from but it did well it definitely did a lot better than i was expecting you guys and i think it is worthwhile checking out if you like the cbd dominant content or the cbd dominant cannabis based product you guys um especially if you're looking at the vaporizers give it a shot i don't mind it myself but for the time being we're going to wrap the sucker up we're going to be diving into some oregon golden goat tomorrow you guys voted on it from canica you decided you want to see that strain so that's what we're going to be diving into tomorrow i'm really looking forward to seeing how that one does i haven't smoked that strain yet you guys so it'll be fun and when my end card slides in here you're going to see the logo up in the corner you gotta hover over that and click that subscribe button to have access to the bell notification so that you know anytime one of my videos go live and the two videos down below will be the most recommended for you i hope you guys check out both those videos or just whichever one seems the most appealing to you but uh that's gonna be it you guys we got the goat tomorrow that we'll be diving into and then on saturday we'll have the weekly review hope you guys are having a good time and uh enjoying the the the content because i'm enjoying making the the content let's wrap this one up cheers you guys i will be back later with some more content", "tz6QveHJ4y4": "to smoke or to vape that is the question at least according to the state of New York hey guys Tara here for dnews and we've reached a turning point in our country where marijuana use is starting to become the norm whether it's medicinal or recreational andrew Cuomo the governor of New York State is expected to sign a bill soon that will legalize the drug but there are rumors that only certain methods of intake will be legalized specifically anything that does not involve the actual flower so edibles THC pills and vaporizing would all be okay now we've been hearing a lot of news lately about e-cigarettes and how those are supposedly better for your health than smoking actual cigarettes but how do we there stack up and are they better or worse for you than smoking say a joint let's go back to basics for a second now a raw cannabis plant contains over a hundred different cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind it to the cannabinoid receptors in your brain cells one of those cannabinoids is THC which is what's responsible for the psychotropic effects of smoking weight then there are others like CBD which gives you a body high but without all the mental fogginess now depending on where it's grown a cannabis plant will naturally contain anywhere from four to 65% THC and products with a high THC content like hash don't actually need heat in order to be activated you could still experience their effects just by ingesting them it's just that heating makes them even more potent now when you smoke a joint you're using an open flame which is very high heat and that combustion process activates the THC so when you inhale it the alveoli lining your lungs will deliver it straight into your bloodstream that's why you feel the effects of marijuana almost immediately after smoking vaporizers on the other hand use a process called conduction heating where either the raw plant or an extract of the plant has direct contact with a heat source but without an open flame so it uses a lower temperature and it heats it up just enough to be able to vaporize the THC that way you still feel the effects of it but without all the health problems that come along with smoking now much like a cigarette paper rising marijuana is still a relatively new thing so it's hard to say exactly what the long term effect but unlike ecigs you really don't have any outside chemicals to contend with so it's still widely agreed to be better for you than smoking burning marijuana produces carcinogens it can cause you to inhale soot and it can exacerbate problems like asthma shortness of breath and coughing basically it irritates the hell out of your lungs and there have been many studies showing that switching to cannabis vaporizers from smoking is effective for relieving those symptoms a 2007 study found that marijuana users inhaled fewer toxic compounds and less carbon monoxide when vaping compared with smoking it also tastes and smells better and from a medical standpoint it just kind of makes sense there's no medicine out there that you have to smoke in order to use so if the option to vaporize cannabis exists why wouldn't we use it well like anything there are a few caches for one paper izing can be way more potent than smoking and it's harder to actually determine how much THC you're getting many people say the effects of vaporizing lasts longer but also produce a more even high it also depends on your specific method if you're using dabs which are a super concentrated form of hash oil it can be really easy to overindulge dab users have also been shown to develop more tolerance to marijuana and have a greater risk of withdrawal which can lead to things like irritability and sleep problems even so it's hard to deny the relative benefits of vaping over smoking as long as people are responsible about how much they're dosing then this law may very well set a precedent for future marijuana laws what do you guys think would you support legalization even if it bans smoking outright or is this a step in the wrong direction let us know in the comments below as always thank you guys for watching", "Sitq2um1_7s": "toriel on how to use a cannabis vaporizer alright so with these products it's really nice you don't put a lot of soot or anything like that into your lungs it's much lighter feeling than if you're smoking it all the time and a lot of people don't know how to use these they're very simple so when you go to the store you're looking to spend about you know thirty to fifty eighty dollars always what we call a base of your vaporizer unit they're going to come packaged like this alright so depending on what brand you buy they all look a little different but from the same function you get your base and a charger in the box you're going to screw your charger into the base just like that and these Chargers just slide into simple USB ports you could charge them on your computer you can charge them to where you would plug your you know your phone cable right in there and then this this adapter will just go right into the wall then your vapor ends charging or you plug this right into your computer and now the base is charging okay so very very simple and the charges will last you you know weeks or more so once you get a cartridge once you get a base you're also going to need a vape cartridge which is a extract of cannabis oil and you can again get these in sativa indica hybrid or all CBD oils for example this is all CBD and this is a sativa product so again very simple simply screw the vape cartridge right into your base alright just like that and you're literally ready to go alright so then to use this product you simply depress the button hold it there inhale on the device take one puff see how you feel about five or ten minutes later and then repeat until you are at the level of Medicaid you've reached the level of medication that you wanted to consume and are feeling comfortable just don't use it before you drive besides that that's really how the vaporizers work it couldn't be simpler again if you want to detach this you can detach it be careful to not let the oil leak out if you're going to just rely on this allow around I usually try and set it upright or put the kite of the cap back on and that's really truly it with the vaporizers we that they're incredibly efficient and convenient way to medicate",

you already know back for another cannabis review on the baked boys you already know what it is if you don't definitely look into these guys definitely look these up these are the best thing on the cannabis market right now for vapes carts whatever you're looking into just for portable dabs this is freaking it uh freaking rechargeable tastes amazing better than any cart that i've i've come across personally uh it's just like taking a dab it even you know tastes like freaking mango this is what the whole box looks like and then you pop them out of the box and then another another baked bar packaging just so if you guys are getting these make sure like they are double packed and if they're not they're probably not real but these are a brand new brand new uh company uh straight from cali and uh they are just getting started so if you want to go ahead and look them up on instagram they're on instagram i don't think they have built their website yet but you know i've been talking back and forth with uh the person on there so uh definitely a good brand definitely quality quality product right here and that's what people are looking for especially in the cart game right now some people are scared of additives being being put in there it already says right here you know max strength lab tested and solvent-free to stood so uh it's got all the little markings don't throw it away you know recycle it properly it's a disposable so you know don't don't just be tossing it in the wrong or california they got big recycling laws and all that stuff so that's up to your discretion um 21 and older what is this right here probably not for pregnant women i mean just just basic stuff that goes on on cannabis products out in california but uh just guys go try one go try one because these are probably my new favorite thing in the world right now like you know i love my dabs but just having a portable portable little it's just like a freaking it's about the same size of a jewel or a uh a puff bar you know it's the same thing as a puff bar but it's just it's distillate so and they hit so freaking hard like you're just sitting here pulling it and then like when you exhale you don't even realize like you're blowing out a cloud because you barely feel it inhaling and to me that's that's how i tell if it's good distillate or not you uh it's not rough on the inhale but it's rough on the exhale and that's just a rule of thumb for all carts if you're experimenting with carts right now but you know thanks for watching y'all go get you one the baked bars bake the bar official on instagram go get into the hype you already know zooteep appreciate", "e5_B8K5nk2U": "loja brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel it's your friend came back to do another review for y'all today got something interesting for all you cannabis enthusiasts and connoisseurs out there we've got a pax era pod for the old packs era coming from Soleil it's Salette unplugged this is a hybrid strain that's coming in at six hundred and seventy three milligrams THC and ninety seven point three one milligrams CBD so it's hitting about seven sixty seven percent THC in about nine percent maybe ten percent CBD not much yeah I've tried this before and flower from Soleil it's always been pretty satisfying before it's their version of rock star cush unplug so really eager to try it out in a packs air pod it's 0.5 gram pod it's like a 510 threaded cart but you use it for the packs Eric comes in these little pods like this and you just put it on there and away you go works a lot like a jewel like a jewel nicotine device just like an e-cigarette same thing same device same idea in fact it's the same company jewel started out as pax labs and broke off into jewel so pretty innovative product pretty cool I haven't seen a lot of these around really wanted to try it out ever since bought my pax era down when I was in Oregon tried a whole bunch of pods out down there in Washington love the thing been really eager for it to show up in Canada and finally I got my hand on a few of these pots so we're gonna check this one out today I just want to show you on the side here it shows that it's a hundred percent plant-based ingredients so any added terpenes are plant-based and not artificial so it's good to know that it's a bit of a unique package here let me just also show you here at the packaging date is December 5th 2019 so it is what June 3rd so it's been sitting around for a little while but it should be okay I think yeah it's an area company so a the one oh yes what I wanted to show you was packaged it's it's unique it's weird so it says here push finger through circle then push and hold the inner tab firmly in continue holding tab pull and flap to open like there's a little bit complicated here for something that is a pod that's about this big let's check it out so tells us to push here alright and hold tab in and pull huh I don't understand so you hold this in and you pull this part out it's not very easy to open so push finger through help push and hold the inner tab firmly in hmm very strange packaging design here by some way we're just gonna rip it open cuz this is nuts nice job alright so once you get inside this insanely labyrinthine nutso packaging here completely unnecessary by the way oh you get your little slave packs pod so there you go it's got the THC logo on there as you're all used to assess branded with so late um doesn't say unplug anywhere on there you can see this is what the oil looks like in these packs air pods it doesn't look like a lot but there's 0.5 grams in there and I've had these before they're pretty concentrated they're pretty good the ones I've had before so all you do is you take this off you're not if you have one on take your packs error make sure it's fully charged take it just like a jewel device put it on there you go it lights up it's ready to go um you know unfortunately I would love to show you the app that goes with this but it's really not set up for the Canadian market yet what a cool feature on this is you can go in here and you can look for the pod that you've bought choose it and select certain temperatures it's not set up for Canada at all yet it only shows states in the United States where it's illegal and in fact even searching for Canadian LPS or any products comes up with no result it's really disappointing that you know the releasing packs pause in the Canadian market and their app isn't even set up for it yet because it is a pretty cool app I've used it for the American pods before it comes with sort of preset temperatures for each pod for best flavor best vapor it's kind of cool neat little temp temperature settings in there kind of cool um I just got it set to sort of a basic temperature right now I actually can't remember what temperature the last pod was but we're just gonna rip on this and see what it's like straight out of the box right into the pack Sara whoa Wow dad there's a lot of taste going on here it's very fruity uh first thought when I inhaled this and took a drag with fruity pebbles this tastes like fruity pebbles there's a lot of flavors going on there I'm very fruity probably one of the most flavorful cartridges or pods that I've had Wow I know it's Rockstar cush is what this strain it's their version of Rockstar cush I've never got a fruity pebbles taste from Rockstar cush before but while I'm really enjoying this taste very fruity very yummy yeah first impressions on the taste very good nice and smooth very smooth packs air pod like I said just like a jewel pod it's gonna last a little while but we're gonna get back to that because of course as always I'm gonna be smoking this over the next couple days gonna come back and finish up the review gonna let you know my final thoughts and let you know what to think about the soleil unplug pax air pop alright so after vaping this pack Sarah Soleil unplugged pod the last couple of weeks got some thoughts for you um I really like this pod the flavor is still there mmm it's a fruity pay the fruity pebbles flavor I really love it very fruity very flavorful I love it the flavor is lasted throughout the whole pod as you can see I've been vaping a lot of this here it's getting down to the nitty gritty they're not too heck of a lot left as it looks but looks can be deceiving with these packs air pods a little bit goes a long way in there as you can see it's not a very big pot to begin with but it does last quite a while I've been ripping on this quite a bit almost like a jewel going a little overboard that's one thing I'll be careful with these things so you know standard use it's gonna last you quite a long time never got plugged up once always nice and clear always a good vapor never harsh like I said unfortunately the apps not working in Canada packs get your act together get this app working in Canada so there's no settings for it I did find a similar pod an American pod I've got it vaping at about five hundred and six degrees those curious out there with the temple eyes and you know it produced a really good flavor really good vapor for the Sun lay on plug like I said the flavor last the throat the effects you get off it it's a little bit mild it's it's really it's happiness it's happiness strain you feel really good you feel happy you feel mellow just feel relaxed like you're floating along like I said there's days when I really ripped on this a lot and get a little foggy great you know it's not really energetic go get a lot of important things done kind of strain but you're gonna be coast and throughout the day and just feeling really happy real conversational real mellow I really like the buzz you get off this it's not super strong like I say you have like three four drags it's kind of a mild effect overall but you do notice it and you just feel really good you can't help but keep smiling I like this thing a lot great job so lay on the taste great job sway on the effects great job on everything except the packaging that packaging was ridiculous get better packaging packs fix your app get it working for the Canadian market because it's a really cool app and I'd really love to use it so it all of us here so get it working for us the price is good we'd love to see it be cheaper it's 45 bucks approximately for one of these pods really like to see the price come down but I really like to see all the prices come down so that's Universal but for what you're gonna get 45 bucks it's comparable to about a 5-10 thread cartridge there's also point five grams lasts about the same amount of time and I got to tell you packs air pods in my experience a pretty potent really good stuff so my review is overwhelmingly glowing I'd say thumbs up find yourself with a pax era device definitely seek out these pods you will not be disappointed thanks for watching hope you all found it informative if you've tried this before you agree with me if think I'm right think I'm wrong whatever the hell is on your mind leave me a comment I like to read them all I replied every one of them while you're here click

new CBD distill it be bait cartridges from black tie CBD no terpenes or cutting agents have been added to this at all they're nice jupiter-c sell cartridges and they also offer a really nice battery it's a self-drawn o button and it holds a great charge it's pretty good I don't mind it I generally hate non push buttons but this battery works for me it comes in a full gram cartridge and right now I believe they're 49.99 and we offer an exclusive discount code through the hemp bud form its hemp bud forum and I believe that will save you 10% off your entire order at black ties [Music] so if you've ever tried distill it it's got that distilling flavor but it also has some natural or carring terpenes in it that were present in the hemp that was used to make the distiller just distill it by itself does taste sorta bad so if you're not familiar with what purity to distill it tastes like unflavored sort of like burnt rubber maybe a cache bowl just generally just kind of gross ish this has a nice herbal base a bit of pine hints of lemon citrus notes pie a little bit of distill if not terrible tasting not the best tasting cartridge around the effects are fantastic as it's pure distill it at 60% CBD full-spectrum all the other cannabinoids are present including a small amount of THC I believe the effects for me are just spot-on with what a good full-spectrum CBD does it calms me relaxes me slows the anxiety down that I fail relieves tension generally in my body that's what I use CBD for and these effects come on instantly as do most vaping products for me and I would find this particular cartridge to be a hair on the night time you can't I wouldn't reach for this during the day for whatever reason so that mellows me out nighttime cartridge hit me with the comment below if you've tried these let me know what you think peace [Music] [Music]", "gqGxit_NiQ4": "what's up guys be green 91 and today we're checking out one of the first legal vaporizer cartridges in the Canadian recreational cannabis market we got this from City cannabis Cove in Vancouver they're legal recreational dispensary this vapour cartridge cost about $80 $70 and about $10 and taxes but after January 1st taxes on vaporizer products are going up to 20% these are new products and they were just introduced but the price point on them right now is just not making any sense this is a point three gram cartridge it cost $80 I could get a full spectrum extract saw scar on the black market for 25 bucks these are brand new they were just released as a part of the next wave of legalization known as legalization 2.0 the introduction of extracts and edibles these are the first offerings they came out around Christmas box has a strained name on their says one 510 indica cartridge net weight point three zero gravel THC is seven hundred and thirty three point eight milligrams so seventy three point 38 percent THC point seven milligrams CVD got the government required warning label on there says frequent and prolonged use of cannabis containing THC can contribute to mental health problems over time daily or near daily use increases the risk of dependence and may bring on or worsen disorders related to anxiety and depression back it says cannabis extract intended for inhalation contact information do not freeze or in a dry place or stored to keep upright no expiry date has been determined key vote of reach of children contains the equivalent of 1.2 grams of dried cannabis and has a packaging date on your tenth month of 2019 on the 21st day as you can see four point three cartridge it comes in quite a big package childproof to open it you're gonna break the tax stamp on the side you're gonna open the top flap of the box you're gonna press the two buttons in on the side pull it oh and there's your cartridge right out of the box it's a small cartridge 0.3 car it's got stickers on it this isn't a custom car it looks like a cheap car nazi so no particular brand i can see these being mimicked on the black market nothing to indicate that this actually came from a licensed producer lastik mouthpiece cut a glass body which is good ceramic coils 510 threading so it will fit on most standard vaporizer batteries the oil looks pretty clear which is good kind of hard to [ __ ] up cannabis oil about the oil is nice and clear golden which is a good sign seen some darker oils on the website but a smooth vapor very bland taste there's a bit of flavor but it's very bland time to get the hint of Kush smooth on the throw pretty underwhelming but I buy these for my personal use no I absolutely prefer my full-spectrum extract cards from the black market over these and really no comparison $80 for 0.3 gram cartridge $25 for 0.5 full-spectrum soft card for these legal products and dispensaries were brought in to try to eliminate the black market prices like $80 per point 3 gram cartridge I don't think that's gonna work to eliminate the black market I don't know if the recreational market will ever be able to catch up to the black market with prices and products like these the products are 100% inferior to what's available on the black market prior to legalization a product like this would cost you about 35 the pros of this product its legal the oil tastes clean it's a co2 oil so there's no additives or dilute and it's not a ceramic coil blast body which is good oils nice and clear and golden pecans it's expensive I'll go through one of these bow every 2 or 3 days I would never be able to afford to use these it's a cheap generic car super easy to mimic they only have stickers on there nobody wouldn't be able to tell the difference between this and a cart from the black market it's a point three milligram very small I didn't see any one gram cartridges available yet only 1/2 milligrams of 0.3 milligram the only way I would be able to recommend this product to somebody is if they absolutely refuse to purchase off the black mark like an old granny or something like that if they were looking for a vaporizer pen die I could recommend this product to them it's not great but it's not horrible it's not dirty it's actually probably the best product I have tried on the legal market I've tried the pre-rolls I've tried some of the buds and they were horrible this product is actually tolerable I was to give it a rating out of 10 I would give it a 4.5 absolutely underwhelming it's not amazing by any means better than I expected me personally I'll be sticking to what I know but for you guys I'll be continuing to do some reviews on legal cannabis products so stay tuned like share subscribe my name's be green thanks for watching peace", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "lu9nS1v3E3s": "Never burn another vape cartridge. Hey guys welcome to the vape review how-to series. we're gonna take this olive oil we're gonna put it in the pan we're gonna turn it on and we're gonna let it smoke until vaporizes okay so after the oils been heated this is what it looks like the color is gonna change to brown when it's overheated the same thing is happening in your vape cartridge when you heat it up for too long so the question is how do we stop this from happening? here's a few tips tip 1 batteries matter all batteries do the same thing but they each do it a little differently so whether you have an Autopen a mini mod Conceal or a Manual battery there's a couple of different things that you can do auto pens heat while you're inhaling so tip number two limit your inhale to 5 seconds Tip 3 I also feel the pen for heat at the top right there in the connection\npoint just stop inhaling for about one to three seconds alright tip number four\nfor variable voltage batteries you want to always use the lowest temperature\nclick three times to change the voltage For manual push-button pens tip five\npulse the button this will lower the overall temperature\nacross the oil and the coils as you inhale The optimal battery temperature\nis 2.2 volts This ensures that you don't overheat your oil It's enough to vaporize the oil but cool enough not to burn it all right if you\ndon't want to do all of that stuff... Tip number six get a cold fusion vape pen it's the best of both worlds variable voltage down to two point two volts pulse chip technologies is integrated into the vape pen never to make sure that you \nburn another vape cartridge You can hold the button down on the green setting which is the lowest setting With two point two volts and you can hold it as long as you want If our logo isn't on it.

Marijuana review for Florida medical marijuana patients or those over the age of 18 alright well I come out to upload the other video I just did and it was so nice and wind wasn't blowing I thought we'd get a video in real quick so we got moves disposable they've been sorry trying to fire this back up it looks a little funky I stepped on it when I set it down for a minute that's the white widow or white queen or something from the last video with the dank tip this one does to me like the appetite I had to go in and get some pecan Toral's I didn't even make it halfway through these are the baits it's a Jupiter pin there's a Jupiter liquid that's the same ones dirt on there chocolate wanna do that's the same kind so Terry uses they pull real nice got a little bit left in there I use these when I'm working they're easier than trying to load the yolk and stuff like that like I said I like these they hit real nice problem is they don't last so long because they hit so nice so you go through them a little quicker this is the Rainmaker it's an indica dominant hybrid I probably wouldn't get this one again for like I said I use these for work and this was a little too much for work had me fall asleep on the lawnmower and see it trying to cut grass like I said that's mainly when I use these if I'm on the lawn Lord it's easier to pull it out of your pocket hit it when I'm painting and stuff like that I usually take the yoke in with me but these are very good for convenient you take it out and do a little pull along it they come in these little plastic things I always keep mine back in there and keep it sitting upright I always want to keep the coils at the bottom or the wick whatever it has in there soaked so I try not to leave it sideways or any of that I think moves is the most realistic closest tasting to actual flower marijuana than anyone else now it doesn't taste exactly like you know smoking a big fat joint but it's the closest one in my opinion that tastes like really marijuana not some synthetic pine-sol or but yeah that's the real earth to your taste to it I really like this it's like so this is my favorite babe hands down is easily moves line the flavor of them now they're all gonna you know it's like true leaves and everybody else all the moves pins are gonna taste kind of similar there's slight variations you know the same way with true leaves I'll have that kind of lemon pine-sol taste but you know the strawberry switchblade you can taste a little bit of you know strawberry in there or you know little different hints in each one but overall the same flavor is there I'm rambling because I did too much of the white queen she's a mean girl my brows all paroled up again but there's some good stuff here too makes you forget the tip you haven't gave move a try and you like the vapes like I said the Rainmaker pretty sure that's what it is you get the Rainmaker and the other one confused all the time the other one's a sativa but this is like I said two hybrid but it's a indica dominant I've been it's got some CBD in there 2.8 milligrams which ate crap it's got 240 of the other ones and then 60 of something else this is 300 milligram and these are 300 and they're $35 not like truly small ones that are 250 so you got to check that on when you're doing your math - how many milligrams you're actually getting in there some have 200 milligrams summer 250 summer 3 summer 5 summer 6 they do that to try to trick you you know they say our price is the same but give you less milligrams in there so keep an eye on that and I'm rambling it's 5 minutes and the friends are here and they want to go out in the boats you got cleaned up and I got too many of them that's what the old lady tells me all the time like I said it was nice out see the water back there she's not windy usually it's too windy and it ruffles the leaves of the trees up here see the bananas back there in the background from the sea pageant point under those ice cream bananas she barely turn around and avocado trampoline some mango tree good eating the zombies ever come come to my house we'll have some good eating so I guess that's it guys like I said I'm rambling this girl's got me tore up and still got a little bit left so if you haven't subscribed hit that subscribe button leave me a thumbs up comment down below tell me what you guys think that I ramble too much did I not smoke so much before the video and keep on token guys what do you guys token on a day at Saturday I've done work for the day so until next video guys", "Ic1ELSLcQ8o": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]", "nCgPAEZltMY": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today I've got another strain review that we are gonna do exclusively here on the ice smoke channel this is ice cream cake it is a cross of the legendary gelato 33 and wedding cake let's talk about this strain in a bit more detail right here on the ice smoke channel we got to DANC growing farms finding this car got a history of finding amazing cuts of specific genetics also found that marmalade cut that people are raving about we got chem dank as well everyone that has made this strain review possible this is a strain which as I mentioned in the intro cross is two absolutely legendary cannabis strains in the game one of them the wedding cake is more on the indica dominant side it's got that really sweet vanilla frosting type taste popularized by jungle boys of course a gelato 33 there's got that real distinct gassy deliciousness to it hearing from the grower the genetics weren't particularly stable with this one this was the only keeper a lot of the others her meat which is when they start producing pollen sacks as well this was a stable one and this was the keeper I am expecting effects from both ends of the spectrum a lot of that heavy hybrid hitting hi is coming from the wedding cake and the gelato 33 let's talk about the appearance of the ice cream cake [Music] this is where this is 10 out of 10 but guys every time I post a picture of this on Instagram it gets like twice as many likes as anything else I'll post it has got this rusted white look to it the trichomes are in such abundance that it is significantly alters the composition or the appearance of this but it looks like it's been dipped in vanilla frosting reminded me of the wedding cake but it has also got this just lovely sort of like stat calyx the bud structure is delicious looking and actually it's consistent consistent delicious looking luxe across the sample that I am smoking you could trimmed you up on this one and the the frosting this means that I must about to trim off quite a lot of trichomes getting those bases of leaves off but it is looking like a Cali bit of bud as you can see that I'm holding in my hand helped out does this look oh yes coloration really really like coloured there's patches of darker which our guests were the basis of the leaf before it was given that excellent trim job it's got reasonable size pistols they're not particularly long and while they are sort of in in quite an abundance on the pile actually compared to some other strains pistols if you don't know come on vagina's so overall this is looking like a a very very nice bit of bud I would say appearance-wise 10 out of 10 but how does it smell initially this has got that sort of dank gluey sort of pungency to it that piney earthy but like also Major League a seat sort of sort of a Roma's coming out of the jar straight away giving hints as to what its gonna be like it's got this real sort of offensive under time the ice cream cake that reminds me of the gelato 33 it's got the sweetness of the wedding cake as well chemically levels of gas eNOS is one experience in smelt bloody lovely very very strong hiney knows gassy notes smells like an OG smells like that sort of it's got that sort of richness that I've got sour power OG at the moment and it's not too dissimilar a smell from there and I think that's the pungency and the Pioneer it's coming together with that terpene profile to give this sort of lovely rich dank cannabis in and that is what I'm getting before I've even pulled it apart squeezed it agitated it at all let's try that now or as a nice density to that guys this is some very good bud alright let's break it open you hear that crack there's a definite skunky smell and a definite gluey smell to it by glue I mean the same sort of chemical burns smell that you get for all that mean the specific a really low strain I mean that gas in it which is like when you're at a petrol station it's like you you think about that smell you're like and I shouldn't be inhaling those fumes but that smells good it's got like a smell that's that's along those veins it's not the same as that spell but that's what I mean when I say gas is like losing this delicious more rich scent that it's really difficult to put you put your finger on I mean it's a pungency than offensive smell to the nostrils oh yes let's move on to the taste section of the review I'm super excited to get some of this into the bond guys we're gonna grind up the ice cream cake by sea junkie genetics all right if you are a hater or prohibitionist or you don't like the weed smell and get a [ __ ] out what you doing so lost if I said you would not like this smell of this strength it is gonna be in your face if someone's got it in their pocket you're gonna be pissed off I've got my raw little sister bong here this is a marvelous piece of kit we're gonna hit it through this raw bung let you know how the flavour is and then we're going to move on and wait some all right if you're joining me for this you know what to do get yourselves ready get those joints rolled bongs ready dab rigs heated up you can hit that pause button if you need to we're about to go live with a bowl of ice cream cake oh yes shoving a lot more in the bong and I'll see you all on the other side cheers folks oh wow so immediately smooth smoking experience nice flame and rice nice and smooth no validity hitting that in the raw bomb was a delicious smoking experience I'm finally over that annoying cough I'll be suffering with for the last month or so allowing me to majorly enjoy this bomb now that it's back up - back up to where I'm normally at no COFF COFF interests try and get a bit flavor and a little bit of the pungency is creeping through but overall the cleanliness of that was the major USP so far I'm pretty impressed with this strain guys looks-wise it is amazing smelling delicious - and really smooth smoking experience through the raw little sister long I'm now about to vape it and see how it tastes and I'm pretty excited because I bet it's gonna be delicious all the signs are there here we go guys [Music] yeah the sweetness is leading just just leading that pungency that gas units there as it's real like frosted sweet pungency it's a really nice white guys this is a strain which tastes bloody lovely let's talk about the effects of the ice cream cake today I've been consuming the ice cream cake by sea junkie genetics this is a lovely straight guys flavor-wise it just completely delivered how am I feeling I feel like this is a good strain to smoke during the daytime it comes from two heavyweights trains yeah it doesn't feel particularly strong I do think that there's a nice indica led hybrid stone creeping over my body from that first bowl of the day but I'm not sort of inebriated significantly you know vaping it to continue getting those cannabinoids I'm noticing this slight visual sensitivity in the light I'm quite chatty so there's also effects on the sort of sativa side I think there's probably some sour D somewhere in this heritage and it's just generally a nice strain for smoking during the day so I might say and not just because it's called ice cream cake you don't have to just enjoy it on sunny days but I bet it would be nice if you did the am feeling nicely relaxed but not overly inebriated even though I did a nice bong of that food a royal little sister and I'm now provoking it a bong I did was actually about half hour ago as well because I had to quickly pause the filming because I had someone come rad to do a job that I've forgotten about come back never felt too high but did get this nice high feeling the flavors delicious even those wonderful let's sum things up today the ice cream cake has been the subject of that I smoke strain review I hope you guys have enjoyed it as much as I have appearance-wise is probably my favorite thing about this strain it just looks 10 out of 10 just nothing better about it it's just a wonderful strain that I love the look of every trichomes glistens in the light smells dank particularly when broken up and ground very very nice strain indeed all that pungent say that guessing is that fuel aroma taste wise delicious particularly through the vaporizer the smoking experience was incredibly nice and smooth as well and effects wise I'm feeling good I like it during the daytime and it is a strain which I will happily smoke any time day or night what do you think of this review guys do leave your thoughts below in the comments and remember to hit that like and subscribe button if

everyone welcome to my honeycomb clear car treat review have a senior review for 2020 this year so I thought it might be the first one to do it so there it is so I have two honeycomb car cards cartridges and um yeah I spoke these a couple hours ago and these really didn't I thought hey you should probably review of these so let's start off with them the packaging right here so this is what the package looks like and as you can see this is its THC level and I think each of these cartridges had the same THC level eighty-three percent THC and 32 percent CBD and I would definitely recommend you to check out their Instagram they post um everything there and yeah I have indica zoo keys just do this one I'm just different flavors um sorry I want to say it Maui Wowi sativa and like I said same THC please follow their Instagram the show they always update their news and cartridges and yeah so let me just open them out right now as you can see these are definitely real folks this is the logo is so you can see right here pretty cool I'll show you the other one too well yeah same thing clear it's all real this is a fake [ __ ] and these have given me I have no problems at all with these and these are just really good I definitely recommend you all to buy these and you know mine might as well take a hit right now so I my pen right here there we go it's a little burned right here I think I am think I smoked outside one time and I brought outside I was on my jeans and the oil just was so thick there just froze and so I had to heat it up and I guess I made this that or I just burned it too much huh but ya gonna smoke this right now and let's see how this goes yeah just a giant nose to get Cheers yeah these are really good yeah how'd you smoke this like a couple minutes ago I'm not gonna smoke this but ya get the idea these are really good and um actually before I go like I said check their Instagram because they said something about their they're a half a gram cartridge how it will not have a a honeycomb logo on the top and they say after they're done with their half a gram cartridge is and them right they'll do the deed over one gram too so yeah definitely keep in mind in that this is um well should I just drop but um it's just my review and um yeah in conclusion I think these are really good and um these are like next to my favorite like um brass knuckles and um slime breath and yeah these are really good and I think you all would really enjoy it I think you should all give it a try and yeah thanks for thanks for watching this video if this helps you all um the next time you buy a cartridge and you take you have a good day", "lZ-vfMIuGco": "[Music] welcome to truebuds tv it's your buddy jack talking distillate vapes versus live resin vapes what's going on here what's the difference i've had tons of requests so i'm happy to be fulfilling those requests let's see what we got in the uh little handy dandy true buds pack let's open it up well that's for another video i'm going to be opening up this top shelf pre-roll see what we got inside keep an eye out for that video i have the uh live resin from jetty here the unrefined let's go ahead and open this up we got the little satchel in here tastes so good so live resin upon harvest is instantly frozen this is the way that they're going to get the most terpenes in there the full flower flavor that everybody loves live resin is usually extracted with butane and purged in a vacuum oven i'm not going to go too far into the process let me know if you want to see more videos on the actual process now live resin usually on the scale shows it's a little less potent and a lot of people go shopping i want the highest potency i want this and that that's why distillate cartridges are so popular and that's why i'm making this video to kind of educate people because distillate is the bottom of the barrel if you will it's the leftovers the trim the shake because everything is going to be burnt off essentially it's like making booze it's like making a moonshine or ever clear you're going to put all this [ __ ] in and then you're going to be left with the most potent stuff possible basically tasteless odorless colorless and then this is when the companies add in the terpenes if you're lucky sometimes they're delicious sometimes they're not but a lot of times you can taste the artificialness and that's why i think especially after having this live resin i got a live resin from my uh packs the other day from jetty too i think this is the go to from now on i'm tired of these distillate carts when i hit them they taste fake i'm [ __ ] like sneezing that's another video i've been with people when they're smoking vapes i sneeze all the time after hitting this distillate cart like what kind of terpenes have you put in there is it some [ __ ] random flower that i happen to be allergic to like that is the beauty of the live resin is you are getting the live flower if you will the closest resemblance in a nice form that's right there price point price point this graham cartridge is pretty damn expensive i'm not gonna lie i was a little hesitant it was like 62. i got it from ease i'll put a comment down below if you want to order through there for your first time get 20 off but that's expensive sometimes i have people commenting like dude that's some serious dough you're dropping on some carts and [ __ ] but it's convenient it's legal gives me peace of mind i really don't mind actually you know shoveling that money forward people buy the stuff through ease it all kind of comes back but what i'm saying here is i think this has helped transform me i've had other live resin vapes and i've thought the same thing but i'll still buy distillate ones but i'm sitting there i feel like sometimes these like even the circles one like i'll take [ __ ] like 10 15 [ __ ] poles off it and it feels like just now i had like what four of these like this is better so i guess you got to decide where you want to put your money quantity over quality i'll just compare it to like schwag versus fire ass nog you know what i'm saying i would say this is that good nug and the distillery cartridges are the swag so yeah like that we got the unrefined live resin and then we have a distillate like this was like 15 bucks and you can tell so that's my two cents i wanted to break down the difference for you between the live resin and the distillate vapes like i said the tons of people were asking like yo bro like what's the difference man and i'm like i'm gonna make a video so here it is thank you for hanging out i'm gonna go enjoy this and if you're liking this pack or you want to grab any of the other true buzz merch you know i'll be

amazing it tastes like a lick one of them orange creamsicle ice creams it is good super mellow high smoke it's pretty heavy on the lungs compared to some of the other ones I don't mind that the flavors really good I actually did a review on the flower of this it was probably the highest THC that I've had from truly y'all want to check it out I'll put a link in the top but yeah this is good stuff if they pens all your thing and you like sweet stuff like I said this one's got like an orange vanilla taste to it it's amazing I'm sure they used some of the orange terpenes and just a little

got to charge this up it comes just like this you know a little cap on the top uh all the oil you know we got that gold heated press you know what i'm saying fresh thc right there fresh off the press man so yeah we got that full spectrum you know and uh we got that cereal milk now some y'all got to know about marijuana i know a lot of people were the real dabbers and all that y'all know but if you press like flour if you press flour down on the heated press with some wax paper right the [ __ ] turned gold you get a gold oil that comes from marijuana and that's you know where this is derived from you know all cbd though um this is all the cbd extract you know they extracted all the cbd from the marijuana and uh yeah so y'all see we had 150 mil milligrams of cbd in this cereal milk uh grown manufactured in san francisco so yeah i like these i like these a lot hemp derived cbd oil terpene profile inspired by cereal milk so we're about to try this man about to see what they talk about so yeah let's try let's try it out oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] she may hold on god damn oh [ __ ] yeah man y'all showing no thc in this man y'all", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "QR28aT45Y8I": "what's going on out there youtubers mr. weed Lee with the joie de lis show gonna do a just a quick cart cartridge review some cheaper cartridges going around adding two weeks in a row now Keene cartridge got a lemon and a Bluegreen 1/2 gram and a 1 gram legally completely different cannabis oil me inside of these two different size cartridges I have no idea why I'm glad I tried the second one is it was night and day difference I have no idea why that is a half gram cartridges or I found this one little dispensary Nirvana not my favorite just been three but they just print three as well you know they they have good prices on car projects especially if you buy two i got the half gram king the lemon i don't think it's a lemon OG anything like that i think it's just dad living food terpene it was a really really dark oil pretty much empty you can kind of see how dark it is in the bottom there compared to that [Music] but the Blue Dream you know it's a cannabis strain terpene or carpet lease boy that I don't know lemon 1/2 gram OG get it out of here crap you only got 20 bucks both taxes what that was hey you get a buzz you know just a taste wasn't the best $20 can't can't beat cannot beat the one gram here get them at the same place there are a lot of other places I'm sure mr. 17 may be dropping some around may not I don't know if he's gonna even go that route maybe just better ones definitely try the one gram the last one I had was a wooden ship it was really good this was a black porcelain tip it actually says something signature on the it is some kind of a brand name cart if you can see when it does have on the stem their signature lol of something signature something I get over but it's been a good one [Music] I found this you can get these at that same shop I'm the cheapest I've seen him as 30 plus tax for the one gram and that's I take 40s a more normal price own but you know go to that one shop buy two you get them for that along tons are my one you can get them for that so it's definitely a budget budget cartridge but I am on a budget so that's good that's good I might actually probably be rolling with these quite a bit let's see if I can keep the people in they keep the quality up and the price of that same price but that one dispensary I might be on me [Music] you don't know about the damn care that's the white V to fix this king cartridge amazingly you get the v3 pretty soon probably when they hit town all right I'm gonna make this quick little download over 420 already though so everybody have a good one big shout out to the man here up and get great medicine all over this town so see you guys later take er easy keep it growing up twisty twisty OKC Thunder seed mmm I like that started to stretch I got it fixed she's doing great so twisty coming along and the other one didn't do so well but it was a random I got all my faith in these twisties everybody have a good one and take her easy again", "q6ulG5rXf-Y": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or you have a medical marijuana card I don't I show you my personal information I had yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so I'm this video so yeah in this video I'm gonna be reviewing the brand back saver if you seen my last review what did uh dizzy that was like a highly requested video and it like he actually lived up to its expectations like and exceeded it like that she was [ __ ] fired especially if the the flavor restraint I got is drawn Anna so that [ __ ] was [ __ ] fired and it's like 97% THC so we got a fax Sarah and we got a pod and I actually got a video coming out soon that do I do this review it's gonna be us busy versus affects everybody if you guys want to see that stay tuned and I know that there's like other brands like Moxie's and like other like fuel THC joules or whatever you want to call them you know I'm saying so if you guys like no one any other really good ones and you want to see like me compare them to bees and something like that or what I mean just let me know down below I can definitely do something like that but facts area is like really popular in Arizona for some reason it's like kinda hard to find Izzie I mean you could find it out here because like we're so close to California and is easy California brand it's like really hard like it took me a minute and actually this dizzy that I got I didn't get it in Arizona I couldn't find it in here I took a trip to Las Vegas I got off my home he's like shop there and actually made a video while I was there I have like a walkthrough video of it if you haven't seen that she go check it out it's like the cultivate a walkthrough video but yeah like I said I'm gonna be doing a video soon comparing this dizzy cottage to the facts so I'm just gonna give my pros and cons which one I think is better what I like about each one what I don't like about each one so if want to see that video stay tuned but right now these facts era batteries like just this alone right here this is going for [ __ ] home $30 so there's a whole pricey out here right now so I hope they live up to the expectation I don't really know much about it I just like heard a lot of hype behind it I'll get more into like more in-depth in the past and later and they had their own look like so the difference between them and it's dizzy I don't want to get too in-depth in this video because I'm gonna make a separate video on this like I said but uh Stacy they make their own brand of pods like you know what I mean like you can gets dizzy pods but they're like oh they work with like local producers and growers and stuff I mean like they're not making the pods himself they have people that are like helping them [ __ ] um bacteria they actually um they licensed out there like different processors and um just like you know I mean there's different processors and distributors and all that [ __ ] so um you can get like whatever the [ __ ] they have in your state you know I mean so my state they have almond drip so I guess they uh Bailey at the brand rib [ __ ] make some back theropods and the brand drip is [ __ ] fire I pick up the concentrates all the time like they're actual like shadow it's [ __ ] fire I've never tried their [ __ ] a wax pen I've always wanted to but I guess so much either uh back there but first and uh one thing about the mention is this is 89 or you guys probably seen it it's gelato because the strain gelato that it's tested at well 89 some eighty nine point seven percent THC pretty much 90% and 0% CBD so super potent will hop into this later let's open the battery first if you guys didn't see my us dizzy review we'll go check it out because I really [ __ ] with these like I really hope I can find these pods more in Arizona they're a little pricey like 45 bucks for the half gram at least that's what they were trying out there but they're far [ __ ] a school and it looks sick I don't still but we're doing facts here in this video so it stopping this yes I get the facts there first thing first box is pretty dope like I don't know I just like a little bit designed they want for you and I mean like the the blue smoke yeah you know I mean like it's kind of like a gradient smoke that's kind of dope I don't know and then it says facts and premium vaporizer extra the Bacchus has a powerful yet discreet that sounds pretty dope no math simple click leak resistant bats pod easily beat easily beat leaky not that means I chat generic cartridges complete control fine-tuned temperature vapor and session oh so they have a mobile app that's pretty cool I guess you can connect it to your phone I don't know what you can really do maybe I'll try that and see what happens alright so I guess they use in like top-shelf we curate the best blend for you so they I get security lock your pen you can lock your pens that's pretty dope so like you want like we do pan out your how I said I mean and that you don't want someone walking in your room in your pan you can just put it on locks an organ hit it any stands like a password that's what I'm getting out of it so included in this box is a factor device and a micro USB charger oh it also has a one year warranty I think this is he goes to yeah it has an app so that still so here's the back if you guys want to be I'm not gonna hold it too long so pause it three two one alright so let's open it up take a little slide out then you slide it out let's take a little look a little smoke bags I'm not too sick Oh blip stop why do I have it I'll have it the right way I flips up and then it says welcome to the back slide insert extract pod pulses one connected enjoy era so that's pretty sick playing it's focusing hopefully did let me see the bottle right there oh all right so there's more sugar than I expected I so and it's just like a black jewel yeah I mean I don't know if they have different colors this is the one that gave me and it has this little thing right here a little cardboard core this is insert the cart there and then you open this up I guess it's the stick you know how like the iPhone boxes have that thing you pick up that's what I reminds me of I don't know why and then you got the charger there and all the stickers instructions nobody reads that [ __ ] alright so hopefully this thing is charged maybe I should read the instructions a little bit so I want to make sure I get this [ __ ] good alright so I'm not gonna connect the app in this video when I do that umm dizzy versus um facts video I'll have the app connected by then and I'll do the comparison then is it's gonna take me a little bit to connect it up and all that you know what I mean if you guys stay tuned you'll see what happened in this if you guys I mean it looks pretty simple we'll just insert the arrow and a device the light will pose meaning device is ready for use draw from the mouthpiece booth table when finished alright it's simple enough just like that figure imaging the series instruct so I don't know the packaging is pretty dope I think it's pretty cool since already guys told you I think it's really cool how they um like a license out to other like processors in this like other people that like make oil you don't mean so you can get like different quality oreal like crisps like gums I'm sure likes dizzy is like using like what I don't know what you want to call it like um one recipe I don't I don't know what they call it like when they make carts this [ __ ] one like recipe or whatever you're not I mean like they're just doing one I don't know I don't know I don't want to like hypothetically I don't know hypothetically I'm saying this I don't really know what they're doing on award for them but they might just be doing like one thing where as facts is like letting all these different companies do whatever the [ __ ] they want as long as they know they're good you know there has to be some top-shelf [ __ ] so that's dope you can get some like down fire or you could get some fire under me cuz they're not gonna this just I don't what I don't think they would distribute or license to people oh yeah let's hop into this um yeah so this is um I think I told you I got gelato it's almost ninety percent THC 0% CVD that's all you guys see it real quick real quick yeah I mean the package and it's pretty sick I'm welcome about it I middle down below in the comments with you guys think of the packaging and I like that like ohm 3m or what I even call it that little shiny font that use that [ __ ] is pretty cool on the back of it they covered it with the sticker which kinda sucks woman it just says the Arizona Department of Health warning there's nothing where we're gonna hate that and that just says compatible with only our backs their devices does it stink you go honey I mean that's how I'm just kinda quiet you know a seal I don't know I mean anybody [Music] I'm so getting this open though I said I already said it multiple times a lot or 90% let's open it up what's going on is just like shuffle how do you open these so after a long struggle finally got it open um off the bat I mean I'm gonna say this pod looks I don't want to say too much I'm saving it for that video so yeah here's the part that gelato 90% and like I said all pods I'm oh I guess I could say what this pod looks like Wow cuz like I said all pod so you're different because it's made from different that company you know what I mean we're still Ike more controlled like quality control like everything what I'm saying so I don't know but so gelato just like 90 percent I'll give you guys like a little look at it it's kind of heart disease I had that white [ __ ] walk in it this one is like a little brown not brown okay darker than the other ones you wanna mean I've ever seen I mean like the clarity of it like color of it it could be a bunch it I mean you could have some bump or that could be the color of it but like you could have some like darker or like this and it could still be stupid fire it all really depends on the strain and just like a bunch of other things you know they mean so so I don't think there's a button on it believe me just hit it I always sure to read the instructions so I've been so much hype around this I believe so that there's a and I guess besides for that if guys are smoking along I hope you're smoking some good [ __ ] and skated Cheers I don't I was tripping I didn't really think I was getting a hit at first I was really smooth hated fired gelato that tastes as good as [ __ ] like I said it was smooth and hit good as [ __ ] but let's go on for another hit Cheers and I like this this reminds me of like a straight-up jewel like and especially I further show you guys what this looks like on the pen like that [ __ ] is discreet as [ __ ] I mean if you want no one to know what the [ __ ] you're doing this [ __ ] literally looks like you didn't like it I don't even know it looks like a USB stick you know I'm saying but you just getting high off your USB stick yeah I'm saying and stays late why do you hate it a little bit that's kind of cool what yes put your logo now this is a Firewise flavor eyestrain whatever you want to call it because they mix the terpenes in it but um I wrote I don't think there was a preheat side and then you just hit it like I'm doing I don't know if you guys heard that [ __ ] I don't know what the [ __ ] that was um I don't know this [ __ ] is fire is [ __ ] um overall reading the battery I'm gonna give it a four point five out of five it depends that that's my personal preference I mean it really depends on how you're looking at it because if you're looking at a business like you don't feel like a businessman you know I mean if you smoke weed and like want to go to your office and you get on it you don't want to bring up a wax pen that's like super noticeable there you have wax in the pen I mean bring this nobody's are gonna [ __ ] know so it kind of depends on how you look at it this is like perfect for somebody like that really like somebody that doesn't want their family they smoke or some [ __ ] like that but in the pot you definitely get lettuce [ __ ] off it it smokes good flavor hi everything about it I know it is my [ __ ] dog guys really bad anxiety in this fireworks going off so I gotta go comfort her so much but now this pot is fires [ __ ] I'm gonna give you like a room just like a four I have really weird score like a four point nine out of five like I mean like super close to a five just the battery um it's not my personal like I've had better in the past but it's might be somebody out there is favorite you know I'm saying but me / I mean I don't know it's like it's really cool though maybe I might change my mind oh no like I said that video will be out soon come I like you guys knowing that when that video comes out which one I like better and which I like my final thoughts and this is so when that video comes out make sure you check that video out but the pod it's a five out of five the pod if you can't tell I'm gonna smoke before I made this video and right before I made this video I made this dizzy cart review so I smoked when I made that video so I'm not been pretty late and plus I've been smoking all day which is everyday all day every year I'm pretty late that was the point you guys couldn't tell but uh now this is some fire pretty close so far I might change my mind like I said but if you guys like this video and you have any other video ideas suggestions recommendations constructive criticism anything you want to tell me at all you in the comments I read every single comment I love all the support from you guys I really do I appreciated and I don't know I guess besides for that you guys like this video big that himself comment like subscribe to all the good [ __ ] strong baby so", "le8Pgcb0uaM": "Roja brothers and sisters welcome back to the channel cannabis connoisseurs I hope you're all taken care yourselves and each other out there Sheeran and chemo back on the channel here got another product to review for you today we've got a 510 threaded vape cartridge from sundial cannabis called lemon riot we got 0.5 grams sativa hybrid coming in at 791 milligrams THC one point five milligrams CBDs are gonna be hitting about 79 80 percent THC on this less than a percent CBD it's a heavy hitting THC vape cartridge from sundial tried this strain before in flower sundial product the lemon riot really enjoyed it purchased it a few times it's got a great taste a nice citrusy lemon taste flavor in the bud really looking forward to see how that translates to the cartridge here for some beeping you know what without further ado let's get this package open it's a little bit of a unique package I haven't seen one like this before um yeah it's okay I will let you know it was packaged in November 16th 2019 and like I said it's a 0.5 grams let's without further ado let's get it okay I'm really excited to try this guy I just want to rip it open so um we're gonna go to a so on the top here it says twist in a line and push up so we twist what are we twisting here yeah sometimes these things are not too clear okay there you go so we want to looks like we're aligning here Oh push the top oh look at that it's kind of crazy little pop so push the top off you got your cartridge in there just like that kind of neat let's take it out of here if we can yeah it's a little foam thing in there it's kind of neat like a little push pop so still some wasteful packaging right you know Canadian legal cannabis wasteful packaging but go to I mean it's kind of a neat package and I do like that you kind of have somewhere that you can put this afterwards if you in between cartridges so that's kind of cool so let's put that cool package over here and let's see what we got all right so here's your standard 510 threaded VAP cartridge oil looks you know not bad pretty clear not too bad looking for oil I've seen worse doesn't look too murky kind of moving a little bit in there when I move it that's good it's kind of what you want to see in your oil I think so for my experience this is a nice color you got the sundial branding on the one side and the other side you got your THC warning sticker along the bottom here says lemon riot and yellow let's take the little mouthpiece condom off and yeah we've got our most about the charger on our battery let's take it off standard battery here for a 510 threaded cartridge let's screw it on and there you go so looks like ready to rock so without any further ado and let's jump right in I'm really excited to try this out oh yeah you got that citrusy lemon flavor kind of a earthy kind of taste to it as well I was expecting to be hit over the head with just lemon citrusy flavor there's a bit there but it's got a little bit more of a an earthy flavor to it you know kind of hummus almost like kind of piney in a way yeah you definitely definitely kind of get those hints those notes of lemon citrus on the inhale and on the exhale you get sort of a earthy piney taste now this is a really nice balanced flavor to this I really like it but it's surprising I thought it was gonna be a little bit more like BAM you know hit me with that citrus lemony flavor but it is there a little subtle but it is a good taste I like the exhale flavor is a little bit earthy kind of piney good sort of a class of cannabis flavor going on with this um it's been about what 40 seconds since I took a drag I almost feel like again a little bit of effects going on here this is my first hit of the day haven't had anything before this I like to come into these reviews kind of fresh so uh first impressions packaging is pretty nice design I don't know no I'm not gonna give it any awards on design there's kind of a lot going on here you got the white top the yellow bottom you got the branding there it's not going on it's alright but for taste so far really enjoying it lemon citrusy piney earthy on you so it's really nice great flavor so we're gonna get this marinating here we're gonna check it out gonna hate this up throughout the day put it through its paces okay so for the last couple days just exclusively they've been using the Sunday lemon riot vape here I've got to say I like this thing hits you hard it lasts for a while and it comes on pretty quick it's it's good B it's about eighty percent THC so you know it's gonna hit hard but it lasts for a while it's gonna last you about one or two hours on set right away what you're gonna get is a nice daytime sativa high you know cerebral head kind of focused energetic happy overall gets through your day really good babe I like it recommended value wise you know these things run about fifty bucks seems to be about standard for a 5-10 credit card trade you get about they say 0.5 grams in there which is standard for these unfortunately we'd like to see something your tanks come out and some cheaper prices but what can we do right we're gonna get there for what it is though you get a good value like I said I've been reefing on this thing for two days oh three to five five second drags every time and you know we still got quite a bit of oil in the tank as you can see it's gonna last you for a while we're gonna get you through value eyes give it a thumbs up effects wise two thumbs up you know even the packaging I know I like to rip on the Canadian legal weed packaging I like this packaging you know it's got that pop top push pop you got a little container that you can put it back in here you want to switch cartridges back and forth is it a little wasteful a little much yes but I do like it what can I say I like their packaging this one so value effect is good values good effect is good taste flavor yeah this where you might be a little disappointed you're expecting a real citrusy lemon hit you over the head with flavor you're not going to get it that's what I was expecting as well - what you get is you know a little bit of lemon citrusy on the inhale on the exhale more of an earthy piney kind of flavor and that's definitely the more dominant flavor that's a tasty hit in the mouth afterwards I don't not like it it's not bad it's just not what I was expecting at all when I got when I went and got something named lemon right because I have had the flower before does have a really strong citrusy lemony taste to it didn't really fully come through on here but I gotta say I'm not disappointed with the taste that's there so overall everybody I'm gonna say definitely recommend a limit right sundial 510 0.5 sativa cannabis faith cartridge here for you that's the end of my review thumbs up recommended let me know what you think as always leave

them please check out Steve's e-comm or find them on weed Maps now let's get started here's the unboxing of the steezy starter pen kit this is the pen that you will need if you're going to use any of the steezy cartridges inside of the box with the pen you have an owner's manual instructions warranty information you also have a USB charging cable and the steezy vaporizer unit itself and you can see we have a real simple kit there nice-looking little vaporizer unit but of course you're also going to need a cartridge that we're gonna unbox one of the indica biscotti and inside of the cartridges you will find also an owner's manual to tell you how to use it as well as the cartridge itself and you had you can say this is where the magic happens with this product here and we'll get it and talk more about the oil inside of these cartridges in just a second but first let's take a closer look at the pen and the cartridges themselves the pen is actually metal I thought it was plastic but upon inspection it's actually a nice metal pen there you've got the microUSB charging cable in the bottom and at the top you have the elements or the connectors that will connect it to the actual cartridges it's a really nice shape and design and it's very very small and stealthy it fits right in the palm of your hand and it's very light and you can see at the bottom of the carpet cartridges there's a little cap that comes off and that shows you where the connections is that'll connect it to the device you plug it into device the device flashes a couple of times blue there's also a light at the bottom on the heel of device and I'm not sure if it's intended but that cap that was on the bottom makes a perfect little dust cover to keep the land out of it and so yeah that that's pretty much it on the device list now to get to the most fun part of it at this little usage and the testing of the steezy concentrate pin first you're gonna charge it up that blue light there will be red while it's charging it once it's fully charged it turns blue you know it's fully charged and then comes the hard part and isn't making a decision we had 12 different flavors to choose from we had a for each of the indica as the hybrids and the sativas three or four of those were actually flavored as well but most of them were just strained specific and I tell you what they taste spot-on this is some of the best taste and cleanest wax I've hit it's a very very enjoyable experience the taste is smooth you can get a big hit if you inhale for a minute it does after about 10 seconds or so it will automatically cut off but believe me you'll have plenty of big enough hit for maximum head this pin is really great it's so easy to use the taste was incredible on all 12 of those different strains believe me I've tested them all and they're really amazing they're a distill it so they're out 90% THC and man you can really feel it let's go to the pros and cons oh the pros are that is so super easy to use it it's very clean of all these cartridges I had there was no leaks no breaks or any kind of problems with any of the cartridges the taste is amazing you can get big hits or you can get small hits and it's very strange specific no additives and the extract themselves cons are the battery life is a little short and the packaging on the cartridges tastes a little bit like or smells like on the issue anyway I still think it's great I'm gonna give it 4.5 stars out of 5 it's amazing so if you are in the market in California you can please check out Steve's EECOM that's st III is UI comm and you can find out where you can purchase those and you can also look them up on weed maps under brands and thank those guys for setting up this review I hope you enjoyed this review of the

found a little bit but I didn't find any videos and I didn't find a whole lot on the vape pens which are these here and they've got I just kind of wanted to go through with you what I have learned about the vape pens and I like to use the one that's got the wick right here which is the same one I understand for the e-cigarettes which I don't even smoke cigarettes or e-cigarettes but I do like the vape pen with the hemp seed oil in it and there's a lot of information that I've got to share with you but I wanted to start off first showing you this little kit that I got there was other stuff that came in here I took them out but what I've got in here now - I got my charging cable I got my hemp seed oil itself and then I got the vape pen which all fits right in there little case and you zip it up the in sticks out so what but now it's curable you can carry it around but back to the V back to the pen the button up here you click it five times to turn it on one two three four and five okay when you hold it down when the blue is on that means it's working see it's smoking out of the sides right there okay but you don't have to turn it off because it's off when you're not pushing the button but that blue light needs to come on is showing you that the element a heating element is working through the blue light the heating element is working so you don't have to hit it five times again to turn it off and the main thing is to keep these wicks saturated with the awl and this is unrefined all hemp seed oil now adding all to your vape pen this is what I do I remove the little cover and this part here unscrews which opens up down in here now in the middle try to avoid not getting any in there because that's the airway what you do is open up your bottle and as you see I don't need to add any but get a few drops here and you just kind of lay this on the bottom half here and let's just go underneath the airway there and it'll go underneath and fills up this chamber here which in the wick pulls it up into the heating element area and then put this back home [Music] tighten it up not too tight but tight enough like I said once it's already on it turns itself off when you release that button you don't have to hit it five times each time it will it has memory and then hold the button down and it's heating up draw it deep into your lungs hold it for a minute - just like smoking a joint and then let it exhaust it you're releasing and you'll feel the change you'll feel a lot more relaxed rot away you know the type of business I'm in can have a lot of pressure to it so in the evenings I'll do three hits like that and that's all I need for a while this juice right here would last a while a week or so for me because I'm not on this pin all day long I just use it when I need to and then underneath here is where you use your charging device charge it up and the light I believe is red when it's charging and when it's fully charged it turns green right here I don't think I left anything out but if I did we put it in the comments if you want to see anything else like this let me know if you like it like it if you hit that bail you'll know when I'm putting up a new one [Music] and I got a little audio file I'm gonna share with you with some sliding pictures and it will give you a lot more background on a hip seed oil and here's what I got to share with you the internet studies shows unrefined hemp seed oil don't have any additives like propylene glycol or vegetable glycol which comes with a cigarette switch heated at high temperatures can turn into formaldehyde the body creates some formaldehyde anyhow humans produce about one point five ounces of formaldehyde a day as a normal part of our metabolism inhaled formaldehyde is rapidly metabolized

everybody like I said we are testing the quant vaporizer up here in Breckenridge Colorado love vaporizers for snowboarding one of my favorite things to use out on the mountain and you can check out this Quandt vaporizer at school of hard knocks comm forward slash quant now let's get into the unboxing so this is the actual vaporizer right here this thing works for both dry herb wax shatter oils anything like that so pretty much you can smoke anything out of it and yeah this is it so this is the marble finish it also comes in a pretty cool wood finish as well we got the marble one now on the side we've got the buttons to turn it on and adjust the temperature so here's the actual box this is what it comes in and that we're just gonna go ahead and open this up we'll break you through or walk you through everything that comes in here so we obviously have an instruction manual who reads those I actually did to see how all this worked but pretty simple to use I mean there's like three buttons on it so it's not that hard right so like I said this is the marble finish you can get this at school of hard knocks comm forward slash quant and it comes with the vaporizer right there so from here we are gonna go ahead and pull out the accessories right here so this right here is the oil or shatter attachment and essentially what this is going to do is drop into the actual bowl itself and I'll show you how that works but it's a little quartz chamber that you basically put your oil or your wax in and drop it right here in that chamber it's pretty cool so we're gonna go ahead and open up the accessory pack right here and I'll break down everything that this comes with as well so everything's all nicely packaged up and in here we have a number of things so this is obviously USB rechargeable so that was the USB cord you just saw right there and in here we have a replacement screen which is that blue thing that you see up top there is a pair of a cleaning brush that comes with this as well now those tweezers are basically used to pull out the oil container if it gets a little hot or just kind of clean this out as well now one thing I really like about this vaporizer is that it has a cooling chamber and we'll get to that in a second but as you can see right here it has a bowl so all we do is just pop the mouthpiece off the mouthpiece is super easy to clean and that is a nice little Bowl right there that you can either drop the oil attachment or just put your dry herb in there and I'll show you exactly how this oil attachment goes in there it's pretty cool here all we do is just pop that open a little cap on there allows it to not splash we just drop that directly in there it fits nice and snug and then we just pop the mouthpiece back on and that blue piece that you saw is a filter to avoid any splash coming up and out of there but you know obviously we'd use the tweezers to pull that out if it had some residual oil in there we wouldn't want to spill that all over our hands so this little black part up top that's the display it tells you what temperature everything reads out at and as you can see right here sorry but just drop that but as you can see right here this is the cooling chamber and the mouthpiece now it is magnetic it pops right on to the Quandt vaporizer this is a nice little glass tube in there that basically allows you to cool or allows the smoke to cool as you are drawing through the mouthpiece and this is something that I really liked about this vaporizer that I found a lot of other vaporizers you know things like the G pen kind of don't have a cooling device and it gets really hot now this screen that I just popped off also allows you easy access to clean that tube out and it also makes sure that no oil or dry herb is flying up into your mouth while you're pulling over the which is something I really liked about this as well I noticed I was able to get massive rips off of this compared to other vaporizers I've used so everything just kind of clicks into place there to turn it on you just click the big button five times pretty standard as far as a vaporizer goes right most of them are turned on with about five clicks and as you can see it turns red as it's heating up now you can set in the temperature right here as you see I had it set to 369 degrees and I also need to recharge the battery but as you can see it turns green once it is heated up which was a pretty cool indicator it's not a super bright light either one thing about some of the other pens is they have a really bright light so when you're using them in movie theatres people can kind of tell you using them this was pretty nice to have you know that discrete low lighting and like I said the temperature is adjustable with the two little buttons it is USB rechargeable right here and there are a few holes in the bottom that you can see and the cool thing is that's where the air draws up and through the vaporizer and that part never ever gets clogged unlike some other vaporizers where it can get clogged easily I basically pull straight through the bottom straight through the heating chamber and into the cooling chamber where you can then inhale the vapor so I've been a huge fan of this I actually brought my G pen out to a movie the other day my friends were all like hey dude where is your quant so my friends love it I love it can't recommend it enough you can check it out at school of hard knocks comm forward slash quant and you may see me up on the slopes with this thing in the near future so thanks for watching be sure

started in this next video guys I'm gonna need you to do a few things as usual i'ma need you to like my video make sure you hit that notification bell and definitely make sure you watch the last deal which I did on candy this week guys I'm so excited because we're doing I'm super excited about this product guys I had a chance to be the representatives of this product at one of the dispensaries that our frequent and sunny day in Vegas Nevada we're gonna get into this product right away alright alright guys so here I have the air pro battery this is an advanced vaporizer system it comes with a graphite air pro vaporizer with a micro USB charger in it so let's get this open and as you can see battery is in here we won't get right into it guys this is you open it up you get a user user manual sorry it's early in the morning this is gonna be a battery it's the graphite I can get it onto the package and there's a USB cord attached to it for the purposes of this video you cannot see this charging but I so guys not enough got it all charged up and as always guys before I attach my cartridge to this I do want to make sure parents know that this is a canvas product we need to keep it out of the reach of children so make sure that you have these items laying around for your children anyone under 21 is not allowed to consume cannabis I'm gonna go ahead and plug in my charger I mean I'm sorry my cartridge guys see that this particular cartridge is a 0.5 grams and this one is called the black mamba and I picked it because it says black mamba but not only that guys and this particular one is the sativa so I want to just start showing you guys to Tevas because I usually use us that even during the day time just to get my day going it doesn't tie up my day and make me tired so I thought it would be great just don't get my work done and I will be able to use this as you guys know I got a bunch of product reviews to do and I need to keep my head straight sativas keep me right but this particular one is black mamba it has a pure distillate oil which only means that they have some clarity and purity to this oil I'm not sure from the research I did how they dissipated the oil there's different ways of getting me away with distillate form so you always want to do your research whenever we serve this particular product we go to air procom shut up at air pro we're gonna open this package up as you can see the package is a little tough to open I have no idea how I'm opening this but we're gonna figure it out okay guys obviously please change our location because it was a little noisy outside but the last you saw I was holding up the package that was childhood but it's also adult food so now we got the package shop guys I'm just gonna get closer got my 0.5 cartridge that's Black Mamba here is my battery is the graphite battery and I'm just gonna show you guys I've already charged it literally the charge only took maybe about 10-15 minutes so you didn't see that because of the purpose of editing the video but the charging takes really fast and it did turn colors when it discharged so I'm gonna go ahead and figure out how to put my cartridge on there we go so you just pop that mouthpiece off and then Oh Meg Nick magnetically it clicked idiot let's do it again wow I like that and I like that because guys it keeps it from leaking some of these cartridges you'll get they'll start to leak into your battery this one is magnetic and I like the way it just draw someone you don't have to like screw it on so you just sit this part to the side guys and we're gonna get ready to see if this thing more all right so remember it's supposed to find rate there's a manual a user's guide so I'm just gonna look quickly and see what it's supposed to do okay so it's supposed to vibrate lightly in your mouth yes I just said something's gonna 5r8 lightly in my mouth so let's see the vibrations oh my gosh that's amazing okay instantly guys this is amazing I can taste the blackberry as the top note with the hint of citrus but it's not a tangy centrist now let me let you guys know that I do know for a fact that this particular cartridge the Black Mamba cast terpenes in it the terpenes is what really brings out the benefits of the particular oil or the flour which is made out of flour so guys what I really love about this particular one with that citrus taste in it that's that limiting coming through and I love a terpene limit because for me is the antidepressant and anti stressor so it has that has pine all in it I think it has some lemon linen all in it as well so if you're looking to do Turks that's what you really want to be at to understand what the oil is doing and what is it bringing out of when you're inhaling it so for me um wow that feels really good in my chest this system is really great and this has been on high time magazine's top when our air pro and I love how sleek it is can you see that you can slip it in your pocket it's really adorable and right and it gives off a nice cloud the smell is great idea I'm like truly in love with this one and I feel like because it is a sativa guys I can go on with my day actually we might film doing some more stuff doing my day so you guys can see how a sativa will work doing your day so when you have a sativa this is gonna be great because you can still go to the gym you can still get your grocery shopping all those things that you need to do in your day sativas won't allow you to do so remember if you need it during the day so theses are going to be the way to go and air pro has some excellent sativa cartridges and these are dissident oils so they have already made pure fighted and clear it up so it's very clear on your chest the second pose you see I didn't even have a call back which is great and I still feel like I'm consumed inside kind of thing I know that sounds really weird cuz this is like my new friend like I can actually like in my little pocket and my yoga pants matter of fact let's just go to yoga and I'll just keep it in my yoga pants done nobody knows it's there let's don't get on my nerves boom vibrating in my mouth oh yeah I feel like dancing this right here alright guys I'll be right back and I'm going to show you how my day went on this air pro all right guys as you can see it's been about what about an hour or so and you know I met the guy named Jim on Stairmaster owning every Pro what I've let one that make you work tell you what I'm working up that's what it's this evil dude that he paid to this we're feeling great I just got a great workout in on the Stairmaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] it was amazing that gives the clarity and the purity of this I [Music] [Music] because I [Music]", "PE3sM3Vf7_g": "hello everyone welcome to a new episode of wheats the marijuana something show here on youtube today we are taking a look at a new contender a new player in the vaping market and even more specifically another player what's another battery in the pod line of THC vaping systems so these are like your steezy your packs your plug-and-play they are not the standard 510 s that you thread on to the batteries these are the ones that you just drop into a little thing very much like the nicotine what's it called a Joule just like joules but for THC so what brand are we talking about today we are talking about icon we're gonna take a look at the whole system here today both we're gonna review one of their pods the Skywalker og as well as the whole icon system their battery yada yada yada so on and so forth um so the battery can be had for about the same price as any of the other baseline batteries I think I've seen anywhere from twenty to thirty bucks but you can usually get you know cheaper if you buy it with a pod so on and so forth so it's about the same line as the base line of the other pod based systems you know might be a little bit cheaper than the steezy big or the pax era prime whatever they call the fancy pax era it seems to have a 550 milliamp hour battery which i think is a pretty decent size for a smaller battery like this I think it's bigger than these DZ the original cz which is like 350 maybe I'm so not a bad size uh and icon themselves they say they pride themselves on their transparency and their quality products so we'll see their website is devoted to all kinds of wonderful flowery [ __ ] like transparency is a cornerstone of our company culture we meet the requirements of fornia full plan'll compliance state testing to ensure our customers receive the steepest vaping experience pretty boilerplate um but you know maybe maybe there's something to it we'll give it a try and we'll give it the final verdict after we do the whole review so let's go and open up our battery here and hope that there's some charge in it would suck if there was it not just for this review but you know generally if you're buying these things you want to use them pretty quickly and you don't want to charge it ah so here we go here is our icon it's about the same size as a cz except it's wider and it's definitely heavier probably the larger battery but it's squat just like that about the same size is this easy maybe a little bit smaller but squatter and a little bit heavier oh now that's cool um this is the first one I've seen that has this it is not USB microUSB it is USB see they're part of the future thank God I can't wait for everything to be USB see so that's it that's a nice little plus for them I'm sure it doesn't matter to a lot of you but it's great that everybody's getting to a new standard in new species undeniably better than micro USB so that's a good point for them other than that pretty basic we've got your case and your battery charger and and that's about it so pretty bare-bones but you know don't need a lot of extra stuff and you know it keeps the price cheap so here is the pod itself this cost this is a full gram pod and I've seen them about 50 bucks is is about what they run so that's a belt in line with the cz a little bit cheaper than the pop plug in place and packs is but right in line with the most popular cz so let's go ahead and open it up it gave me a press and slide just mangled it completely anyways there is our packaging pretty basic packaging nothing too fancy which is great not a lot of materials wasted and on the back we got a nice big lab testing results with our THC and CBD percentages at seventy seven point five and one point one percent CBD now for the most important thing itself the actual little pod and just like the steezy or just like the battery itself it's squat square kind of fat looking okay so let's go ahead and take off a little bit of cap there the camp goes and at the bottom you can see the little connectors for the battery zoom it slides right in ah that's nice there's a little clique to it see here that there's nice clique steezy noir packs has that so always especially the PAX is the PAX pods tend to come out pretty easily this one's definitely in there it's it's not going anywhere and that quick is pretty reassuring so no button on it just like this easy uh let's go ahead and give it a hit it's a different little system here by the way it's it's kind of translucent boarding on opaque the big sort of plastic covering the oil but does look like that's to chamber system but it doesn't look like each is equally filled it's hard to tell through there and it's hard to really tell the color of the oil but here we go here is our Skywalker og from the icon premium extract pod at base system oh wow that is really nice Wow excuse me for the coffee I'm gonna try to stop and I forgot to hold my hit super long time and he'll get ping for that hmm very tasty um Wow uh it definitely tastes like Skywalker of these Skywalker's that I've had but it's very smooth on that one of the better sort of tasting I assume you know there's no natural or unnatural flavors artificial flavors does contain food grade flavor extracts so maybe that is there it's delicious nice easy draws don't like to pull very hard comes right out and yeah again be the vapor itself is absolutely fantastic tasting moderate to big drawers as well um pretty big glass for a single draw they're not as big as say a plug-and-play I'd say a little bit maybe cz but a little bit bigger than a sort of steezy draw so no complaints there as I said again the taste was exquisite in terms of potency they label in at seventy seven and a half percent that definitely seems true um feeling it quite nicely already after just four or five little hits there this is a nice system no problems with the icon system but we're just at the very beginning of our review here well we're gonna review the whole thing not just there our first little impressions so I'm gonna finish this whole one Graham Skywalker og icon pod probably take me about 5-6 days or so and once I finish it I will come back to you guys after that last hit and let you know about the whole experience make sure that this oil didn't start to burn the battery didn't run out after two or three more hits all that stuff all the things that you know can go wrong with these battery vapes I'm gonna test the whole thing really looking forward to it nothing but good experiences so far and I hope that that holds true for the rest of the pod so until then stay out stay healthy and I'll see you guys soon hello guys welcome back to wheats it has been six days since I first started using the icon pod based weed THC all those words acronyms system and after six days it has finally run dry here's my little pod that you can see it is mostly the please of oil there a little bit of residual residue but it's uh it certainly feels spent to me uh so what do we think I think my first half the review was pretty positive um and that is still pretty true this is a good little system I like the design of the the actual battery I liked it really did like the design at the pods I hit pretty well the entire time did get a little bit of that kind of Bernie taste towards the very bottom of the pod but not too bad and not for very long it was only the last maybe ten drawers or so but I really like how firmly it stays in place that click system is nice that little white LED is nice to see as well ya know completes a pretty good system additionally again I like the fact that it's USBC and um I never had to charge this ever it had enough juice in it out of the box and the battery is large enough that it it was good to go for this entire pot which is really nice you know that you don't have to have to bother to deal with any of that especially if you're on the run so that that is another good plus it has enough juice for sure to run an entire grand pod even outside of the box it was handled it no problem so really no problems with it and price wise just a quick little look line seems it's kind of in between the price of like stevesie and say plug and play or the higher end pod based systems um not quite as affordable as CZ and not quite as expensive as some of the more primo ones uh so you know it's not certainly not a terribly overpriced or anything like that but that kind of does lead me to the one sort of thing that I would hesitate to to tell you to pick it up and that is just I'm trying to I trying and failing to come up with what makes this stick out over any other system you know the PAX era system has a cool much cooler vaporizer with more tech in it and a cool little compatible app the steezy has ubiquity and price it's usually pretty affordable and it's everywhere so if you get a steezy pod or a CZ battery you're bound to find some CZ pods really you know wherever you are in an area that sells weed and then the plug-and-play or whatever is you know just a transcendent experience you know not that this is a slouch it's just not as good as something like that uh so this kind of doesn't have III don't feel like it has it's as neat of a home because it's not quite as ubiquitous as cz III don't see it nearly as many places I've seen it around so it doesn't win on price it doesn't win on ease like being able to just you know buy pods when every year wherever you are and it's not as good of a vaporizer as the packs are not as strong as a plug play um that is not to say that you should not try this or get this that is just to say if you're going to only invest in one of these or even two these give it some thought and start to think about you know the ups and downs and again the downs here are just simply it's just not as ever-present as the others and it's just a little bit more expensive than and then steezy so um but on the whole really did like it six days of moderate use still enjoyed the flavor of the skywalker OG up until the last ten hits or so so really a pretty good experience with the icon based system uh and before i go here guys before we wrap up this review we wanted to share with you a little cherry on top little something extra isn't necessarily weed related but you can you know enjoy maybe on the weed or maybe without who knows it's up to you um this week i'm gonna share with you a multiplayer video game so they don't really share too often and this one is while you can play it online it has a very robust online features it is the couch co-op games and all couch co-op games not that we live in an era where couch co-op is easy but something to look forward to and you can play the online until then and that is Killer Queen Killer Queen black I think is actually the name it is a eight person online multiplayer game two teams of four there are three workers and one queen on each team a variety of ways to win each round lasts like 90 seconds five minutes max I won't bore you with all the details but it has that pick-up-and-play thing it's just a big 2d looks and plays a lot like a oust back on the Atari or arcade like the 80s and 70s but anybody can pick it up and play it but it's also very deep and it has a lot of different ways to get to victory it is actually a spin-off of a cool arcade game yes an arcade games still being made where it was a 10 player local giant to cabinet arcade machine played with 10 players and big teams I've unfortunately never got to play the actual bar arcade version but the home version which is on switch it's on PC I think it's on ps4 as well maybe it's Killer Queen black if you got some buddies and you want a great way to spend a couple of hours yelling and screaming chat it at each other give Killer Queen black a chance so guys that's gonna do it for this cherry on top that's gonna do it for the review and that's gonna do it for pretty much everything here I want to thank you guys for watching stand tuned listen to me rambling here um if you would give me a follow on the Twitter's a tweets reviews I've been doing a lot of

there a tweets reviews that'd be very nice until then thank you so much guys we'll see you right back here for the next review take care", "DRepb6SGOqM": "welcome back in this video I'm going to be reviewing the supercar squawk box by 5g vape I'm Sherlock Holmes and on this channel I do build tutorials reviews live streams all kinds of cool stuff as I said today we're gonna take a look at the supercar bottom feeder box by 5g vape this is what the supercar squonk box comes in really cool packaging and this is like a soft wooden material almost like a balsa wood inside the box we have little baggie of a rings and those are spacers peek insulator spacers and I will show you these in a minute but then there's a little Instagram card and that's all you get and here is the box you can see on the front here we do have the 5g vape logo you can see the squonk pin in there it is a flat head pin the pin is gold-plated on the back of the box we have the supercar bf Box logo with the serial number in the bottom corner on the front of the box really beautiful 5g vape logo there and the rest of the box is plain you can see how thick and well-crafted everything is in there everything in here is silver-plated contact this whole box is mechanical there is absolutely no wiring no circuitry the button there is peak insulated completely mechanical switch you can see how contact is made as I said the 510 is gold-plated you see your squonk bottle here and it is an 8 mil squonk bottle and it is a really really nice soft high-quality bottle the threads on this bottle are extremely smooth it is food grade material I love how they laser etched their logo in the top there you definitely get a really great quality bottle yeah your bottle here on the left side and on the right side is where your battery goes can go in positive up or positive down it doesn't matter there are no indicators when you install your bottle and you install your battery it actually puts tension on this piece here which creates distance in between the switch and the 510 I've got a nice firm little bit of a throw there with the button which I really like that's what it's going to look like with your battery inside there is not a easy way to get your battery out but what I do is I just stick my my thumb under here and just pull it out if you even need to get the bottle out I just put my nail underneath the bottom of the metal piece here until the bottle comes out and I could pull the bottle out first and then just pull the battery out so that is not an issue for me that there's not a battery strap in there the door is super thick as I said earlier all the construction is very thick and nice you have two magnets here and two corresponding magnets at the bottom of the door the door just slides in just like this those magnets hold this door in very very well I can't get this off if I tried that's not going anywhere and you can see how everything just fits so nice together it's solid and in there beautifully everything is just flush and obviously you're cut out for your bottle the wood quality is fantastic on this thing it does come in three different options there is a red one it looks like a cherry it is in fact rosewood this one is the walnut so it's more of a brown color and then there is a beech and that's a lighter a lighter wood almost like an O and that oring there oops one thing I do not like with this o-ring if you can yeah you can see me it just kind of falls in there it it's easy to knock that out because it's not set in there really well this is five G vapes RDA called Washington and it is in squonk mode when you put your atomizer on there I'll show you how it fits that's nice and flush up against the 510 pushing down in that Oh ring creating a nice seal the reason my Washington fits so perfectly on the 510 is because I have changed out one of these peak insulators now these have different sizes you can see one's taller than the other and what that does is that allows you to adjust the internal 510 because it is not adjustable some five 10s on different atomizers are longer than others so if you want it to fit flush all you have to do is swap out the little spacing insulator here and I'm going to show you how to do that there is the flathead slot in there at the 510 I'm going to use that to unscrew the 510 now if this spins you could just stick your thumb on it or stick a allen key or something in that hole just to keep it secure this is actually a very easy process so don't be intimidated by it you just need to unscrew that till that piece comes off and that's going to come off in two pieces there's the peak insulator and the bottom of the 510 now at this point your button will come out all you need to do is push your 510 up and drop it and here's the 510 and here's that spacer you can see how the different sizes will affect how tall at five this 510 sits up all the atomizers that i've put on this box have fit perfectly with this smallest insert i've only had to do this once this is about as difficult as putting a squonk pin in an atomizer I really didn't mind doing this it wasn't the pain in the ass that I thought it was going to be really simple everything just goes back on this will matter how this ends up and I'll show you in a minute what I'm talking about I just get everything lined up and start screwing it together and it back into place you can see that this part has two flat ends and one of those flat ends needs to run parallel with the side of the box to make a nice flush contact with the firing mechanism I just hold it in place with my fingers get my flat head in there and get it so that hole right there that little hole is pointing straight up the tray goes back in and I just kind of turn it underneath to make sure that that's going to be a nice flat contact there it looks like I could use just a little hair turn here I'm gonna do that boom and I'm perfectly flush if I wasn't doing it on camera it would take me literally two minutes or less and I'm set and as I said all the atomizers that I have fit flush on this with that insert in there guys I really like this box the vape experience has been fantastic I'm using an aspire 1800 obviously it is a fully mechanical box so safety precautions are required right there is no locking mechanism on the button so you need to be aware of these things so this box isn't for a beginner vapor it's not for a pocket it's not for a purse it's not for morons let's just put that out there this is not [ __ ] proof this box requires common-sense the actual mechanics of it are excellent they're all either gold plated or silver plated it's brass and stainless steel really high-quality you get a lot with this box the door is about 1/4 inch thick so the whole construction of this it's a quarter inch thick box it's just really well constructed but like everything fits flush together there's no rattle the only little bit of movement I'm getting is from the button the magnets are nice and strong the door has tension as I'm pushing it up so it's just really snug and it fits well together it just looks beautiful bottles fantastic really soft really quality food grade plastic or rubber whatever it is just so nice and squatchy the threading on the bottle is super slick and smooth all the internals like the firing mechanism just fit really well together it just feels solid my battery is nice and tight without the door it's not going anywhere a cutout is really nice and smooth everything it's all rounded edges and it's nice and sanded a logo looks great on the front I'm not thrilled about the supercar logo on the back I think it would look a lot cleaner without anything on there maybe just keep the serial number at the bottom or right supercar in the bottom corner and just leave it like nice and clean because the rest of it just looks so clean and classy and I even love that 5g on the front it just looks beautiful but then you just kind of have this big picture of the supercar which I'm not really fond of now I have to admit at first when I first put in a demise around here when I first took it out of the box it was protruding from the 510 to the bottom of the RDA and of course you know I don't read the instructions or anything I just ripped it out and started playing with it so I was like why is there so much overhang this really is a bummer but then I read up on those little o-ring those spacers so once I put the correct spacer in there everything was flushed it was a really easy process to put the correct peak spacer in there but I guess that could be a con for lazy people kind of together with that the o-ring on top of the 510 is a great little addition it creates a nice lock like a nice seal but then at the same time it doesn't stay in there well the one you just saw in the up close as I was like putting it back together and stuff somehow from then until now I lost it luckily it does come with extras that's a mild irritant once you have your atomizer on top though obviously it's not going to go anywhere performance is a major plus it just it hits hard it hits well I have a point 100 build in here some night chrome aliens and I'm just getting tremendous flavor from their RDA but the way it hits with a good battery in here I'm really enjoying the perform this there's very few cons that I could truly think of that Oh ring on top having to dig out the battery is kind of a pain in the ass it's again it takes 30 seconds extra than if it did have a battery strapped in there I guess one thing I would have liked to see would be a little bit more tension on that button so there's like this itty bitty rattle there could be some sort of some spring or something it's just so minut but it's like the only thing that I can really like if I'm really picking at this thing to try to find cons yeah so that's that's about it and one of the best things about this is it's only $60 I found it online for 50 59 something I will put a link in the description to where you can check this out for yourself I have coils build tools accessories all kinds of cool stuff as Sherlock Holmes comm so definitely check that out I will be giving one of these away this whole entire set up the Washington RDA and the supercar box on my patreon so the link will be in the description a huge thank you to 5g vape for sending this to me to review and a big thank you to you guys for watching if you haven't already definitely hit that subscribe button and if you want to be notified when I post new stuff hit the bell next to the subscribe button so you get my notifications thanks again for watching I'm Sherlock Holmes and I will see you in the next video", "DrRSLuSShD4": "hey guys this is dab connection we're gonna be going over the difference between fake brass knuckles and real brass knuckles this one on my right is a fake this one on my left is the real one and the first indicator which you're gonna see some fakes with this anyway but first indicator look for is the sticker so this sticker is actually on the is on the front and the back I just put the the probably actually got ripped off with the back went on here for effect but it's a same stick you're gonna see the sticker around and there's gonna be you know that little left this little childproof thing there as well and it's gonna have a this tamper-resistant part so there's gonna be the childproof part the stamp resistant and this strain indicator no strain instantly a fake now here's the other part of the real versus fake that I thought I found was most telling so right there you can see this ring right here is metal so it's metal on metal down there now take a look at the fake the fake doesn't have that metal the hardware is different you can see that's almost like a plasticy rubbery piece there that's kind of covering over the metal over there you go yeah you see that in there that's kind of a clear plastic Ness and then right in there you can clearly see that's metal there so that's a big difference and of course this is the Napalm OG one so it does have the name a little bit different here you know other than that you're gonna see the text is gonna be fairly similar on the California ones on the real ones you'll probably see some type of California thing this also says for medical use and I'm not sure that that's always going to be that way it's probably on the newer ones it's might not say medical use anymore because it's not really just medical but really main things look for is that strain and that Hardware difference so the hardware difference is something I've really seen covered before and that's the main difference I think between fake and real if you're not sure you know submit your pictures to us you can go on our website to next calm on the about us page we'd like to take a look at them and we can try to help you tell if they're real or they're fake what we really hope happens is brass knuckles actually put a solid store locator on there and then it's not even an issue the other thing I should just say is brass knuckles is really heavily advertised and people seem to love it but I got to tell you there's a lot of better cartridges out there if you're in California check out arrow Pro arrow Pro is much better check out select oil select oil is much better if you're in Nevada you got select oil you got roots and arrow Pro those are all better and you know that's it I you know it brass knuckles it's okay I see why some people like it but the hardware is dated and that's part of the reason not gonna get a good hit the other thing I should just mention for people in Nevada you know their grams their cartridges are all one gram and there's a limit it's either 80 or 85 you 5% THC that the one gram cartridges can be so you're gonna see half gram cartridges like select in the 90s and select is in California everywhere it's all over the place those are just some brands I think that are better as well just throwing that in there anyway thanks for watching guys and have a great week", "x1SEo05vk5Q": "hello hello cannabis connoisseurs welcome back to the channel Kimo here with a brand new purchase just back from the store with this new paper cartridge called a collab project sativa 0.5 then we're really looking forward to tearing this open so let's get down to and see what's inside all right here we are so we got the collab projects at Eva is 0.51 510 threaded cartridge coming in at eight hundred fifty milligrams THC and eight point five milligrams of CBD okay let's check this bad boy out we have it so got your standard 510 threaded big cartridge here nothing too fancy or you know standard thing you th see warning label on here this little mouthpiece condom ah well alright yeah it's a nice-looking cartridge against as far as cartridges go let's just stick it on the old standard 510 thread battery any one of these bad boys will do for it of course and let's give it a go shall we see I mean yeah it's good mmm I don't know what a bit of a peppery earthy flavor to it definitely nice very smooth on the first draw here so first impression is very nice on this let me check another one out it's a very nice flavor profile going on with this thing I got to admit it's great it doesn't really see what the strain is on it just says sativa but this is really wonderful okay so I'm gonna put this thing through its paces here the next little while and yeah come back and let y'all know what I think of it overall okay so final thoughts on the collab project vape pen here I really like it I've been ripping this thing all day long gives you a nice buzz nice long lasting buzz it's energetic focused sativa buzz great for daytime use great wake and bake extreme it's fantastic the effects are great you're gonna get just a Teva strong sativa buzz out of this thing it's gonna last a lot and we're ripping it all day you know this tank is gonna last you for a while and you're gonna feel good about this little tank and get up and go here for you good value on it like I said went to the store wasn't going to buy this I was going to buy a San Raphael 510 cartridge that was 0.3 grams at 0.5 that was 73 percent THC is 85 percent THC this is three dollars cheaper so value wise this is very easy to recommend effect wise is very easy to recommend flavor wise very easy to recommend it's good taste you got kind of a spicy peppery earthy taste can find a lot of information online about the collab project it's at Eve is 0.5 like I don't know what strain it is which is a little annoying but whatever it is it's really good I don't know if it's all natural cannabis terpene in here if there's a some kind of botanical terpenes added I know they do that with some vapes nowadays I'm not sure but try to find out a little information I tried to get some more from the review I couldn't find much but whatever it is it's really good it's really smooth it's not harsh it's got a good taste good amount of vapor production so overall this thing is really easy to recommend it's good value great taste great effects collab project sativa 0.5 good job guys it's a winner probably would purchase again what's it I want to hear what you say leave me a comment if you tried it I want to know what you think about it if you agree with me or not and yeah we'll see you again for another review thanks for watching keep smoking we'll talk to you soon", "kLfwZxFWgI0": "what is going on you [ __ ] bunch of stoners my name is j-1 and today I am super excited because I am able to review my most favorite straight that I have tried in all the years of being a [ __ ] stoner today we're going to be reviewing some of the gelato flour absolutely love this straight it is my go-to [ __ ] straight if I see this on the menu it's the first thing I am purchasing and medicating on so for all of the for all of those that are familiar with these strain reviews you're gonna take two rips one before we get into some close-ups obviously we set up the tripod get into some nice close-ups of the birds break open some mugs and show some understood trichomes and then we take a second hit to basically a wrap up video so I've got a flat [ __ ] cone here packed in the thick ice glass beaker let us know what strain you were smoking along to to this strain review and cheers to you all yes this is exactly why I love this strange so much so let's get into some concepts let's show you it's absolutely beautiful medicine up close and personal and then we'll get into one more room explain the taste what we like about it and all of that good stuff so sit back and enjoy so the gelato strain is crossed with two very well known strains the girl skate cookies and the sunset sherbet the strain is testing eight at about 20 to 25 percent THC the smell would be described as a very sweet dessert candy like aroma very very nice this strain is like nothing that I've ever smelled before in my life as you can see now we're gonna break open a couple of these nugs and get some shots of the undisturbed trichomes if those of you out there that have tried this before you guys will know why this is my number one strain and for those that have not tried this before if you do have the opportunity to get your hands on some I highly recommend it so enough of the close-ups let's get into another hit and cheers to you all alright so as you can see they're absolutely beautiful beautiful close-ups of this but going off smell this smell for those that have smoked or tried the air the sunset sherbet before in the past very very similar smell very very sweet almost like a dessert or some sort of candy very very nice also when it comes to the heat it is definitely a creeper as you saw from the first hit they're incredibly smooth not very harsh on the throat and was able to snap that with ain't any tickle on the old tone so beautiful tastes absolutely awesome hit nothing too crazy but still a creeper will creep up on you for sure let us know down in the comments if you have ever

live resin vape cart from orchid essentials so this is their gold live resin product line cartridge by pure tech project vapors are the world's first cannabis cartridges emissions tested at afner standards the highest standards in the world puretech ceramic is higher quality than competitors and offers superior flavor and user experience the pineapple muffin so we're gonna check this out i'm pretty excited because i've never had this brand before i was just introduced to it recently so it's gonna be just quite an experience so let's dive in shall we interesting enough i've been having trouble getting into some of the boxes oh there we go okay here we go so easy slide up nice big cartridge here check that out that's the oil and then just gonna twist it on to the battery that i have there they do have a custom nice powerful battery over here and then five four three two one you guys know the rules one hit wow off to the races with that one man that is delicious you've got this beautiful gold live resin inside there i can tell that it's not disliked because of the consistency and there's like this film over um you know over the glass kind of like housing for for this device um let's see taste on that first hit absolutely phenomenal i won't sit here and say that it was extremely pineapple but it was sweet it was piney it was earthy spicy citrusy and i'm definitely energized after that first hitting so second hit there it is there it is you really get that pineapple on the second one okay so 84.6 thc point two percent cbd this is a half gram uh cannabis oil cart delicious manufactured uh what is that july 23rd 2020 score out of 10 for the taste i gotta give it a really high score i'm gonna give it a 9.5 i need to know the terpenes to know what's going on somewhere here change it up make it smaller bigger whatever you got to do i got to know the terps and that kind of lets me know what exactly it is that i'm tasting otherwise it's a perfect score 9.5 add the terps to the back i know what i'm tasting it can for sure uh kind of prove what i have going on in my mouth the high that i'm probably gonna experience bam taste test through and through for that really good um there was a slight metally taste but i believe that it's just because of this battery being as powerful as it as it is so that would be 0.25 for the terps and 0.25 for the battery if there could be something different maybe there should be but i don't know at this point really solid experience very impressed score out of 100 i've got a number in my head already 95 on the taste test the packaging a little tough um one second draw cartridge contains 75 servings cannabis oil distillate and terpenes so ingredients it says cannabis oil and then in parentheses it says distillate and then it says and terpenes so is this live resin or is this a distillate in terpenes i'm not sure let's check the other one it says the same thing we could have a labeling inconsistency here um because of that i gotta give it an eight out of ten because now i'm confused and this would definitely turn me off if i were buying it because now i don't know for sure what it is if they don't know what it is i don't know what it is but aside from that 95 on the flavor the effects the potency the product appeal all those things very high but there is a major packaging and presentation issue going on causing me to drop the overall score to an 80 out of 100 so definitely be sure to tune in uh for more taste test reviews big shout out to orca you guys have a really solid item here let's figure out the packaging and get the numbers up and help the consumers understand what's going on at a higher level so they can trust what's going on here i really appreciate everybody for all the love and support be sure to comment below like follow and subscribe to respect my region and of course share if you can so someone else can learn and and gain from this and i'll see you guys in the next taste test review love you guys peace", "YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if you liked the video hit like hit me up down in the

live respect my region.com here today with a west coast weed tour review today's product the napalm cannabis live resin diamonds vape card this is a napalm og strain this is one of their staple streams exhibits company with ted major partnership going on here in california the napomoji 510 cartridge one gram live resin diamonds take a look at the packaging this right here is what a perfect score for packaging looks like absolutely beautiful the only thing that i can possibly find that i would take away is i need that terpene profile and some genetics listed on the packaging on the presentation but when it comes to looking like absolutely incredible so uh the actual product uh again one gram napalm og live resin diamonds vape cart thc 73.94 percent um cbd 0.55 total cannabinoid 76.82 manufactured by goodwill llc manufactured july 23rd packaged july 23rd twist the cartridge onto a compatible 510 thread battery and draw from the mouthpiece to start vapor flow repeat until desired effect is achieved you guys ready i'm gonna hit it once talk about it hit it twice give it a score out of ten look at that man absolutely incredible and then you can just pull it out using this little cardboard piece here oh there we go i guess that's what it's for huh all right i'll set that right there check this out you guys [Music] napalm branded look at that little emoji right there the little flame that's super dope i love it i love it and then it's got the orange rubber pieces this cartridge is just beautiful the black tip look at that nice colored live resin inside of there check this out you guys get you guys some of that good color right there man all right so we've got a vessel battery we're going to use this here today a vessel five different heat settings this wood grip here beautiful stainless steel or metal i'm not sure how it is it's pretty simple though you just set this in there doesn't fit with the napalm cartridge cool thing about that is you can twist off the little accessory there we go and get it to fit this way simple twist on you don't want to over tighten it so as soon as it's secure done twisting push the button five two three four five and it turns on it blinks and then all you're gonna do is rip it you guys ready oh yeah okay here we go i'm gonna hit it right this time i wasn't sure if it was working so i really enjoy how heavy the cartridge is i think part of the part of what makes napalm different is their commitment to a truly premium luxury cannabis experience um you know the gentlemen that are running the show there are putting the time and energy into making sure that all the you know the eyes are dotted the t's are crossed in every single way the color on this live resin is just perfect and then you look at the actual little flame emoji here the flame branding combined with the packaging that's right here it's incredible i love the orange the sleek black look the uh the terpenes on this are fire this is why i wanted to be able to know what kind of terps i'm tasting in this when you talk about live resin you know you're going to get terp so i'm going to hit it twice give you guys a score on 10. while the flavor the flavor on this is incredible definitely not distill it you know with live resin and sauce pens on the market in california you never know if you're gonna get a true live resin product or something that's been blended with distillate or even just the sauce from all of that um what's what's cool is at the lower temperature i'm getting no burnt popcorn taste i'm getting nothing but earthy pine this sweet berry uh and i think what's cool about that is an og should be sweet and piney and earthy and there should be a pungentness to it and this is definitely roasting the nostrils not because it's hot i'm hitting it on the lowest setting here on this battery five heat settings i'm sure it's around two or two and a half volts or something along those lines but it's absolutely incredible when i think about the battery experience combined with the cartridge although i although it couldn't fit with this one i do feel that the luxuriousness of this cartridge of the the hardware definitely will overcome the fact that it may not fit on all the different devices and just looks sexy and sleek you know this is working even though i had to twist off this little section it's still working and so i think that's wonderful um score out of 10 presentation appeal taste color smell potency um what i recommend hell [ __ ] yeah um experience you know this this for me you know price point depending on the at the at the store this to me is probably a 9.5 out of 10. uh what gets me is going to be 0.25 on the genetics and 0.25 on the terpene testing again we want to know if it's 100 cannabis terpenes we want to know what the terpene profile is at least the you know two or three of the main flavors that we're getting and then the genetics is always helpful to understand the lineage and some more information overall i think this product is immaculate i think napalm cannabis company whether it's the grenade or these items or some other ones that are coming down the line they do a really spectacular drop of the branding so shout out to ted in exhibit putting this together 9.5 out of 10. absolutely incredible from the flavor to the taste to the experience and the high you name it go check it out let me know what you guys think in the comments this is jpeg here man doing a respect my region west coast we tour review 2020 baby we got more reviews coming vessel go check them out i'll see y'all down the road baby west coast we tour peace", "oMshsLsw0UA": "make sure to subscribe because all this is coming up soon and if you like this you're not going to want to miss what's coming up next enjoy the show hey you welcome to my quiz review a juvenile spells this is what i do smoke push hash and shatter too go and check them out i try them off for you if you like rap you will like my news now instead of show thank you for the view what's up world juvenile styles is coming at you with death bubba live resin vape pen so let's open this up and check it out and give it a nice review so as you can see it has a very nice looking box and if you can't tell by taking a quick look at my channel my thing is kind of skulls i love skulls i got a big old collection of skulls here's just a couple of them but so you know i had to so you know i had to get myself the death bubba fate pen to try out sorry so instead of my ass talking all day let's open this up and take a nice look at it so it is a very nice classy looking vape pen it has a very nice design on it and if you take a look it says unicorn hunter certified so after this we might have to go up and get some unicorns you know what i mean just playing obviously of course nobody call peta or anything like that i'm just playing we're good so let's take a nice puff of this and see how good it tastes so i can give it a little bit of a reviewing so it has like a very nice sweet taste i'm sorry we had a little bit of a glitch there so it does have a very nice sweet taste and it does have a very nice like it's not like rough on the throat it's kind of like a nice like smooth hit and it does look like a pretty nice account nice gram inside so i paid like i think it was like 55 50 or 55 for this so it's not really a bad deal when you usually pay about 35 to about 40 or so for like live resin chatter stuff like that anyway so i'd say it's definitely worth it and i noticed that there's this little hole and if you push that you get like a harder hit quicker than without it it like stops the air from going in it to like i don't know kind of like like takes the air away so you get more smoke i guess so and i didn't mention that it has at the bottom a plug to charge it up if the battery dies on you and you can unscrew the top to unplug it so those are some really good quality features about it as well and it says that it's 93 to 98 percent thc so that's pretty good you can't get much higher than 93 to 98 unless you go to the one something percents just just joke no no so i know my humor is a little lame a little dry sometimes so i hope you all get it just trying to keep you on your toes you know what i mean so what we'll do is i'll give a rating of i'll give a rating of 4.5 for the taste and for design and packaging i'll give a rating of an overall five because i mean come on the packaging can't get much cooler very nice box to store it away when you're not using it so the kids don't get at it or something it's easy to put away without losing the pin itself so i guess i'll just give an overall rating of 4.5 to 5 out of 5 to the death bubba fate pin that is a very good choice and it does taste very good so if you ever get a chance to try it out i definitely recommend it it gives you a nice buzz too i'm already feeling pretty good so i definitely recommend it so if you ever get yourself a chance to try it out go get that and i hope you all have some good [ __ ] to smoke at home and i hope you all doing good and i appreciate everybody that comes and spends time spends time over here at juvenile styles and i hope y'all doing good peace now it's time to end the show i'll be back but i have to go now that we're all getting stoned but i got lots more videos so you can stay for show so bust up some more close to roll and watch another show you", "_fAbeW1MhUc": "it's a fantastic day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka zulu and i'm back here for another video guys and today guys boy today is actually a freaking strain that i've been wanting to try for a while a long time um it's been out for a while i mean not too long because it's still kind of new but i think it's been out for at least a month or two um shout out to legion of bloom yeah boy got a legion of legion of bloom uh cannabis derived terp this is the new strain that they have out it's called lemon banana sherbert and it's a hybrid guys check that out hopefully you guys can see that and it's a focus and all that good stuff but um yeah i've been looking at their instagram and seeing all the new strains that are coming out um and not even just from legion to bloom also the freaking um the what's up the honey leaf the honey leaf live resin sauce i also want to try that but um i saw this on flower co and they finally had it guys and i just had to pick it up and do a review for you for you guys so it is cannabis derived terpenes it's sullivant less too guys this is solvent less and i love sullivant list just because most sullivantless product is a lot more smoother on your lungs not as harsh as stuff that's not made um that's not solvent non-solvent but um let me see i'm just looking at the package to make sure um i read all the contents for you guys so the thc content guys 85 thc um but there's 91 cannabinoids in the product there's a little bit of thc v 0.69 percent thcv uh cbn 1.06 percent cbg 2.559 and then you know the delta 9 has the 85 percent i'm not sure what all the other cannabinoids are what they actually do i'm not sure what c thcv does or cb and or cbg does but i've heard of cbg bud and you know if anyone wants to explain what those are down in the comments educate your boy thank you i appreciate that because you know i never try to act like i'm this all knowing person that's why um i always tell you guys if you guys are ever in my live stream i always tell you guys i don't want to be an influencer i'm not an influencer i'd rather you guys go try it out test it out for your own but i'm just giving you guys my opinion my opinion i said opinion my opinion of the product um and you know we all got different taste buds and things that we like you know so you never know so this is what it looks like guys it honestly looks like your typical legion of bloom almost like a raw garden in a scent like the the texture and the color of the oil it looks like some raw garden stuff hopefully you guys can see that it's pretty dark sorry if i don't get a close-up of it um i just don't feel like moving my camera and putting it back and stuff like that right now i just feel like sitting down chilling with you guys and just vibing but um [Music] it's been a chill day guys um nothing eventful today man i've been trying to just make sure i tell you guys if anything eventful happens or something funny happens in my day but nothing really to today's monday and um mondays are usually the hardest the hardest at work is mondays we just have a lot to do on mondays and mondays are usually the hardest

just pop open or turn on the camera and i just go and just say what's on my mind so we got the uni s i put it inside the unis been using the unis more than the uni pro lately so we got in the uni yes so cheers guys let's see what it tastes like okay it's not hidden what the heck hold on guys sometimes the battery does not want to hit it's like not on there fully enough i don't know what's making this not go oh there we go hell yeah it took a while to get going but sometimes um if the car's not perfectly on there with the magnet and it's not perfectly in there or touching it the unis will not work it won't even won't blow any smoke like that like it just blew smoke and then it stopped i don't get why it's doing that all right we're going to use a different battery guys what the heck is going on i don't know but that battery is not working but your boy your boy always comes prepared i always got like two or three batteries on me i just hate it when the batteries don't work when i want them to work man when i want them to work but it's all good we're gonna throw it on the uni uh pro and we'll get to see what it tastes like on lower temp because i think i have this on a lower temp guys so hope everyone's having a good day and [ __ ] man hopefully we get a nice rip from this one i did taste i did get like a little rip and i got a little taste but i didn't get a good rip no a good enough rib [Music] there we go okay guys off jump this [ __ ] is super it's super dang very smooth though very smooth i have to hand it the freaking legion of bloom so far every legion of bloom that i ever tried before and i've tried legion of bloom before i ever posted even on this channel but every freaking legion of bloom that i've ever tried it's pretty damn [ __ ] smooth and that's honestly one of the main things i look for in carts guys is that smooth if it ain't smooth i kind of don't like i'm not really into it [Music] but it's definitely very smooth has a very oh [ __ ] my pool cleaner is going crazy again but it's um very dang very earthy but it also has like a hint i could kind of taste it when i put it on low temp because i have it on the lower temp on this one on this battery it has a little bit of hint of like lemony type taste like lemon taste i said lemony i always like say lemony but i like um just like a lemon type like a citrus citrus yeah more of a citrus taste too so it's not too bad um but it's more it's more on the earthy dank side for sure because i mean it is cannabis derived uh terpenes but um for the most part it's good um yeah it's pretty good and it definitely has like a citrus taste i won't even say it's i wouldn't even say it's like a lemon citrus but it's definitely like a citrus um taste they got going in here the hell yeah

day it's a good day to be alive come to think of it every day is a good day to be alive yo what's up ladies and gents and if you're new to the channel my name is shaka x420 and we're back here for another video guys it's just another chill-ass day it's actually nice and bright today it's actually pretty warm compared to the last couple days where it's just been cold and rainy and stuff um i'm out here in california but today guys man we're um this week has just been a budget week i bought a whole bunch of budget cards so your boy is doing budget cart reviews today so today i got a honey leaf and i'm trying this [ __ ] so you guys don't have to man but um honey leaves they're pretty cheap distillate but i've heard they're pretty good and i've never tried one or at least i've tried one but i've never tried one on the channel i've only tried them like you know in passing one of the homies had one so you know i ended up buying it but i got the northern lights and um it has 92 percent thc it's pretty freaking high in thc but that's a given with the distillate and it has 2.26 cbd guys so your boy we got the ursa bat today shout out to um ursa extracts i came home today and i got two packages um one from ursa x-straps and one from another company they sent me a gravity bomb but shout out to ursa extracts i love the lanyards because i love wearing a battery around my neck you feel me if i ever get big you know i won't have a chain your boy's gonna have lanyards with like different cards like different lanyards with different carts on it feel me so let's open this baby up and let's get into it [Music] like i'm not a big dislike fans but these carts are like 20 bucks 15 20 bucks a gram so when you hear that price you're just like huh should i try it should i try is it worth it do you guys think it's worth it so let's check it out see what it looks like [Music] the oil looks actually looks pretty good i'm not going to get a super close up but you guys can see it it's like a super gold color um darker than raw garden darker than a lot of distillate cards too in my opinion um but let's put it on [Music] and it looks like it's just in like some cheap cars not in an avd card or c cell it doesn't even have a name so you know you gotta watch out for those type of cards guys with either c cell or avd avd cards or one of the cards or any type of ceramic um but avd is um one of the big brands that are kind of dropping their carts and they have ceramic coils inside of them so they look like a normal sea cell but inside they actually have ceramic coils but shout out to ursa extracts man they got a full ceramic cart that's crazy so we might have to get pick up some ursa extract soon a strain that i haven't tried yet or something so cheers guys we're gonna take a rip of this northern lights it's not bad [Music] it's not bad but it's also you know not my type of flavor like it just tastes too much like it doesn't taste like they put any kind of terpenes or anything in it sorry i'm trying to get a fat rip i have it on red on this battery but if you guys don't know ursa strikes batteries uh they only go up to 2.0 voltage so sorry if it doesn't look like i'm hitting it but i'm actually i'm hitting this [Music] [Music] but this is good i guess if you're on a budget you need this lit but it's not the best distillate i don't know if it's just the terpenes they put in it or it's just because they barely put any terpenes or anything flavor but i don't know it just tastes like like basic distillate if you guys ever um had friends who just had a jar distillate and you ever just took in a dab or smoked a little bit of this religious straight distillate you guys kind of know it kind of tastes like that in a way [Music] man i gotta take super heavy hits to get nice hits off of this ursa battery but i do like the ursa battery but yeah guys man i don't know if i like this i would give this cart a rating like six six out of ten just because i would buy this if i was on a budget and this is all i could buy to get me through you know a couple weeks but i would rather go for a raw garden or a stizzy type distillate or any other this one's not as good like i think papa herbs is better than this one i would say papa herbs distill it is way [Music] better but yeah guys man today is just a chill day i just got back from work got some hennessy coming because if you guys don't know on saturday nights i like to drink a little bit of hennessy and smoke a bit with you guys a live stream and this saturday we might even be able to throw some gaming in there a little bit because i finally got fortnite and i finally have cold war on my computer so we probably could play some games too also if we wanted to you know shout out to all the people that are in the live stream man the live streams are actually starting to get a little more fun than the freaking the vlogs man i like the live streams actually um so i'm gonna start going live stream way more often guys um but i'm also doing more reviews i still haven't even tried um that noose dizzy strain that came out i bought i bought it and i just haven't even tried that out yet and i feel like everyone's trying but i'm gonna try that out and probably do like a wake and bake or story time but during the week it's kind of hard to like you know get out and do those types of vlogs because i'm just working but um yeah we're just trying the honey leaf guys man let me know if you guys ever tried honey leaves this is the northern lights 92 percent thc in this it's not bad i'd give it like a six but it's definitely not you know the best quality you know like if you're gonna choose a cheap cart just get a pop of herbs it's cheaper and it tastes better just tastes way better but shout out to everybody that made it this far in the vlog man don't forget to like comment subscribe more vlogs to come i just wanted to give you guys my opinion on this freaking cart but yeah guys more vlogs coming soon don't forget to keep watching guys and let me know if you guys have any suggestion on videos too i'm always open for suggestions and sorry if i don't do the cards that some of

storefronts so i have to drive 30 minutes to go to actual storefront so most of the stuff that i buy is delivery so if the delivery places don't have them i usually can't get them um just because i'm

where we're gonna go on reviewing we're gonna slide over to big gas um do some monsters do some oasis i'm not really 100 sure there's some savages we could check out some savages too so i just got to figure out what what's our next one we're going to start reviewing because the platinum vape line we cooked through that one we cooked through mkx and we cook through all the select elites there are a couple more select elites but like i said some some are half grams and they're like 50 bucks for the half gram and then some of them oh i think there's one or two other sativas that they sold out of before i could get them so i will keep keeping my eye on those because we will finish that strand out the big gas though i do have a big gas here it is a master kush it's like 77 i never really been a big fan of it guess this is the only one i've ever bought in because a guy once told me at the dispensary that they put artificial flavoring in their terpenes and their chirps so when i heard that i stuck i got away from them and i never really messed with them i do a lot of people do enjoy big asses they are quite pricey too from what i've seen about 50 bucks a cartridge so and from what i understand they're actually they they brand themselves as live resin and not terp they're they're live resident so maybe that's why they cost a little more i'm not 100 sure on that but i am going to do some more looking into two big gas products before we start reviewing them all right put out another note let's check out this pineapple punch oh yeah that's got a real sweet pineapple earthy flowery taste i really like that and it's got a punch to it like a punch in your throat punches you in the lungs oh yeah real nice does hit hard though i said it's got it it's got a kick to it and it's got a kick to it nice taste so real flat real flower sweet tasting you can really taste that pineapple in there they really did a good job on this one it's worth nailing down that pineapple taste kind of sits a little crooked on my pen i don't know if it's my pen or my pen oh you're gonna write with it you can write with it daniel my battery kind of sits a little wonky on it but this one here hasn't given me so many problems it's in timeout that's why we're not using it he's he or she whatever it wants to be it's in timeout because it's just been being really wonky and it works and it wants to work and drives me crazy i'll pick it up and i'll get a good hit and then i'll go ahead again and you know those are going to work for me wants to be stubborn and coral with me and i don't got time to coral with a battery so tonight i just snatched up the news battery i like this one it's 1100 i've had i've had about all of them about all of them but i really enjoy the 1100 it's kind of it's kind of thicker and it doesn't have the adjustable the adjusting setting on the bottom here but i don't mind i enjoy it i think this is one of one of the better ooze pins that they make pins batteries that they make real quality that's real quality it's what i said platinum vape is you know they raise the they've always set them i think they set the bar high for other for other brands because they knock down and they nail down the taste of their strands without overdoing it or making it a bit too much now they do have a couple strands that aren't the greatest you know taste wise or whatever they're not the greatest but but i think that's just how it is you're not gonna be they can't you're not gonna knock it out of the park every time i think they do pretty good job though i really do as for this being a sativa is it 85.37 with 3 cbd and i i think that's really good for a sativa to be that high their cantaloupe which is one of my favorites it comes in at a 90. it's a 90. so it's not far off that one it's antelope's amazing check out santa loop if you get a chance i did review it on my channel i believe i did i may not have i might not have it might have been one that i didn't do i'll review on before but if i haven't i will share i'll go back and do it again i don't care not one bit but i've always found in half grams if i can find it in the gram that would be really nice but yeah real sweet okay pineapple punch he gets out there real sweet earthy flower like earthy sweet pineapple has got a real good pineapple taster like you can actually taste the pineapple in it it's really strange and it comes out it you that hits you in it like on your exhale on your aftertaste it's really nice real smooth you didn't overdo it i really enjoy this cartridge it's a really nice one they've done really good with these strands these new ones that they come out with you know the ruts um at first i didn't care for the pint watermelons littles but it will it it it ended up warming up on it i ended up warming up to it liking it so you know you got the zittles the pie driver pineapple punch the lemon cookies but anyways all the ones that the new ones that come out that we've checked out have been really good they've done a really good job and i think that's cool because you know right about the time we were getting frustrated with with not having any new strands out they they hit the market with them and i think that's you know they take their time and they do it right so hey we gotta wait for it then we gotta wait for it as long as we're getting quality cartridges though that's what truly matters you know because that's what we're doing we're spending our money here and we spend our money we want product that's quality we want something that's gonna last you know something that's to taste good some we're not going to be disappointed when we buy it because it is a big purchase you know people can act like you got money and act like you're cool all you want i know i buy these cartridges all the time numerous times a week and i can tell you that they're not cheap and sixty dollars is sixty dollars thirty dollars is thirty dollars you know twenty dollars twenty dollars it is what it is money is money when you're spending it in your hard earned work money that you work for you want something in return it's going to last it's going to like it's going to be enjoyable so therefore that's why i'm here i hopefully can knock these down for you and we can make a you know formative choices on what you're going to spend your money on not be wasteful and enjoy what you get know ahead of time kind of more than what the box is going to tell you oh that is one thing too about this battery is it'll recharge long before it's fully charged so if you do get one of these and it's blinking green or and you think it's good to go i'd probably leave it for another hour because mine was fully charged and it's already at the halfway point quality cartridge really enjoyable i'm not going to smoke too much more of this i like to use it more during the day if i could plus i haven't been sleeping very well i've been having a problem sleeping you know and i'm getting like maybe two hours of sleep tonight sometimes three if i'm getting lucky sometimes there's been a few nights and i just haven't even know what bad just stayed up and then began my day around seven so i'd like to save some of that for the day and hopefully get some motivation tomorrow in case i don't get that much sleep i'll enjoy that um like i said the pineapple punch and platinum vape they knocked it out of the park again i'm giving them a four or five i really enjoy this cartridge if you got in your area and you're able to pick it up one pick it up i think you'll enjoy it too i appreciate everybody all the new subscribers everybody that had subscribed i appreciate you guys so much i really do from the bottom of my heart you never know how

vape when I first started vaping I would always leave my batteries and cartridges inside of my car because I couldn't take them to work and then when I came back from work I would always have leaky batteries leaky cartridges and that was really before I looked into proper maintenance of my oil cartridges so today I wanted to share a few tips I've learned along the way that I'll help you get the most out of your oil cartridge oil cartridges are great great for my producing they preserve your contents for a lot longer like most devices it's the small things that go a long way save you time save you money frustration but you don't want to take advantage of this by refilling new oils in the same oil cartridge do not fill your cartridge more than twice why is this bad to do well if you keep refilling the same cartridge over and over again it can cause leaking clogging lots of paper production thick oils will begin to harden on the wick and you won't be able to vape new oils properly stuck in an endless loop pulsing for good drawls and there's a special circular inhale for things like that especially you'll burn the cotton and the oils and once that happens even the best tasting oils they won't be able to mask it I like to think of it like oil in a car you wouldn't want to change your oil too often without changing your filter and the cotton inside of your atomizer is like the filter in your car you can go and get new oil but without changing the filter you never really have clean oil don't do what I did and leave your cartridges inside of your car or any hot place for that matter I know it might be convenient but for most you out there a good rule of thumb is heat bad cold good high temperatures can not only degrade the oil taste and potency but it can cause leaking the best places to store your oil vapes are cool dry dark places like a desk drawer or a refrigerator put the rubber plug back onto the bottom of the cartridge and start it ideally in a dark place around 70 degrees Fahrenheit or less but don't go too far to the extreme to the other side when stored in the freezer because that can create moisture inside of the cartridge so avoid heat and avoid freezers but now when you take your cartridge out of the fridge the oils gonna be thick and all thick oils need to be primed first priming your new oil cartridge is going to make the difference between the first hit being smooth and magical or dry and burn the nasty teetsi oil is thick so you need to give it some time to soak into the atomizer here's how to do it make sure your oils are at room temperature if they're fresh out of the fridge pull the cartridge in between your palms for about two to three minutes to warm it up if you're loading an empty cartridge only fill it with a small amount so if you run into problems you don't waste all your oil take about five polls on the cartridge without the battery being attached what you're doing is simulating vaping and pulling a little oil from the atomizer then attach the cartridge to the battery and give it a try I recommend pulsing the battery here it's the best way to ensure that you're not burning your oils if it's still too cold go back and warm it up and then try it again so there you have it guys those are the main ways to get the most out of your oil cartridge dont refill it more than twice always prime your new coils and always keep them in a cool dark place to prevent it from leaking on you keep in mind that not all cartridges have wigs some only come with ceramic or glass cores it's your responsibility to know what you're buying it's always smart to clean the bottom of the cartridge before storing it with cotton swabs or alcohol wipes that way when you take the rubber cap back off you can see if it's leaked hopefully these tips helped you guys where do you personally store your cartridges if you have any other questions leave them in the comments below let us know subscribe to god vape for more videos like this thanks for watching peace", "aiOwvK57Jsw": "Lotte's has been made of vaporizing being safer than smoking marijuana and my question to you is does science agree with that is there science backing up that vaping is safer than smoking yeah 100% in fact sometimes I feel like because there are so many brands that people are forgetting that right off the top the minute we're not combusting where I'd say in the 95 percent range of being better right so if you take a joint for instance where I'd say 90 percent of that smoke is just carbon and foot that you're putting into your lungs and the rest is good THC and it's great with the vape pen you basically get all the THC and such and yeah we talked about the propylene glycol it's just not the toxins that are in something that is lit up I mean it's just that simple so yeah vape pens by definition are just way better than smoking and it's kind of like the marijuana equivalent to the e-cigarette revolution and you can't you know step foot outside this building without seeing people with their ecigs and that's a good point that you made because already you start to see the guise of truth calm having their easy commercials and kudos to them because nicotine is not THC I don't want to have them lumped in not only that nicotine juice is unregulated and out there and comes from China and has who knows what in it and so it shouldn't be confused with like what I'm doing and what even other cannabis vapor providers are doing because one thing about our over-regulation is you know they're looking at us and so we put cannabis resin we put our vapor carrier and that's it and then that goes out for testing but we can't say the same thing for the tobacco industry guys they're kind of just wah wah West and I've seen people trying to quit smoking using e-cigs because they were supposed to be a cessation device and end up huffing more nicotine than the darn Marlboro red so oh I you know definitely not to be confused I feel like on the cannabis side it's being used correctly because it's safer and less carcinogenic than smoking and you know the idea is to have potency in there so we're not trying to get mean people off of THC but we also are in such a regulated environment that we're making it here it's not coming from overseas it's not it's being tested so you know that you have any craziness in there besides just your cannabis resin and your vapor carrier sure Brian vaping is it safer than smoking in your opinion I think it is and I don't know I'm not a scientist I don't know sure but I mean it just makes sense if you're combusting at a much lower temperature than lighting something on fire I mean that's got to be better and anecdotally I mean it feels better on my lungs if I use a vape pen versus smoke a joint so I think that it is what would be interesting is if you know the truth calm and whatever they they do their studies and if they find that although nicotine cigarettes are not safe but they happen to be safer than cigarettes then okay they just show that it's safer I'm really looking forward to the science you know as a journalist we we thrive on information correct information factual information and so I'm really looking forward to the science that's to come to tell us because certainly when you're inhaling a vapor it feels better on your lungs it feels less invasive than smoke if you have access to any studies but ya know Islands III could forward it to because yeah they they have captured samples and it's really it's amazing I mean like the list and even just cannabis if we just keep it the canvas smoke cannabis probably I believe numbers like 130 different components and chemicals that come from lighting because you're not just lighting THC give all that green matter right and of course I'm like even old schoolers like myself swear by it you know uh but none of that stuff you need and it's not and and that's why in recreating the vape pen and trying to keep it strange specific I want to make sure that I'm bringing everything we need and of course there are old-school guys that are like well it's nothing like smoking and so I'm like oh so those other chemicals are what you're after no it's like literally a hundred plus chemicals in something that's combusted and in a vape pen it's not it's just the ones you put in and a wig I call to THC resin yeah and I think that's part of the point it is nothing like smoking you know and our our we have asked the cannabis columnist who asks oh she answers a reader questions she does a really great job of that but somebody was asking about the high from vaporizing and she said that some people quite accurately call it kind of like a half high because it's not giving you the Joel that smoking flower will do would you guys agree with that I definitely would yeah I mean I think it's more mild I don't know yeah yeah it's not as intense although if you take three or four hits off of a pad I mean you get high the analogy we use internally is uh we want to be more like the wine right so if dabbing is spirits and whiskey and so sand smoking a joint is kind of like that we want to be more like the wine or the beer right it doesn't knock you down but you can continue to vape it and eventually not be at a half hot you know I would I would say dabs are more like the grain yes exactly this world because and granted I've not dabbed a Brian props because wow I can't have that try it right cuz I sell it but yeah I wish I could be in the boat with you guys I had as soon as I with the torch it was a little bit much but with the advent of the electric nail the minute I saw that like a couple hemp cons ago a couple years back I you know lines of people I love in the cannabis industry how everything goes out the window right like it doesn't matter how grimy the hippie in front of you is if somebody's giving free dabs as soon as he steps away you're stepping up to that piece of glass it's so crazy but the electric nails were amazing we were at the Cow Palace in San Francisco and the fire marshal just been through saying no smoking you know no open flames and literally there was like a chuckle because every single vendor had like an email there and people were just dabbing in like the rise of concentrates was happening I guess like 2013 so of course I got one of these electric nails and of course since I'm constantly in the nectar collecting business and making wax it's hard not to taste it but it is strong and it is something that even I as a would-be cannabis professional only use at home because you know I remember the first time I dabbed it was like I thought they went through my mind was like it's high school high it was like that high that you would never that I'd forgotten about oh wait you can actually be too high and uh yeah but you definitely knew I think a lot of our viewers and sympathise", "yoZbe2XLzOc": "I want a transition here and start getting to some science sure so Ohio approved multiple routes of administration for medical marijuana some of the ones off top of my head would be sublingual like the tinctures inhalation methods whether you're vaping off of dry flour or vaping off of oils or concentrates oral where you actually swallow the medication capsule form of gummy form and topical where there's lotions and patches yeah so can you kind of run us through those different routes of administration some pros and cons some on set duration just some of the science behind that sure and that's where it gets tricky and that's where I think another benefit I'm having a pharmacist on staff helps they didn't really get a good sense of the science behind it and why different routes of administration might be better for different patients so really the roots of administration one it boils down to convenience that's a big factor for instance if you're buying flour you have to you know loaded into a vaporizer grind it up versus if you buy oils that you can vaporize it could be quicker and simpler onset of action what kind of condition are you dealing with so if you're dealing with severe pain that comes on every now and again suddenly you need something that works quickly if you are dealing with having trouble you know say you have some seizure disorder and it can come on at any time so I need a baseline level of some sort of compound in cannabis you probably want an edible form because you're not dealing with the symptoms all day you just want to prevent them so PT SC is another thing you never know when an attack may strike or some sort of them severe anxiety you may come across so some people may want the edible form and other cases sometimes you want to take something that works immediately where you could do the tinctures and keep it under your tongue and have a quicker onset of action so it's all what you feel comfortable with some people don't like inhaling so they would prefer a quick onset of action and sublingual is their best read some people may not even want to absorb cannabis at all they may have a localized condition some sort of skin inflammation localized pain they could put a top to pull on mm-hmm and other people may like the convenience of a patch where you're absorbing it and it's a long-acting product unless 8 to 12 hours so it's all patient specific based upon the onset of action what kind of symptoms you're dealing with and not just what you hope to gain from the product so it's not a one-size-fits-all solution the good thing about having these different methods of administration is the fact that depending on what your symptoms are what your condition is what you're hoping to gain from it there is something out there that is tailored to that need ok very informative", "j7IOky6Wkkc": "we'll stop here by simple Anthony hero follow kind of it's live and we're back with another review video make sure you like subscribe and watch the end for a chance to win a free grinder piece another mastermind head [Music] what's up everybody boy mastermind we're back with another video I'm here live while kind of his live and today we're talking about a product from Wellsprings Fields this is a live resin crumble the name of the product is train is called snow Ripper tested at five hundred eighty seven milligrams has total CBD of six point five two and does have a terpenes here check that out there on the bottom there and it comes in this box this box you got a peel the sticker off here and go through all this the box is just too much and inside we have a little stick and we've got the product here now in order to get the product out there here it is here's the back of it you have to turn this one and this is I don't like this you turn this really hard and there you've got it open you can see the product how does it obviously this is like I said a crumble snow Ripper and smells amazing what I'm gonna go ahead and do is try some in the packs which guys and like I said whenever you're doing this you know you just really need a small amount for your packs you don't need to you don't need to overload very small dab here in the oven you can almost not even see it it is in there and we're gonna go ahead and heat up the packs see what happens let you know what my first impressions are there's a bird flying around out there so you might hear a bird an eagle or something in the background the video I don't know what's up with that so yeah but yeah my thing about the packaging is the box is too much and the cap is too hard tool those are my main things about the packaging so let's see how it tastes that we're almost here to our temperature here you know here paksas I have mine on number three on the third light so that he was where I keep mine at for me but you could run it on 420 and get a little bit hotter but I don't really feel like it's necessary and so I have a green light now I'm gonna hit it the water test I would say is doing great underwater guys still hitting lots of vapor still coming [Music] all right now I'm gonna stop the video for a second and I'm gonna come back in about five minutes and let you guys know what I'm feeling you ride that alright I'm back so you know it's been about actually ten minutes and basically the bird is still crowing out there see my store a bird in the background you know I feel any relief predominantly in my back and in my knees positive energy so I think it has a little bit of effect on my anxiety because I do get anxiety and that can be kind of tough for me to do videos I feel a little bit of relaxed let's look at the chamber and see how well it vaporized see if we saw anything then left look at that look at that folks there is nothing the chamber is empty so that's back to what I was telling folks before is that with concentrates you don't need nowhere near the amount you would use even if you was to do flowering in the packs or even if he was to do your pin you would still not need a whole lot of concentrate for one session for one person now maybe two you might add a couple a little bit more but again it's really the key word is dead just a little tiny bit but concentrate will go a long way so a lot of people I think will go through the concentrates thinking they need to put a big bunch in there or maybe that'll make it last longer but really with its oil based in a lot of ways so oil burns for a while so you don't really need to overload your pass if you do you really is going to end up with a lot of extra in there and when you think it's going it's not gonna be gone and you know typically with the packs if you you burn it all the way dry you'll notice too won't me vapor come out of it but the most time I never really do that I mean usually there's a little tiny little residual left but when you dead when you get the right dose in there you will find that you were able to comfortably vaporize the entire dose and won't really be nothing left for you to clean out all your deal just really wipe the up and out and what I do is wipe like Hex's I take an alcohol wipe like this one here these are just the ones you get at Walmart or CVS and then I take it and I just go in here and I clean around my going around the inside of my oven and that gets any oils it may have spilled inside there out and I've also taken a little plate it comes off it's down in there out and that's most helpful now as far as cleaning the oven it's so all you have to do is a sticker you're - stick in there preferably while the oven is warm just take your cut your alcohol swab whatever they call alcohol pad sorry we're a wet alcohols q-tip will work as well but I feel like this works better because I could take my - deep and kind of you know roam around in there until I've got any a little bit of oil out of there and I have like basically I like to call a brand new oven and that just means that when I put something else different in the oven it has no other contact cross-contamination as far as flavors I want to make sure I'm tasting whatever I'm tasting you know something else you do because you can go on Amazon and buy you know extra ovens there knock off others that are not as nice as the ax oven itself and what I mean by that is they're just coming they slide out of here a lot easier and that's not great for me because when I'm cleaning my turn upside down sometimes and this will just fall out hot you can burn them in so they're only sixteen dollars for two it comes in a nice little case little metal case you get here you can put them in there and I made the extra hole for my other evidence like I have all three of my doses now I'm gonna have three different deaths three different flavors I can use this you know to put them in there so it comes in really handy so with that I'm gonna go ahead and rip wrap this video again if you'd like to see them make sure you like subscribe and one see change in a program make sure

says tangerine Dream's i knocked my camera around sorry everybody make you dizzy i don't know if you can read that or not it's tangerine dream all right so it's cut a petite see warning on there I got a little plug on the end so pretty straightforward its kind of hoping you'd be able to have a visual to see how much is in there I don't know how you know how you're gonna know when it's done I guess it's just gonna stop so yeah alright so this is it it's got a you know not much heavier than a man pretty lightweight not too big you know you can steal it in man pretty nice yeah just don't see

very tasty well there's a yummy one so there you go unboxing for a San rafeal tangerine dream stay tuned I'm gonna give you a review on the effectiveness that this here alright so I've been putting sting through his paces a little bit taking eight nice big rips off it five seconds on each and yeah I can say I'm starting to feel that feel the effect a bit got that dastard cerebral high going on you know it back here I see you know got a nice burst of energy feeling nice and creative and happy yeah so kind of like I spoke to smoke the tangerine dream do not too bad very very yummy it's good about a vapor you know it's not bad one thing I noticed is that you don't get a lot of smell afterwards that I can tell anyways so that's nice it's a little bit inconspicuous the pen itself it's pretty I don't know if that's necessarily inconspicuous it's a blue pen people are gonna know what these are right away especially with that THC warning right up top there but it's a sticker you could peel that off it's no problem yeah not too sure how long it's gonna last like I said there's no way to see inside to tell how much is left how much is in there it's 0.15 grams doesn't sound like a lot we're gonna see I put it through its paces you know at last I'm gonna take about five second drips every time I'm gonna keep track good night here comes ten well five seconds taystee yeah yeah you do notice it kind of effect pretty quick it's an onset it's pretty quick it's not bad I like it the flavor that you would expect smoking tangerine dream it's there it's not overwhelming though it doesn't taste like anything's been added it doesn't taste like it would pumped up or anything it just tastes like how it tastes you know a citrusy tangerine taste the whole taste is in the name tangerine dream yeah so far really enjoying it fantastic we're gonna see how long this lasts you're gonna keep smoking it I'm gonna keep counting we're up to ten big rips already well not big wraps but you know keep it average and yeah we'll see how it goes well check back a little later okay so back here to do the wrap on the old san rafael 71 tangerine dream disposable bait pen okay started out really liking this thing a taste is great gonna let you know doesn't last too long 35 hits I got off this thing about five second draws each I find that I would deal about five each time that would get me to a really good spot you know like as if I smoked the dupe so that's gonna have a joke too about seven joints I don't know it's $32.99 your mileage may vary with that you know you might like three second drives might only take you two less to get where you want to be gonna say you know that for like a heavy experienced user this is not going to last very long it's gonna last like a day two - max intermediate users might be able to stretch a week out of this but yeah that's not gonna last too long it's 32 99 again no way to tell when it's gonna be done you can't see inside at all you don't know how much is in there when it's gonna be done how much is left another thing still lights up even when it's like finished I've had vapes from Washington Oregon that the lights will blink and then it'll just stop as a bit of an indicator done so that's a little disappointing there's really no way to know if it's done unless you're counting you know like I was so you can expect about thirty five five-second drips on here the taste is great on these things for the most part after around 25 rips or so the taste wanes quite a bit you don't get that tangerine taste as much and you get a bit of a metallic taste another thing that I've noticed is that this area here can get kind of hot if you're doing I'm like in repetitive you know drags not too bad but just something to note I don't know I don't know how good this thing is suited for doing a session with friends I don't think you would last very long might get a little hot too one thing that's good is this little plastic thing stays on here you see there's a hole on there so you can keep that on if you want to pass with friends and take it off for yourself or whatever so yeah it's pretty much a premium item I don't know if it's quite worth the $32.99 this is like 20 bucks I think would be really good 35 is a little high you know I want to recommend it but it's it's a specialty purchase I really want to like these things because it's so cool so convenient like if they tasted so great at first but for me personally it just doesn't last long enough they say your mileage may vary might be a good value for you I might buy these once in a while as a bit of a treat or something but yeah I can't see myself buying too many of these but did enjoy it while it lasted so that's my review of the San Rafael 71 tangerine dream disposable vape if you have any comments or experiences with it just leave me a comment I'd like to know what you think I see what works for you but other than that thanks for watching and we'll see you again on another review or video soon", "KJcjYTArjIw": "hi guys under here from Essex UK UK thanks for joining us today we're will be looking at how to clean your vape pen just a quick short video just to show you how to clean various pens we'll be looking at a standard Eagle where you just replace the head normally and also a slightly more advanced vape pen with replaceable coils in in the in the middle just to show a few extra tips basically on how to prolong the life of your vape and the main reason for keeping them nice and clean and tidy and so oh yeah so you will need a few things to start with first being cotton buds or q-tips whatever you want to call them next paper towels pretty essential really and also what I would recommend is a nice bottle of of just warm water well that'll do you nicely I've come across this that came in and another ecig kit which works perfectly it's got a nice fine tip so you can spray with it and it's very squeezy so if you've got one of these that come in very handy if not just use one water straight out really tough so let's crack on okay so let's start with the the Eagle tea setup here so this is standard pen with the replaceable end with your wicks in so normally what you'd do is you'd smoke this with a any liquid in the recommend that you don't really change your liquids using the same cartridge I don't have that much of an issue with it as long as it's quite empty but there is another way so they start by taking a report intake can remove the battery for now put the battery to one side so what we can do on the the atomizer side of things you can take your you tip off so you would normally fill it straight up through there and I've got a bowl here I'll just use this too to keep the little bits and bobs in so that's as far as this one breaks down it doesn't break down any further than that so you would normally just replace this or have a few spares so what I find is if you take your warm water in a squeegee bottle like so and just squirt it down inside and put your finger on the end and give it a bit of a shake then just discard the rest in here and do that a few times try not to overfill I can get the stuff down the middle in fact what I'll do I'll put the end on it's probably a better way to do it and give it a good shake again you can see the wicks are starting to come nice and clear all of a sudden it really works well it's quite an effective way you know maybe you've come to the end of an e liquid and you have another one and you just want to quickly give it a nice clean it's perfect where to do it so you can see all the the residue coming out here I think you can't anyway there you go so that's pretty much it so what I would do now is take a paper towel and just give it a nice wipe down and then ideally what you want to do is kind of try and shake out as much of that water as possible because obviously the more water you've got in there when you fill it with a liquid it will dilute so you can check out as much as possible it's quite a bit coming out there when I'm shaken into the ball but it's now running clear you can see that the the wicks inside are fairly clear they're not yellowy color off the the yellow liquid that I had in there there's still a bit of water in there I wouldn't worry about that too much you might even be able to get a cotton bud in to some elements of that too to dry it out a little bit I'll just leave it with the top off and leave it for an hour or so and that'll dry out nicely before filling it back up with a liquid similarly with the the top the drip tip should give that a nice wipe down and around the o-ring seal make sure that's sealed nicely and then you can use a cotton bud if it fits and just clean out the inside of the drip tip as well just to get rid of all all the flavor and all the residue that can build up because obviously over time the more that you use these things the more that the liquid kind of breaks down and can stick to your apparatus so that's it let's pretend that's dry inside so that's now ready to go another tip would be to make sure that the bottom doesn't have sometimes you can get a bit of e-liquid seeping into this area so again it's quite simple just give it a wipe round the dry or very slightly wet damp cotton bud get into all the nooks and crannies and give it a nice wipe here because at the end of the day this is where the electrical connection heats up the wicks inside off the battery so you need to make sure that's always nice and clean and similarly on the battery end of the connector you sometimes see a little bit of residue down in here see if I got a bit closer for you so again just clean that out with a cotton bud you should do this maybe every few days or at least once a week just to prolong the life and it genuinely will prolong the life of year your lluvia pad okay so screw it back together now you've got a nice clean atomizer ready for the same a liquid more e-liquid whatever you want but that will that be good to go so I would recommend that you dry it out because obviously the water will swipe you don't leave you a liquid but all in all that's you know it's good to go so let's have a look at a slightly different this one is an Apollo brand it screws off the same has a very similar battery again probably make sense just to give you a battery connector a quick clean but actually did have quite a bit of any liquid in there so that's nice and clean now inside there's that to one side and then we have this which is their atomizer which has a coil inside so this one does break down fairly well so first of all we will take the coil section off the bottom and I place that to one side for now now see if there's any extra a liquid few drops not much in there so nice smell this one this is watermelon so again take you your bottle with your warm water in and squirt it down the side like you would with a liquid then again finger over the end give it a shake pour away the residue and I would do this a number of times just to to get as much of that a liquid out as you can again don't fill it to the top leave some room so when you shake it has a room to maneuver around the getting the nooks and crannies there we go so that's pretty much running clean again so two squirts two shakes and it seems all good again and I can see through the the clear window on the side that that is really well it doesn't smell at all now again take a cotton bud and just clean out all or as much as you can of the actual drip tip and the same inside as well around here and then in this case I can't get my cotton got very far down inside so what I can do is I can just take of a bit of kitchen roll of a paper towel roll it out at the end that fits nicely down inside now turn that round inside and I'll get the rest of the liquid that the the cotton bud couldn't reach go that's gone all the way through so that is now perfectly clean as good as new so the coil and this is a bit more messy like I said this has a replaceable coils so this coil screws out like so out of the base place the coil on the paper towel for now and I'll just take the the end I'll just squirt some water over it there's no extra parts in there just to remove all the liquid there I'll take another paper towel and just give this a clean get all the extra water off the main thing to remember here is everything's cleanable with water you've just got to try and get all the water off again once you've finished the cleaning process so that's all good I think what I'll do is I'll take a cotton bud and just wait round inside with a dry cotton board just to get that residual water out here we go it's there that's a clean base and a clean top now the coil the coil itself as you can see if I get a bit closer there there's not a great deal you can do with this you don't really want to get water onto the wicks as such I'm going to try and avoid that so what you can do is you can just wipe it around on the end to get as much of that yield liquid off as possible and any residual stuff on the end get that off and the other end and if you've been really picky what you can do is you can roll some more kitchen roll up and you can go all the way through the section and down the down the center but I don't see too much use for that and at the end of the day these are replaceable coils but what it means is when you when you have a VM with repairs or Kyle's it does make it a little easier to to take because you can take it apart and makes a lot easier to clean so there we go so let's put this back together so the coil goes in this section and the whole thing goes together like so and pop the battery back on so there you have it we have two perfectly clean as good as new there and ready to go so I hope that's helped yeah you clean everything pretty much the same as what I've just done with these two examples or via pens working pretty much the same manner and yes the same goes even with so bomb setups with with saban tanks you break them down as much as possible clean as much as you can with warm water and for the same reasons it's just to prolong the life if you vaporizer you know so you don't have to to to spend as much on on replaceable x' as as you might do", "ZvfF8rCMoKM": "welcome everybody to the snow Hovey per coat channel I'm Travis and today what I have for you is a how-to on taking your vape through the airport I have a few different bakes for us to cover and what you need to know before heading to the airport for your next trip and what to do with your vape supplies before you get there all right everybody let's jump right into it and don't forget to subscribe to our channel if you like this content and definitely hit that like if you think this video is helpful let's dive right in okay so we're gonna break this down by category of vape so the first category here is going to be pod devices it's super easy to bring your pod devices on pretty much any airline in the u.s. check with each airline individually if you're flying out of country but here in the US these you won't really get any issue for because they are okay to bring in your personal carry-on bag the way you really want to take these guys on airplanes is you want to bring these with you you want this to be in your personal carry-on baggage that being said and the couple tips that I would have for anyone bringing these on to airplanes is to keep in mind that you are gonna be thousands of feet up in the air and what that will do will pressurize the cabin you're in if you've ever had a water bottle that expands when you get up to altitude and when released releases pressure that's exactly what's gonna happen inside of your tank and what that will cause is your tank or your pod in this scenario the leak out so what you want to do is put these guys in a plastic bag the pods that you have orthopod here put this guy into a plastic bag when you go through security you just want to make sure that this device itself is outside of your pocket maybe somewhere visible maybe in the purse or the bag that way if it does set off any metal detectors or any scanners pick it up and they notice it's the battery they know exactly where they can see it firsthand they don't really have to pull you aside to check these items the next products I want to talk about which have a wider range of accessories let me start by saying the TSA isn't searching out these products and pulling people aside or confiscating them if you follow the rules so I wouldn't worry too much about losing your device or losing your tank or liquid as long as you follow these rules and this is coming straight from the TSA website so that being said here's a common set up a box mod style set up with a tank and two 18 650 batteries on the inside now I'll show you what I'll need what I'm gonna need is a battery case something like these guys that will hold up to four batteries what I will have with me is more than likely a battery charger and a bottle of juice now what we're gonna do is break down each one of these and what you'll need to do to stay ready what I'm gonna break down here is battery cases and how to store your batteries before you actually get to the security lines and while you're on the plane any lithium batteries with 100 watt hours or less in the device which does pertain to these batteries can be put on your carry-on or checked bags with special instructions on the check bag you will want to bring these on your carry-on the main reason why is they don't have special requirements other than a case because you're in a pressurized environment meaning that these batteries in an unpressurized cargo area are more likely to have issues than in a pressurized environment you're gonna want to get yourself at least a four bay battery holder this will ensure that you have two sets of battery capacity that way if you want to have extra battery life wherever you go you're gonna have room for that take the batteries out and you can use either battery case place each battery within the holder start and voila there you are there's minimal rattle but there's spacing between them now if you don't like plastic and you don't like that rattle and you want something a little more secure find one of these rubber guys because there's no noise there and it holds them really secure separates them from every other battery so there's no issues and it just feels better has a little key ring on it it's very easy to do the next thing I'll go ahead and cover on this particular device is going to be around the liquid first thing that I would recommend for everybody to do is make sure that your tank is near empty now you're not gonna want to vape this while it's near empty so get all your vaping in before you get to the airport ape this down get it all the way down as low as you can or pour it out go ahead and pour it out now what you're gonna want to do is go ahead and close up the airflow on these tanks what's that a hundred percent closed it'll help eliminate from the rest of the liquid that you leave from leaking but to prevent that further take off your tank close up that airflow your a really good job and close that up put this in a bag and that bag will more than likely be the same bag that you're gonna put your liquids in which brings me to my next segment you're more than likely going to have a bottle of liquid with you at least one maybe two or three that being said the TSA does say you can bring a liquids with you either on your carry-on or checked bags so what I would recommend is if you have any larger size bottles the 120 mils or above put that in your checked bag you're not going to get questioned on that and you can carry quite a bit you could probably put ten bottles in there and not really get pasul for any reason now if you have this bottle and you want to bring it on your carry-on they're gonna toss this bottle this is a four ounce bottle and the maximum they allow you to bring for a liquid is going to be three point four ounces or 100 milliliters the more bottles you have the more likely they are to stop and search you so bring the one bottle you need to have you and put the rest in your check bag if you're not checking a bag try to bring only what you need for that trip maximum I'd say in my experience what I've had on me maximum is about four or five bottles and I've never really been questioned this is your standard 60 ml bottle and what you're gonna want to do with this when you do put it in your carry-on and what you want to do with this when you put it in your check bag is you want to put it in the same plastic bag as the tank and the reason for that is so they can easily check all your vape gear all in one spot and know hey this is all for vape super easy you don't have to pull out multiple bags you just stay organized the reason I'm telling you this is TSA wants all of your liquids in a quart two gallon size bag you will not be questioned and as you go through the line you're gonna want to pull that bag out and set it in one of the trays with other products it does not have to be by itself but you'll want it there in a plastic bag for them to be able to easily access and when it goes to the scanners and they see that it's a liquid they'll say oh okay this is a vape bottle but even in your check bag you're gonna want that in a plastic bag because again you're going up to a high altitude this bottle is going to expand and chances are you might experience some leakage these two sizes are pretty easy to put in any bag you can put it in the Ziploc court or gallon size bag that you have or you can put it in your regular bag if you're not worried about it spilling and this is more common for people using like a pod style device but it's small so it does take up less space and if you're only a carry-on type person you might try finding some smaller bottles just to take up less space and maybe have a sandwich style to court style bag in my experience I've never been questioned for one or two small bottles of liquid now the last item you're going to bring with you is going to be a battery charger these guys are very easy to take with you put it in your check or carry-on bag more than likely this is going to go into your check bag you don't have any special requirements on these guys you can pretty much put them anywhere as long as they're not powered okay so the last thing I'm gonna go ahead and cover is mechanical mod users and rebuildable users now I do want to make this very clear that you are traveling with a metal hollowed-out unit okay so in here what you have is basically a red flag now if you're traveling with one of these more than likely this is not going to be an issue you've got ten of these that's gonna raise some flags so just keep that in mind if you've got a lot of these you're bringing with you somewhere put them in your check bag now I know circumstances sometimes warrant you to carry them on that's not what this video is about though that being said you're gonna want to take your battery out you're gonna want to take your RDA RTA off I do not condone tanks on a hybrid style mod once you've disassembled your bulk pieces you can leave the tube all in one piece you're gonna want to have a carrying case purge is a very good product for this not only do they give you this hard case to be able to hold it it's also a pressurized cave cut out your insert place your products in here see how easy that was and there you are that goes literally anywhere literally anywhere before you go to the airport make sure you get court and/or gallon sized bags to store all your liquid on if you're carrying on don't carry anything over a hundred milliliters or 3.4 ounces make sure you have a battery case that way you can put your batteries in that case do not leave them in the device that'll raise some red flags that'll slow you down if you're bringing a mechanical mod keep in mind that is a metal cylinder it can raise some flags just because you did everything right that doesn't mean you're not gonna get stopped you may get stopped but if you do everything right it's gonna be a quicker process you'll be able to pull everything out identify it quickly do their swab tests and move right along so I hope this video was helpful for again if you thought the content was helpful you liked it like the video subscribe to the channel check out the other videos that

"zNw380j9ctY": "hey again everybody this is Ken eccentric films back at you with another strain review this will be my second recreational cartridge review of Illinois cartridges if you recall in my first video I reviewed the Cresco kosher tangi liquid live resin cartridge so for my second video I thought I would explore a different company another one of the more prominent companies that I've seen here especially in the Chicagoland area but in Illinois in general Verano and the strain I went with was mag landrace I don't know too much about the strain other than the fact that I was drawn to it because of the word landrace in there because I am a big plant enthusiast so whenever I see the word landrace it grabs my attention but the mag landrace is an iranian landrace that was originally propagated in Illinois according to verrano's website so this is a 0.5 gram oil cartridge compared to the Cresco cartridge which was also a point 5 gram that that one cost $85 and this cartridge was $77 both of those figures are after-tax so a little bit cheaper since the Cresco Koecher tangi is the only other recreational cartridge i've tried here Illinois I'll sort of use that as my frame of reference and reviewing this cart so with that said in comparing those two I would say that Cresco Koecher tangi had a more vibrant profile in its flavor however I wouldn't say this was flavorless by any means it just didn't sort of linger in your mouth as long which i think is sort of a pleasurable thing from certain carts the flavor for this one was sort of a piney spicy cookies sort of taste and it was sort of creamy in that regard but it wasn't anything super potent in terms of flavor but on the other side of the coin this mag landrace cartridge to me was infinitely more potent than the last one which was not you know a weak heart by any means in terms of its effect but this was just super couch lock inducing really good for relaxation I would advise people that have had sort of like too much of a body high before to be a little cautious with how much you use this cartridge because the the pure indica label is very accurate I would say it's very sedating so you don't get panicked thoughts but you can get a very strong body high which I know for some people can cause them to feel more panicked but yeah that's about it with respect to the price I think this one was a little cheaper but the effect was much stronger the only difference was that it wasn't quite as volatile in its flavor but that's just a matter of perhaps different strains and different processes and the other one is liquid live resin and this one's just labeled as an oil cart so I don't exactly know what it is if it's BHO or you know any other kind of concentrate but that's about it overall I'd say Verano did a great job with these carts and I'm definitely gonna try out more of their strains they have some great looking ones let me know if you've tried Verano let me know what other carts you're trying right now and which ones I should check out but thanks everyone hope you have a great day", "Ob-NUSJPlAM": "male leader made with 100% organic ingredients cannabis flowers

talked to you about this before about how to do it I just do mouth to lung which is I inhale it in my mouth I hold it hold the vapor in and then I inhale again and I push it down and then I just let it out so let's see and this should light up green to tell me that it is working I'm getting something okay I see this one is definitely a little bit stronger than the one that I had yesterday again this is the distillate high-cbd two to one yesterday well the previous video because it's not gonna be yesterday for you guys but the previous video it was ten to one so it's a little bit different again this is two to one I did two pools on the ten to one and it was incredibly mild I think on this one I'm going to do two because it is two to one so it is a lot stronger so I'm just gonna do two on this one and then later I'll let you guys know how it made me feel like I said this one is a little bit stronger than the one that I had yesterday it's spicy the other one yesterday was up was a very clean flavor but this one has some spice to it spicy and a little like green and just a head of like citrus seal just a little bit anyway I'm only gonna do two of these because I'm actually doing something different today because me and my husband are going out this is our anniversary I don't want to do a little bit too much and I'm not driving anyway but I just want to make sure that things were these are good all right guys all right I will come back later and let you guys know how it poppy or how it went all right right [Music]", "ShtXtVA7zRM": "this is the true leaved Mystica

bottom of the cartridge with the notches in the ring facing upward towards the tank of the cartridge insert the cartridge into the battery housing completely you'll hear a click and the cartridge will be retained by magnetic force before using charge the unit fully by attaching the provided USB cable to the side of the battery and into a USB charger when charging a red light will illuminate that is visible through the vertical side window the red light will go off when the unit is fully charged to turn the device on press the silver button five times within three seconds a blue light visible

batteries in the game if you don't let me show you how it works every box comes with the Honeywell slapper and a micro USB charger cable last but not least our battery clerk today that I'm going to be settling with is our blue Raths CBD part and it is a hundred percent THC free screw on our cart and it fits obviously honey all the best but it can fit any other 510 thread cartridges the way to turn on this bad boy is five times on the button one two three four five and the way to turn it off is another five one two three four five right out of the box the battery will be about halfway charged so you can get right to baby let's take a hit nice oh wait there's more a battery has three power settings it should start off on the blue which is the middle setting if you click the button three times you will go to red the highest power setting for the biggest hit let's try the big hit whoo can another three we'll bring it down to white the lowest setting to give the most flavor what but personally I like to smoke it on blue if you want to go gnarly go red if you wanna have a good time go away so we'll go back to blue this guy has a preheat mode just two clicks as you see it bleakie the better will light up blue and white and heat the oil at the lowest time possible for 10 seconds and if you're sick of waiting click the button again and stop the reheat and then you get to Rivet us but not lease my favorite feature instead of having another adapter to lose and unscrewing a cartridge every time your battery dies we put the charge port on the bottom of the battery and if it's the standard microUSB port a big metal boom the best part is with the pass-through charging you can keep charging your battery while hitting it when the battery is charging the red light was this little circle at the bottom will light up and it will turn off when it's done being fully charged if you guys have any more questions feel free to leave them in comments below but just in case we have written directions for everything we just talked about on the back of each box stay up stay lifted and fam", "MeVzVvDGnOI": "[Music] hey guys today we're going to take a look at the number one most common problem that you'll have with your vape pen and cartridge and how to quickly fix it so what you want to do to start is unscrew your cartridge from your pen and take a look at the two connectors there sometimes they can become too recessed of whether its packaging or being screwed down too tight and it's really easy to fix to bring it out so you'll want to grab a paper clip and just gently catch underneath the edge of the connector and tug on it very gently to make sure you don't pull it up too hard you can damage the cartridge that way so be careful and once you catch an edge you can work around the entire lip there so that it's in a nice proper position for it to emotion correctly with the battery next we're going to move on to the battery and repeat the same process we're gonna work underneath the connector here and ring it up nice and gently you don't need to apply much pressure again and once you catch that same edge just work around nice and slow so that you don't have an uneven space for the connectors that you're touching [Music] so it should be all ready to go here and we're gonna grab our cartridge and screw it back in the cartridges don't need to be screwed down too tightly for it to work once it's there you should have a green light ready to go all right guys thanks for watching [Music]", "IZevn2phLbw": "[Music] let's go right right right right right right what's up friends this time i'm coming at you with the gather from soleil this is the old 510 or vape cartridge there from the cool dudes over at afria this is a thc cbd it's a 701 thc it's a cbd reading the old ingredients on the back here it says thc distillate cbd distillate and flavors so this one has got all natural berry and watermelon flavors it says so should be tasty i'm guessing i picked this one up for i think it was 39.99 at the store kind of looking forward to a bit of a cbd one in there anyway because they're kind of good for bringing the old mellow out i was out working in the yard yesterday and my back is sore as [ __ ] today so i'm kind of looking forward to this one reading on the side here says 100 plant-based ingredient soleil the sun the sun weed it doesn't taste like watermelons and berries yet this uh so they gather this is derived from their jack herrera so this is a sativa based one if that means anything to you guys what do you guys think does the indica sativa do [ __ ] all of you i don't really know to be totally honest with you and these desolate cartridges let's smoke it i don't know what there's left to do other than later up let's [ __ ] bring her over and take some pics of it [Music] what you guys can't probably smell through the camera is this thing smells really really really good like watermelon berries something like that i smell it all if you are in a situation where you can't be smoking stuff that smells really [ __ ] dank this is definitely a very good i would say this is definitely a very good option for you this one definitely the cbd is helping us out here you can probably hit this one a few times you won't be hiding under the [ __ ] bed i've never seen a cartridge that looked this fancy before hey you guys saw that one it's all shiny and gold and chromed out it's cool looking man i like it i don't know why they made it so fancy but i dig it looks cool probably not the most important thing but they sure made it look freaking sweet packaging is cool things super cool i'd like to see the smaller package instead of the big box but that's just me whatever it's cool just make sure you recycle it i'm probably gonna head out and do a little bit more yard work today so uh we'll see i'll give the old cbd if i can go okay for a rating what would i give this one this is a solid one i give it seven and a half strawberries out of ten yep definitely seven and a half strawberries out of ten seven and a half uh yard leaf rake bags out of 10 because that's what i'm gonna [ __ ] end up raking today probably i need the gyms to open back up my shoulder's [ __ ] killing me it's tough though when you only have one arm that moves you should see your rake in a [ __ ] yard with one arm they're known or i'm so sore i need this i don't know i'm feeling energized i feel like getting in here right now i think for a snack on this one today i'd have like maybe a bowl of oatmeal and maybe a piece of fruit because i'm gonna work today i'm doing it this is a good one i'm feeling inspired i'm not [ __ ] saying like and subscribe okay guys that's pretty much all i got for you on this one if you're down for the cbd you got the soreness going on you're working hard you're sitting around and quarantine doing push-ups in your house all day long on yard work time too you're out there pumping leaves around pulling down branches [Music] whatever right cbd's got you if you guys want me to check out anything that is like weed related let me know in the first vid there guys my mic was kind of [ __ ] up like i said i only got one [ __ ] hand that works here so i was [ __ ] messing with the wires today audio should be back now so sorry about that dudes say what say what hi guys it's me again the hooter yeah the hooter i blasted this through this was the remedy and it's made by the same guy who makes my little chatter hooter pulsar it's a pretty groovy little guy man fits in your pocket real easy i like that one it's got a preheat on it okay now i'm out i'm out peace", "TsI5MwjR_tw": "hey there so i wanted to show you how i got this vape open i finally went upstairs and had my husband help me with this vape um i just was showing it to you the high supply hybrid vape so i was really struggling to get it open it's the child resistant part was really tricky for me and i will say it's not their fault i have lotion on my hands so it made it somewhat tricky to get out but you just push the tube up like this you can throw away this cardboard thing recycle it whatever i love that this is so minimal with the packaging and then you have this reusable tube that you can roll pre-rolls in or whatever and keep it in your purse i love that it comes like this um so this is this is how you get it off you just twist the top off i was thinking it was like one that you pull off so the trick is just twist it so that's what my husband did so i wanted to show you this um this is a 500 milligram disposable vape and it's really rare to find ones in illinois that are 500 milligrams disposable style typically 500 milligrams or more of the cartridge that you like screw on the top so to get one that's disposable with 500 milligrams and it was only 50 dollars which is a steal for me i know that sounds funny because in other states that is extremely high prices but here this is a very good price so i like it that there's no buttons on it it'll last me a long time you just draw from this end right here and then this end right here will light up letting you know that you did it right so i want to give it a try and see what this high supply is all about it's a big big brand like i've seen high supply really making a big effort with their marketing lately they're really crushing it so yeah really excited to try this so this one is a hybrid strain it's not like any particular it's just like a blend that is very good i like that um it tastes almost like a lime and it smells that way like even from this like cap like that on the top i can smell it has a very citrus note but it's very limey and very pleasant like a very functionable feeling to it like i can definitely you know use this you know go to a conference call or do whatever i need to do for work or go on a bike ride very very of a functional kind of high it's a hybrid strain like i said and the thc percentage on this was pretty good so it's um 74 thc which that's very high that's pretty good like um just as a reference point if you're somewhat new to the percentages um one of the very very very best strains of cannabis like that you grow like the bud that would be like 35 maybe 38 thc at the very highest so 38 thc from the bud versus 74. 74 is very strong so this this will do the trick and i like these because it's just potent clean medicine you just take a couple hits a few minutes later a few seconds later i will feel different i will feel more calm so this is great and i can't wait to use this i'm going to go on a hike or a bike ride i'm not sure which one but yeah i just wanted to show you this i was so excited that i finally got it open but yeah this is the high supply hybrid disposable vape it's also technically from cresco so if you're interested in that kind of thing check out cresco check out one of their dispensaries called sunnyside in illinois but yeah really happy with this this is going to treat me really well all right hope you have a good day happy sunday to you all right take care bye", "clxObz52quQ": "welcome chef this eye style images coming at you with another platinum vapor view this one is white dragon I've already kind of come to terms like in my head that I may not like this flavor and very much just because it's earthy and spicy as the flavor spicy might not be a big deal the earth he may be too overpowering so you know just reading that I made some assumption so the last three I did I chose one of those over this one so then I went back and I was like hey he's like I got this left and this left I said [ __ ] it I'll get that so it was this one in the forbidden fruit pod one that I just just uploaded earlier I recorded it the other day but this is an indica it's

you can tell there I've been slow going on the cards lately hmm flour I just keep getting some and then I end up blowing through it and then I don't get a video of it or I think I did and I didn't happen at least twice on this last round of weed I picked up this off try hit it not only spicy and at the end of the dry here you get a little bit of the earthy which I'm gonna assume is gonna be relatively predominant in the flavor profile as soon as I hit the button sorry on the hiatus on a couple videos and some of the other stuff I got back in the gaming I haven't been streaming any gaming right now mixers in the middle of being bought out by Facebook July 22nd will be the final time mixer is actually on its own Mark Zuckerberg bought that [ __ ] just like he did with Instagram I don't blame the guy the money's there so I'll probably just make a twitch account and go over to there and see what I can do webcams up there my xbox is out here [ __ ] ready to go you do pro still rocking that got a blade of grass in there from putting it in my pocket I had some grass left in my pocket from work when I grabbed and came out here yesterday noticed it when I got home today oh my gosh it has a bunch of grass behind the screen which is crazy it got back there get into the button did you get in through there and somehow make your way to the front there whatever no big deal so fire in the hole let's see what this is all about that spice up front is actually pretty nice and that is not an overpowering earthy taste like my stupid low battery there's a tiny bit of bite at the end that hits you like right in here that's not as bad as I was thinking based on what I was reading this is a mix of Afghani and Northern Lights which makes white dragon it didn't specify which strain of Afghani weed it was just said Afghani that was it not Afghani Kush Afghani something og just said Afghani as one of the parent plants and Northern Lights being the other I will put all the information below I couldn't remember it all I should have read it by like six seven times to try to retain more of the information but then I had to set up the video dude that had walked through all this and then I just forgot a lot of it but it says it's really potent it's really good with sleeplessness and pain were two of the things he was talking about I was pretty much it on the remembering part marijuana affects the memory so as I said I will put the legally description in the description below to let you guys know exactly everything I was reading so they you can read it yourself and yeah yeah that's way better than I was thinking my things on three volts today because I was letting someone cheap on it so I dropped it to down so I didn't want to [ __ ] burn through it as quick just because they just keep ripping and ripping it inside [ __ ] just gonna kill my [ __ ] huh oh yeah white dragon I'm gonna I should within the next couple days get my hands on it was a variety of different ones but I'm going to try to get Sonoma coma Hall Pass OG there was like eight of them I don't know they were all new flavors and I want one of all but understanding things get sold out quick so I'll see what he's got left and see what I think my hands on so I can make more videos of these yeah I like it actually I you know based on the flavor profile I thought I was not gonna like it and I had tricked myself into thinking I wasn't gonna like something man don't play the bass doing a big again I love your products keep them coming I'm gonna keep reviewing them I'm gonna keep trying them keep letting you guys know which ones I like more which ones I don't cereal milk was really [ __ ] good limoncello was really good ice rec I really [ __ ] enjoyed I like white dragon but still some of my favorites have to be purple ponds purple champagne galactic Jack Incredible Hulk green crack was really good you know those are definitely some of my favorites but yeah that being said I don't really got much else to say on this but uh check your local dispose get some deals fines platen babes for 403 400 or three four ninety or some [ __ ] get your hands on it try as many flavors as you want I don't think it'd be disappointed especially until you find that one flavor that just really hits you the way that you want for my significant other faith og was the one that just was nice and mellow door out it was a nice hi she didn't get super super baked off of it because she's not really a STONER as it is anyway so just a quick like and that's pretty much all she needed was a tiny tiny little baby hit so one cart might last her like a month on I have two months where lately they've been nice to me a lot longer but it used to be a week maybe depending on how you know how constant through the day that you just slamming this down or how many people that you got in a rotation that you're letting hit twice you know a puff pass before you know a happy [ __ ] car it's

ingredients with that i so i n g r i n in gradients as you probably already know youtube has very strict community guidelines so if you're not 18 please [ __ ] off of my video thank you let's have a nice day what is going on guys tony robb here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video we're up in my car and we're about to review the wiz khalifa og by pure1 and just thinking about it i could have done this in my room because like vape cartridges don't smell that much but before i start this video i just want to give you guys a little disclaimer to watch out for fake cartridges when i looked up the pure one wiz khalifa og i had seen that there's a lot of people out there that had been scammed with fake cartridges so when buying a [ __ ] cartridge buy it from a reputable source and just don't buy it from somebody who's super [ __ ] shady so please watch out and with that out of the way if you guys want to see more vape cartridge videos drop a like hit that subscribe button check out all my social media links are in the description down below and without further ado let's get this video started whoop all right guys we got the pure one wiz khalifa oh g over here which is a indica strain i got 1 000 milligrams which is equivalent to 1 grams of concentrate and i bought this from a reputable source so i don't want you guys saying in the comments down below that this is a fake cartridge and just looking at the packaging the package is very beautiful you know with that gold tint on the side um with the warning label on the back which i will be reading for you guys on the back of this package it says wiz khalifa og the best hitting ceramic cartridge disposable cartridge 1 000 milligrams it says ingredients and i just want to [ __ ] point out which kind of scares me you know because i just said that this isn't a fake card they wrote ingredients with that i so i n g r i n ingredients whatever in the ingredients it says cannabis oil natural terpenes all right instructions for use screw the cartridge onto the battery to ensure the best vaping we strongly recommend the pure one battery blah blah blah that's just advertising obviously for the brand inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat they're not saying how many times you should inhale and exhale repeat but i'm assuming like three to four times should get you gently or modestly baked um if you want to take it to a whole other level obviously you're gonna spam the [ __ ] cartridge up until you can't feel your brain but i would not necessarily recommend that as a natural product the color of the oil may have a slight variation without sacrificing quality prolonged exposure to sunlight and heat will cause the cartridge to leak now the government warning this product contains cannabis a schedule one controlled substance which is not the case in canada because it is 100 percent legal keep out of reach of children and animals cannabis products may only be possessed or consumed by persons 21 years of age or older unless the person is a qualified patient the intoxicating effects of cannabis products may be delayed up to two hours i have never taken a cartridge where the delay is two hours it is generally like two minutes right like very rarely no actually it is i think impossible to smoke a joint or hit a cart and the effects hit you in two hours it's not inedible right cannabis use while pregnant or breastfeeding may be harmful consumption of cannabis products impairs your ability to drive and operate machinery please use extreme caution and then there's the final warning which is not the government warning this product can expose you to chemicals including pulagon which is known in the state of california to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm for more information go to www.whatever blah blah blah blah and then you have like the purevape website and purevape instagram with that out of the way we're gonna open up the box over here and i don't want to destroy it right because it is a very beautiful box so i'm just assuming you either push it up ah yeah wow a beautiful push feature wow and i could keep this because this is actually a beautiful packaging so i'm gonna put that on the side and now we got the pure vape cartridge wow the color of it looks amazing like it's not too clear right but it's not too brown it's a right in between color we got one full gram but we got it over here and this is what it looks like it is kind of transparent if you put it up in the sunlight honestly and the color isn't too dark right it's not the darkest i've seen but it's not the lightest color and it is obviously not the same color as the packaging as they said on the back the color may be different blah blah blah blah blah we got the vape cartridge turned on now and i will be putting it oh i turned it off oh [ __ ] i will be putting it on the lowest setting and going to medium and then going to high and i will be telling you guys like what best setting to hit it because there's different types of vape cartridges where if you hit it on a high setting it just burns completely the car other vape cartridges if you hit it on the low setting it just does not hit and sometimes you know the middle setting just doesn't work so you got to try it out all right i'm on the blue setting which is the lowest setting and we're just going to follow the instructions that are on the package so for best use inhale for at least three seconds exhale repeat so like i was saying i'm gonna inhale for three seconds exhale repeat three times for each temperature setting and then i'll be able to judge which setting is the best and tell you guys if it actually tastes good and then finally i'll take [ __ ] blinker because i know everybody wants me to take [ __ ] blinkers right but now the moment that you guys have been waiting for let's take the first three second puff so let's get it guys cheers what the [ __ ] [Music] why did that taste like dry pasta that wasn't the taste i was expecting what the [ __ ] like it literally caught me by surprise bro like i was expecting some sort of like stronger taste because it is like an indica and i was expecting like something you know a little fruity because like you know wiz khalifa og kind of a tropical fruity taste you know but no it tastes like dried [ __ ] pasta but i'll be taking another puff because like i said we're gonna repeat three times on each temperature setting so without further ado let's get it cheers guys okay on that second puff a little bit more fruity maybe needed a little bit time to you know heat up and activate um there's not much of that like you know tingling sense in the back of your ears and like inside of your eyeballs when you're hitting a cart there's not much of that to be honest with that second puff there's like a mix of like dried pasta and like fruity taste so i'll be taking the third and final puff on the lowest temperature setting so cheers guys well i'm just gonna be 100 honest after three rounds on the low temperature it did start to kick for me right i feel as if this was like a productive type of indica buzz because it's not really a body buzz it's not gonna like slouch you it's not gonna get you tired it's kind of like one of those productive ass buzzes in my opinion that's how it's feeling right but we will keep going up with the temperatures but we're on the [ __ ] red setting so that's the medium setting so let's see what the medium heat see if this shit's gonna start smacking and yeah let's get it guys cheers nice three second hit and wow okay the taste is way smoother so with a low temperature low setting it tastes like [ __ ] dry pasta with this it's just a fruity taste to it honestly it's maybe because the combustion is a little quicker but yeah i'm going to take the second puff on this one because it was super not harsh so cheers guys [Music] them three second puffs are very blessed [Music] overall this [ __ ] started to hit man you know the indica feeling is starting to creep up slowly maturely upon me right and i did get a full night of sleep so i'm not tired in that sense alright we will take the third and final puff of the medium setting let's get it guys cheers got that one all right so just overall the key difference with the medium setting is that the hit is a little smoother and it tastes a lot less like [ __ ] ala dente spaghetti you know what i mean so we're going to be moving on to the final heating temperature with the which is the highest temperature of the battery so we're going to be taking the three puffs off of this if there's a key difference or there's something to add i'll add it or else it's gonna be like some sort of i don't know three puff montage or whatever but let's get it guys cheers okay yeah i do have something to add with the high temp you can really taste the full amount the full flavor you know what i mean which is pretty sick so medium and high is better for for this strain there's like i said some other strains they prefer i guess low temperature to hit better but with the wuz khalifa og is tasting pretty pretty good so we'll take the second puff cheers guys nothing to add on that second puff so we'll go directly to the third one cheers just overall nine puffs in it really fries you like nine puffs in i was expecting to be a little slumped like a little you know all right guys this is future robin and i'm currently doing the outro because i just checked my computer checked the gopro and i just cannot find the rest of the video like for some reason it's just completely deleted maybe it got corrupted i don't know but i will be taking the blinker because obviously i promised you guys a blinker so i'm not gonna beat around the bush too much cheers guys alright this is like post post editing rob and i just gotta say that like i did hit a blinker i tried my absolute best to put my finger in a certain type of way where the camera would capture the actual blinking but like my dumbass kept my finger in front of the light so it did not appear in the video so you guys gotta take my word for it that i actually did hit a blinker and like i wouldn't be coughing uncontrollably and not being able to hold on the hit if i didn't take a blinker trust me on that take my word for it this is like post post editing rob i'm like on some omnipresent [ __ ] yeah okay i think i'm gonna leave now but god damn like i was saying the strain is very very like uplifting and it's not like a super indica for some reason like this train doesn't get you couch locked it doesn't give you that natural indica feeling it really uplifts you and it kind of gives you a boost of energy like i just took a blinker and i'm feeling up and at it right and i've been awake for like five six hours but besides the fact that the word ingredients is misspelled i really didn't join this cart and i do hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did drop a like please and hit that subscribe button if you haven't already check out all my social media

that and stick CBD I think because yeah it's craziness and I hope all my customers are staying safe and yeah not getting too caught up in all the negative stuff that's in the news at the moment so yeah let's get cracking on what we're going to be talking about today we are looking at the Harmony tempo kick so there it is there's the packaging really excited about this product because as I've mentioned in the past on the website this is probably harmonies one of our best sellers as a CBD vapor liquid range so they sort of cater for everyone's tastes and the toppings are there and it's just a really really nice CBD in liquid so when these were announced I was really really tough because it gives someone a great way of trying three flavors so you in the starter kit you get three pods you get the device itself for thirty eight ninety nine so it's a very very good way of trying not only vaping CBD but as you guys may be aware in the CBD business and in the vape business as well you buy a starter kit you buy the juice you spend fifty pound on the device you spend unknown fifteen pound on the juice you don't like the juice you go to another one you don't like the juice and then you find one you like you've wasted all that money on all that equipment and and the juice and it's not for your liking this way you get options so straight off the bat you've got three great flavors to try and the device 438 ninety nine so as long as the device gray I know already that the juices are good because I've tried all of the harmony juices there is a review of them if you want to have a look back of one of my earlier videos so you can see the different flavors there but yeah in the box you get three off the bat so that's really really cool and very good from harmony it's very jewel lesk if you've seen the jewel kit for vaping this is the CBD version so it's really cool right let's crack open the box so you get a cardboard sleeve you've got your device picture on the front you've got your pots on the side and then you've got some bumps on the back which I'll be talking about anyway so we don't need to go into that right within the sleeve you then have two different packages you have your device which will look at first and then in front of that you have your free flavor pots so device first just so you can see the packaging very nice very clean dual lesk as I said looking and it's open seal so you get a nice little pull thing here pull that out now on the back you've got your USB and on the front you've got your tiny little pen so let's get the pen out and it says insert the tempo pod and it will be in that end it's very obvious when you see it that's how we little up close on the mod itself so 3010 milliamp battery it is very tiny the coils are very tiny and as I've said before the vape CBD game is completely different to nicotine vaping you want to vape CBD at a low wattage because then you don't burn all the goodness off so regardless of the battery size in the vape game you'd say three thousand and ten is very very tiny it is tiny but because you're vaping a very low wattage you'll get a good three quarters of a day to a full day that depends on how much CBD vape now this size is stunning you guys may be aware but I love tiny little mods things that don't make your pockets bulge your purse is all that stuff something that's tiny and discreet and you can take anywhere with you when we get back to football the football stadium when we get back to festivals the festivals are now more rubbing it in with all the other cool things you could be doing this summer that you're not but you can go to the park and you could have these slips in your pocket and you could be laying there in the Sun by vaping your Harmony mod so there's not really much else to say about the mod itself you've got the tiny USB port in the bottom it is a standard micro USB it would have been nice to see a type C in there now these days you know this could have been really super fast charging but then the cost goes up so I understand why they're sticking with micro USB it's a matte black finish it feels very very nice in the hand very much like you know back in the day with holding cigarette it's really nice between your fingers I can feel it being a bit of a fidget fidget device right okay so let's get to the pods sorry guys right so then you've got your pod kit now the one I'm opening today is the which one is this there's a classic and an originals that's interesting it doesn't tell you what what flavour one is the classic and the originals but the yeah the originals that's it so oh gee Kush mango Kirsch and super Lemon Haze now those three flavours in this pack on my top sellers so just a heads up there guys if you want to try one of the two flavor packs because in the other one which is another kit with the other style of flavors which are wild strawberry Moroccan mint and pink lemonade now all three of those sell really well as well but just just the heads-up that is my top seller is those three in this pack so once you're done with your pods they're about two hundred puffs per pod depends on how much you vape 17 milligrams of CBD per pod which is a very good level of CBD i've always said to you guys 30 milligrams is not really worth bothering with it gives you it will give you you know if you very very mild symptoms and you want to try low because I do always say to work up from the lowest to find your range but if you want to skip a couple of steps to save money then I would definitely not bother with 30 and I normally advise is a hundred to go in at a good starting milligram for vaping now 72 is perfect it's up there it's close to the hundreds it's an everyday pot then so that's really good and obviously the more you vibe the more intake of cdeep CBD you've got so that's all good right okay so let's crack open the packaging so as I said there yeah you've got two different variations the pods are sold separately 200 plus per pod and you get three so it's very good value now the pod pods themselves are foil seals or it's been a long day oil seal and then on there you have expiration dates for each pod which is a really really nice touch on that so it gives you a lot number and then expiration let's crack it open okay wow you smell it straight straight off the bat I wish you had smell vision you could smell those smell that all day long the terpenes are just really really pungent it's brilliant right okay I'm gonna go whichever one I found first which looks to me like the Lemon Haze you get a nice little yellow rather stopper on there to indicate what flavor it is so if you want to swap out flavors just make sure you stick that back on there so you know which one you were vaping on there you go right the simple as there's a little triangle on the pod and there's a triangle cut out on the mod and that literally just s-- so literally it all goes wrong clicks in there and that is ready to go now the other cool thing is this little rubber bung here is a dust protector know any of you guys that vape already will know that you get a lot of stuff down your drip tip and then when you go to inhale you might get some fluff off your jeans at the back of your froat which is awful if you're you know like a chippy or anything like that and you're in a dusty environment that little cap even though you're guaranteed to lose it in the first week is a cool little touch so then you've got your liquid inside it's a black clear so you can see your liquid levels but it's quite difficult to see it will start to go burn when you're when you're at the bottom it's drawer activated so it's easy just prick to your lips and draw and I think that's all I need to mention before having a toke on it oh yeah so the pods themselves let's take it back out there is a little rubber band at the bottom you won't see it on camera but there's a tiny little rubber bung there and you can refill these pods up to four times so that is an amazing touch by harmony because I didn't have to do that they all make their money on you buying these same with coils for vape devices you know they they could probably with the technology they've got these days make coils that would last forever but that's not in their interest because they want you to keep coming back for the little coils that you know you have to switch out every three to four days now harmony they've met you in the middle there and gone what okay well we'll give them the little flap so I should have had this prepared by only two seconds and stare at all guys and he's back in the room you can get your harmony flavors and just fill them up yourselves so that is brilliant really thumbs up there's harmony for that little touch okay right half of the stuff let's put the pop back in this is a brand-new fresh pod so I'm gonna give it a tug and see what thing okay so I had the light indicate that it was activating but there was no real vapor off of that at that time interesting maybe gotta run the other way so you saw about ice geysers but then this could be the same sort of issue that you have when you're vaping so to leave it in I'm not going to edit it strange the only thing I can think of is the device is completely dead I don't know there we go so basically with the pod it just hadn't met the connections nicely in the actual device itself once I clicked it back in there right we're good to go now that is the Lemon Haze that I know and love cool the flavor is really there that's brilliant considering the tiny little coil the Lemon Haze in all his glory is there perfect well done harmony so are there any negatives on this we'll type-c would have been nice if you don't like draw activated devices and you want a button and this won't be for you the tiny nosov it you could say for some people well I'd lose it yes you could possibly lose it but I I still don't think that's a negative cause I hate massive devices but they'll it will o go there on the bottom harmony do you know what it's just full of positives this tiny little device for me the fact that you get three flavours the fact that it's drawer activated the fact that it's tiny and discreet you know you can have literally you imagine taking three different flavors of a juice out with you or you just take these tiny little things out with you and you just switch them out for whatever mood you're in and then puff on another flavor a morning flavor a lot of time flavor and an evening flavor amazing well I think I've exhausted my thoughts on

don't flag me for illegal content this is a legal product that i've bought here um sorry if that was annoying but i just always want to point this out i'm not buying these things from the black market this is from a dispensary down the road that is licensed and authorized to sell me this so that caveat this is one of my favorite products i have ever bought ever and i have tried many many products so this stands out to me i just wanted to show it to you it's called the good news friday vape i know i know the name is annoying and it almost turned me off like the name freya i was like uh this is that's annoying i don't know something about that word just like somewhat off-putting for me but i went ahead and bought this and the reason i bought it is that it was pretty potent um on the back here it shows the potency of how much thc is in it and this one has 79 thc so it packs a punch and i also like that it has 300 milligrams of oil in it which means roughly to me this is about a hundred three second inhales is how i think of it um roughly i know it's hard to know exactly but um it's a disposable pin and it's you know pre-filled so you don't have to do anything to it there's no buttons to press and i actually just love how cute it is i know that's silly but it says fryer all over it and when you hit the end the end will light up i don't know if you can see that but i wanted to highlight the flavor of this vape so this taste is unlike anything i've ever had it actually reminds me a lot of this really silly um hollister cologne that i or perfume that i used to have in junior high it's very girly it's it tastes like girl shampoo is the best way that i could describe it um a friend of mine bought this recently and i said that i was like don't you think it tastes like shampoo in a way but it's very like it smells and tastes like apple shampoo is the best way that i can describe it and it's very fruit forward and very light of a flavor like i don't get any of those heavy indica taste from it like og kush or something this is a very light uplifting taste and it's a um it's really not a strain itself fryer is most likely a bunch of different strains that they've all put together to kind of make this concoction here but however they did it is beautiful it's a very good vape i've really enjoyed using it and cresco really just hits it out of the park i feel like with their flavoring like i can tell that whatever flavoring they're using it's most likely cannabis derived just because it's so natural tasting i don't get any sort of like overpowering notes in it it's very very natural to the cannabis plant but i would highly recommend this it was 35 at my dispensary here in illinois and again it has 300 milligrams of cannabis oil but this one is so good and i applaud you cresco for making this and i'll definitely be buying it more and every time i use it i really just think of a nice weekend where i'm like biking or just outside it's a very very happy high it's a hybrid strain i believe so it's nice balanced mill of the road but just wanted to show you this vape if you're looking for something that's really tasty check this one out it's a friday vape from cresco all right hope you have a good day bye", "pXmteypdwuo": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel welcome if you're new here my name is Ariana de I am going to be challenging myself I'm going to be smoking a half gram cartridge in one sitting I'm also gonna try and figure out how many hits are in one pod and that's pretty much the situation hard intro we're done let's get into the video right let's do it so what I'm going to be smoking today is going to be a dart pod I've been seeing these a bit more in the West Coast and they come with this awesome little C cell battery it look kind of like this it's orange my favorite color um concentrate from the brand evermore here in Maryland and I'm going to just pop this open then we're gonna get it started I got this in the strain gelato I don't really have any feelings about the strain gelato so I'm definitely gonna get closely acquainted to it in this video it's got a decent amount of mercy and limonene so it should be kind of sedating it hopefully wouldn't be too anxiety inducing despite it being sativa laning you know this is well so the box within a box that it comes with um very cute very wasteful and then I have just the triangle the weird solo triangle I'm gonna get up in your space real quick and show you what the pod looks like nice and cute this is what it looks like it's brand new still sealed and yeah this is what a dart pod looks like it's got a little evermore branding on it I love it pop this [ __ ] right in done couldn't take the plastic little seal out and then we're gonna get right into it let's do it just so you guys know if I'm looking down a bit I do have a counter up and ready cuz like I said I really want to know how many hits are in it I'm probably not gonna hold it up the whole time but I'm gonna show you guys a little bit throughout I hope you have a joint a blunt whatever it is that will tickle your fancy and get ready to wash my suffering let's do it Wow so we're coming out with the big ass hit I guess before I forget I'm gonna get close and getting a thumbnail but quick sorry I had to get my shots in real quick right now we are at eight hits so let's just keep it going let's stop dilly-dallying honestly this one definitely tastes not my favorite but like I said I'm not crazy about gelato I think it's a pretty basic pretty boring strain so I'm not crazy what taste either all right so that's 16 I saw on like the Moxie tart Instagram that I should in it kind of low and slow so let's try and do that and see what happens that was definitely less [ __ ] harsh Wow oh my god can I do this ya can do it do these clouds are like ridiculously huge for a baby I'm definitely starting to feel high god help me every time I think I forget I remember to hit the [ __ ] number down there so I'm at I think 29 if I'm wrong at the end I'm sure one of you will check me but right now I have 29 and I'm feeling pretty good should we do a pod check I'm scared that if I open it I won't be as far as I think I will but if I open it and I'm pretty far it's gonna be pretty motivating for me you know let's do a project let's do a pod check okay so I don't know if you guys can see that but I've got a hard bubble in there and from what I understand about this pod system it goes from here it being the distillate it goes from the bottom all the way to the very pretty much top right here I don't know if you can see that so I actually think I'm getting pretty far I think I might get another like 30 or 40 more hits out of this I'm kind of excited [Music] you guys I'm probably gonna crap out the coffee I just did but I'm dying but I'm gonna push do it for you I can't even look at myself right now cuz if I look they're all setting what I'm doing it myself and I can't I'm so Lake [ __ ] high right now we're at 40 in case I haven't updated you recently this is getting hard I want to take a break but I know I can't take a break is on that won't come back what I could really use right now is some water but like should that be a challenge in itself like no water like Buckham oh my god by the way I did see Mac fizzle originally trying to temp this a couple of months ago and it did inspire me to want to do it myself so this isn't very original I'm just gonna be honest but I did think it was cute so I am doing it [Music] I'm at what I think is 50 let's do a pond check and the suffering check while we're at it shall we I think I think we're gonna make it voice I really do god I hope we make it [Music] oh my nose is running [Music] [Music] that was my 69th day you can tell that she's almost kicked and we're at 73 and at this point it could be a little off so let's go 73 between 73 and 75 right now we're at [Music] I'm going through it I do a lot for you so you know be sure to thumbs that you know what I mean I'm looking for my glasses so I can really see the hell that I'm bringing upon my life by doing this okay I'm ready to do this I'm ready to finish this up for 82 let's do it [Music] made 200 it's gotta be towards the end oh my god oh my god you guys you guys it's almost empty I coffee decent amount but honestly he is pretty smooth considering that I just did a hundred hit doesn't want to feel like it boom it actually seems like I'm getting towards the gun I'm like really inhaling and nothing's coming out I think it's getting towards the end look I think we're pretty much done here I'll go like two more heads yeah I'm gonna call that a Duns oh so we are at final answer a hundred and ten give or take I'd probably say five to ten so let's to say a hundred and fifteen a hundred and fifteen hits to finish a typical dark pod system that was pretty cool shout out to Cecil for coming up with this new battery to enable this crazy awesome way better vape technology and shout out to ever more for being the first in Maryland to have it and for honestly being pretty good and that's pretty much it if you guys liked it be sure to subscribe be sure to follow me on instagram at indica wife and it's time for me to go eat some food if you enjoyed this definitely let me know and I'll be sure to see you guys in the next video have a good rest of your day peace out [ __ ]", "mhQK4MnZa_I": "what's up desert buds Rob here and today we went shopping at a new dispensary so I haven't been to this one but I think I'm gonna start going because it's pretty badass the deals I got it's herbal Wellness Center it's off of Indian School and like 43rd out I think got a couple stickers they gave us this cool phone wallet and when you're a first-time patient they give you these hemp rolling papers which i think is kind of cool and then we got a lighter too so now let's get to what I was really trying to show you guys today so they gate I went and bought a grandma wax right there's our grandma wax they pen extracts and I bought that for like $15 at Grandma wax and I got this for free with it badass vape and cartridge this is the King Louis the 8th og and it says nighttime indica you might be able to see it says each Bay pen cartridge comes prefilled for optimum discretion our discretion and ease of use simply screw the vape and cartridge on to the vape and battery and begin medicated so it comes in this cool plastic you know there it is so the only thing we don't have is a PHA pen battery but it's not like your stickers in there yeah it comes with a sticker so they have to buy one get one free deals because these are normally $40 for a half gram but I'll just wait till they up but I want to get one to go get one go get two so this is battery charger that the vape batteries look like just a USB you screw it in there and that's my battery this one's got a stylus on it and no button so let's try it what's funny as I dropped this battery in the sink where I where I work at I was doing dishes I pulled this out to rip it real quick dropped it right in the sink that day's good it's good like my face is melting instantly mind-fucked babe head and where you're using a different battery so this is actually for a different battery so you've got three products here we've got the bait charger for the move battery and their cartridges we got the urban green house stylus pen battery vape pen cartridge I think this vape pen stuff is like 10 out of 10 [Music] and kind of see the little bubble we already smoked out of there I'm taking four puffs off the same total apparently you can refill these things but yeah that is the vape n King Louie the eighth cartridge guys and stay tuned for more reviews we've got the Phoenix og shatter and that's an indica and we've got some chem dog and hindu kush coming out guys stay tuned", "72Tap5PtOLs": "what would you guys say if I told you I was smoking hash rising out of this pen no [ __ ] no buying it from a dispensary no half a stuff that's mixed together no wax liquid eyes or nothing like that just straight-up patch rosin in a pen because that's exactly what I'm [ __ ] doing you really have not been doing a lot of these but I'm excited to get back into a little bit before we leave for Hawaii it's gonna kind of couple more after we get back from Hawaii but before we get started I wanted to let all of you know we have a full restock of black fueled by meds in black 710 works shirts as well as fueled by meds and 7:10 words mood mats these are fully UV all stocked up on Team small nurse calm you guys can hit the link down in the bio go pick one of those up for yourself or don't I appreciate you guys just being here to watch the video so we've got some pretty groundbreaking interesting [ __ ] in the industry that we need to go over here today these things are called quasar pods these are from kungfu vapes now he was given these out at DFO left and right let's go sit there like what he's doing he's await everybody and then I saw him loading them on his internet site for the past three days he's been loading Lana's internet site everybody can get one it's all over now but what would have happened is you went on his site you filled out all the stuff that he sent you one of these for free I was like well why the [ __ ] is he doing that so I really started to get more into it I was kind of like okay well I didn't really hit it at DFO so let me try hitting it I'll tell you guys it feels like it's clogged until you exhale this one is getting pretty low I can taste but it's kind of acid out here I'm sure they didn't want to give out me [ __ ] ton of these with cash cause that would have been super expensive but the really [ __ ] cool part about these is that you buy them without oil in them you put your oil in them and they're stupid easy to put together I guess showing you guys we've got some Yolo ooh some Yolo Turks from primo we also have some ski tier stuff out in the fridge if we need it I may have to go grab that but you see this top layer in Terps right there we're going to be using one of the syringes that you provided us with we're gonna be trying to put them in one of these quasar pods before we do that let's go over what the [ __ ] this thing is when you look at it looks like a jewel it's the same exact size as a jewel honestly literally exact same size of the jewels I believe they did that on purpose it's a really good luck I mean you could just be like no officer it's a jewel they're not gonna be able to tell because you can't take the top off once you put them together so here we go here is what he set us up with no this is two empty quasar pods right here and then two tops for them and then you also need this little red rubber grommet and that's gonna be what holds your oil in there that's that's it all you need after that is some oil that's liquid enough to go in here and it really doesn't matter how liquid enough it is as long as you get down to the bottom where it's gonna be touching I believe a little ceramic port down in the bottom I thought I honestly do not know and the way I think this would work is every time you got a hot every time you start hitting it it would get warm all the oil in there gets warm drips down to the bottom and it just keeps doing all that [ __ ] by itself instead of having a cotton wick or a coil or something in there that can get clogged up or easily go bad it's just a little ceramic but with the bottom don't quote me on that that's just what I'm saying from what I see visually here so he also gave us some syringes over here and they say come to base on him on them this is what you're supposed to be using to load them up make sure you can get your oil in there first what's up let's see if it even works for what we got going on here and then we're gonna load this [ __ ] up and just see what happens all right Yolo Terps we got right here I'm gonna go ahead and dunk our syringe oh I'll be back chiller over here which I've heard some dumb reason decided to lock we're gonna wait and in art the sick one Terk chiller we have a bunch of primo extracts and I'm wearing this ski wonderful skinny Wonderland that's what I'm looking for is this jar of Tropic haze and as you guys can see it is it's fairly liquid on one side and then there's some ski on the other side running it back and forth though it just drips to the other side of the jar let's go ahead and we're gonna try and load this up again this could just be a massive waste of oil using a syringe but let's see oh oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] okay gonna try again thank God some suction there okay well let me let me just take a moment here and show you guys that we actually do have there we go you piece of crap there you guys can see we do have a little bit in there what I'm gonna do please our pod just comes pre opened up I'm just going to put that down in there and I can see it we're dripping oil in there slowly slowly but surely we are getting some well in there now that's not a massive amount it was very difficult for me to try and sit there and do that it was actually physically exhausting trying to hold my muscles but I'm just gonna sit here and do it very easily and slowly and I can immediately tell you guys this is working a billion times better holy [ __ ] I kind of do it right above the oil now I'm trying to get a little bit of the crystals in there too we'll see what happens if we have a little bit of extra scheme okay so with that one we definitely got a lot more in the little syringe I'm going to show you guys the filling of this [ __ ] this time pop that in there and now I'm just gonna really slowly you guys can see it slowly start to splooge out in there and then once you get to the end big old sploosh er look at that guys look at that now I'm gonna call that good there I think that you said these have a half gram capacity and we can see right there that that's pretty that's pretty hefty amount so all you need to do this is the crazy part guys all you need to do boom rubber grommet on the top and make sure that you have it as full as you want it because when you click these on these do not come back off when you hear that little click that's it that is it pull this little rubber stopper out of the top and we have a good to go pad right there hundred percent like that how crazy is that is it just me or is this [ __ ] mind boggling guys this is some new this is a new tech this is some new [ __ ] I have not seen this people are going crazy over these pens like the internet is on fire kung fu vapes has really stepped it up with these so let's take a look at what we got going on here it looks just like a jewel and if I flip it upside down we can see all my liquid oil is running around in there is it oh it is on this side dripping down so all we have to do is pull that's it there's no button there's nothing there's no charger you just [ __ ] pull on it let's give it a go cheers everyone first hit literally the first hit you guys just saw everything you saw me put it together you stomach with you on their first hit big clouds great flavor no flavor lost whatsoever it's a little bit lower temp that I would like to be dabbing at but we're not taking a normal dad this is a pen this is kind of like a maintenance device its kind it keeps you hide throughout the day is his titties guys if you have a bunch of liquid oil this is it was the line that's just cuz it was the first [ __ ] hip hope my good lordy alright well since we have two of these I'm gonna go ahead let's see if we can fill the second guy up with these Yolo terms now I don't think this stuff is going to just come out of here which it's not so what we're gonna have to do give it a little heat get it out of there this is probably a much more dangerous stupid maneuver but what I'm gonna do is hold this from the bottom I'm just gonna try and get some of these tips right up here hot and once we've gotten them a little bit liquid we're just gonna try and dump it some of it in there boom all right here we go oh my god a man cuz I don't want to take the time oh [ __ ] okay splooge is losing its just kind of dripping into that works really nice I'm gonna go ahead and call that good that this one has a crazy look to it guys Zuber light turfy yellow come look at that's almost clear with my hand in the background that is insane same thing all we're gonna do red rubber grommet pop it on it take a cap wait for the click that one was kind of a silent click pop the top off and rip it whoof crazy crazy flavor as we saw it the last one it seems like it takes a couple rooms I mean still the vapor production on the first hit just dripping it in there not even a minute ago that's grazie has some insane flavor to it seriously insane flavor give it a double and it's good I don't need to say anything else if you're not thinking about going buying one of these there's actually something wrong oh my god quasar Potts will come to bait it was the easiest product reveiw have ever had to do it's a product that people have

beautiful wonderful amazing people as always please be kind of one another Cheers I'll see you guys soon [Music]", "aEnBAd1Hy7g": "whoa Aloha and welcome back to the channel of fellow cannabis connoisseurs Saran Kimo back here with another legal Canadian vape pen to review this time we got the latest offering from Aurora this is from their brand Aurora drift so we've got THC sativa blend one disposable of a pen 0.15 grams literally the beta vape pen never view here for it this thing will go for about 3035 bucks you get total THC seven hundred and thirty five point six seven milligrams so that comes in at 73% the CBD content is 0.46 milligrams so 0.5% it's basically non-existent there's like no CBD in here it's a THC heavy sativa pen so let's check it out here kind of eager to see what Aurora has to accomplish here lately it seems like that company can't do anything right let's see how they do for the rapes so I'm gonna open this up so it looks a little bit like San rafeal just open pinch the sides and pull it out so there we have it that's all the packaging you got not just wasteful as others so it'll wasteful but there you go so we will take this and and take this out here so there you go it's actually kind of a nice little pen I like the black color which is nice see on there it says THC sativa you got the Aurora branding on there got this little mouthpiece condom we just take that right off and there you have it it's your standard disposable Big Ben oh you got your THC sticker on here really like the design of it actually it's got a nice little mat feel nice design so far so good let's not waste any time always jump in on so hmm not an explosion of flavor definitely some cannabis taste there almost a little fruity hmm I'm gonna have to investigate a little bit more let's just try here see that little a on the end I take it that probably lights up when I drag yeah you get a nice smooth drag not overly tasty but doesn't taste like crap either yeah terpenes I don't know a little bit of fruitiness in there kind of earthy fruity tapes go together nothing too memorable nothing you're gonna be writing home about but nothing you're gonna really complain about either vapors not too bad pretty good so yeah that's your pen therefore you gonna be back here I'm gonna go take a little bit of experimentation on this I'm gonna put it through its paces gonna see what we get you're gonna wrap up the review on the old THC sativa blend grower drift vape pen here don't have a lot of good things to say about this pen so let's just getting a pros and cons pros great design like the black design like the iam of the unit feels really great like that little glowing a you know it's really great really branded nice for aurora yeah the design is great don't like the fact that there's no way to see inside the tank to see how much yeah well enough to see what the oil looks like so it's really no way to know but other than that great design and thus ends my list of pros let's get into the cons cons value this is not a good value for you you know one buy this package is gonna run you a 30 35 bucks you're getting 0.15 grams and it's gonna last you like a day a couple days maybe if your moderate easier but not long and what are you gonna get out of those a day and a half well not much the effects I got on this thing we're minimal at best stiva blend 73 percent THC I was thinking I was gonna have a really strong cerebral energetic sativa high really didn't get anything didn't really feel lifted at all to be honest with you if anything I kind of felt a little bit of a headache later and it was really feeling burnt out so I don't know not the effects I'm looking for on a THC sativa pen as well like I said this thing lasted me about a day maybe 25 drags and it was dead already very bad value it's only 0.15 grams it's not gonna last you long anyways but I was expecting a little longer taste first first few drags there's a little bit of a fruity kind of spicy taste going on there it just evaporated quick like by 12 13th Drive it's getting like no flavor on this pretty much just sort of a kind of a harsh hot vapor flavor that's it just heat the vapor quality degraded as time went on with the thing and yeah this was just not a good disposable vape pen so you know flavor not great did not last like it wasn't that great in the first place and the flavor that was there just did not last like 10 drags and you're not tasting any flavor in here whatever terpenes they put in there did not last the value not there 0.15 grams is not going to last you a long time in the best of times but they seem to go really fast I've had some other ones that last longer than this not good value effects like I said the effects were not what I wanted to be not feeling what I was thinking didn't really get me lifted it didn't get me energized they can't expect that of a sativa same didn't really get me high kind of just gave me a headache and left me feeling a little run down and burn so not what I'm looking for in a disposable sativa vape pen so yeah Aurora had some high hopes for you like I said things have not been going too smooth for that company the last little while hoping these babes might turn things around for them they are an Alberta company you know I got to support them but I cannot recommend this product to anybody I do not recommend it to myself probably will not be buying it again sure hey maybe did I get a bum unit that was not good possibly am I gonna be running out to try another one to see probably not for quite a while so I recommend you do the same I would stay away from the Aurora drift disposable vape pens not too sure about their 510 threaded cartridges gonna try those in the future but this is a no-go for me so there you have it or a drift THC sativa blend disposable lakebed do not recommend so but any of you out there have you tried it what do you think leave me a comment just comment down below read them all reply to mom love to know what you think I like to know if you think I'm right if I'm wrong did you like it what did you like about it what didn't you like about it you know how it

bro yeah", "hlaQrK2WtPE": "what's up oh my stone is how y'all doing today good that's [ __ ] great well today's review we're going to be going over this northern extract disposable fake pen show you guys the testing and results right here damn versus only sixty eight point six nine percent with 0.11% CBD interesting now these these are about thirty five twenty five to thirty five dollars out of this bow depending which discipline you go to I believe it is only a point three or a point yeah it has to be only a point three but that's where it was made if you guys want to go rob that place go right for it right there's the bench test advice what I've never heard of that if you guys want to see an it go right forward you can scan it right there I really hope this actually does taste like a very high blueberry I don't know I love blueberry it's a very good flavor to me I love being blueberries just when I get them from the store even so it's not northern extract its northern cannabis company and it is a half gram it's not a point three it is a half gram so yeah I I really like this pact Jean how the art is on it how its labeled and everything it's pretty neat it's pretty neat it's pretty simple too it's just right there with it but let's get right into this I don't think you can pull it from the top because this band right here so let me go from the bottom oh the other one was white this one is silver that's sweet oh that's so cool dude that's [ __ ] sick this is my first time ever getting a disposable pen like this cart does not come off this battery right here just it's on there one thing I do notice it is a little mic down that could be because the coil was setting and so just soaked in there when they filled it well yeah that's that I like this I like this I really like this thing I mean maybe if they were a little bit cheaper there would be a hit but I kind of just paid for it just because of the video but yeah that's that's real neat that's cool that's [ __ ] sick I like that you don't even need a [ __ ] battery it's just down there it's just that's [ __ ] sick that's so cool I can't come literally I can't get over there that's [ __ ] awesome but yeah you got a little half room I think it actually might be a point three that is a point three that's a point three over point four that's no half gram my high frame would be a lot thicker I think like taller maybe even two but yeah that's that's pretty cool let's let's try him so but to take my first ripoff this blueberry northern cannabis company yeah try how this thing is it's literally just fits right in your palm just like this is that whoa whoa it snuck up on me only being the 70% or 69% 68% 68% it's pretty good it's pretty good as a high up blueberry tastes obviously a strange blue great but it's soothing it's real smooth it's real real smooth Oh sorta get a nice hit from it's real clean real clean I like that that's good see now one thing this car would be really good for is if you're not a high smoker if you don't smoke a lot say you don't smoke in you have a low tolerance this car right here will really do you justice like I think that'll actually help you out a lot it's a lower percentage most of all the other carts in there in decibels are around 80 to 90 still I mean it's this is 68% and there was a little bit honestly this car right here I think for people who don't smoke should be smoking this like if you have a low tolerance this would be perfect for you this would be legit perfect for you I said maybe 12 times and I've noticed it go down I mean yeah you're gonna notice it go down but like I don't know for for the place of this northern cannabis company you need to make your [ __ ] a little bit bigger it actually needs to be a half gram there's no way this is a half gram there's no way and it says right here that it's a point three it looks like a point three but for thirty to twenty five to thirty five dollars depending which this well you go and what they're gonna charge for it yeah no not worth it not worth it but it still got me huh you're still getting me high so I'll take it I bought it whatever but I don't think I'll buy it again so again with this being thirty dollars it is not really worth it I mean it's a point three the yeah it has a very good flavor in it it does the job like see you don't smoke or something this is the peg for you but if you're ace they like you smoke a lot you smoke a lot of cleaners you smoke a lot of wax this is something you should not buy it it'll you'll probably be pretty disappointed in it or it'll go pretty quick for you I don't know kind of disappointing this pen just because it's so small not about the quality or anything I'm just disappointed in how fast they went by", "EmSxAqFUSxM": "what's up YouTube this video is going to be a review for another CBD cartridge by funky farms this time we're reviewing the gelato flavor I got it in the 350 milligrams CBD content well excuse me so let's dive right into it let's start with the first I should mention because I forgot to in the last one when I reviewed the granddaddy purple I forgot to mention whether it was an indica hybrid or a sativa the Grande of a purple is an indica this one is a hybrid the gelato is a hybrid um so it's good for like midday or in the morning or at night really it's good for anytime I usually prefer the indicas at nighttime and sativas in the morning but hybrids are really flexible you can use them pretty much any time of the day and it'll work really well um let's take a better look at this packaging I think it's pretty cool it flips up and it says enjoy right there and like in the other video there's a tube with a little cap on it to store it in when it's not in use so that's cool packaging is pretty cool let's review the taste very sweet that's the first thing I think about when I take a hit from this is very sweet um it does taste kind of Turpin II kind of plenty but not as much as the granddaddy purple not nearly as much as the granddaddy purple um so that the flavor I like it a lot it's so sweet and it's also really earthy and planty so if I were to rate the flavor out of ten I would give it a seven point five strong seven um as far as CBD effects go it is a very relaxing very um it calms down my anxiety I was having a lot of anxiety before I made this video and I just took a few pops off of this cartridge and I'm back to normal I'm just chilling now um it also helps with pain it also helps with sleep so if you have problems getting to sleep you can use CBD for that um but if I were to rate the CBD content out of ten I would give it a another seven point five because I don't like the effects as much as I do with the Grandaddy purple so this is both flavor wise and effect wise a tear lower than the granddaddy purple but it's still extremely good um I got it for around $35 I got the 350 milligram concentration um hard to rate it overall I would give it a since both of the Ravens Fred the others were 7.5 I guess I've rated overall as a 7.5 but yeah I look forward to more videos I'm going to be doing reviews of a liquids and more CBD products so if you're interested subscribe and click the notification button so you can be notified when I drop new [ __ ] oh yeah that's really about all I have to say in this video I'm gonna right after this

were half grams 40 apiece I got them $10 off they're normally 50 it's got a little okay so it doesn't have like a uh like oh okay you push it stupid okay just pops out like that I guess that's pretty cool hmm punch smells kind of berry smell I can't wait to try it um okay I'm gonna stick this back in here for a second I don't think I can even [ __ ] that's not good whatever I guess it doesn't really matter um I mean I guess it does matter whatever so that's it that's a fault cuz I mean it's hard to put it back in there like that sucks cuz I want to try them out and put them back in but how the hell are you supposed to put it back in well whatever [Music] I'm going to try this purple punch this is the other one that I got Maui Wowi sativa it's gonna be fired they didn't have the flower this one's 86% THC so we're gonna try this out y'all I don't figure out how to put this back on the thing it's got a little oh so that's just for stacking all right okay I guess that wasn't too hard but I mean it's way harder than putting a little rubber piece back on like on the other all the other cartridges yeah that's the right one this is a small battery I think it's pretty much charged so I'm gonna go ahead and try this how to insert cartridge logos align okay buttonless that's pretty dope all right we're gonna try this purple punch y'all I got it back on there so I mean wasn't too hard but I mean like you like I said alright purple punch we're gonna try this out yeah we gonna get a couple hits in wrong okay hmm real smooth guys it's gotta like a I guess it's almost like a grape taste but it don't taste like strong like grape you know I guess it's what you think purple would taste like that's pretty cool this one's an indica which I'm not sure which one I prefer I don't even

legacy on the bed of cities Thanks", "6MOfU7VGHDQ": "[Music] hello and welcome to Pella data today we are reviewing the 710 at vaporizer pen from camp in the 1710 is one of the most popular oil-based vaporizers on the market thanks to its reliability and ease of use and is a good choice for both first-time and veteran vapors at 2995 for seven times prices on par with most oil-based fake pens it's available online or at local retailers in California and comes with custom battery and carrying case included in the fetchers the 710 boasts a perfect pool system designed to provide an ideal draw and we found during testing that the pool hint was strong while not overwhelming a streamlined design does allow it to slide easily in and out of a pocket but given its length we do worry about breakage while sitting our editors also noticed intermittent clogging after extended use and a bit of vapor leakage through the tip sealed during normal use the 710 comes with a custom at 350 million amp hour battery that lasts for roughly 400 puffs and can be recharged using the included USB cable oil cartridges must be purchased separately but a big plus is that the 710 is compatible with most standard oil based vape pen cartridges which can be found at any recreational or medicinal shop our panel taker editorial team gave the king pen an overall score of 84 out of 100 rewarding it for its ease of use portability the 710 is definitely a safe bet for anyone looking to acquire a reasonably priced oil based vaporizer overall though the 17 kingpin is a trustworthy vape pen with a smooth full-body

"pDiuy1PzmMo": "hi as mad at Rafal studios and welcome to our unboxing usage and review of the beast dryer vaporizer from LV smoke first things first is let's a free the beast from its cage and see what comes in the box of course you get the beast vaporizer unit itself there's an instruction manual there's an assortment of brushes and cleaning tools and a packing loading tool there's also a micro USB charging cable and a really cool thing that's included is a metal grater card that's used to grind cannabis so we'll be trying that out later so now let's take a closer look at the LVS beast vaporizer there is a one single power and multifunction button and then the eight power settings are indicated in that black box on the front which will light up once we power it on the bottom compartment is where the actual oven has a stainless steel oven it has a magnetic swinging lid that covers the bottom compartment it's a good sized oven there it's very similar to the PAX vaporizer oven then on top of the vaporizer we have the actual silicone mouthpiece that mouthpiece is removable underneath you will find the micro USB charging port you will also find the air path which goes all the way through the device and that's also why the pipe cleaners are were included because you can use those cleaners to fully clean the air path that's recommended to do frequently and you can see there's also a screen in the bottom of the oven compartment that is removable underneath these silicon mouthpiece is also where the charger as you can see when it's fully charged there's a little light in there that indicates blue and it indicates red when it is charging or it needs a charge okay now we have our vaporizer are charged up let's go ahead and turn it on and check out the functions and features the LVS beast cuts on with five clicks and that will actually power the unit on and then the really cool feature here is you use your finger to slide up and down to select between the eight different power settings well that's pretty innovative and really sets it apart from most other vaporizers and then once you have your temperature set you hold the power button for two seconds you'll see it turn red and that'll stay red until it actually gets to the temperature and it heats up in about 90 seconds or so to the fullest highest temperature and then you see it turns blue when it reaches temperature it stays on for seven minutes automatically you could also cut it off yourself with five clicks again it'll flash three times to let you know that the unit is powered off okay so that's the basic features and functions of it now we get to the fun part and that's actually testing it with some marijuana and first I'm going to try out the little card grinder that they sent these are really cool I've seen these before but I've never actually had a chance to use one it works really good with a especially with the larger budge you can just hold it and grade it and it makes a nice not a powdered but a nice fine grind and pretty even grind too so that was pretty neat a little thing to include in a vaporizer I'm so glad they did that now we're going to go ahead and load up a couple of bowls and try it out on a couple of different settings the first bowl I'm loading it loads really easily that big oven is really pretty easy to access that big lip that goes around it gathers a little bit of cannabis but then you just tap it it falls right down into the oven no problem there so it loads easily we got two of them loaded up and it's gonna head and test the first one what we're gonna do is we're gonna run one test at about the middle setting initially so I want to set that down to about 400 degrees right towards the center and then two seconds again to hold it on to get the actual heater to cut on and now we're trying it out and the one thing that I'd say about this is that the flavor is very good and one thing that I don't really like about it is that the puffs are pretty small so try though as I made to get a big puff out of it usually the actual smoke that you see coming out is it's pretty small amount but however the flavor and the intensity and the high is very good it has a lot to do with the mixed air path at the top of the mouthpiece it has one hole that lets an air through the vapor path which gets kind of warm and then another hole that lets air through at the top for fresh air which mixes the two together now but also maybe dilutes the amount of smoke that you get but small puffs aside I'd say that the quality of the vapor is good the flavor is good and the vaporize wheat itself is perfectly even and no combustion whatsoever even on the highest setting overall I want to give the beast dryer vaporizer from a heavy smoke three and a half stars it's a good entry-level vaporizer it doesn't give big puffs but it does give great flavor and it does an excellent job of vaporizing the cannabis I would like to thank the guys at

this eye style images coming at you with another product review this one I never even heard of this company before I don't know other than the guy I picked it up from I don't know anybody else that has ever bought this this brand or ever at a house party or anything you know there's no idea it's getting a little a little stuck now just so you can see from my bounnam Pro like sticks right there now I don't really [ __ ] need it but it comes in handy so this is super Lemon Haze it is not platinum veins for the one guy that I asked me to do the Platinum babes one I did a super lemon haze in the MKX card so I believe it was and now this one is cure super haze C so cartridge 510 threads you know the normal really unless you're getting a pod or something no no the kid I got this from was telling me how the oil is really thick and it takes a while for the bubble to move he said it took like a half hour for him to get the bubble to move from the side to the top it was in my pocket for not that very long and the bubble moved so not fast so I'll show you that in a second so on the label I get a batch test number tested by steadfast love labs I get a test number a test date 224 20 20 this is from one six eight zero market a vase City Michigan four eight 706 one Graham says activation time immediate but nowhere on this entire box does it tell me anything about percentages of THC so I'd have to look that up myself so I'm going to attempt to do that in a little bit and then I'll throw that in the description below you kind of see it in the shiny part it's a sativa and it's got the little little push button right here it's got the little weed logo poison control number we're gonna try to do this as easy as I can it was giving me difficulties earlier oh so this box reminds me of like the rogue watches that I see people doing reviews on I've never had one of those so I don't know anything about them other than I've seen packages from watching real man he smokes he did a lot of Rose cards so I've heard from the kids that I got these from but you know at the end of the day the salesman he's not gonna tell me something bad per se he told me that these are really good he enjoyed them every one he sold one to really enjoy them so we're just gonna get into this and formulate our own opinion pretty fruity on the on the dry head so you know it's got the the gold colored thread stuff in the mouthpiece the glass on the center just a seashell on the one on the bottom it says three when sea for three nine zero doesn't have the cush logo and it doesn't have the little fire looking symbol that the the Jupiter symbol or juniper one of the two I forget I kept saying Jupiter I think it's juniper um a little logo that they put on the bottom so we're gonna then turn this on nowhere on here did I see anything about bolts so we're gonna drop this back to the three point two that I usually run it instead of the three point seven for the Presto cards raise that up drop it down let's give this go and see what we got pretty tasty get a slight bit of that burn back here like you get from some cards usually I get that closer towards the end of a card or unless it's like a really earthy flavored one is sit back here or usually the coils burnt out and I'm getting like a real gross harsh flavor in the back of the neck throat I mean say yeah I'll say that's pretty tasty for being a company I've never dealt with before you know you get a little you get a little area because I don't want to pick up stuff like the myth next track ones that I got the one time that I didn't enjoy at all four flavors did enjoy them at all this one's actually not bad at all oh I'll have to wait and see you know just the type of high that it's gonna give me my eyes are watering a little bit I think I got something actually in this eye cuz I can feel it dry like up in here but yeah I would use this brand again I see no no reason not to now most are you gonna sit here and ask me hey how do you feel that these compared to say platinum based MK Church any of the other bigger named ones I would say this is it's not better than a lot of the Platinum vapes I've had this specific one um but it's right on par with a lot of the other platinum base I've had it I would say it's no worse just there's certain flavors and the Platinum vapes that I just really really like purple champagne purple pawnch Sunday driver galactic jack those were usually my top five I would definitely get this specific flavor again and I'm definitely willing to try this company a few more times the guy go through happens to have a few more these and I will do my best to get my hands on another one who's got cherry pie gelato blue dream is another one he's got but most of them are indicas and I was looking for a sativa at the time so that's why this one got chose blue dream he told me tasted really really good too so I may try to get my hands on that so one cuter boom super Lemon Haze you're on the channel can't wait to check out some all your products and give some more reviews taystee um so with that being said well try these if you can I can't tell you specifically that every flavor is good and every single car it's gonna be top-notch but as of right now one-for-one peace out guys like sub comment hit the bell for future videos and got a couple more reviews to do here in a little bit catch you guys in the next one peace out", "z0axSTawJPU": "hey what's good everybody jp here checking in with respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick marijuana madness versus challenge here for the month of march this is the fourth installment featuring the one and only napalm cannabis co this is a collaboration uh and ownership between exhibit and the cannabis company nepal cannabis he is one of the co-owners uh and so this is their newest product the flower bomb it is a 3.55 gram eighth they utilize flower that is indoor grown cultivated in downtown los angeles specifically in south central the originals group man some of the best cannabis on the entire west coast is going into this on my right we have the oxtradam og and i'll give you guys a full view here you guys can see the inside and it's a it's a bomb right fully branded oxtradam og and then over here we've got the gelato some larger looking nubs definitely covered in frost some nice purples again the bomb fully branded um what does it say what does it say 25.48 on the thc for the gelato 29.3 on the uh cannabinoids um what do we got what do we got manufactured february 17th it's fresh wow it's fresh uh manufactured packaged february 17 23.88 28.08 percent total can happen with 23.88 on the thc for the oakstreet so here we go i was told there was a surprise so this opens up here straight into the lid super dope just like that the lid for me is still inside so i got to get this out somehow oh maybe we just twist it maybe i'll just pull it off yeah there we go pull it off and then twist so there's this okay wow look at this gelato nug in here absolutely incredible beautiful chunky dark green purple there's just covered in trikes wow and then tucked inside is a custom branded napalm cannabis premium rolling paper pack so super cool inside of the bomb there this whole this whole experience can literally be gold you know this is a little storage device so this is super cool big shout out to napalm cannabis man that's [ __ ] dope that's super dope all right let's get this one out next all right all right the oakstra damn oh gee oh sweet and piney wow delicious and again another little napalm rolling paper pack custom fit there's actually a little slot that it slides into super dope man all the details really thought out um all right so for this versus i'm gonna roll up two little baby joints real quick and we're gonna get right to it so let me get this rocking and wrong the first one is gonna be the okra damn og i've smoked this a number of times uh i'm told and rumors have it here in la that this is the uh uh either the same cut or the originating cut for the marathon og so there's that which is super cool and then the gelato i'm a big fan of gelato's been smoking a lot of it i literally woke up this morning and smoked a gelato joint so we we shall see how it goes man i think you know when you think about these these marijuana madnesses these verses right it's it's so easy for me to just go brand versus brand but in this case this is a brand new product from me upon that literally just hit the market uh i want you guys to be able to to understand whether or not you know which one to buy it's a 60.8 plus tax so for some people it might be expensive and whereas for others you might be buying you know an entire ounce worth of these i personally i'm going to try them out so we're going to see we're going to see how this goes the oaks again unfortunately is smaller buds even all the way to littles the biggest bud in here is going to be that one so already at least on the bag appeal a lot of this is just smaller um just smalls unfortunately the bag appeal on the jar peel on the the gelato is significantly better but you know ultimately it'll come down to the flavor here so let me go ahead and grind this up get this going here we go the smell is delicious i mean there's no doubt that oxtrade emoji is one of the best cuts of og around there's just no doubt in my mind about that so we're going to start off with this one here we go i'm not going to do too big of a joint but i do want to get a good taste and then we'll just finish this a little later do you guys roll joints do you smoke blunts do you prefer gelatos or oh geez let me know what you guys think in the comments great time to like follow and subscribe right now definitely smash that down below trying to get this up to a thousand i'll be giving away honestly i really want to give away one of these flower bombs so uh whoever's gonna be my thousand subscriber i'm gonna go buy you guys a flower bomb you all heard it here first all right here we go all right here we go i'm excited okay damn oh gee versus the napalm gelato napalm versus napalm here we go first hit delicious smooth piney creamy not gelato creamy but og creamy wow okay okay it's good it's good it's not the best version of the oak shredder that i've ever had though just to be 100 i definitely had it better taste wise nine nine flat it's super solid it's just not as sweet or as tiny as i've had it before whether it's from the marathon og or literally the ocean dam i bought it before i've tried it uh it's delicious though absolutely delicious okay okay so that's where i'm at with that one wise it definitely makes you feel a little a little bit sluggish a little bit foggy in the eyes or the head it's definitely a heavier uh a heavier high um oh see there we go back at it with the there we go back at it with the jar on the top so this is a little bit tricky for me but i should be able to get it oh once i get a seal there it is there we go there we go there we go all right so i've got a little gelato nug right here we're going to use i'm going to save the big one because that's just too beautiful but to be real all of the nugs in this gelato thing are bigger than the nubs inside that one over there so gelato is a clear flat out winner for nug size jar peel bag of peel they got one beautiful big ass nug and then every other one is just big yeah you're not big but at least you know a .25 or 0.3 there's not little there's not little scraggly ones that would be used for pre-rolls traditionally right you guys the gelato i can smell it from here it smells like sweet creamy berries let me get it stuffed in this joint and lit up i gave you guys a nine flat on the ocean damn over there for the taste test let's figure out what the gelato is at here we go here we go here we go the high for the okra dam was pretty good too i'm not gonna lie i do enjoy the way it's making me feel it gives you a little bit burst of energy you're not sober slightly sedative you know feel like all which is a good feeling sometimes you really just want to feel messed up you know but now we're on to the lotto okay here we go you guys now we're ready so let me go ahead and give this end a twist so i can give it a good light here at the end and then we are going to figure out what it's at i've got an official score in my head for the ocean dam it's a nine on the taste test here we go overall though we're gonna have to see i'm gonna wait for the gelato and then i'll hit you guys with the score at the end like follow subscribe take the time go support napom flower bomb support green uh green thumb dr green thumbs la i got these at the downtown la doctor green thumb wow first hit right away you get a blast of gelato holy [ __ ] sweet sweet creamy berries gas all right here we go second hit sweet sweet creamy gas okay so it's really it's really hands down on this one the gelato has a more of a blast of an experience more sweet more cream more pungent the buds are better it's an overall better buy right but the reality is that if you do prefer og strains i don't think that the oxygen is gonna let you down so my official taste test review for the gelato is gonna be a 9.75 it's absolutely [ __ ] delicious now overall i'm gonna also give it a 97.5 maybe even a 98 out of 100. the only thing that i have issue is that i would love to see the terpene profiles on the packaging it's a standard comment i make right there so 97.5 98 whatever you guys would rather have it highly recommend it go check it out gelato beats the ocean dam on this taste test on a pure numbers basis but gelato go buy that if you're an og person definitely go check out the yorkshire dam it's delicious my final score for the okra damn is going to be a 90 out of 100 i'm gonna keep it at a nine flat i really have an issue with the smaller buds being that it is a sixty dollar premium eighth and wrapper weed right but at the end of the day you do get what you pay for if this was 75 80 90 then i would definitely expect bags and you know we should see bags with only nugs like this but i love it i would go buy it again i highly recommend you guys do it go check it out let me know what you guys think in the comments be sure to like follow and subscribe and go support napalm cannabis on instagram respect my region everywhere baby i love you all peace see you guys in the next review", "f-DP35X6LaY": "so I'm curious how long does the oil within your cartridge actually last well for our 500 milligram cartridges we'd like to think of it as around 4 to 5 grams of cannabis okay for me it'll last a little less than a week but for my wife it can go a couple weeks okay and for some others it might last a month or two correct right right and - what's the shelf-life of an oil cartridge if I if I happen not to use it right away how long will it last work well with the oil there's not really a shelf-life but sometimes the cannabinoids will degrade over time whether it's with light or heat THC can turn to CBN a CBC can turn to CDL through too much light and that's not harmful but that's not exactly what people might want to have happen correct right so if you have a sativa oil that is high in CBN the CBN is going to make you sleepy which kind of goes against the sativa right and how long would that degradation take to occur it takes a good while at least a year okay so you've got you've got some time yeah it's gonna be gone before that happens and so tell me if I have a oil cartridge and/or it's on the pan or in the package how should I store it storage is probably best at room temperature and you don't want to leave it in your car you don't want to put it in the freezer or the refrigerator just a normal room temperature would be fine and if you live in a hot climate about that if you live in a hot climate it's good to be in air-conditioning if I wouldn't leave it in a car sometimes if if it's too hot in a car the oil will get so thin you're risking possibilities of it leaking got it okay well thank you so much for that answer", "oovH1YDaw40": "welcome back welcome back welcome back to our [ __ ] hey [Music] hmm all right child welcome back to another video but the video is gonna be a quick one because we just had to try this we keep seeing it everywhere in our town y'all let us know the shit's everywhere bro yeah like let us know if it's everywhere god's out too because this [ __ ] is is going through fast i'm seeing it literally everywhere but it's called cake and it's a little disposable and right off back it looks like the cookies logo which so they they kind of stole that yeah they did and the cookies does a little print they stole they they completely stole the cookies look but how i feel is delta a and delta nine is like delta nine big brother delta a little brother or maybe a little sister ain't number one in that sense like cookies is d9 and cake his d.a like cookie's a cake nah that's how i took you yeah he didn't like it he didn't like i ain't got a lot it's it i don't really have a problem with it no more because it's kind of like damn burner you ain't got a [ __ ] delta eight out yet so yeah someone's gonna steal your [ __ ] you should have been up on it why do we not have a cookie's delta eight sure period but we got the texas pound cake indica 940 milligrams delta a one gram cart it says on the bags got a little oh it was collected on december 16 2020. it's got the qr code on the back and everything the batch that this was made from was only 14 grams so you literally got one of 14 grams that was made for this that's pretty cool it's got a little cake seal i kinda like that crack this [ __ ] open got this love hate relationship i do i do it's a real love hey y'all don't don't judge me for my sailor moon shirt i don't give a [ __ ] they think yours is dope ah [ __ ] this is the ceremony used to be on all my uh notebooks and folders back in the day all right so i've heard nothing but good things about this oh it's the sticker i've heard nothing about good things everybody keeps saying how good it is and they had two different boxes for some reason one box was solid and then it was this yes and it was like the box like this is what a box like these was all like a cake line yeah and then the red box was like the other flavors and [ __ ] yeah but so far i kind of like the packaging though it's it's winning you over so we got [ __ ] this this trash now and i want to go ahead and say kate does not know we're doing a review on them no we just [ __ ] we gotta keep up with our subscribers [ __ ] is talking about it so we got to get it regardless if they [ __ ] with us i kind of like how it looks no lie it's got the clear windows on the side of it it's pretty cool i like that okay it's got a charging port so if you do find yourself low you'll be able to charge that [ __ ] up a little seal like the top is rubber right now it ain't yeah it's plastic it's a little look a little bit more a little rubber fits it better other ones you see and i got three little mouth holes i like that that's cool like a harmonica at the top now the texas pound cake i've never tried texas pound cake anything but you know it's crazy hold on though they cake starts with a c but the disposables got a k on it see okay let me see the box that's a little weird maybe they got the disposables made by somebody else just didn't have their logo on it well when you look up cake we tried to find that actual like company and get in contact with them to see if they wanted to work with us it was hard to even find anything about them everybody that sell these are like third-party sellers they're not coming from a direct site so when we look down there that was a thing you can see on the metal of gas stations yeah a lot of gas stations that's mainly we're already off back okay disposables i have some other disposables you pull it out it's literally just a plastic container like a little plastic square and some wires connected to it that's it this [ __ ] is like a real cart if you look on the inside you see the same filter and [ __ ] as a cart yeah you do so this is like i don't know if y'all gonna be able to see that [ __ ] yeah you're not gonna be able to see that that's the window but the window it's got an actual [ __ ] little piece of the metal [ __ ] stem like on the carts yeah all right so see what this tastes like he'll be [ __ ] me up when [ __ ] ain't got buttons oh what's that to look uh action was that satisfaction have you that's what you ain't answering me have you tasted texas pound cake no that tastes good oh it tastes sweet yeah it's like it

heading out all dishes are not alike [ __ ] over here it hit me in my esophagus [Music] perfect", "NOl3lkgTT-Y": "yo what is going on everybody this is weed them boys on the we dem boys Channel I'm here bringing a tutorial on how to unclog your vape pin this goes with like any cartridges you know of any sort for smoking like a some sort of liquid of or oil you know so basically this is showing you how to get this part in clogged because what happens is I'm just one on a little trip to the desert basically and uh it's really too hot to even take these things out there the temperature is like war about you know ranging from a hundred degrees like 110 and riding in the car they see worked okay and even then you can still feel the heat in the car so what happened was the liquid started just heating up too much and it just got filled here like it would get liquefied and I guess I got blocked so if you take a flashlight to your cartridge look in here you'll see it at the block right now mine isn't because well I I kind of just found out my way how to fix it this is um and this may not work with all cartridges as a disclaimer because this is a heavy hitters I'm not sure throw the same like that inside where it's a little bucket and then a narrow hole for where the vacant escape anyway let's just get to tutorial so what you need is a cartridge you gotta need a lighter not preferably a lighter because you don't want to use a tortured you're way too hot and are a liar would be safer so not everybody has torso lighter I recommend having these these are alcohol swabs relying on so I recommend getting a couple of these you can find those at Walmart Walgreens I can't guarantee you will find them out get the which called 99-cent store but if you don't have those you could use like a q-tip or maybe a q-tip what some alcohol higher grade would be better like ninety percent or something anyway first step you want to get your vape and get your vape you're gonna hold at one side I'll show it while recording is call me crazy I'll hold it one side and you get the other you light the lighter you basically have to hold it till this gets hot now you wanna be careful how you're holding it because the liquid will start dripping out so you want to make sure your hands will not be touching the liquid because when it falls out its gonna be like hot cuz it's melting scumbag lava high if it gets on you it's gonna burn so this is just example just to show you but be careful how you are aiming the lighter you don't have to buy it like this to use your hand like that just make sure you're getting the metal part and this will take like maybe about a cool minute you'll know it's gonna be hot enough when you start seeing the the chrome tip starts to look like blackened will start to singe the actual chrome tip doesn't actually burn our mounts because it's metal if it's plastic you know melt and that's not good so don't worry about melting we'll be fine you wanna do this for a minute and then after a while should be hot enough to where the liquid should just see I think I'm pretty good already because you could see the gunk previously that was in it there's all that and it was just uh not good and there is a little bit still there I guess you can see how it blackened around there please do not don't don't touch the chrome tape because that's just gonna be hot so just be careful guys cuz may be doing this you know when you uh that's a little bit mess and your system so just be careful with that and once you're done you're gonna want to get the alcohol wipes and I don't have another one right now I could just reuse this one real quick is still kind of moist last week check this out all right so all you gotta do is I just get that thing oh [ __ ] is still hot you just you might want to wait give it like five minutes let it cool off I not still hot but just for the sake of the video lightly touching it with just the cloth it wasn't super hot but it was still hot enough for her gotta be careful and like I said this one's not as dense but once you use the alcohol swab or this in this case I'm using an alcohol pad just make sure you wipe off any excess side from the lighter and make sure you also another thing is to outside the mouthpiece kind of clean inside just in case so you're not you know getting any of the fumes that you're using the lighter from you know and after that well check the inside make sure it's clear if it is go ahead and give it a test suck you know take a test hit basically and like I said be careful cuz this this is real metal so it's gonna conduct heat it's gonna stay warm basically and I will get another one but I'm recording on my iPhone so I can't like pause and restart the video kind of sucks but I'll give it a test suck real quick just to make sure just kind of want to cool it off because it is really still kind of warm I'm not trying to burn my lips it feels ok to get like a quick heat off of me okay making sure all this is off and it may take a little longer there's not really much of a long process just making sure that you get you empty out all that burnt hardened wax that was in the mouthpiece little hole I kind of just still trying to I'll just put in my fridge real quick you know all right I'm just over here in the freezer just not put it on there but just kind of keep it in here so my hands it's gonna be too hot to still get like a test test it over I may see only just cooling it with the ice now basically by now you will you would have been done already and giving your test to it but yeah basically at this point or just moment I'm you you're your vape should be cleared and you should be able to get a test hit half of it and I show you right now I'll do a quick test in oh one other thing to other thing if you have a second alcohol swab or tab I recommend using it on the bottom of here because sometimes there can be a leakage for some reason because the air I live I've had it where this part will get sticky and you also want to clean the inside or nothing of what you have inside and also make sure make sure you clean that content because of that contact I can't hit this part of the vape it's not going to get any it's not even like conduct any electricity to you know melt the vape and for you to take you know the vape it so make sure you clean the bottom of your cartridge as well as the inside of your vaping ping once you do that make sure there's no leakage or no blockage excuse me do this again I would say started off slow you know right now my pan I could go up to a 4.3 volts which isn't much but honestly it's the perfect amount when I'm using it for right now I'll play like a 3.3 now but I'm glad I got 3.5 so I get some juice going take the hit I'll try one more time but it was a pretty good hit it's cuz there's not much in the cartridge to begin with it's kind of like most of it got stuck up here but here we go yeah it still needs it very clean it's like I said make sure you clean inside real good because I feel like some of that suck get in there too you know yeah so make sure you give it a good clean other than that guys that's pretty much how you get your your vape unclogged this is the Alpine one you want to be careful cuz like I said this is heavy hitters you can see how these Alpine ones really it conducts electricity and then they not my bad electricity conducts heat and this rubber band that kind of like a seal for this could maybe break or get worked so you wanna be careful depending on what kind of vape in your head you queue and see here how it looks like there's a coil in there and it's more like a direct passage compared to how the heavy hitters is just like it starts off flourish and then it goes in thin and so I hope this video kind of help you guys out look a little tutorial just kind of found it out yeah so next time guys deuces", "3zYwF_NNiKU": "and on guys welcome back to another video and I've got draw how to play boys with you and a big thank you to thank vapes for sending this in this is the black member dry herb vaporizer and it's one of the best setting in the UK and give so many 35 pounds or 46 pounds and they give you a 10% discount on their website I'm going to be trying it today with the purple marzipan yeah big thank you to car as well she's been really helpful on the live chat and email speaking to me they just simply sat for nothing so yeah big shout out to them and then yeah this is the black man bar as you can see it's a nice portable vaporizer nice and small it's very easy to use is one button and there's five different temperature settings ranges from 180 to 220 degrees Celsius and yes a glass mouthpiece two magnets will four magnets on the name there's a glass mouthpiece yes the chamber apparently you can hold 0.65 gram in there but not too sure on that to be honest but yeah it's quite nice size train bar so if you pass it around with a couple of friends or few friends having a nice session to yourself is pretty nice but yeah it's one of the the best-selling in England at the mini I think and this really easy to use as I just said one button and yes plenty of I have it and to be honest we've gone i'm not going to slag off the other one that I've got but this ones are not cheaper and to be honest with y'all I've only been using this one since I'm quiet so yeah it's not only just to give you a better idea of it but yeah I really do enjoy it it's pretty real number one there yeah I'm going to just pack this out with the end papa marzipan and then I'll get back to use it's worth saying you get this nice little worm packing solve it as well which is really nice as well you can feel a nice weight to it and yeah it's really good for doing the job is intended to do and betting them little dad tells it you get with the other ones you get a little worm microUSB charger there's a little char to pull and then when it's full charge there's a little light display there when it's full charge is green and then when it's half or like near enough half it goes purple and then when this low battery it goes red just so you know it needs a charge and five presses then it turns on and as you can see we're all fire lysis displayed that'll be going up to the highest temperature 220 but if you hold your finger down on it start whining for it sandwiches put onto the false in as you can see the green light they're showing us on when they starts heating got through to green and then when he goes on to the last one that's when you know it's on the temperature setting it you want just give it a little minutes of them hey up the whole chamber before you start chugging on it and then yeah big shout out to Cara and everyone that think vapes we're sending this over and then yeah I've been using it for two days I have to say so I'm really good to get nice nice for long for vapor and I'll get about five minutes out of every chamber and this purple marzipan is really nice and sweet on it as well getting not a peppermint sort of taste off for this marzipan the only thing that I found I didn't really like is it you can't stand it up from when you try and load it so you have to use both hands at once hold the device and 1/2 M pour in and then start packing it down afterwards but other than that the only thing that I can really point out I haven't had no problems with them hate on the math pace excuse me sir but just not used to well at the bother to vaporizers they won't give me a notches on what this one is to go through yeah but if we're first price my other fake prize I'll paint the same money for that one and to be honest with you how that one went back yes they are singing it back to the person to a boy off of because then I wanted to get a refund because I won a P because once I tried the M crayon and I tried this one bow for them and blowing it out of a ballpark so this one's am the same price and everyone's a little bit more but yeah this is what go to one at the minute to be honest with ya I only got this one on the crate over I did Sydney's advertise a while ago and I was really intrigued like everyone was saying a good deal for the money but I never ended up getting one and then when I bought that and herb I really regretted buying it and wish I bought this one [Music] give me a look at the pearl marzipan really nice peppermint sort of flavor Lanka and for this absolutely yeah big shots of them no for sending this over make sure you go check them out guys I think you can get 10% discount when

good battery life I've only had to charge it once since I bought it and I've used probably about nine or ten chambers for at lease CS really easy to use easy but if you get a box nothing you did come instructions but to be honest we are would he read up on the website as he use it and then didn't even look at the instructions but yeah it's got 16 minimum battery so yeah decent battery as I was saying the temperature 180 to 220 it's 20 second heat at times yes really fast thing up decent chamber knock it where there's nothing I can really say but the only thing I could really say is this not the chamber might be too big if you're on your own and you want to have a bit alike but I don't think if you want to put in a little bit another thing that's gonna matter you can still use a little bit in there it's not going to make a difference to the quantity of the vapor so yeah 10% off for the website when you join up guys and this is the best setting in this price point if you want to buy

with justin cures for part two of the buddies brand west coast we tour review series for this episode we've got the three bears og cannabis derived terpenes distillate cartridge i've heard it's really good the roommate sells it at mother nature's remedy where we got it it's really delicious so 91.98 on the total cannabinoids and again since i'm an employee of buddy's brand justin here is going to be the official reviewer on behalf of respect my region for this case so thc at 88.5 this is a high potency product brother this is high potency 88.5 yeah that's crazy 91.98 basically 92 cannabinoids i mean terpenes listed on the back coming in hot 3.3 yep uh we got the top three are beta-mercene beta-caryophyllene and beta uh osamine i believe that's how you say it osamine muscle i don't know whatever 0.26 on that one point three seven on the karyophylline and 1.62 on the mercy which makes total sense uh since it's an og three bears og is the string uh i have smoked a different i'm sorry i vaped a different batch of this probably about a month or so ago um and it was around 88 on the total award-winning so we're gonna check it out cannabis single source distillate are you ready yeah i feel like uh you know i'm not a big you know pen smoker but i have definitely tried lots lots just about every brand because it's either been handed to me you saw or give it to me or exactly live residentially like even back in the day when it goes to you know where you don't even want to talk about those times medical days yeah medical you never knew before testing and all that um so but right away i look at the color and i'm like yo this is poe because that color just looks it's so nice very beautiful shade of gold that's for sure so you can just look at the color i'm like this is going to get me uh probably pretty stoned this is good i feel like it's going to be harsh though you think so yeah but what i do want to know though is what's what's the cross on this three bears oh gee though that's what's also kind of missing is because that would usually tell you right the genetics information we want to know i think as consumers we all want to know what g's can vary what what is the original strain right there's there's ogs that are like they come out purple there's og's that are very you know stoney there's you know it ranges it says ingredients distilled kettle oil and canna terps that's it simple as that that's it inhale until desired effect is achieved i always recommend four to six seconds system is safe if you're experienced obviously you know i'll do it around the middle minimum i always also like to say if you're less you know experienced go a little shorter we're talking high potency some good clouds right there shout out to buddy's brand battery okay not harsh at all i was actually expecting to be very harsh wasn't harsh do you get the terps i mean yeah that's like smoking a bowl of lg right there wow yeah that's really nice wow almost almost could trick somebody like if you didn't show me the box and said this was live resin i i could have got dude really could have did me are you just let me try this are you saying yes yeah are you are you thinking yeah no i'm saying no i'm saying that i like i said you might have dude me no i'm not saying you would but i'm saying because it is just it's not harsh and it has very good the terps are like there you can tell it's og but um it does have that it does have that limonene and it does have that carryoffaling not my main i guess it does that but then once once i'm like sitting with it i can tell it's this because the vapor is just different it's different than libraries it doesn't have that sweet or you know like live resin has a rounded hit to the end of it versus something sharper yeah just sharper um that's what i need to do too i always do the hit uh out the nose to really get the turf beam profile second hit here this is your score out of 10 hit opportunity so we review for respect our reason review you know presentation appeal color taste potency wow more information would you recommend your experience i'm definitely stunned i'm definitely stoned and man that knows would you recommend i would to somebody who's a big distillate fan yeah that is that this usually ranges from between 37 and i'll keep you 42 that'll keep you lit at disneyland i'm telling you that much yeah this [ __ ] is potent let me hit this up later i feel a head change i feel it behind my eyes like making my eyes lower i feel on the second hit i was like i'm like going back to what i said i'm like no you couldn't do me you can't do me on it like getting it the second time i'm like yeah you can tell that's some really fire disney what are you thinking really exciting really clean for a distillery pen i'm like man that's i'm surprised uh more people aren't talking about uh i want to ask you that like is you know do those are they flat whoever has them for the club oh really wow okay okay people i just i guess i way more than that yeah and and um certainly sometimes i even get like like what you would call like sweats yeah and i'm not so i think this is just really really good distillate you're right yeah you said it a couple times really really good oh hi i can tell i can tell if i were there's no mirror in front of me but my eyes are red for sure for sure right now um let's let me see from color to to overall to the packaging you know once again hey let me know what the three bears og crosses but man i i'd suggest that over anything when it comes to just a pencil that's uh i don't know how else to give it anything but um nine club 9.5 9.5 a little bit more information could help i can't remember well i appreciate you sharing that review my man you know i personally have reviewed so many of these buddies discipline cards i've tried them i've smoked got 100 100 of them at least and i think as of recently you know whether it's the extraction or the source material i think you know we're just seeing a lot more consistency um but yeah you know adding the strain the genetics and some of that information will be a key addition and let me let me say that that this is very honest for me because this is i've tried i mean i could just name like a bunch and gone to so many events where they're letting you try this try this try this trying whatever flavor they're coming out with and again and again it's like a lot of coffee in the sweats you know a lot of harsh products a lot of harsh product exactly and i believe that's where it comes down to you know single source over multi-source i guess right i don't want to see anything and that's what really sets this apart this product apart because you know it's three bears og when you're smoking it it's like i said tasting a bowl of og kush so hats off to that because i appreciate that that's that's really good for some distilling you guys let us know what you think in the comments all right

coming and joining and sitting down or driving or whatever you're doing but listening most importantly to our humble podcast thank you and welcome to another episode of votepro podcast um we're gonna get started with um some inside the beltway news what about that sounds good but first let me just interrupt no please do can you see we we do this on zoom so he's looking at it see what i got today i just got this what it is i don't know i'm going to say it this i bought a cartridge a vape cartridge from my vape store in virginia which is not thc it's just this is right delta 8 thc have you heard about it that's the big craze now there's a little loophole in the law delta eight is very close to delta nine which of course is what we all used to using to get high phc delta nine delta eight is a molecule a compound rather that's in the plant in the flower on a much smaller quantity but what happened when they passed the uh the hemp bill the farm act the farm bill whatever the hell they called it farmville making hemp 2018. what they what there's a loophole where they go in and they can pull the delta eight out of the flower and concentrate it and sell it and what it does is it gets you high but it's different from delta nine it's a it's a sister to delta nine gets you high but it's how do i explain it it's like you feel you realize you're high but you don't have that lack of focus you know how you get you know you do a couple bonuses you're always done and you're standing at the kitchen sink or you have the refrigerator open for like 15 minutes why am i standing in the time thing you don't get that and you don't get the paranoia so anyway you can buy this now legally and it's pretty interesting pretty easy now so so you're enjoying the effects of the delta i took a couple hits before the show so let's see how that goes but no i've tried it and it's a uh it's hard to explain it's not like a stone thing like what you're used to smoking a joint or something but it you feel it do you feel a physical uh sensation you feel a little bit of that euphoric kind of i feel good thing and i feel relaxed wow yeah but i don't have that like what time is it man so anyway i just thought i'd throw it out there for those of you what did i come to the kitchen for again you know what i'd love if some people would write us write us you know podcast that's pod pod cast at votepropot.com let us know what you think of delta eight i'd be interested to see yeah let's get a little bit of i didn't mean to interrupt your very important up-to-date political news phil i just don't patronize me man okay go for it no i'm kidding we've got two separate bills that now these are both been introduced into the house and senate before but uh didn't go anywhere and as we know when the senate was controlled by the republicans senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is not in a rush to get any of these things done that's for sure so they've been reintroduced and there are two of them and i'm going to start with the secure and fair enforcement banking act it's called the safe banking act it was reintroduced this week by colorado representative ed perlmutter and this has got a lot of bipartisan support they're more than a hundred co-sponsors um and they're from both parties that's great and it's got a very strong chance of passing now what the legislation does uh would allow financial institutions to basically serve the cannabis industry without facing any federal penalties which many banks and credit unions they don't want to take on any cannabis clients because of these federal sanctions the fear of right um and what happens well they have to operate on a cash basis and crazy and it's it's a pain in the ass and dangerous i mean these guys are walking around millions of dollars right yeah they're vulnerable to all kinds of crime and it complicates you know they've got all this financial regulation compliance and it's just so complicated on a cash basis it's just it's not worth anybody's time in the financial world i don't know who on the republican side is sponsoring it but it might be uh kevin kramer do they have a fair amount of republican support yeah they've got strong republican support i think it will pass i i have a feeling it would have passed if if mcconnell had ever you know dated to to put on the floor um but that's hard to say but it's a good bet to pass now um promoter said uh quote it's time to enact safe banking to align federal and state laws and reduce the public safety risk in our communities and and that's true and uh we're just inching our way towards some sleep legalization this is inching our way this is this now this is in the house um and a similar bill is expected to be introduced in the senate next week i don't know who is going to sponsor it but um that's that's the scuttlebutt the other bill is um called the claim act and again this is how i don't know how they come up with these acronyms but it's the the clarifying law around insurance of marijuana act you know it is what it says now what what it would do is it it basically keeps the federal government out of the insurance uh uh out of the penalties for insurance companies covering cannabis industry firms um it just would prohibit it it would are they penalized now yeah you can be penalized simply for offering coverage oh my god to uh to a cannabis firm and and uh and and the same thing as the same lines as the banking yeah and the same line as the banking it's a sort of a financial industry and um it would also now there's a lot of provisions of this bill but it would also the other thing is it would require the gao uh the government accountability office to study and to report on any barriers that are being imposed barriers to the marketplace to financial services licensing any of that stuff the gao will be responsible to keep tabs on this and make sure that this all flows smoothly and and people are not being unduly burdened and the senator on the democratic side who is sponsoring this is bob menendez of new jersey and on the republican side is rand paul of kentucky well rand paul's a libertarian right so he's always going to be on the side of getting the government out of your face that's right and he said here's what he said the principles behind the claim act are simple respect the voices of the states and their people and stop shutting out legitimate businesses from obtaining basic protections ah how do you argue with that you know how do you argue with that right yeah exactly so why are they doing this doing this being federal legalization in such an incremental way why don't they just if they're gonna take the time to pass all these bills why don't they just pass a bill that says it's legal you know why all these little incremental baby steps yeah that's that's the way government works as well the the old saying is that politics is the art of the possible yeah so they're doing what they can what they can yeah well you know what the uh with the makeup of the congress and the white house being what it is they have an opportunity why are they doing this all piecemeal i really don't know because they can but they but they're doing what they can i guess send us your thoughts at votepropot.com contact or send us an email at podcast votepropot.com and please give us a 5 star rating on apple podcasts if you'd like to be part of the show call our message line at 240-257-2441 remember we had on um we had on a guy i don't know maybe a year ago or a little less than a year a fellow by the name of warren bobrow oh i remember warren well he had a great time with oren yeah a lot of fun he's a he's a big wig in the industry you see him on tv and you see him all over the place he uh he writes for forbes magazine he writes for forbes and a bunch of other magazines uh on cannabis and he's also known as the cocktail whisperer that's right and he was on the show uh to talk about a lot of things but one of which was promoting a new line of uh infused beverages he has which i believe are out now called claws k-l-a-u-s oh cool yeah so this is a story out of there i suppose with a k yeah the original version right um this is a story out of marijuana business daily by bart shannon and the title of the story is how are cannabis infused beverages doing in the market basically sales of the cannabis infused beverages are up 40 last year as companies sought to capitalize our new marijuana customers seeking a familiar form of consumption and those looking for an alternative to drinking alcohol okay according to data from seattle-based cannabis analytics firm headset sales of marijuana infused beverages increased 40 last year versus 2019 recreation and recreational markets such as california colorado nevada oregon and washington state cannabis infused beverages rose from 67.8 million to in 2019 to 95.2 million in 2020 wow so that sounds like a pretty significant growth does to me but what you have to realize is the overall industry grew 40 too so they grew kind of you mean the overall cannabis industry or the overall beverage industry cannabis okay all right but they didn't lag behind so that's good right they're at the same 40 growth despite the strong growth of infused beverage market um there's a small port there's still a small portion of the overall mix they're about one percent one percent of the entire cannabis sales are beverages now that kind of surprised me i thought it would be a little better than that but this year they're at 1.2 percent 2021 so far so david they're edging up a little it might seem obvious but kind of the marketing idea i think for most of these companies is that you've got a lot of people who are new to cannabis yeah either have never tried it or haven't in a long time and some of them are a little cautious about rolling a joint or doing a bong hit or buying a dab rig you know right but it's easy to buy a drink pop a top and drink it another thing is they say that um this is again how they're marketing it it's much more acceptable but let's say you get a cocktail party with a bunch of friends somebody lights up a joint right everybody turns around and looks what the hell is going on yeah right you know what i'm saying it's like but but if you go to the refrigerator and grab a can and crack it and pour it into this i'm just gonna give it a second thought nobody thinks about it so they're thinking that's kind of the uh the whole idea so so it's a kind of a social fit in type of a thing social acceptability now here's the question um you've had cannabis infused beverages before i don't recall that i ever have um i understand they don't taste so great well again that was warren's that was warren's deal that he was going to produce something that really was good he's written six books on making drinks yeah and he says that he has come up with a formula and a way to infuse drinks and market them that taste delicious we have not i have not seen his drinks i think they're in can uh california yeah i don't think they're available in maryland or virginia or virginia yeah no but i would like to try some clothes me too me too i have had a couple of different uh and and i've they're fine if you the kind i've had or you put a little cap full and you drink the capful like fruit punch or something so it's like a little five hour energy or something i have not tried like you know one of the seltzer drinks where you're going to drink 12 ounces right i don't know what that's like i wonder how much [Music] thc is in one of those salts or drinks it varies a lot of them are actually um making them fairly low like five to ten yeah yeah so that you know you can drink a couple socially and not get hammered you know right and uh i think that's kind of the intent i mean why would you buy a drink that's 40 or 40 milligrams or something you know they're five and you can drink two or three and and get a little buzz and it comes on slowly and that's one of the things they talk about in this article was some of the people are cautious about china because it takes a while for it to kick in yeah so there's a couple of uh manufacturers who claim to be coming out with products that kick in in between five and 15 minutes well that would be helpful i think yeah like you have a glass of wine or a drink you know and you feel it and yeah 10 minutes later you know how it's affected you right and the problem you you and i both know that edibles is sometimes you it's an hour an hour and a half and you don't think you've gotten any effect from it and you drink six of them so the drink the drink market is doing well but it's not blowing the doors off anybody so uh you know good luck to uh to warren and all the all the manufacturers anybody have any experiences with some of these cannabis infused beverages love to hear from you bye he's the president oh right the president um i've heard of him yeah been around a little while he has been busy you know setting up his administration and uh we've been sharing some of that with you in the last few segments or last few episodes this week um and this is an article from marijuana moment um which i love by the way there's all kinds of great stuff um about his top pick what a lot of people believe is his top pick for the director of the federal office of national drug control policy aka the drug czar and rahul gupta is the leading candidate for the position of drug czar he was the former chair of the west virginia medical cannabis advisory board um and he served on biden's transition team what makes gupta a little different is that he has actually publicly recognized the therapeutic benefits of cannabis whoa that's encouraging yes he has really and and he has and he worked in west virginia with the control board advisory board on a legal cannabis program so to authorize medical use of of marijuana so um that's a little bit different take on a drugstore you know drug czars are usually the enforcement czars saying no no but this uh rahul gupta may be if he's picked he may be ready to break that mode what an interesting what an interesting pick seriously what does that say well i i think the the what how do you read those tea leaves you know i don't know because the sum total of biden's picks um since really mixed messages right there was that's my point the other one uh uh oddly enough also named gupta of anita gupta um who was uh confirmed i believe as the assistant attorney general is not in favor of legalizing or decriminalizing drugs she just said flat out and we told you about that last week merrick garland who was confirmed as attorney general may be a little less strident about it we just don't know so i mean up and down the biden administration i i just i'm not getting any strong indication uh of a pro-cannabis bent from these folks although i'm not getting an anti-cannabis spent either so i mean that's something yeah it could be a couple things could be just that that's just not a priority for them and that's not one of the things that you're looking at on the resumes of these people or because drugs are you with things drugs are that's what i was going to say but drugs are a guy who's very pro that seems to that kind of i don't know well i think it's it's it's encouraging if if you're going to read anything into those leaves exactly whatever whatever kind of leaves that you want it's encouraging we but again wait and see the odd thing is that the the drugs are the director of the on dcp is required by federal law to oppose any legalization effort of any drug banned under the controlled substances act so i don't know where he's gonna fit or or what's gonna happen but instead of a dilemma he's in there but maybe it's time for that law to go as well so yeah um let's let's let's hope got a new segment we're gonna try this out all right on a regular basis we're going to do a little piece on history history is related to cannabis last week we did a little something on on the beatles yeah and uh cannabis remember i got a 100. thank you you did i got both questions right i think the idea is to we'll cover a lot of different topics you know events that occurred you're not going to quiz me again are you i might have a question for you yeah uh but you know just just it could be anything it could be 2 000 years ago the chinese and what they did with it it could be you know how marijuana became illegal in the united states in the 30s we'll cover all that but we're going to start out with something fun this week and that's cheech and chong all right so are you really mad all right well you know there's a lot more to cheech and chong i think than what people assume by the characters they played well the characters we grew up with the characters we grew up the stereotype stoner you know many people suggested that you know that they were detrimental to the cannabis movement because you know they they created this stereotype the stoner stereotype they they defined what the stoner is i disagree with that oh i heart will heartily disagree with that do you good because i would argue that chieftain strong did the exact opposite that they through their comedy kind of shined a spotlight on the culture of the 60s and 70s and part of that counterculture was cannabis now and as much as anything they made fun of it exactly but if you look at cannabis and the way that cannabis was perceived the use of cannabis before cheech and chong before the 60s right before the counterculture it was the reefer madness thing right our parents generation the 50s the 40s and before yeah they believed that people that used cannabis were you know mexicans black people yes and that they took it it was like heroin and it made them go crazy and rape women this is what people believed and i think they opened the eyes in some ways them and others right through their comedy and just regular dudes yeah and just to get a perspective of what they did cheech and chong the ones that you hear on the records in the movies and the stage were actually two really hard-working really intelligent comedy writers performers yeah they created these characters you know and there's not unlike what you know uh three stooges or you know the lord or something exactly you know it's a character to make fun of and laugh at right but the stoner characters that they portrayed was an artistic creation it was just something they did them that was funny and and it was a vehicle one one of many i mean he listened to their records they had all kinds of characters kinds of stuff that's right right cheech marin said in an interview that he never smoked pot while he worked ever not once not when they were on stage doing comedy not when they were making movies or records oh i believe it he wouldn't be able to this guy was really smart he went to i'm talking about cheech he went to uh cal state at northridge and he was an english literature major oh yeah and he only he dropped out eight credits short of graduating to run to vancouver canada to avoid the draft vietnam to avoid the vietnam draft and that's that's that's where he met uh tommy tommy who's the canadian right exactly not only that cheech was this cracked meal he was a member of the five sigma kappa fraternity sure why not if you ever listen to an interview he's a smart dude he went on the first uh jeopardy uh celebrity remember that celebrity oh he knocked it out he kicked the ass of no other than cnn's anderson cooper crushed him crushed him didn't just beat him and crushed him but he's a smart dude yeah um so anyways a little history the guys met the two of them met in 1968 in vancouver and marin was uh delivering carpets and he met tommy chong tommy was a musician and he was running an improv group in a strip bar that his family owned and so he talked marin into joining this and they after a while doing the the the stuff they became a stand-up duo right and they became quite popular in vancouver and they decided they've kind of done all they could do in vancouver they said let's go to la they went to la and they were discovered in clubs there by no other than lou adler now those of us who follow music know whoever is he was a huge producer he owned the roxy right he owned uh uh a couple of those clubs on the strip oh yeah couple clubs of strip he owned um dunlap dunlap dunhill records he started that record company huge record label he did he produced tapestry yeah one of the biggest selling albums of all time yeah he saw them in a club said hey let's make a record they're like a record yeah let's make a comedy record right so like in 1970 they made their first album which did really well it's just called uh chichen chong 71 and they followed up in 72 with an album called big bamboo that's right big bamboo and that began yeah well that was the biggest selling comedy album in history at the time yep and then their third album won a grammy so i had that one that's right after they had all that success with records they decided we need to make a movie right well so they put the script together they went around a bunch of a bunch of the studios in la nobody would do it nobody that that was too controversial a couple stoners it's not gonna be fun it was stupid you know um so what happened is paramount lou adler worked with paramount and they said paramount said hey what we'll let you use our studio and our facilities but we're not going to finance it so they financed themselves they were eating peanut butter and sandwiches by the time they finished that movie they spent every penny they had yep making that making up and smoke up and smoke which was huge yeah i think they spent a few hundred thousand which is nothing for me it grows like 50 million or 45 million uh so they did really well yeah so that's kind of their history and they actually split up at some point and i think they're mid 80s yeah a little bit of a falling out and they each went their own ways actually cheech had a very successful solo career in television oh yeah he was a regular on uh one of those cop shows well no cheech was on the cop show nash bridges nash bridges right tommy chong was on uh the one with tim allen what was that show uh home improvement home improvement yeah yeah that's right so they they they had a little bit of a falling out and uh and they did get back together eventually and and that they made an appearance on the late show as stephen colbert in 2018 in a response to john boehner remember boehner sure he was a republican uh speaker of the house and he left he left congress and he became he found himself on the board of a big marijuana a cannabis entrepreneur now yeah yeah so they went on to talk about that and they expressed their displeasure that uh marijuana was no longer rebellious and i i love this quote i'll finish up with this cheech said that um he could now buy weed from a store in a strip mall when we used to have to buy it from behind the store in the circle so anyway i think cheech and chong did a lot to kind of reverse the stigma and kind of make it fun yeah light-hearted make you realize that it doesn't make people who use it murderers and rapists and addicted like regular people just regular guys now you may remember this back in junior high school jay and i have known each other since then yeah that's right we had our junior high school had a very good basketball team and we would have pep rallies each start of each season and one year we had a pep rally do you remember michael alexander oh yeah tall skinny black skinny guy he did they did a version of basketball jones which was a big it was huge he he had a basketball with him and he wrote the words on the basketball in pen in case he forgot them and he played what was the character's name tyrone shoelaces that's right and i think a lot of the teachers had no idea right [Music] that was like early 70s man yeah yeah yeah 73 74 something like that here's the final final question all right let's see how let's see how your trivia is one question for you their first film as we said was up in smoke what year was that film released 76 77 78 or 79. 78 bam you're good man nailed it yep i just you know remember where i was when it came out that's great that's great all right so i'm three for three on one and the thing about tommy chong is you know when i when i wanted to learn how to do the a canadian accent or those kind of i i listened to tommy chong is that right oh yeah man you know he's got one of the best canadian accents out there you know i never even know what he's talking about but you know he's got a great one well it's funny because cheech marin does the best like hispanic southern california compton accent yeah but that's how he speaks at all but yeah well he doesn't normally speak but i guess that's how what he was brought up on but he was but the two of them man well what a great comedy team some of the best comedy ever guess that just about does it for us this week we are glad that you joined us um we hope uh you enjoyed the show and if you did tell a friend about it get some people in here we we love seeing the numbers each month and uh um you you've been great so we're really appreciative of all of you folks out there um and and again if you've got some thoughts on this on cheech and chong on uh infused beverages we'd love to hear some opinions some some ideas on that uh

clicked on this video makes you guys you're 18 and up or a cannabis patient these videos are made for an educational purpose in the cut welcome back everybody to a brand new video today I got yet again another select wax cartridge I got you guys man you guys been doing these like wax cartridges I went for the hybrid I went for the cherry pie and so a little bit about this it's a hybrid I believe it's more than a sativa science I'm pretty sure because sometimes when it's yellow it's kind of like a sativa hybrid you know so it is cherry pie and I've tried this only like once or twice just because I throw this and I I bought this and all we're having at me and some of the guys were having a sesh so we just kind of threw this some rode oh and man like this man I only have it just a little bit enough just to kind of show you guys look at that all right right there so like always everybody we got to select you guys see that right there we like it that I just like that 83% zero six eighty three point zero six percent THC and it's some cherry pie you guys know was good I'm completely sober right now so we're gonna see how many hits it takes for us to get lit so cherry pie everybody again welcome to another podcast I hope you guys are enjoying these also everybody makes you guys drop a like the comment subscribe 18 another educational purposes like always everybody make sure you guys once again actually let's take let's take the first shrimp so on there's if we got a brand new pen this pen is actually a little bit different the red is actually the lowest setting the blue is like the medium and the green is like the highest so I'm just like wait what cheers everybody see if I could get like a taste okay so it does kind of become like a bit like a little cherry like a little cherry aftertaste like a little punch like a little cherry punch hmm see the cool thing that I like about select cartridges and regarding cartridges is they don't really be adding a lot of flavor sometimes when they be adding flavor that shit's kind of like a bad chemical you know I mean I'm pretty sure it's a pretty bad chemical you know if they were to add some flavor on it might be not too harmful but I mean if you guys are damn [ __ ] you guys are heinous [ __ ] all day you know it's just definitely bad for you but these happens man these are coming these be coming and going like crazy so look at that we got the little select logo um I think there is a couple pink ones bro like that strip tap fake select I feel like nowadays man they could probably make anything bro literally anything for example like again you guys know this I already tried on fake brass not though I seen fake King pens I've seen what other fake it's mainly brass knuckle I've seen a couple fake heavy hitters and it's just like damn people are thinking like man I'm getting the jug but in reality you guys are just can that custom that home that custom made oil could be a little bit cheap who knows some plugs can potentially make some good fire stuff so who knows but let's take another first hit select does not disappoint I mean out of all of them out of all of them I feel like select is top 3 I gotta admit top 3 when it comes to like actually getting lit again select does have like a little meaning like a point 3 cartridge which is like an ax it's in high 90 percent THC and oh my god roll you take a rip of that 1 or 2 a deer man but it's not around like 40 50 bucks just for that little piece of like super concentrated THC it's crazy but a cheers OH I think now I feel like I can probably tell the difference from a lot of wax cartridges like this definitely has select I'll written all over like all of them have like different tastes if it's crazy the raw garden one you can tell right away like bro if I were to close my and I woulda hit a wrong garden and if I were to know if I were to hit a rock garden I'd be able to tell it's like you know chewing out a piece of leaf you know piece of tree piece of bush and that's the leg type I got that it's so weird I'm not I'm horrible at explaining especially explaining a taste but it has like this let me see if let me see if I can explain to you guys definitely I think select cartridge is a lot better than a Moxie but the Moxie does have a really great flavor but again you know that's what a lot of people say you know when it has a good it has like a good candy type flavor and yeah it's definitely not good for you you know because they'd be adding stuff for the flavors because in reality it's like okay if they were to press a certain tree huh you know what there's just so much to it man I there's so much learning to this to this industry you know like I just I just keep thinking about it like it doesn't make sense because sometimes when you don't taste something I'm just like okay cool it's legitly the concentration you know it's literally the oil from the flower you know it's nothing else added to it which makes it just taste like like literally just one single taste which is kind of dough same with raw garden that's what I figured you know Rob garden it always has like the same flavor that same strong flavor with like maybe a little hint of something and you can tell but it depends on the flower like the natural flower you know but sometimes we have like for example I'm not saying heavy hitters brass knuckles and all that stuff sucks or anything like that I'm still gonna cop some here and there but I'm saying like the flavor is too artificial like it's not artificial but it definitely for me I feel like they could potentially add some something to it just so I could get that flavor you know but I could be wrong you know I could be wrong that's just my thought but again everybody I'm not saying to not buy those brands you know because in reality they are you know proved as long as you guys are like like legitly getting them from like the club or the you know the dispensary and stuff you guys aren't really getting them from your local drug dealer cuz your local drug dealer listen to this you guys I talk about this in all pretty much all my wax cartridge videos because sometimes you know these guys they could probably make the wax you know the oil pretty good and you know what hey you got yourself a good cartridge homemade wax you know but at least it's like nothing crazy you know but then there's also other cartridges you know for example like in my experience what I had is like you know I poked out in a couple times and they just turned brown and I'm just like yo this does not look normal yeah it was like a thirty dollar brass knuckle you know like it was definitely fake it was not it was not the real brass knuckles of faith it was a fake brass knuckle but that's one way you guys could see and sometimes let's chop the other sensitivities 1 2 3 I think it's just good 3 oh wait a minute green as the middle one look at that that green is definitely the better wood yeah green is definitely the middle one tastes a lot more made-up fatter cloud and I do see a couple people sometimes like there was this um I had a friend that they came to visit me during my lunch yeah my old job right and they were like eh like you smug and I was just like well I mean sometimes you know not all crazy she's like they're like oh I got a I got a wax pen right I'm not gonna call them out or anything but like yeah I got a wax Maran I was like yeah that's good so they took it out right and I looked at it don't like have a halfway smoke and I was like what is this it was like some off-brand you know wax cartridge right and I was like I like bro you're selling your smug on some fake ass [ __ ] didn't it was just like so black the oil will you see this right here the oil it's like halfway through maybe like they smoked it like right here no no maybe like right there like literally get halfway and I guess what they said was that it just started turning black and I was like dude you know that's like when that's when it's fake and I was like what kind of car is it was like some designer brand not a designer brand I come it was some type of brand where I'm just like - right off the bed I'm just like yeah man you got to turn me little your local drug dealer huh you know my head I'm like why you know 1 2 3 all right let's try it off in the in the max um setting well I have your cloud the taste it's not too gay Don the highest win oh not too good this pen is to spit it's $50 pen don't get me wrong it's a nice pen but definitely not for Lake we tried a couple well we tried a couple um we tried a couple of these select cartridges already I liked select so it was literally like the first one to go to like this is the one that I wouldn't always like gay you know it's really good brand you know but right now the brand that I've kind of uh have been buying lately there's a lot of regarding rocker and is really nice rock garden is a good one but don't get me wrong rock garden and select are way different and they're both good so you know you could either go this router this round or you know cop one of each but definitely switch off you know mine I'm definitely gonna cop another Moxie cart I really like the flavor I mean it's some light resident in a wax cartridge you know and it's it's only $25 1/2 gram this one was about $35 1/2 gram I believe or 25 no no no I think this was 20 bucks I think $20 a minute there look at the thing dude half gram was like 25 I believe 25 um so it's not that bad whatsoever you know I like it it's a hybrid it doesn't have me all slump or like super awake I mean I like that super awake feeling you know the sativa that way I could be very productive but right now it's almost gonna be 9 p.m. so might as well you know just hit some in because and stuff like they're you know such it's pretty good oh one thing that a lot of people do not know and then my dumb ass just remembered especially here right here let's check this out so the directions or suggested serving a suggested serving which is one serving is three seconds so this is one serving I think I went a little overboard at three four seconds but three to four seconds is one serving and there is a hundred and twenty five servings so it's so let's see so let's start off it says right here look one three second draw and close cartridge contains 125 servings so what one three second draw is a so three times 125 so if we were to drag this it would take 375 seconds and if we were to do that and be around six or seven minutes so wait a minute so six or seven minutes of you pump that makes sense because if you're just gonna go sir like four minutes you'll smoke the whole thing hmm six eight minutes of hitting and that's why I love having baby hits - oh okay now that - that was just like a little fact that I just like read from the back a lot of people don't really know but yeah usually it's like a three to four second scene and I'm different once I'm pretty sure it's for all of them it's for the 510 thread the the pens or whatever but um um so three to four three to four seconds is one hit yeah but you have around 125 settings so if you were to take at least one serving a day that's literally a 125 1/2 gram of this but that means you have to be like super lightweight you never had any type of th in your blood whatsoever you know oh and another thing too that I'm just spacing out at this point what at this point pretty much what you want to do is I guess one of my boys put me on actually shot up oil yeah shout out chicken but pretty much when you hate when you have a pen you want to hit it right you hit it and then you have to wait I think maybe like 30 second I believe I freaking forgot but he said 30 seconds or more you have to you want to wait like 30 seconds in between that way it kind of cools down you know because if it's too hot the coils it might not burn right you know you might not get the best like the full potential of the hit you know so you want to make sure that you wait at least 30 seconds let it kind of cool down is that way so you can get like the best you know now I'm gonna try to tell everybody that because he told me that I'm just like dude I see people just rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out rip this [ __ ] blow it out past I see a little person rip it blow it out and I'm just like damn maybe that's all the wax is being over burnt and it's not even like I mean at the same time it's it's gonna get burned you know it's gonna file but if you want to have like a perfect hit that's when you have to wait at least like over 30 seconds that's what he told me you know and in my head I'm just like yeah it makes kind of sense but let me know in the comments down below what do you guys think crazy stuff man but I just said bad but man but if you say man isn't but right out it just sounds like Pampa that's crazy so there we have

hope you guys are really having a good day hopefully you guys staying blessed the world's kind of [ __ ] up right now but it'll it'll be over soon guys so everything will be back to normal so I really hope you guys are doing good and yeah guys last week got posted like two videos I usually post like on a Friday or Saturday so you know my bad had kind of been a little busy you know with all this [ __ ] going on but today actually last week I have picked up this moxie these are actually new you know I've never seen them before I had gotten one before it was super super fire you know they taste like an Ursa cartridge like actual actual like resident and I had a like a question you know if you guys ever know like don't you guys think like why is raw Gardens live resin so lighter than other live resins like like this one right here for example this was like a dark amber color compared to this one like I'll show you guys right now like live resin for the raw gardens are really really like you know which there's a lot there's some people I'm a comment section that say like regarding this fake like fake life resin so I don't know I just want to get your guy's opinion on that and that's a couple people already telling me you know but we're going to take a hit others before we get in the cartridge just waking big guys Cheers but I want to appreciate my new subscribers and those who are new here you guys are awesome for watching my videos you know I really appreciate you guys but let's get into this Moxie cartridge these are called MX brand but I had gone in there um on their Instagram page and it says they have to do something with Moxie so I'm guessing it is Moxie cuz it's like the same letterings everything this one's a yellow og this one's of life as full spectrum life resin so THC on this is 80% so it's a pretty good cartridge for some live resin there's some licenses that don't really get that high THC you know but this one's around 80 so it's pretty good cartridge I paid like maybe like 40 bucks for this so it wasn't too bad you know so we're just gonna go ahead and pop it open guys I had had one before it was like the it was like watermelon OG it was really really good you know it had tasted like an actual dab you know it tasted like really weed and it is like no discipline and intake and I like a really really different flavor than like what a raw garden would have like that clean like rock gardens to me that kind of tastes all the same you know they have all that fresh clean taste to it which is I don't know it's pretty good I'm getting wrong but they all kind of do taste the same here you have a cartridge it's a seesaw I really love these seesaw cartridges right here you know they're like the dank dank vapes how the tips are I really really love these tips now this is what I mean you know raw Gardens this one's life resin and this is my resident as well so and this one's a Moxie and this was a raw garden as you guys can see this one's way lighter than this one this one's the darker amber color so a lot of people been saying raw Gardens fake live resin so let me know what you guys think about that and that's just coming from couple people not just one you know so let me know what you guys think about that oh I thought about it as well like it is kind of lighter than what this one is and on this is real dead live resin so guys let me know on that so this one's it's really really thick yellow oh jesus was the indica hybrid I'm guessing so I'm good and dry hedges let me see what it tastes like you know flavors off it so the best way to try to just to [ __ ] hit it so we're not going to take this off I didn't do a cartridge you'd be on this raw garden I was just too lazy and I got a like on a Wednesday or something Wednesday night so I just started puffing the [ __ ] out of it so we're gonna gonna screw this on the cartridge battery hopefully I was smoking well wouldn't you guys plot you guys vape pens whatever you guys got to get [ __ ] high mass waking day just around 7:00 in the morning before I hit this let me get up Oh Red Bull sponsors we may get sugar-free Red Bull but besides that guys oh hopefully got a smoke along with me work on ahead and try this [ __ ] this one's the yellow og moxie I guess MX brand whatever you want to call it so cheers guys oh wow right off the bat if you guys ever had a if you guys ever had a Ursa cartridge these cartridges taste exactly exactly like them they taste exactly like weed you don't get like that raw garden like taste to it you know it tastes actually like dad and that's one of the things that I was wondering like why does this taste more like dab you know and like the raw gardens taste like a little chemically you know I don't get me wrong they're pretty good but I don't know that's kind of weird to me but these cartons are pretty far guys are like 40 bucks for some actual life resin I said these taste like an oyster cartridge the taste on it it's like a strong dad taste you know really really good you definitely get that OG taste like a strong cushy taste at the end but it's mostly like a clean fresh oh gee tation well it tastes really really good like when I tried these cartridges like last week it was a watermelon og cross was something and I was really amazed by the turf shamash it was crazy I little smoked the coke cartridge like in two three days you go back-to-back that's how good it was but this one it tastes kind of the same but it's just had like a more strong cush taste to it now I'm feeling like a little good high right now I know like a really good buzz you know there's my waking bag I'm gonna take a bigger hit to see if you know I [ __ ] get a big cloud for you guys I hope you guys are smoking along with me and I'm also having a vaporizer I'm going to give away I don't know if you guys had seen my review I had done on these belief goes if you guys want to go ahead and check out my video I did on

you guys ever see these MX brands Moxie cartridges like presents they're pretty fired they have a lot of flavors as well you know just as you guys can see they say Moxie on there so they say MX like I

we are bringing to you honest and unbiased cannabis training reviews so today we are going to be reviewing runs by the medicine room and high class now you guys know runs is no stranger to the channel we have reviewed it before from grow sciences but we have never reviewed the high class and the medicines version so let's go ahead and talk about if this is a new strain to you runts is an indica dominant hybrid strain that is a cross between two very popular strains skittles and gelato so i'm expecting this to be real sweet and this pack a real nice punch now this particular variety tests out at 27.70 it was harvested on 9 23 so september 23rd i am filming this on november 23rd so a perfect time uh two months from the date of harvest which i think is the perfect time to get it it says there's an expiration date of 1105 but yet i purchased this on 11 13. i got to call the ponderosa relief center where i purchased this and find out what's up with those expiration dates but um i'm really excited to try out this strain before we get into the review let me bring it up on the screen for you guys to check out then we're gonna take a look at it together okay so what did you think of the runts by high class and the medicine room i will tell you what when i first popped the top for this when i was filming the penny pinterest test before we got started i forgot what the crosses were but when i smelled this i'm like oh that is gelato and sunset sure and sure enough when i looked up the crosses because i remember skittles was in there i knew skittles was in there but i could smell the gelato and sunset shirt coming out so much in this but it's honestly amazing and it's funny because i was kind of hesitant to get this strain and even review it again because the gross sciences version that i had was really leaning on the skittle side which is not one of my favorite citrusy terp profiles but this one is leaning on the gelato side i mean honestly when i opened it i thought it was sunset shirt now let's go ahead and look at it oh my god this is just beautiful you guys the bud almost looks black to the naked eye really dense buds these thin bright orange hairs are just inner woven all and they're actually not bright to the naked eye to the naked eye they really look dark they look like a burnt orange color but man there's a lot of trichomes on this bud and this is just really beautiful looking bud now the trichomes are not those huge fat um you know globular ones and they're more on the inside of this bud as opposed to the outside i mean man it's hard to say that this isn't you know there's anything wrong with this bud now the one thing i noticed is on the bottoms of these buds like they're indicative signs of auto trimming um which i don't like i don't like like when you see the bottoms of the buds all like pressed up against the butt it looks like it went through an auto trimmer and honest to god i think this stuff might have been run through an auto trimmer just based on the look of it um god and if i think it had it not been run and i again i i really i think it has been run through an auto trimmer and that really would have messed with the trichome production and they would have you know really crushed a lot of those trichomes on the outside of this bud and otherwise i think this bud would be just a perfect 2.5 out of 2.5 and it looks alone now wow and that sunset chirp flavor just really pops in this now here's the deal let's go ahead i want to throw this jar up on the scale to see if it weighs three and a half grams and passes the penny pinterest test i filmed that right before i got started so let's go ahead get to the penny pinterest test right now and see if the ponderosa relief center is penny pinching or not okay so the time has come for the penny pinterest test let's see if the runts by the medicine room and high class weighs three and a half grams uh and let's see if ponderosa relief center weighted out properly here so let's go ahead we'll get the scale turn on here i will put a dollar bill on here just to make sure that that weighs exactly one gram perfect we'll go ahead get our cup put on there tear that out and let's go ahead and pop the top of this jar and get the contents emptied out that is a pass that is how you pass the penny ventures test 3.5 grams the exact weight that they stated on the jar that is a past 3.5 grams big ups to the ponderosa relief center you guys i have never had any problems with any of the bud that i've weighed out from the ponderosa relief center their scales are calibrated they're accurate the labels match what is in the jars that they are giving you and honest to god i might not do any more penny pictures test for them um because they just keep passing you know so like some of these brands i think nectar was another one of them that has passed every single time i've done i'm pretty sure it might have caught one time i might have i got to go back but anyways you know i don't know if it's worthwhile to do the penny bingers test every single time i might just do it sporadically with some of these companies that are really good about passing just to kind of test them and make make sure they are staying true to you guys um but i can tell you i am so excited to try this runs out i mean i told you i was a little weary about the first time that i had it um you know and i thought that was good but it just it was too much on the skittles side for me whereas this one is definitely more on the gelato side i seriously when i first opened this up i was like the [ __ ] did i buy biscotti or something like that i literally thought that's what this was it was so dark and then i saw like it looks like sunset sherb even man that is sunset sherb all the friggin way gelato gelato gelato sweet it's kind of like um damp clothes that have been sitting in the the dryer for too long a bit musky i mean it's a really really good smelling strain um now today i'm gonna be enjoying the runs from the medicine room in high class out of my arizer extreme q desktop vape i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees as you see right there i've got my silicone tube it's got two male ends on it the silicone tube is basically just getting the vape from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on it that was just cleaned out that one's gonna go inside the bowl that sits atop the vaporizer it looks just like that you guys now that sits on the heating element the other end which is open no screen that's going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler i have got distilled water in the second chamber and our organic cotton filter in the third chamber i've left the first chamber which sits right in that little bubble there that's where you can put carbon that would prevent ash from reaching the water but you guys know there is no ashkin in this vape train mucking up my water so if you guys are ready i am so excited to try out this runs by the medicine room so let's go ahead and get right into it and see what this stuff is all about okay so there are very few times that in the middle of a rip the first trip in particular i feel it coming on this is one of those times now i have a little confession to make there was a little kind of a tickle like in my throat as that was going back truthfully the citrusy flavors of this strain are coming out for sure now um it's hard to kind of put my finger on the citrus notes because it's it's kind of a mixture of the lemon and the orange it's interesting um i will say i can for sure taste the gelato that like you know a sunset sherb type flavor in there there's no question about it um and that is pretty prevalent in my mouth i mean for the first rip to have this much flavor on my mouth i'm shocked i mean if this stuff is continues to be this flavorful it's really going to be a treat to enjoy the rest of this bowl wow this stuff it's hitting it is hitting you know it's funny that second rip i think from a smoothness standpoint i think i liked a bit more than my first one wow there is a lot of flavor going on here i'm getting like a sweetness there's almost a little soapiness in there um some muskiness it's for sure um got that damp taste you know um and boy it's really starting to coat my mouth i mean that was only the second rip you guys this stuff is vaping so freaking well i can't even describe how well it's hitting on this vaporizer um i have a feeling this one's gonna be a nice uh uh it's gonna pack a nice punch too i'm really excited to finish out this bowl now while i am finishing out this bowl i want to bring this runt up on the screen again for you guys under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens you can get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this stuff so here comes the runts now okay so you are looking at the runts by sonoran roots and wow is all i can say i am just blown away by the trichomes on this bud they are obviously the star of the show today those beautiful orange hairs are on the thinner side hugging very tight and close to the buds themselves honestly i feel like the trichomes are even in better proportion than the hairs themselves this bud is definitely on the darker side it's crazy because it almost looks like black but it's that deep velvet color or violet i should say i said velvet um it's that deep violet color and it almost looks white to the naked eye this has got those dark green undertones um underneath the violet but honestly all in all the from the bud structure the butt is very nice and dense they trimmed the leaves right up to the bud this stuff is just exceptional looking wow wow i just finished having this you guys just finished looking at it wow wow wow that's all i can say i was just not expecting this i gotta be honest with you guys i just it's funny because this i have i've so many strains to review this sack just sat and sat and sat i kept doing other strains like nah nah and i'll get to that one later i'll get to that one later i'll get to that one later and then i like looked at the harvest date on i'm like okay wait a second it's exactly two months it's like it's meant to be to review this strain before it gets any older and god am i happy that i did this bud is just this is killer this is like absolutely killer killer stuff and there is so much i want to talk to you guys about when it comes to this strain so i don't want to waste any time let's just get right into this thing okay so how i do all my reviews i write all these strains out of 10 0 being the lowest 10 being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency or how effective this medicine is you guys see my eyes i mean they feel cast right now so i will assign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we will tally up the total at the end and i'll give you guys my final rundown on like what i think of the runt by the medicine room high class and my boy big john who was the head grower up there just left but i want to talk about this i'm so excited to talk about it um so let's go ahead and start by talking about the look bag appeal jar appeal um so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time for you guys to look at and then we'll go ahead and get into my final review okay so you've seen it multiple times let's talk about the looks now i have to tell you this is just goddamn it's heartbreaking for me it really is because i swear to you i think this bud looks absolutely amazing the bud structure from the color of the nugs just a deep violet undertones of of green um with the orange hairs thin orange hairs all throughout the bud you guys this bud i mean look at it there it's legit stuff i mean this is lu stuff now i swear i'm telling you i think this was run through an auto trim machine you guys just upon closer inspection and i'm so bummed i mean i'm sure you hear it in my voice it just looks like these were auto trimmed it just does the bottom of these buds looks like they're just really mad pressed up against an auto trimmer and like the fact that this bud doesn't have trichomes on the outside and i know that they they had to have been there like they had to have been there i think that it got rumbled through a machine and they got shaken off um oh man this could have been a 2.5 out of 2.5 the looks it's going to be a 2.0 out of 2.0 uh or 2.0 out of 2.5 sorry 2.0 on a 2.0 would be perfect it's a 2.0 out of 2.5 of the looks um this stuff looks great um but i i really i think it was run through an auto trimmer and i think it it tarnished the quality of this bud i'm just my my my spidey senses is going off and when it goes off i learn to trust it so um let's get to the smell now normally go to my sunset sherb uh reviews in gelato reviews like i always say like you know i don't think that this strain is for everybody i don't know it's hard for me to give this a perfect rating it's a perfect rating this has a dynamic enough smell and it's loud enough like and it's like sweet and there's like that skittles is in there hiding underneath i honestly think this stuff just smells awesome i want to smell it all day i think most people would just find it super interesting super dynamic and even now i'm stuffed up now but i can still smell it you know and that to me like this it's between a 2 and a 2.5 if why you want me to be honest with you guys but this is the best representation of gelato maybe i've ever smelled um and it's not gelato of skittles uh you know but of of that cut in a strain you know it's coming and shining through so much that i i really i think that their runs this runs it smells so good it's a 2.5 out of 2.5 in the smell um in the taste category you know it tastes good um but i don't think it tasted great if you want my honest opinion i think the flavor for me died a little bit prematurely that first rip was a little bit rough and a little bit too citrusy for me uh and for my liking um it really did go to that sunset cherby gelato flavor for the remainder of the bowl mostly but it went it was like the flavor did just kind of die a little prematurely um and went to the more faint you know um uh fl you know burnt flour taste so the taste is gonna get a 2.0 out of 2.5 for me now let's get to the potency truthfully i think this is just quality medicine and i've got to go based off of like how i'm kind of feeling overall like this is hitting me like an indica like it's honestly hitting me more like an indica um i'm like my mind is chilled out my body is chilled out i feel good i feel happy i feel uplifted i feel like i'm just joyful and you know i'll tell you that like i'm really just enjoying this and you know it got me where i wanted to be truthfully and i i'm not gonna say that i think this is the most potent medicine i've ever had by any means like i'm not gonna go out and say that at all i think the potency and again i think the potency is between a 2.5 a 2.0 and a 2.5 now in this category usually i save that 2.5 for those ones that are really just bangers but in this category just based on how i'm feeling and like how good i actually feel this is that very like again not the pressure on your head but like the heaviness behind the eyes and um you know just strong effects i guess is what i would say um both body and mind very euphoric and um i'm loving it cerebral this stuff is great um and i feel good i feel medicated and you know for that i'm giving them a 2.5 out of 2.5 this is one of the better strains that i've reviewed on the channel in all honesty like i'm really impressed with this bud um so for me yeah it's gonna be this is freaking crazy it's gonna be a 2.0 in the looks it's going to be a 2.5 in the smell a 2.0 in the taste and the 2.5 of the potency and honestly that meat tool is a 9.0 it's going to get a dank thumbs up approval here on our channel for this runs by high class in the medicine room big john thank you for the hard work you did up there man you really you really uh came in and just crushed it up there i'm real proud of you buddy and uh thank you for the awesome meds man um you know it's funny because i really i do think this strain is between an 8.5 and a 9. um but i think there's enough areas like the looks it almost could have been you know a 2.5 the taste you know a couple little areas it could have gotten to the 2.5 if if it was improved you know if uh you know it lasted longer but again i have no problem giving this a 9.0 and would i go get this again i would get this bud again and i would just urge the medicine room um you guys stop using those auto trim machines and i know you have one up there because i have toured your facility before so you know the auto trim is not cool you're really taken away from the patients at the end of the day to get that you know keef and sift and i just uh i think it's diminishing the quality of your butt i mean this bud honestly might have been a perfect 10 on a perfect 10. um but a 9.0 on an out of 10 ain't bad and you know again i'm i would i go pick it up again yes i would i would go pick this up again even even with the auto trim truthfully i think this medicine is just bomb um so yeah if you're looking for something like a gelato with a little sweetness there's some gassiness some muskiness there for sure indica dominant strain this one's going to crush you anybody if you have a high potency or excuse me a high tolerancy a high tolerance this has a high potency so it will definitely be effective medicine see i'm even fumbling and jumbling my words here you guys uh that's what the runts will do to you so i'll tell you what thanks again uh to the medicine room high class ponderosa relief center uh big john and thanks to all of you guys for watching today and let me know what do you guys think of this stuff if you picked it up let me know in the comments below is a 9.0 spot on or am i absolutely out of my mind and then let me know what you guys want to see me review and until the next one you guys take care of yourself and one another and i will see you guys soon [Music] peace", "WTfuKDWp6Vk": "hey bud d9403 channel is an 18 and over channel for adults interested in watching how i am battling chronic pain i am a registered cardholder so everything you see here is legal for me now let's get medicated if under 18 please get the hell out of here now there i'm supposed to do that for every show now as you can see right here medical marijuana from columbia care uh disposable vape it is theraseed high tc uh four milligrams thc low cbd point two milligrams per three second inhalation it's a 25 mils and possibly 50 doses what i've been doing is keeping track of i've had this for a while now i've been keeping track of how many hits puffs i take off it and i think i'm around 40 right now so it's gotta be pretty accurate but i've liked this so far nice little thing comes in this child proof thing like can you i ain't gonna show the kids how to do it oh no kids are watching that's right take the lid off go like this there's no bonza push there's nothing like that the only recommendations i got for you is uh store it this way because if you store it like this your oil is gonna be you know flat on the bottom not all the way around you want it all the way around but it's as simple as the battery's already in it you ain't gonna do nothing it comes fully ready to go you can see the holes right there here we go pretty good for just a little quick inhale i wouldn't go much more than that you'll be coughing unless you get better lungs to me i am elderly all right cheers everybody let's go take another puff that was pretty good i have no idea what the strain is or anything like that i'm sure it's or they're normal stuff they have just checking to make sure it doesn't say anything but nope all right let's do a known these things are nice like i said i mean i've been testing it out it is getting low on oil you can see it's less than essay a little on this side that's because it's probably stored like this a little bit but it is what it is the other option i got yeah let's do another i do like those they are nice put them right back in here it's all labeled with my what i got to show everybody and everything else when i get in trouble or whatever you want to call it but i do have my credentials covered up there well that's that then we go on to medical marijuana from columbia care premium reserve concentrated cannabis oil let's see high thc low cbd four milligrams thc zero milligrams of cbd per five milligram dose of extract 200 doses per syringe here's the fancy syringe for you to look at as you can see it's about empty right now because i already filled my uh pot up and uh this is like a one mil i believe and this has got like 1.2 million or something like that so you you pretty much can fill one of these pods up of the smoke novo vaporizers i do like these but i'm starting to wonder if it's not powerful enough to push this thick oil let's see what happens and this is the automatic too i didn't buy this from the dispenser this is bond online all anywhere let me put it in there better i don't think we're getting anything out of it let me do a quick clean here and see what happens it was working just the other day now we got a blanket sometimes why the battery's dead with this i've been trying this a few times over the last week i guess maybe we can have and i'll puff on it like three times and i don't get much out of it i don't know if because the oil is too thick and doesn't heat it enough or what the deal is but i get more off the disposable one but i'm gonna keep trying it smoke noble vaporizer a little harsher than a disposable vape but i guess it works but like i said i haven't really been getting that medicated on it but does coming up fancy little you know nothing to it they just throw this in there that way it's all in the original packaging less trouble and then it comes in this box which is i can't really show the front because my credentials are there but you see it's from columbia care and [ __ ] it's just nice to get new products all the time in i'm trying them out i'll put the ones online that i like a lot but um i'll probably do a separate review for this this is another thing i got is a sativa blend it says for vaporizers only but let me know that goes i'll put it in my [ __ ] bong and do it i don't care but anyway it's 3.5 grams and they claim 140 doses 25 milligrams a dose let's see 2 milligrams of thc 3 milligrams of cbd per dose premium reserve cannabis ground flour medical marijuana let's see i gotta cover my information over this side sativa it's supposed to make more uplifting instead of indica which is in the college meaning oh man i just want to watch a movie and go to bed now this stuff is more uplifting so far i like it i mean i like ground flowers to begin with i mean i like it it's okay like i said if i want to be really medicated i'll get the indica which is coming up probably the next time i order from the dispensary but i hope you all are doing well out there i'm doing fine i just been trying out this new medicine for everybody so everybody knows what to expect when they go to buy it but i should put this in another vaporizer to try but i really don't wanna because it's already in there i saw a white out for a minute that's okay and i'm sure i still got the adapter from the hemper box where i could put this in my bun i'm not doing that today not sure if it really fit in or not right off hand i can't remember for sure but either way this ain't too bad i mean to me this would be something if i want to get medicated in the morning but not too high where i can't go do stuff and this to me is a little stronger possibly i'm not sure but like i said i'm gonna probably dab some of this [ __ ] i'm gonna take it out of this vaporizer i think here sometime and tried dabbing it for y'all i did it i did it when i first got this i don't know maybe a week ago and it worked great i was totally sober when i did it and i was great afterwards i was very medicated had quite a head high but man i was medicated i really didn't have any more pain or anything it just kind of felt better yeah i wrote cc in here so i know it's columbia curry that way i'm not because i got known just like this too and it's cbd so i mean cds does help my pain but this makes me forget about my pain and helps with the pain all right everybody i think i rambled enough for you i will try doing another video but you know how it is i say stuff and then don't do it um all right everybody

subscribers and I really like that feedback also give me a big thumbs up if you like what you see alright let's get into today's review today we're going to review the saber vape wax pen now I had the people at new york vape shop calm send this out to me for a review very thankful for them for doing so and in response to that they've also given me a discount code the dabber all in caps and you get 15% off of your purchases if you go to new york vape shop calm so let's get into this review it's the saber vape wax pen this thing runs $79.99 and ships very discreetly and promptly - i ordered and got it to my doorstep in about three or four days after you open up that shipping package you will see a very nice slim a box with the Sabre branding on it this is a little kit so it's not just the pen you get more than that I'll tell you what you get in that box you get the Sabre vape pen battery you also get two atomizers a glass mouthpiece a dabbing tool and then you also get a charging unit for this thing alright what's really cool is they're all magnetic components don't have to worry about gunking up the threading if you have any spillover or any kind of bubble up for your waxes that you put in here so it's a really really nice feature let me go into some of these features for you right now let's start with the mouthpiece this is a glass stem on the mouthpiece right so that also comes off and it detaches from the other component that is magnetic so you can clean it out a little bit more easily the glass makes it really easy to clean and maintains that really really nice flavor for whatever wax dabs shatter crumble whatever you're putting in this vape pen it's very nice it also has a screen so if there's any bubble up or any kind of splatter that restricts that from going up into this gleb this glass mouthpiece and getting in your mouth okay that's the glass mouthpiece now let's get to the atomizers the first one is a dual quartz core coil setup all right I really like this it heats up really well gives you some pretty decent flavor it also gives you a really nice temperature and maintains that really well it stays clean too which is really nice sometimes you get these coil setups and it Gunks up really quickly I didn't find this even after using this vape pen heavy for a couple weeks the other thing that I liked about this is it is magnetic so this component of an atomizer magnetically attaches to the battery which makes it really nice to change between this and the second one which is a ceramic doughnut atomizer this is actually a ceramic disc that is sitting on top of a heating element so most of your wax crumble DAB shatters so forth is going to sit on top of this ceramic doughnut and get heated up I do suggest that you run a cycle through first so that ceramic disc gets a little bit warmer and then you start inhaling your vapor the thing that I also like about both of these there's a roughened inside of the chamber for these atomizer so if you have trouble getting your dab off onto the sidewalls this makes it easy because that rough texture allows that dab to stick a little bit easier all right now let's get on to the battery this is a really nice battery charge as well has a nice logo on the bottom that lights up it's a five click on five click off for the main unit and then there's also three temperature ranges so you click three times to cycle through either blue green or red which is mild medium or hot temperatures now what I really like about this is there's an auto heat feature once you find the temperature you really like you just double click and then you don't have to hold down the button while you're actually vaping now it may seem very trivial but it is really nice because it keeps a consistent Heat going and then it auto shuts off so you don't have to worry about it you just puff away and it turns off by itself but it also holds that temperature that you desire I used both of these atomizers on all the settings I really like the higher setting more than the rest of them however the ceramic doughnut does tend to produce a less of a vapor and less of a volume and density of vapor although it does hold on to that really nice flavor for whatever kind of material you're putting in there I will say that also the other atomizer that dual quartz core atomizer that also produces just a great flavor but also more volume and a higher density of vapor with this okay charging this is very easy you can look at a previous video that I've put together but you just pull off the components very gently and then plug in the adapter to your charging unit and then put the battery magnetically onto the charging unit it's very easy and then to connect it you just do it in Reverse I found that from a dead battery to full charge took me about two hours and it lasted several days I got to give this a 5 out of 5 on my dabber scale this is the saber vape wax pan and those people from new york vape shop comm sent this out to me if you would like to get a 15% discount on any of your purchases they're just used the dabber and all caps and they'll give you that 15% off all right guys I really really enjoy this pan it works well and I hope you pick this up along with a slew of other items that you might be able to find at that online store all right there is so much more in queue live resins CBD aerosol type inhalers and gummies and other edibles so a lot coming down the pike and man I hope you come back to visit me so stay tuned I'll see you soon", "X02JHdTdoPE": "all right hey guys what's up uh I'm gonna start this video off with a rant I'm honestly kind of done with kingpin at this point I'm getting endless hate for hit and I talk about fake hearts because apparently my kingpins then were fake and recently I just bought more fake kingpins honestly the ones I got before they were the best quality like vapes I've ever had they like they tasted amazing the reason I didn't finish the wax and those ones was because I literally couldn't I hid them until they wouldn't produce any more vapor so like that's just a bit of wax that's stuck in between the metal and the glass and the atomizer this time though and you'll see it in the video that I edited originally I was gonna do a video on like how to fix when you get like fake kingpins how to like transfer the distillate from one atomizer to another because I thought it would hit smoother and taste better but the thing is even after doing that and trying to give these fake kingpins a chance if you can see it I don't know if it's gonna show really well but uh the wax or the dissolute term Brown it started to taste terrible in this and now I can't even hit it without like hacking up a lung it made me green yesterday which was like a bad sign from the start because like I don't green out when I smoke unless it's like really shitty carts so like that sucked and I'm just gonna show y'all how it like hits so you can see like why I'm saying stay away from it from my own personal experience this shit's kind of this shit's not kind of dangerous this [ __ ] is dangerous I would just not buy kingpins if you're on like looking at black market dealers like just don't do it this shit's dangerous for you it's not healthy and the high isn't even good all it does is give you a headache and if you smoke too much you'll get sick so like [ __ ] fake kingpins [ __ ] this fake wax and yeah go into the video if you're like if you don't care about this ranch at all and if you still want to try these fake kingpins but like I'm telling y'all it's really not worth it it's a waste of money and if you have Danks or like even exotics they could be much better than this fake [ __ ] that I got at least so I'll show y'all how it hits and then we can go to the video but my message to y'all is just [ __ ] stay away from fake kingpin carts they're [ __ ] so yeah [ __ ] tastes terrible it tastes so disgusting if I took a longer rib I probably would hack tup a lot but like I've been smoking for the past hour not on this I'm like an actual decent card so yeah so lucky what we have here what we see in front of us today are two King pens a Skywalker og and a King Louie og you see I bought these because I wanted to do a review on them and show y'all why King pen has such a good reputation while it's great but look at the [ __ ] that I got the [ __ ] is this what the hell is in my cartridge is it meth is it meth cuz like I better not have a meth part I'm very upset cuz like y'all are on the internet you see that King pen has a great reputation but this is some [ __ ] this might be a fake it probably is a fake but it's a bad fake a terrible thing and usually your boy would be like oh well I guess this is an L I guess these parts are ruined let's say movies better open it still looking like someone dropped a [ __ ] glitter bomb in my cart I don't understand how this is passable this is some [ __ ] [ __ ] like for real so uh I'm not gonna take this sitting down i'ma show y'all what to do when you buy cars than the end of being [ __ ] [ __ ] like this all right okay so you may be asking why is he so angry about a fake kingpin card well not only am i angry because this [ __ ] is so crystallized and it looks like someone pushed it out of their urethra it's like you it doesn't hit watch [Music] okay that sort of looked like a good hit but hold up I promise you these suck [Music] okay see it's showing some clouds but y'all are gonna have to trust me on this it tastes burnt and it tastes like chemicals and it hurts my throat plus the pull is terrible from this 710 cartridge which is why my plan is to transfer it to a C sub cartridge also it's hot as [ __ ] in this room so it's probably making me angry but like I'm still really upset about these stupid kingpin cards so just to show you all real quick that I'm not like just bullshitting and complaining for no reason I'm gonna show you how it hits out up a tab cap just so you can see like it barely hits at all and it's still gonna taste terrible [Music] it tastes like [ __ ] I [ __ ] hate these 7/10 cartridges like I feel like even if the wax is fine after the crystallization which I don't even know if you can fix like it still just tastes bad so I'm still gonna put these in a CSL cartridge and then bake them through those so like let me show you all what to do or how to do that what you have to do is you have to steal your girlfriend or your sisters hair dryer and you just gotta try it on low and hit the cart with some heat so that the wax loosens up and becomes like a bit thinner so let's do that real quick all time laughs how long it'll take okay so this car is hot as hell but now that it's super hot and it's not super hot but it's hot enough that the liquid is a more loose and workable all you got to do is I like to keep a container under it you got to pour it in now let me see if I can get that egg you got to pour it in to a seesaw cartridge it is not showing and now my cats getting into the frame oh my god prints get out of the frame pants get out the frame anyway as you can sort of see I'm not trying to waste any of this wax otherwise I try to show you better but all you gotta do is heat up the wax and then pour it in to another cartridge that you would have if you smoked carts regularly or you can go ahead and buy a CSL cartridge offline I'll set I'll put a link in the description for y'all if you're trying to do this but like it's so easy to just transfer your wax this way look at that it's already like filling up the new cart and if I heat it so more I can probably get the wet the rest of the wax out of the 710 cartridge but I think what I'm gonna do is try to save a little bit so that I can show you just the difference and why I'm telling y'all to [ __ ] throw away these stupid 7/10 cartridges and just switch to see cells Oh try and get this little less drop of wax into this a new cartridge so I can just like Hey more of this waxed better you know what screw it it's not gonna come out I'm just gonna go ahead and let it drip back into this 710 cartridge but look all of that wax transferred to this brand-new seesaw cartridge in under a minute like that is so easy and you'll see how much of a difference it really makes in a second so I'll be right back so just you know can see that I'm not just like off my [ __ ] right now i'ma show you how like a Skywalker King pen hits versus like the same exact wax in a seesaw cartridge all right here's it from a seven-time kingpin cartridge [Music] I mean it clouds but like I said before it tastes bad and it's definitely not as good as through this C cell 510 cartridge I'm not even sponsored by C cell I'm just a consumer that really prefers how C cell does their business with their from their batteries all the way to their cartridges or at least their atomizers like see some is just really good that was off a small drop let's do a long one it's gonna kill me but for the point you'll see that we now have two new and improved kingpin carts and would tip the seesaw atomizers I think that would tip C cells are just better than the kingpin seven tens because the seven tens on these fake kingpins came from China so when you hit the wax it kind of turns it black and you can taste that it tastes chemically or like Burt so just switching them to any other cart that you have that would early any other atomizer you have that would be better than leaving them in the seven tonnes so yeah if you found this video helpful just leave a like um it's sort of a mess so I also understand if y'all like hate in the comments I'm ready for that bring it on my [ __ ] anything um yeah I hope you enjoyed the video I'll catch y'all in another one I'll see you later peace", "HQc9FXLOkiM": "what is up YouTube family boy baths is here I'm gonna be doing another cartridge of you today for you guys now today I had 10 ran into some new cartridges so nothing for like a little that like a catalogue that had gaming at the dispensary so about these new cartridges just explaining about like you know the new flavors that they had and like what they were about and [ __ ] picked up with this I was gonna get like a rock garden or like maybe like a plug and play some but I just didn't want to have the same [ __ ] you know I like trying new things you know it's not bad to try anything so you know that way you guys can like see what's good and what's not you know but these cartridges really grabs my attention there's a church Church cartridges I had never had it before the thing that really caught my attention was they have like this adjustable airflow you know which is pretty pretty dope you know I've never seen adjustable airflow on these cartridges I only seen them on like got 2020 vapor now if you guys had seen those where you could like that just like on the bottom yeah you can they're pretty dope you know you can hit them hard in it would be really smooth it which is pretty cool you know and there were like 40 bucks no $40 a car which is you know they they're pretty neon the marquee I've never seen them before and on the bots on the back that says their Instagram and whatever so it says super premium cannabis distillate you know so it's um it must be some pretty hard dis Allah you know it's a sour it's [ __ ] a super premium distillate you know it's pretty far cartridge guys for the price you guys can't complain so let me know how you guys been let me know how my new subscribers been I've been pretty good as well let me know how life's been treating you guys I really appreciate you guys watching my youtube video you know my videos as [ __ ] you guys are [ __ ] awesome for that you know for taking the time out yesterday and watching my videos I really appreciate that and [ __ ] trying to fix the camera a little bit but you guys are awesome for that and you guys just keep it up you know like an income that on my vetoes and you guys are my snapshot you know you guys always cool you know really appreciate you guys adding my snapchat and [ __ ] but yeah guys let's get straight into this cartridge this cartridge like 40 like $40 you know so also about the barrier that goes along with it Hey look is this for the thumb now so it's Asif so here we have the battery so we're just gonna go in the shimmery drop in the cartridge and ship but but yeah guys it's Sunday afternoon tell him not he has been um it's gonna gotten a little tab on it so it has a little sticker on the bottom so the THC on this is 81% it's a strawberry cough so it's gonna be good guys that I mean we finally we so we finally got the [ __ ] cartridge open after a while struggling you know they gotta like I might work on the [ __ ] cases or something but here we have the church or I don't know if it's just me but I have trouble helping this [ __ ] ship but yeah guys so the thing that really caught my attention was a the design of the cartridge and it kind of looks like a heavy hitter but it's like a really really different different company so we're gonna open it it's a nice really faculty and also really caught my attention so as you guys can see it's also so the coil itself compare this the size of the cartridge this is really really big guys compared to like you know that it's really really a big cartridge and like no joke guys right when I pulled out the cartridge you can smell the the terpene something smells really really fruity and the really thing that's really cool about these cartridges that not a lot of cars you just have to have this adjustable airflow so you guys can take big big clouds or you know you guys can get it really really smooth hit so so there's the cartridge itself right do the bullet test and this thing does not have a bubble in it this thing is like literally filled to the [ __ ] top so it has a really really thick oil in it big coil I mean so this thing should have some good airflow in it and I have this battery along to there you know it's the same battery for the cartridge so I had a copy you know had to it's a adjustable 900 battery the ma battery so it's it gots to be a good Betty so we're gonna pop it open just like that this battery was like twenty dollars so and also you know it's a surge protected so I don't know what I think it sounds like if it blows up on you or some [ __ ] but the max on this is like a four point one voltage so we don't we don't need that much so we're just gonna use the lowest setting on this it's pretty dope these guys packaging is pretty DUP you know everything comes the nice hard plastic packaging so it's pretty dope so it's a battery I really needed a new battery I mean that yoke and it works pretty good but to be honest with you guys I don't know if you guys are the same way but do you guys get tired of using the same [ __ ] battery for this cartridges like this time we're like I'm like [ __ ] I want any battery but I mean even though I don't need one I still want one so I don't know if things just mean I like using these stuffs all the time but here's pretty ears battery and here's the charger simple plug and play for the thing you know it says search on the over and here's the battery it's a nice thick like a brass knuckles really really thick so this battery right here should [ __ ] last you guys for a while the quality on it feels really good it's nice and heavy it has this little rubber tips on there we're gonna take that out and has a California warning sticker logo whatever so you guys know you guys smoking a good cartridge so the the quality on this is really really amazing I had this Cadillac that explained everything about it the oil and it looks really really thick it doesn't move at all and I'm recording uh as yes can see it has this little adjustable air flow net where you guys twisted so that's really really dope you know I had a cartridge before they had that it's the 2020 vapes the feature is something like that and they were [ __ ] fire so imma go ahead and try hit this and I'm gonna go and let you guys know what it tastes like oh wow I'm not gonna [ __ ] what you got your nama straight up guy up on sugar Coast [ __ ] you know if something's bad I'm saying it's bad you know but the tip the terpene profile this is [ __ ] amazing you know the flavor on this it's a strawberry coffee and it tastes like really really fruity you know that's really crazy I don't really think there was gonna taste that good but it tastes so fruity so you know we got this nice big thick battery the same same church on it and like the logo as I said as a cartridge as well so we're not going to see if it's charged hopefully it's charged man I don't know pause the video and alright so turns on so it's on yellow and I'm see that's on the middle one alright so we're gonna put on the 3.2 volt which is the blue light it's already going to screw the cartridge on it sure looks [ __ ] dope guys I'm not gonna lie to you it's really the quality on the quality on the battery and all the cartridges it's amazing just the way it feels in your hand it feels like if you're holding like like a nice gadget you know what I mean so it's pretty dumb guys so we're gonna close up as you guys see these these are really neat to the cartridges so we're gonna quote go ahead and close this little this airway we have here see you ask him alright guys my bad so how to delete some footage up my phone and you know get the video start again because I ran out of footage of storage so we have the cartridge here we're going to just take the sticker off you know just to get that [ __ ] out the way so we're gonna go ahead and hit this and if you got a smoke let me go ahead and do so I'm gonna get back to real quick I'm gonna be heading to follow me on snapchat go ahead and follow me you know yeah that's where I keep up posting updates you know about my lifestyle [ __ ] cheers guys we got this church here so we're gonna go and see this is really good I had to close this airflow so I'm gonna compare it whether it's open and closed I'm gonna tell you guys the difference so Cheers Wow you get this nice really really fruity strawberry taste you know that's [ __ ] awesome it's like and you get some actual terpenes in there I don't really taste like distantly to be honest it tastes like some really top-notch distally really really fruity guys so I'm going um you didn't really get a big cloud as you guys see I don't really get a big cloud with a little airflow closer so I'm going to twist it I'm gonna go ahead and open it and I'm gonna see if I can get a bigger cloud with that as you guys see I took a blinker really really thick oil you know you don't really get big clouds so we're gonna ahead and bump the [ __ ] voltage level on this siren garden one two three ICS conceived so I got in close the thing again and we're gonna hit it cheers guys smoke along with me take a blinker now you really do get this little bigger cloud yeah that's what you needed to do is pull up the voltage on that so you really get the same flavor but it tastes a lot way way better you get this nice fruity Strawberry Cough taste it tastes amazing for the price the cartridge was like thirty six dollars guys now you guys can't beat that to be honest it kind of reminds me of a what's a call you know it's kind of hard to burn so we're gonna go ahead and I'm going to open this airflow let me see what's the difference with the higher voltage oh wow tastes pretty good but to be honest you get a big you get a bigger hit whenever the thing is closed I don't know that's just up to me and it tastes a lot better but I think it's just a preference just depends on anybody but we're gonna flip the thing go over it just to make sure you know there's no [ __ ] bubble in there it's really really really really thick guys all honest it's like amazing if you guys haven't had these Trish partridges I guess you really check them out I would really ricky'll recommend them to for the flavor you guys really get a great great profile terpene profile so I'm gonna hit this again to see if get it cut for you guys I don't know if the batter needs to be charged or some book oh yeah you definitely get bigger clouds whenever the dings closed so yeah guys I'm the hive I really feel great you know I'm really like ready to talk [ __ ] some other [ __ ] you know I mean I'm usually quiet I'm the quiet guy but I guess a now it makes you kind of feel like you know you want to talk a little bit more you know makes you talkative and she like that cuz I'm really like the quiet guy you know you don't really hear me around like I've run a group I'm like the one that Lena talks less but whenever I smokes the teal of products and [ __ ] sativa strains it like makes you want to like I don't know just conversate more you know it makes you want to be out there a little bit more and that's where the kind of mission field right now you don't mix me [ __ ] there didn't know god makes me want to you know hope conversations should but I'm gonna rip this again for you guys and hope you guys are smoking log with me I'm gonna turn the voltage up to the highest setting which is on the red so cheers guys took a blinker and the taste still the same you know this oil is really different than what other distillate is get the nice big cloud guys so if you guys ever see these Church cartridges get the battery as well cuz that [ __ ] oil stick as [ __ ] you know you guys need something good about it to burn them on the [ __ ] book I really appreciate you guys watching my videos and you guys stay tuned for more guys", "ys-itXlit6s": "[Music] hello everyone and welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you guys make sense of your dispensary it is a cartridge root of you today my friends and one that you guys have been requesting very often probably one of the most requested reviews I've had so far and that is king pen we're gonna be reviewing king pen today this is not their standard batteries I think they have standard 510 threaded batteries this is one of their 0.3 gram disposable baits which I have actually been reviewing quite a few of these recently uh this is the third one I'll be in reviewing and I really like this a disposable joint format I find it pretty handy pretty useful don't have to really worry about anything it's just a quick and easy little way to get yourself medicated so I'm really excited about this king pen this is the king louie OG and I picked this up in my dispensary for about 25 bucks here in Long Beach so not too bad for a point three milligram cart this according to the lab test results has eighty one point four 1% THC it's a pretty high percentage but not the most high percentage of THC I've seen in a cartridge not even by a longshot and again this is the disposable variety of the king pen and at the top you can see that they have ordained that themselves or they told me that they have been ordained the world's most awarded cannabis vape Lala so we will have to find out why with their King Louie og here so let's see if we can get this open I'll try not to tilt the camera as much as possible okay so what do we have I actually like the packaging quite a bit it's a nice design I like the little king guy there the playing card guy and then the actual cartridge let's see oh this looks a little different than some of the ones we've reviewed in the past ah okay there's just a plastic wrapper in here as well we'll move this aside as we do not need it we will open up our little plastic roll and here we go don't worry guys not littering I'll grab those so here is our King pen does not look like a lot of oil there it definitely looks like point three grams this is a different looking disposable card I've seen it's a lot squatter than the other ones the other ones have been taller so I'm guessing we're gonna take this off here at the top maybe oh no no we're just gonna draw well I think I just inhale [Music] little LED indicator light at the bottom [Music] ignore the coughing that's me not the cartridge but that is a nice taste it definitely tastes like King Louie very terpene e tastes very natural tastes like it tastes quite a bit very easy to draw from I like this format I don't like to tip too much it is plastic so it heats up a little bit but that's okay I actually like the base here quite a bit it's a rubbery and grippy so it's easy to hold on to doesn't slip around as much [Music] and those are pretty big hits for for quick little drawers yeah great taste and this is a pretty potent one let's do another big hit here [Music] [Music] it was about a one-second draw and a pretty decent-sized little exhale exhalation at that I am quite happy with this one this is another win for the disposable abate format here I am very happy to smoke on this and it is pretty potent I would say I'm at a battle for after a couple of pups there so on the higher end of some of these cartridges and again the taste is incredible in this little pocket size format thing is just very nice and convenient so early impressions are very positive for King pen gonna have to do is like all of our cartridge reviews I'm gonna finish this whole thing do the entire product and then I'm gonna come back to you guys after I've demolished this point three grams to let you know exactly how I'm feeling make sure this battery lasted the entire time make sure it's not leak if it tasted and get too harsh all that good stuff so guys just stay tuned and I will be back to you guys in just a bit peace thanks for watching guys it has been Oh been a whole day since I checked in with you our first checked with in with you talking King pen and I think I erroneously called it platinum Bubba before but it is King Louie og the double King King pen King Louie got me all tongue-tied and tongue-twisted there so it is King Louie og and there's a lot to like about it so let's go over the good things first really enjoyed the taste really enjoyed the delivery method again I really like this disposable joint method had sex for the environment I am sure to have all these extra batteries out there but it is undeniably more just more convenient for sure um I liked how potent it was it felt every bit as potent as the 81.4 1% per sentence it says it does and the price was pretty good for what it claimed because again this was only a point three milligram disposable and that is my one little niggle oh that's a clumsy word isn't it so my one complaint is that boy that point three grams did not feel like point three grams as I first said I'm always coming back to you guys at about 20 hours at this point which is not that long and I wasn't hitting that that particularly hard wasn't really drawing on it that much so I'm not sure it didn't feel like point three grams to me again I did not measure it before time or afterwards I don't have a scale that accurate so if it was I apologize but it certainly felt like I blew through this so you might want to keep that in mind when it comes to picking up King pen in the future and that guys is gonna do it for our first king pen review I'm not sure I would give them the world's most awarded cannabis vape myself I think it's more of a world's most okay disposable they pen that I found at this one dispensary that is my little box quote for them and that guys is really gonna do it for this review but before I totally totally 100% bounce here let's do a little cherry on top a little something that you guys can take with you stick it in your pocket and enjoy it for the rest of the week that isn't necessarily weed related where you don't even have to have weed to enjoy it and that guy's is the Netflix original series oh my god I hope I haven't done this I might have already done it and if I have I am sorry but that is the remake of the hill on haunted house haunting on Hill House whatever they may be that one is and now I'm pretty sure I have done this one before regardless great great show ten episodes one-shot miniseries about a family that had a traumatic event happened when they were all very young and taking a look at them sort of 30 years later after this after the fact and the both literal and metaphorical hauntings that trauma can bring for it cool stuff really fun um so guys that's gonna do it with a cherry on top again that is haunting on Hill House god damn I can't really remember it and that's probably the second time I've endorsed it and that guy's is gonna do for this cherry on top and that's gonna do it for this review I appreciate you watching thank you so much and we will see you guys on our next review deuces", "WVnhfdr6j_o": "okay everybody this is a instructional video I recently had a problem my cartridge it wasn't burning my hollow I couldn't figure out why and I went online for an instructional video and found all these things about the plate nothing fixed it so I just there's this section right here where the smoke comes up the back of it I'll show you what to do you just take top off grab like a zip tie they're flat they're long and skinny there's a groove right there if you take you see it's going inside you push this all the way down sometimes the oil likes it get clogged up in the side of right here in the cylinder so you just start poking around in it turn on your pin and I've already done mine so I don't need to you just jam it around there a little bit it will get clogged up and you it's perfectly safe and you turn it on while you're poking it and it will start to clear up the clogged oil that'll fix your issue for you and get you burning and smoking again alright that's my video thanks bye", "r0an08pfcCY": "hey what's good everybody j ping here checking in respectmyregion.com here today to do a quick taste test review featuring the live resin cannabis oil from potter's cannabis here in california i'm excited to check this out because i actually haven't tried potter's cannabis in over a year it hasn't been since one of the first few hall of flowers events that i've tried their stuff this is labeled as a high potency live resin cannabis oil and then on the back it describes it as all natural whole plant extraction the way nature intended excuse me a tribe called potter's from the farm to your fingertips for the connoisseurs and the raccoon tours we wander the world on a soulful quest towards self exploration and elevation we connect material with spiritual and we believe in healthful healing we leave things better than we found them and we don't take shortcuts the journey is our destination join us and live higher all right so they definitely put some money into the branding that's for sure ingredients this is cool single source live resin extract terpenes derived 100 from cannabis high potency cannabis oil they are covering the bases y'all uh in terms of total cannabinoids 84.78 total cannabinoids we're looking at 80.25 percent chc 0.16 percent on the cbd 0.29 percent on the cbn 1.5 percent of the cbg a and then 1.08 on the cbg total terpenes also listed so the cvgs are listed and the total terpenes are listed four point five nine percent total terps terpenoline is at one point eight six mercene point five nine limonene point four nine so potter's is invested heavily into the terpene information the t the cbg information they've got this crazy poem basically on the back shout out to all those things now the one thing that does sketch me out a little bit is that the original sticker that's on this has different information listed on it there is a different sticker repackaged over it definitely leaves me a little to be conserved so other than that i am quite excited jungle spice is the strain you guys we've got a vessel vape battery over here big shout out to vessel uh how do we get this open ah all right here we go see if we can these these these labels sometimes man they kill me all right here we go so the packaging is tough it should be perforated edge it's not that kind of is troublesome to open for sure if a customer is gonna have difficulty getting into the item it just starts to decrease the chance that they're gonna buy it again and again this is difficult to get into and i don't like that why why is it so hard there we go all right you guys saw me trying to get into that having way too much trouble we finally got to the oil this is what we're looking at for the cart this is definitely looking like a disney car but we shall see it says high potency live resin we shall see i know a thing or two about live resin cards y'all all right here we go vessel one two three four five it's turned on one two three ah here we go we're on green this tastes like this tastes like distillate with fake terps i'm not even gonna lie jungle spice earthy and calming is what it's described and then the total terpenes on the back 1.86 on the trapinoline i don't know to me it's just not making sense the flavor profile with this trapinoline mercene and limonene and look at the color of that oil you do you see this gold this is insane is it live resin is it distillate i don't know do i need to do i need to pull out i guess you guys are gonna have to stay tuned in the description i'll let you guys know uh i'll i'll check out the coa that they have listed here with the qr code i'll see what happens when that comes up but i just want you guys to see this just so that way i can just 100 be transparent with you guys there are two different testing stickers on this one thing okay i just want you guys to see this i'm putting there are two different ones so the one that is on the outside layer okay the one that the one in this hand uh says 84.78 total cannabinoids um and 4.59 total terpenes the one on this which was the original sticker that's connected to the strain type says total cannabinoid 71.8 thc 66.45 but it says total terpenes 16 so it's just interesting to me what is it is it this one is it this one what's the issue um i don't know just a lot to really be desired uh in terms of that i am gonna hit it one more time and i'm gonna give my official score because if you took away this all that matters is the quality of the oil at the end of the day i don't know man this just tastes like dizzily with cannabis terps uh it does doesn't have that live resin uh type of vape hit i guess i've tried select i've tried prescott tried buddies i've tried stizzy i've tried alien labs this looks like dusty so potters let us know what's good comment below if you guys have tried the jungle spice cartridge let me know what your guys's thoughts please be sure to share your opinion if you want to go buy it yourself go visit mother nature's remedy in woodland hills show them some love make sure you follow them on instagram send them a dm and i will of course see you guys in the next taste test review but before we get out of here my taste test score for this is an 8.75 my official score on this is an 8 flat because i don't know what it is it looks like disney it tastes like disney it gets you high like cannabis terps but then you've got two different stickers over here on this packaging situation and so there's just a lot of questions going on i'll see you guys in the next review love you all peace", "420nTyOkEI4": "okay so i have watched about a million videos on how to fix the cartridges for these style cartridges that uh people use right okay so most of them tell me most of the videos that i've watched told me just to take my fingernail or some tweezers and pull that little thing this thing here up because maybe this connection after use isn't touching the connection in my battery right okay okay so i did that like a million times i pulled that thing up over and over again put it in nothing worked the lights just kept blinking telling me that something was wrong right so a while back i had taken this cartridge off of my old battery and this whole thing slipped out okay so i just put it back in put it back in put it back in thought that what did i do i broke it i broke it i broke it well if you can see it's got a little light in here inside right there you can kind of see the wire okay that's in there now on this part that came out it has a little hole that goes straight through it and i thought maybe that wire is supposed to go through those holes i'm going to do this as a tool because it's kind of meticulous so if you have tweezers or something i would suggest you do the same and also be very gentle because you don't want to break any of the parts right so i took the little wire and threaded it through that hole threaded it through the hole okay it doesn't like come out the other side or anything it just goes into that little hole and then you just kind of shove this back inside of it right of course i'm not pushing the buttons right okay so before when it was broken and not ripping the lights would blink telling me that something was wrong with my sorry anyhow telling me that something was wrong with my thing now the light well in the camera it blinks but in real life it's just solid smoke yay so if you have like me watched a million videos on what's wrong with my cartridge why won't my cartridge work it might not be this if this is fine okay it might not be you having to pull this thing out like all the other ones say it might just be the connection with the wire inside of here it's not there or this thing pulls out because it gets stuck to here which has happened to numerous cartridges of mine so i'm sure it's happened to other people right this part you take your cartridge off and this part is stuck to the inside right here okay then you stick it back on there and oh my god now my cartridge won't work well don't worry just take the whole little nubbin out thread it through that little wire in there shove it back on stick it onto your battery and try it again i hope that helps somebody out there like me who was not getting the answers that i was looking for um on youtube so i had to use my own noggin mixed with a couple of the hints from other videos and and bam good to go", "Bhzzj0wtii4": "how's it going YouTube this is Alex coming at you for TV TV in the studio with a very special video for you today today we have the top five vaporizers of 2020 perfect to start your year off with a bang or I guess a fast heat up time but first if at any point you like this video throw us a thumbs up would you if you're gonna go screw up and your way through this video please throw us a like before you bounce without further ado let's get into it coming in at number five the utility at 7:21 brings the heat without breaking the bank awarded best vaporizer at Oak cannabis 20:19 the world's most affordable convection vaporizer features a large stainless steel heating chamber 60 minutes of battery life and a magnetic mouthpiece cap that makes loading a breeze the 721 is a true two in one and the added ability to handle your wax makes us a very versatile unit comes with a wax canister tweezers a brush a USB cable and a set of earrings it takes 30 seconds to heat up and has a chamber capacity of point 4 grams with one button operation and ample vapor production you are going to be satisfied with every drop I like to send it to anyone for many reasons but my favorite parts of a deep chamber tasty vapor and how easy it is to use the one button on the side controls everything and the temperature options cover all the basics I would say this vaporizer is for fans of the crafty and mighty who can't splash the cash on a 300 plus dollar device all these reasons add up to the utility and 7:21 sitting in our number 5 spot coming in at number 4 the Arizer solo 2 is a great conduction vaporizer with flavor coming out of everywhere that long last stem that is a risers trademark cools the vapor really well before it hits your lips and the airflow is very free-flowing it comes with two of these glass aroma tubes a glass aroma dish some sample botanicals and no it's not the same kind of botanicals that we used to refer to on this channel actual botanicals a charger a carrying case with a belt clip if your feeling dad like to stem caps a stir tool and four screens the digital display and precise temperature control give you the ability to customize every aspect of your session and the three hours of battery-life is nothing to scoff at either the chamber holds up to 0.25 grams and it is nothing short of a workhorse vaporizer it is a well-built powerful device that will hit you harder than a freight train on steroids look the solo 2 was the third vaporizer I ever bought and I still have mine to this day it holds a special place in my collection and I love using it when friends come over or when I have a solo session I hate myself it's not necessarily a beautiful piece of machinery but it gets the job done and it is sturdy as hell one of my favorite things to do with the solo 2 is to run it through a water peace cooling the vapor down even more it gives some great smooth rips off a very capable device and that's why it comes in at number four coming in at number three the utili and 722 released at the end of 2019 brings a breath of fresh air to the award-winning view Tilian line the new sleek look and redesigned shell is classy as hell sorry and it's not just the aesthetics that have been updated this vaporizer maintains all the things that people loved event the 721 including 30-second heat up town while adding a couple more features utility does refine the airflow increase the maximum temperature and improved the boost mode all of these things add up to a better full spectrum extraction and I really love the changes to the 722 it comes with a cleaning brush tweezers a wax canister a set of o-rings and a USB charger the 2300 milliamp hour internal battery will have you vaporizing for 60 continuous minutes the included wax canister will help you paper as your favorite concentrate especially because the highest temperature has been increased to 225 degrees Celsius another true two-in-one the 722 is elegant in design and function features a point four gram chamber and has officially replaced the 721 in my lineup don't get me wrong I love the 721 but I just can't say no to a version update I love this vaporizer because didn't cost me much money and it looks and performs like a much more expensive device I call it my ballin on a budget vaporizer I'm sorry I said them nevertheless it comes in at our number three spot in spot number two the world renowned mighty from Storz and Bickel hasn't changed much in 2019 but it didn't really need to did it the mighty has great battery life tasty hits and packs a punch that could rival Anthony Joshua in the ring it is bigger than most portables surely but that trade-off gives you great design cool cool vapor and added functionality it features precise temperature control from 40 to 210 degrees Celsius the intricate cooling system housed in the mighty keeps your lips nice and chilly it's not a thing it comes with a grinder filling aid cleaning brush liquid pad extra set of o-rings charger and a dosing capsule for when you don't want to take your whole kit on the go look we all love the mighty if you have ever used a mighty there is a 100% chance that you enjoyed your experience if I could afford one I would have one I might steal this one don't tell anyone it features ninety minutes of continuous use that delicious flavor that Storz and Bickel is known for and can handle concentrates as well the reason it didn't make our number one spot is simple plastic if you've seen any of our other videos if I'm paying $300 for a device I don't want plastic yes I know it's not in the vapor path and yes I know it's specifically made plastic but still give me a nice tight metal body that sound gross I bet that sounded gross I didn't mean it nevertheless this is a fantastic vaporizer and that's why it sits in our number-two spot and now the moment you've all been waiting for or scrubbing - in our top spot this year is none other than the Zeus Ark named cannabis product of the Year at Oak cannabis 2019 the Ark is tiny and packed full of great features the haptic feedback will let you know when the unit is reached temperature and the accelerometer will detect when you haven't touched the unit in a while and will start to cool down to savior it also features an all gold vapor path which cools the vapor off really well and makes the hits off the zeus arc incredibly smooth comes with the charging cable a half pack spacer a flow singh tool and a bunch of cleaning tools it has a powerful 3500 million our internal battery which will last you 90 minutes of continuous use this high performance vaporizer offers massive clouds of flavorful vapor in a small compact body it looks incredible and the performance holds up to that look it's like picking up a novel with an awesome cover and then reading the novel and realizing you could have judged this book by the cover it gives me the high gloss German sports car feel I want in anything German made that tight metal body I was talking about earlier why did I say it again gross I've had my Arc since late 2018 when it was released and it is my go-to day-to-day device it is another unit I absolutely love ripping through my bomb one of my favorite parts about it is that it can come with you almost everywhere and it even fits inside of that don't lose [ __ ] pocket inside of your jeans you know that pocket in the pocket of your jeans I'm not gonna stand up and show you my lower half I'm not an animal but you get it either way all of these features add up to a fantastic vaporizer and that's why it's it's in our number one spot before we go a quick footnote we wanted to include the crafty plus in this list as it is another well-built device from Storz and Bickel the updates to the unit are great and I'll throw the link to the full video up in the corner here sadly Apple is seriously taken away from this device as they have removed all vaporizer apps from their App Store this means that roughly 50% of all vaporizer users will not be able to have the full experience of the crafty plus for those of you who have the Storz and Bickel app already this is a great device and definitely worth checking out but Apple helped Storz and Bickel elbow Jim and that's it for this one guys thank you so much for watching this video if you enjoyed it if you learned something please tap that like button you really enjoyed it hit subscribe and that little belt to stay up-to-date on all of our latest if you think I'd missed anything if you have any different opinions on the top five units this is just our opinion

that really don't give two possible Jardine a meal", "G1VQlA7A9R8": "what is up YouTube family boy Vasquez here gonna be doing another cartridge review today for you guys those who are new here I really appreciate you guys for subscribing to the channel and those who've been here you guys are awesome you know I really appreciate you guys taking the time out your day and watching my videos you guys are the MVP for that and if you guys have any questions and think about it you know you guys just want to talk [ __ ] you know I'll reply to you you guys know could probably be friends you know just comment down in the comment section and yeah guys but let me know what you guys been up to it is Sunday afternoon I'm just kicking back today you know I'm gonna be chilling at home so yeah guys if you guys have any good shows on Netflix let me know as well but today we have a special cartridge that like I've never thought to be honest when king pen came out they're really really popular but now they have a live resin like they kind of fell off you know cuz there was a lot of fakes and there was just I don't know they were just bad you know a lot of people they really liked kingpin but there are pretty good cartridges but you know I assume that they came out with the life resin line so I definitely had to go down to the shop and pick them up now they're half grams so I don't know if they have full grams yet but the packaging on these are [ __ ] amazing like you know it's like a ten by the tin box you know so it's really cool but yeah it's a half gram I've got it for like 30 bucks so let me give you guys a close-up on the on the packaging on the back the THC level is like sixty it's 61 percent guys so it's not as high so I mean the taste should be spot-on you know life residence should be always be good but you know kingpin a really shocked me when they came out with the light resin you know I was like what the hell because I thought pink paint just you know was regular distillate which it is but I don't know it was kind of weird seeing they came out with some light red and so some people had said you know to go check it out and they're pretty good so we're about to find out right now so the manufacturing date was January so it's a pretty fresh cartridge still I had paid $30 for a half gram so it should be good you know cuz the full grams gonna be like 60 bucks so you have this little sticker on the bottom and I grab the biscotti flavor because that's the one that stood out the most so we're gonna open it so has a little sticker in there where you can fi your product and [ __ ] like that and we're going to spill it damn it's really excited you nod I thought King pin fell off you know a lot of people don't really [ __ ] with king pin because there was a lot of fakes and they were just I don't know some people said they weren't good but to me they're a pretty good cartridges I really liked them a lot so the pill the little stick off I'm just gonna open the little thing [ __ ] here we have this little thing that came out pretty sure it's just like information you know it says the counterfeit the counterfeit prevention program ensures your product is authentic using a kingpin iZON it's the website where you can go check to make sure that you think is authentic your cartridge I should say which is pretty dope you know and yeah you guys can give you guys a little close-up on it it's cuz kingpin there was a lot of fakes and telling you the streets were flooded with kingpin a lot of black market and I'm pretty sure you guys know appreciate guys I've gotten one before so I personally have gotten a fake one before and it wasn't as good so this one has a little digit code on the on the little sticker we just ripped and you just type that up in little computer and you know it shows that you have an authentic pen which is pretty dope you know just to make sure so we're gonna go ahead and open this up and bam that is [ __ ] sick right there tell me now that is not dope right there guys that is like fancy packaging right there I've never seen a cartridge that came pretty sick like that you know it looks like something something that it looks like something expensive you know what I mean so that looks pretty good right there that's the first indicator which this is gonna be good so we're going ahead and take that out and there's nothing else so I'm gonna keep the uh I'm gonna keep this little box you know can probably put some doozies in it I'm in a couple joints you know take this [ __ ] off but this is what you guys came to look for so it's nice to man I'm also keep that it says kingpin on it and and on the back says made with a hundred percent recycled plastic which is pretty cool you know they feel kind of different which is pretty cool so we're gonna take that off I'm really excited about how they're getting the look and how they're gonna taste so I don't really expecting pet to come out with a light resin lines BAM that you have it guys it looks kind of little darker couldn't a live resin so we're gonna take these little rubber caps off and it says royal on it so I think it's like a collab with Roy I think it's like a different company because I seen a had royal on it so I didn't have kingpin so I'm pretty sure it's like a collab which is pretty dope and I was about time kingpin did something you know to come back but and they came back good with some live resin cards which is not bad you know and we're you guys close up and I'm going to flip it over and see if it's some nice thick oil this is a nice little day in there which is the half gram you know I'm pretty sure the coil absorbs some of it and it does not move at all guys and we're going to dry hit this yeah it's pretty weird cuz on the thing it doesn't say kingpin it just says row as you guys can see but I mean I don't care so we're gonna going that dry hit this and I'm going to see there's some flavors if I get some flavors off it this one's a biscotti so a biscotti is like how can I say to me a biscotti is like a cookie a cookie cross with something I'm not sure how it is if you guys are familiar with the biscotti straight let me know in the comment section below would really appreciate that I mean I smoked it before but I'm just like I said I'm not familiar with the cross it so you guys know and I'm not gonna lie to you guys this thing tastes like a cookie you can get you to get that nice clean Wow it's it's amazing guys it tastes like a cookie honestly if you guys ever had the the strain cookies exactly it tastes exactly like it so I'm really excited about that and I think we're gonna go ahead and hit it out of the yo can okay if you guys have if you guys are ever looking for a battery you know I'm not you know then there's sponsor me or nothing but you guys ever looking for a battery get a yo can you know order on their website or just go to the smoke shop any smokes just have it this shit's a [ __ ] [ __ ] beast you know I've dropped it in water it dropped so many times open beers within it still works you know it comes with a little magnet you just screw on bottom of the cartridge so we're going to do that I'm really excited man cuz it was about time [ __ ] kingpin came out with light resin which I've never thought they would you know I thought they would just stick to their normal distillate so here it is we got their magnet on there so make sure the battery's charged guys and let me know what you guys up to on this Sunday afternoon what kind of cartridges you guys smoking on and always don't forget to let me know in the comment section what kind of videos you guys would like to see as well so I know you know what what you bring out for you guys you know because there's times where honestly I go to the dispensary and I don't know what's a good cuz I don't like getting the same cartridges I mean I would but you know I like bringing out a new concept for you guys but if you guys would like to see some new some some of the different I mean some of this same cartridges are over and over just let me know you know I'll do it but yeah guys if you guys are smug along with me go ahead and do so we're about to get high so I'm going to drop this in and I'm gonna drop it in in the battery BAM so cheers guys if you got to smoke along with me go ahead and do so yeah really excited man hopefully hopefully it tastes good right like [ __ ] wow wow wow I'm not lying to you guys this [ __ ] is fired for kingpin a dual life resin honestly I thought it was a joke I thought it was gonna be as good because you know kingpin literally either solis people to come out with live resin and this [ __ ] tastes good it kind of tastes exactly like a raw garden but more of a Terp flavor in there like a strange Pacific flavor like this one's a biscotti and you really really get that cookie flavor him you know that earthy cookie flavor in this fire wow it tastes really good I'm going to hit it longer to see if it like chokes me a little bit so I can get high now I can explain to you guys how the high is it's just making me drool damn yeah this shit's fire guys I'm not you know I smoked a lot of cartridges since ever since I've been smoking I smoked a lot of cartridges before I ran through a lot of them and this this has to be one of the best life raisin cartridges I've tried i'ma have to compare it with the raw garden one day man this shit's fire it tastes exactly like would it like the strain if you guys had a biscotti it tastes exactly like cookie it's like fresh earthy clean taste - it's so good now the high you get a nice good of buzz you know I'm feeling good already I've smoked it in the morning I smoked a blunt but I kind of sobered up so that's why you know I decided to do the review so I can explain the high man but I feel good you know afraid for being 61 percent THC it's not a lot but it it also depends on the strain you know you also get different effects the THC level doesn't always got to be high to get a good feeling you know what I mean that's what a lot of people don't know cuz just cuz you hear it 90 or 80 percent doesn't mean all I'm gonna get high as [ __ ] it's not like that you know well some people it kind of is but to me like some strict like the strains you know they all got their own high so whether it's 60 80 per se you know just gonna is gonna get any hot so I'm feeling good right now you know I'm getting a nice little buzz so I'm going to hit it again just to you know the cartridge tastes good it tastes so good I can probably smoke it in one sitting but I'm gonna try and save it a little bit for the weekend so I'm going to hit it again before I take off gotta go to the store man I'm we're stuck I already booked and these things are so big if you guys ever see the kingpin man you guys you guys got to give him another try if you guys said [ __ ] kingpin before this is the time to give him another try man this [ __ ] tastes so good I'm not lying to you guys they had like four different kinds of flavors but like I said the biscotti ones the one that standard out the most so it is really good you know you get that nice cookie taste to it so do you guys ever see these you guys got a copper you know they're $30.00 1/2 gram right here in California in Modesto California that's where I'm from so I don't know they're probably gonna be twice as much over there from where you guys are from but over here at medical and recreational prices are the same so so yeah guys I really appreciate guys appreciate you guys watching my video and you guys stay tuned for more guys and uh hope you guys stay safe don't do no dumb [ __ ] and yeah just like and comment on the videos and don't forget to let me know what kind of videos you guys would like to see and you guys have a good day guys", "OEEBmsgSTpA": "hello everyone and welcome to the channel my name is Zack and today I'm going to be doing a cannabis product review I have the brand new geo pen by G pen or gran CO science they make all sorts of different G pens this is the Geo pen this is a Geo pod from colt in Baltimore City they're right on the harbor they're one of my favorite cannabis dispensaries they have some of the best deals they have some of the best flavors and some of the best most high quality products for some of the best price these are not the best price these are pretty expensive they're about 70 to 80 dollars for a half of a gram but I wanted to try them out and see how they were so they gave me a free battery one time when I went there when they had some specials going on obviously to promote you to buy this but anyway this is the lemon diesel flavor here is I'll put up a picture of this as well so you guys can see I'm sorry I don't think you'll be able to I don't think you'll be able to read that um I tried but anyway lemon diesel half a gram it expires 1012 of 2019 so it's good for I guess it's probably good for a little over a year definitely except audit like a week ago if that um yeah haven't had a chance to try this out yet but I mean itching to try it and I wanted to make sure I made a video when I did try it because this is a brand new product and I couldn't find like any information on these online like nobody had any information on this so anyway guys I figure I'll give you a good review of not just the product and how it smokes but also how cultist stuff is so anyway these are supposed to be extremely high in Turkey and content and recently I've been on a terpene kick so anyway I'll read you what this says it says chemical profile active ingredients fresh frozen cannabis flower now I'm pretty sure they add terpenes to this to liquefy it and to enhance the flavor so I don't know if that's all that it contains is just fresh frozen cannabis flower I don't know how accurate this is I could probably call the lab it call to and find out if you're interested I'm sure you could call the lab occult on find out but I haven't taken it that for yet anyway pretty sure they add lab terpenes to this not cannabis derived terpenes but I could be very wrong so anyway um it says T chemical profile THC a thirty six point seven percent THC twenty five point eight percent total cannabinoids sixty two point five percent and then it goes on to the terpenes and this is where that really got me this is why I bought this one total terpenes nineteen point eight nine percent and it goes on to explain I'll just read you off the three highest because these are what or four highest that are the most concentrated in this terpene make sure but anyway it says alpha pining 1.45% beta Mir seen twelve point five three percent Lamoni n-- l IM o n en e Lamoni Lamoni no however you want to say one point nine percent oh and there's also beta carry of Filene one point one four percent there's a few other ones in here but they're very small percentages so anyway this is nineteen point eight nine so almost nineteen point nine or almost 20 percent terpenes and almost sixty two and a half percent cannabinoids so let's give this a shot without further ado i'll practicode and show you guys what it looks like this is my first time trying this I've never had a Geo pod so anyway you pull it out it's got this cool little jar this is a hybrid flavor this is not sativa or indica dominant it's hybrid on the back it says how to insert the cartridge yeah yada oh I think we can figure that out pretty easily cartridges are only compatible with the Jeep NGO battery so you have to have this battery also um hate the hate to sound like a hater here but um I'm pretty sure this is like a 350 milliamp battery and these are like 20 bucks I don't know what the hell they're thinking because realistically I can get like a 1,300 milliamp 510 threaded vapor battery for any of the other cartridges that aren't pod specific and only work with this for like 8 bucks from China so and it'll last forever I've had plenty of those batteries that are continuing to last and have held the charge for years so anyway kind of ridiculous that this is like 20 bucks and you get I don't know you get like a fifth of the battery life that's kind of ridiculous so I guess I'll be charging this thing often but let's crack it open and see what this looks like and then I'm going to depth and show you guys the pod mmm and I'll tell you if it smells I don't know if it really has any smell yet but we'll see all right so it's got this little strip top you just rip that off pull it out okay so it's got this it's a little packaging you got your Jeep in wow this feels nice it feels like doesn't feel like it's plastic it feels like it might be some kind of aluminum or alloy charger on the back looks like it I guess that's a microUSB I don't know I'm not sure what you call that pretty sure that is what you call that with a usb on the other end so you can plug it into whatever but anyway so here's the pen gotta cheat on the back a little grippy spot for you to hold it I guess it's so fits in your hand like this and you can rip it but anyway G on the front G on the back it does have a serial number I don't know if you can see that where if I should be showing you my serial number but anyway um alright chess compliant so anyway let's take a look at this this is the cartridge hybrid ooh the pot itself smells very good okay so it sits in this weird little stand inside there break loose with my hand and then pop it out but anyway there you go it says hybrid I don't know how well you guys can see it I'm sorry mmm camber is not the best here I'm using my phone but anyway um tiny little cartridge and I'm already extremely concerned I don't know if you guys can see this looking at it but I don't know if you guys can see sorry about that I don't know if you can see this looking at it but the bottom looks separated from the top the bottom looks like diamonds the top looks like sauce so I'm already extremely concerned about the quality of this product that's not a good thing but anyway let's give it a shot I'm gonna go ahead and assume the the G on the plastic which you can see lines up with the G on the front I've read that before so yes that is correct that's how feeds it's pretty obvious because the way the mouthpiece goes and I think you just rip it so let's go ahead and see what we get from this thing okay honestly tastes like I just took a low tenth freakin dad I was worried by how that looked but oh my gosh does this taste good I'm not even just being a fanboy I expected that I would not like this at all and it would taste like any other vape cartridge the flow is great really smooth on the drawl and you can taste dank buds on there now most pans you only taste it on the exhale this it's on the way in it's on the way out I literally feel like I am dabbing at low temp off of some super clean quartz some dank lemon diesel I mean it's got a little bit of a lemony taste a little bit of a diesel II taste neither overpowering but it just tastes like some really dank fresh buds I'm actually super impressed by this um still looks like it's kind of separated it's really gonna be hard to show you guys what that looks like but it's it's like looks sandy it looks sandy at the bottom looks like there's a bunch of crystals and top is all just turkey juice so actually home let me take another look at that yeah I don't know that's the vibe I'm getting it's kind of what it looks like it's like the dank of a thousand nugs in your mouth like honestly this is like taking a low temp tab I really didn't think I was gonna be impressed by this product so anyway the battery might be not might not be superhot capacity it might not last super long but realistically these things are so expensive they're pretty much twice the price of what a cartridge costs you know you can get a gram of about you can get about a gram a gram fake tank from one of the local dispensaries for between 70 and $100 when it's on sale and this was like 70 between 70 and 80 for a half of a gram so this is a lot more expensive but honestly it's a completely different experience I am not kidding you I don't know if it would have stopped me okay so personal advice do not rip it that long I can totally tell whatever the heating comp own it is started to ruin some of the flavor when I was ripping it that long so maybe just do short bursts much better so yeah don't be taking huge rips with this thing guys do a couple of seconds don't be going real long and you'll get super Turkey rips um honestly I tried to get an opinion from some of the people at Coulter when I bought this they didn't give me a super good idea of what to expect I pretty much got the idea that it was going to be like any other vape pen but anyway guys it's really discreet pretty much looks like you got like a little jewel or something nobody's ever gonna question what the heck you got but anyway yeah this is great this is a nice little discreet medical device this is some very high quality medical product like I said my only complaint so far is well I guess I have two complaints one the battery doesn't have much life - if you rip this too long it will taste funky but this is great guys honestly pick some of these up and try them out um I have another flavor I'm gonna be trying out but I'll be doing that in another video this is super Silver Haze this is a pure sativa anyway let's take another Ripper to close this out yeah super Turkey super delicious um it's like taking a low temp tab guys I don't know what else to say sorry if I keep repeating myself but this is amazing I'm excited the trout the super Silver Haze and see how that is but this is the lemon diesel Geo cartridge again guys thanks for watching definitely check out Colton in Baltimore whether you just like concentrates or flowers they have great deals on all of it check them out and if you get a chance to check out some of these geo pods definitely worth at least grabbing one to try out if you can get the battery for free or if you can get the battery chief I don't know if it's necessarily worth paying 70 for the cartridge and like 20 or 30 for the battery then you're racking up like a hundred bucks but either way I don't know how long this is gonna last might last me a pretty good while but um yeah this is delicious guys I'll get back to you and let you know in the next video if there's any issues with this if it's leaking if it's doing anything funky I've read some kind of goofy reviews online about this but so far I have I have a pretty good uh pretty pretty good confidence in this and working pretty well as long as you take light rolls and you don't use it all day long maybe substitute this with another pen that you use every once in a while get some flavor and mainly chief the other one because I think if so you'll probably kill this battery quick but I'll get back to you guys on that in the next video anyway thanks for watching and have a great day", "ou3UxU9drB4": "c.b.c outbreak information they the outbreak Walker that's me

eight my guy this is the delta eight card from black tie this is cbd delta ape vape banana vape banana you know what i love about black time one not only do they take their products very seriously they have great products but they take their packaging seriously seriously this is noise this is noise packaging this is nice packaging and this little button see on this you got to push this little button down and you push it down far enough it should fly right up it's child proof [ __ ] you know that's what you're supposed to do [ __ ] it can be a bit difficult you know what it's teeth time oh

with this pull down but anyway besides the difficulty of that look at this oh look at that delta eight cart oh i needed today too delta eight is for mondays delta eight is for mondays and it's a monday oh this is what i see everything is already ready with black tie everything is already 100 ready it you get the cartridge and you get the pen and i really do love the packaging i'm not gonna lie this is just this this is great packaging this is the 0.5 milliliter and it is the kit so that's what you need to make sure you get if you go to them if you don't already have a pen which i did not so i had to order the kit but let's get to it man because delta 8 is all the rave right now so they say um this makes the review super easy because i don't have to roll up i don't have to like there's nothing to do but get it and to say what i always say before i smoke which is salute to health wealth and self as you all know self love is the best love so look if you haven't heard the words i love you today then please get to the closest of me and tell yourself self i love yourself because you can't love anyone else or expect anyone else to love you if you don't love yourself you dig so let's see what it's talking about and yeah smoking in the hotel room [ __ ] the rules that banana flavor is delicious oh my god it's yummy yummy yummy some kind of song that banana is good this is definitely justin bieber this is definitely bieber in here black tie you got that yummy yummy yummy yummy yummy yup set up work i'm gonna wait yeah babe okay okay okay this is about the delta egg first of all oh man i said banana i meant banana that banana flavor is kicking i can tell you this it does not take much it don't take much to fix their fix the effects kick in quick so um i would talk more about the banana flavor but if you don't know what a banana tastes like then where have you been but the flavor banana bananas amazing i love banana i like banana flavored nyls i just like that flavor so this was an excellent excellent choice for moi that's me [ __ ] smooth but yet strong though it is strong and the effects the effects are great it is a as the effects kick in it reminds you of a delta nine thc type feel if you're familiar with what i'm talking about um it it feels like it's close to that it's not that though this is definitely uh it's it's delicious the effects are the effects are calming uh that's my homeboy uh vic right there the effects are calming um it is a it's a you you you almost you're right there at getting an intoxicated type feel but really really good um i will say this excuse me i will say this if you guys are used to one if you do not fool with thc because it increases your anxiety rather than helps calm it down then be careful with this because it's gonna somewhat remind you of that type of feel um but if you guys are not worried about that at all then this is definitely a must-have uh and i'm just indulging right now because it really doesn't take that much for the effects to start kicking in but at the same time the the flavor makes you want to keep hitting it the flavor alone will make you just keep coming back more coming back for more but the effects kick in really quick and it it it's a it's a it's a sense of it's a sense of euphoria uh it gives you a happy feel i definitely feel like this is a uh like it's a i don't know if delta 8 is a sativa but it gives you a sativa type of feel dude this is good i'm impressed i'm impressed with this a lot man this will be with me everywhere i go everywhere i go to the mall to the gas station to the stove everywhere i go this is gonna be my this is teddy ruxman this is gonna be my buddy and everywhere i go he's gonna go my buddy this is going to be my buddy oh i'm blown away it's amazing it's euphoric it's awesome it's wonderful it's great i'm gonna run out of adjectives before i run out before i run out of good things to say about it uh oh man black tie for the win black tie for the win man uh i love this company the the the customer service is amazing shipping is super super quick and this oh and this is cb this is not just delta 8 by itself this is cbd and

feels pretty good in your hand it's not too big you know my hands little almost bigger than the goddamn thing so you know you go ahead and uh gots a little magnet on top which is pretty dope because I've seen other vaporizers where you know the the damn stick it it's like not connected to the top to the mouthpiece so you know you got to take the mouthpiece off and then you grab the little stick and you move it but this one has it like connected to the mouthpiece which is pretty dope so you just you know BAM and like to mix the bowl you just turn it like that you know you want to pick out it whatever do it up so it's pretty dope guys and the chamber is pretty big as you guys can see I love yes to see as good but got some nice little chamber you know we're about a shred some suggestion button we're gonna pack that [ __ ] and I see him if the ribs so it's pretty cool guys to recharge wise you have to see yo can I have a cartridge battery from yo can and it's a [ __ ] monster you know I've dropped it dropped in water drop open beers with that [ __ ] no I still had it out of like a year so it's pretty good battery guys so it's a pretty simple vaporizer you guys nothing too hard for you guys to figure out so you guys click it on you guys click it five times to turn it on one two three four five as you guys can see it gots a little o LED screen on there which is pretty good it shows you guys uh he has Fahrenheit you guys could put on Fahrenheit or Celsius I guess but I'm gonna stick to the Fahrenheit cuz no I'm not I'm not a pro with these vaporizers I don't know what's the best vape that was the best fake temperature to put it on so we're just gonna go uh wrinkle like force like force we're gonna go we're gonna go high you know we're gonna rip this [ __ ] we're gonna see if this really works now before I um before I heat it up I'm gonna open it as you can see it's pretty dope let me show you guys a close-up on the mouthpiece you know I got you got your little it's like a little dab stick attached to the mouthpiece you could [ __ ] with your [ __ ] on there so I'm going to shred some butt up and a better way to try the dryer vaporizer with these little cookies right here guys it's pretty fresh still moist II sticky so we're gonna go ahead and see if it burns this [ __ ] so we're gonna go ahead and pack up the chamber right now and we're gonna see if I'm nice and stocked up I didn't put a little nugget nap through a lot in it I made sure that just filled up you know we're gonna see if this thing hits or not you know what I mean so we're gonna go big or go home so we're gonna go numb [ __ ] packed in there you know some people throw a little bit in there but I packed I made sure it should works you know I'm this is not a paid review or nothing so I'm gonna give you guys my honest opinion you know I'm oh [ __ ] this [ __ ] doesn't work out off I don't like it imma let you guys know you know ii mean i'm not gonna tell you guys to buy something that doesn't work so we're gonna dime out just you know you got the little chamber there and this is your mouthpiece with the little stick on the to stir the bola which is pretty dope so you just go and stick it in there BAM so and you guys click on there 5 times 1 2 3 4 5 wait it's on already so we're gonna go numb so I don't know I'm not really I don't know what's the best temperature but I'm just gonna go for where to go for 70 [ __ ] we're going all out and we're just gonna press down the button and you have three minutes for a session you know it heats a real fast you could do the three minute session or a five minute session but five minutes is way too much I'm go ahead and do three minutes so it's already warming up right now as you guys can see the temperature is yes cuz he is going up and it vibrates once it's done then once it's done that's when you can hit it my mucus hit it right now is going so I'm gonna hit to like 380 and then I'm gonna start ripping at you for you guys and I'm gonna let you guys know if this really tastes like some cookies cuz I have some fire cookies here and I'm see if you guys get the flavor if it burns it or see if it tastes good so all right I'm just gonna go on in that's pretty good that's pretty amazing it's a 470 right on it tastes so clean we're going to stir the ball just turn it that's how simple it is I'm just gonna go and rip it for some bait if you get a nice little cloud you know and it's it's so tasty and clean oh [ __ ] that's my waking bag guys and I'm choking I know and it's still have four seven here and you guys can see it still has like about a minute and a half still you got bigger and bigger clouds this thing tastes amazing guys Wow I'm really surprised this thing has me choked and I don't really think I was gonna have me choking but as you guys can see it's like it's running down whoo I'm gonna go ahead and open this up after it's done and I'm gonna see how the we lookin like so I'm gonna rip it again I'm already high as [ __ ] [ __ ] this is like a creeper you know if you guys babe it's a creeper I would definitely definitely take this wrong the goal like if you guys are in places and you guys want to be discreet about the smell I mean you'll probably get like a little smell you know a little funky smell but this thing is dope guys it's small you guys smoke weed wherever the [ __ ] you want without a light or rolling [ __ ] up Wow bigger clouds and the thing it still tastes like cookies you know they don't taste burnt don't say it's nothing like that so as you guys can see once the timer is done it starts all over - three minutes - three minutes so yes could do either three minutes or five minutes depending on how long decision he has one so out of the ten I'd give this a nine you know I [ __ ] love it I've never had a vaporizer before and to be my first vaporizer my drier vaporizer it's pretty dope guys I'd really recommend it I would take this everywhere I'd go which no I am maybe to work and [ __ ] like that you know when I go to places and that's it's pretty cool guys and I'm going to leave the link on the description so if you guys want to go ahead and check this dryer vapor out vaporizer out I would you know recommend it you know I'm not gonna tell you guys to get it if it's not good and [ __ ] but but yeah guys I want to say thank you to yo Kevin sesame this

I'm gonna do like a session you know how about neither but well guys you guys go ahead and check out y'all can and I appreciate you guys for watching my", "_2y1jHND5KE": "yo yo i'm sugil crist and i get asked way too much about thce liquids and hey drew can you make a video about thc e-liquids hey man do you know there's like loads of sketchy thc e-liquid going about so today i thought i'd make a video about why you should sort of stay clear of thc e-liquid now quickly before we get into this video quick message from our sponsor of the day the goods yo the goods have been such an amazing sponsor of the channel so it's always good to have them back on here and yo they have some of the most amazing cbd vapes that you could ever imagine and they've got a bunch of new flavors recently i'm super super hyped to try this draw on honor because everyone's been telling me that's dank and i haven't tried it yet i'm waiting for it to arrive so hopefully in the next video it should have arrived so i can give you guys my thoughts on it but for the time being if you want to check out the goods the link for them will be in the pinned comment down below so i get messages all the time saying something along the lines of hey drew do you know about these fake thc carts going about hey drew do you know about these thc carts with spice in them so i thought i'd make a whole video just going through my thoughts on sort of these comments and explain to you guys what i think and how you can avoid stuff and just stuff to keep in mind in the future really so if you don't know about this this has been a thing for a very long time all the way back since like 2014. these vapes started popping up which were basically like spice vapes they'd be sold online on the internet as something called sea liquid and basically it's just like synthetics in a vape and then basically selling it as a legal high it's basically legal high but as a vape so these have been around for a long time and they're really not something that you ever want to come in contact with because if you do end up coming into contact with it you do end up smoking some of it it will not be a nice experience these chemicals that they put inside those vapes are insanely strong and they're not safe and like some of them aren't even like cannabinoids a lot of people like to think oh you know synthetics are just like cannabinoids so it should be fine no no no we've gone way past the cannabinoid point of synthetics like a lot of these vapes will not even have like synthetic cannabinoids in them they'll just be synthetic drugs in general that you are vaping so that's been a thing for a long time but in the last two years it's kind of propped up that a lot of new users a lot of people who don't really know anything about vapes or you know people just trying to prey on new people in the cannabis scene we'll try and sell them this spice liquid and say that it's thc now i get messaged a lot about this and to be honest most of the time when i get messaged about this unfortunately it's usually really young people like people who don't really know much better people who aren't in like the actual cannabis scene and people who just think like hey i want to get a thc e-liquid you know it seems like a reasonable thought but to the untrained person who doesn't know about all this stuff you could be sold one of these things and then it could end up [ __ ] your life up but the thing is as well i kind of hate when people call these fake thc carts because they're not it'd be like the same thing as if somebody has some ketamine at a party and then they come up to you and they say hey man you want to do this line of coke and then you do it you've not done fake coke you've done ketamine right like somebody has been an [ __ ] and has spiked you essentially and i guess i'd probably think differently if people were like making a brand and like you know there was like this brand of thc e-liquid which was actually spice you know but i'm pretty sure that's not a thing i'm pretty sure most of the time it's just people buy this spice liquid branded as spiced liquid then they're trying to sell that to people and trying to lie to them and say that it's thc which i wouldn't quite see that as saying oh it's fake thc liquid as much as i would say it's someone just trying to drug you but okay listen to me here that is not the only reason why you shouldn't buy thce liquids so even before the whole spice thing came about i've been trying to tell people that thce liquids just aren't worth it like they're really not so when you think about it in this way it might make you change your perspective on it but think about it for a second right if you have a thc e-liquid it has to be mixed with something it has to be mixed with like pg or vg essentially when you're mixing it stuff you're making it weaker and i'm not gonna lie like every real thc e-liquid that i've ever tried has been insanely weak but you kind of have to hit it the same amount of times as you'd hit a joint to be able to get the same feeling from it and when you're doing that with a vape it's not the most comfortable thing in the world especially when most people who are vaping are trying to like you know just have one or two hits while they're outside or walking around like it just doesn't feel quite right to like sit there with a thc e-liquid and chong it just as much as you do on a joint it just really doesn't feel right and then you've got to keep in mind that shout out carts are a thing right and to be honest shack hops can be just as like iffy to buy especially if you're buying like a branded one i guess that's kind of the difference with the thc e-liquids in the carts because the thc eliquids are pretty much always going to be unbranded but the carts are always going to be branded now obviously carts are dangerous for a different reason like obviously there was the whole vitamin e acetate stuff that happened with you know a bunch of carts having that in it and it you know messing people's lungs up so that's a whole nother story so i mean personally i try and stay away from branded shatter cartridges and also you know the e-liquids in general but if consuming in that way is exactly what you're looking for and you're from the uk honestly the safest way to do it is to buy an empty cartridge that allows you to just put straight up shatter in it so you can get these types of cartridges from loads of places i've even made a video called making my own wax cart so you should definitely check that out if you're interested but essentially you can buy your wax from a certified saucer you know the wax is on point good because honestly it's an extremely rare thing to have like contaminated waxes it's more of like a i guess you could have the issue of having like bad wax with butane in it still but if you're buying rosin it's relatively the safest way you could ever do stuff so imagine you've got yourself your rosin you've got yourself a cartridge all you've got to do is heat up your rosin to the point where it goes a bit liquidy pour that into the cart put the lid on it and away you go you've got a safe cartridge that you know is 100 real and you know it's going to get you stoned as well because one hit on it is going to make you feel like you've just done a dab so for those reasons that's what i would say to stay away from thc e-liquid especially in the uk especially right now i definitely definitely wouldn't be going near it and that's not even just on the safety standpoint it's also just on the standpoint of you know if you're a smoker and you have a high tolerance thce liquids ain't going to do [ __ ] for you oh and yeah there's a reason why cbd e-liquids work so well in comparison to like a thc e-liquid when you normally intake cbd you use a tiny amount of it so the ratios of when you've mixed the cbd with the pg and the vg it comes out to still being really strong in comparison but if you had thc at that same level of the cbd it ain't doing anything i mean i mean it will do stuff but it's just not going to be what you're expecting it to be so people just before i go i want to know what your thoughts are on thc eliquids in the comments down below have you ever had any issues with like the spice liquids or anyone trying to sell you something dodgy or just in general you haven't really liked them or maybe you like them maybe you really love thc liquids i would love to know in the comments down below so save one for that people i'll see you guys very soon i'll be live streaming later on tonight at 9 00 pm so like you're always on the phone i sell a toxic what you do the most when you really want to stop this got the trap spot jumping jumping like a [ __ ] [Music]", "pg2k4GNhOGY": "means and i'm gonna do a a roll uh a rolling tutorial bamboo and sheets rolling tutorial you know some cool [ __ ] right here",

money shots and we out set out to use up you already know what I'm saying from the bay to LA they can deliver now deuces ah", "1nJ6qi4T_hQ": "all right guys so now that we are home man it's time to start this video guys we ended up stopping by the store getting ourselves a little uh gatorade zero because it's kind of hot today not gonna lie and i got some heat man i got some heat or at least what people in the streets are calling you know they're calling me they're like they're like yo sebby there's this new product out man that i think it's pretty fire i think you should try it and i was like all right what is it man i'm gonna go cop it let me know what it is so i ended up to i ended up going to carpet downtown l.a and we got it right here in the supreme bag boys you guys already know the vibes let me go ahead and take this thing out show you guys first hand what we got all right boys wrong one so um pretty much this brand is in literally every single legal dyspo that i know of at least the really really really big ones all right guys so getting straight into this one we got a new company man a new company called new normal right so basically what it is it's a new pod system that's out and about and i've heard nothing but good things about it so but the main thing that i've heard about this system itself is that there really really really consistent when it comes to their thc percentages okay so i have two pods right here for example the one that i've been chiefing on just to test it out because i like to test things out before i actually make a video on it because if it's not good i really don't want to make a video on it all right boys so the one that i've been trying was um they labeled it they labeled it as sleep and it is grand daddy perp it is a one full gram and the thc percentage is going to be sitting at delta nine thc okay 90 thc must say that the packaging is actually very very child proof it's very it's actually super nice hard to get open all you got to do is i'll press the button boom there you go all your stuff is in there i'm going to be showing you a brand new pod all right so gorilla glue number four this right here guys is one of my favorite strains okay if you've been following the channel for a long time you already know that gorilla glue number four is one of those strains that it's just like it's just so fire man it it might not be the most fruitiest you know most terpius strain but if it's a really really good gorilla glue it just hits the spots on so many different levels and it's one of it's definitely one of my favorite strains of all times all right guys so brand new packaging you just take that off right there this one right here like i was saying super consistent right so this one is sitting at a 90.65 thc right so gorilla glue number four same thing as the last one go ahead and pop it open like you're giving someone a ring and then boom instructions you could check scan the qr code it just to check if it's real man if you guys ever go to dyspo i'm pretty sure they let you scan the qr code just to double check that you guys aren't getting any fakes and boom you take it out of the little packaging oh they got like some saran wrap on it or something that's something new bottom you have the little plug right there take that off take the saran wrap off and then you have another one right here on top all you got to do is just take that off and then you got your full gram right here all right the oil you i can see right through it honestly it's actually really really clear hopefully that focuses up for you guys that way you guys can actually see it and like i was saying i got the battery itself right here okay the battery honestly this battery is actually really freaking dope in my opinion it is a usb type-c so that means that it's going to charge really really quick i mean before this video um i actually put it i actually had my portable charger i put it to charge and it charged in what like i want to say like nah i don't want to over exaggerate maybe like um 25 to 30 minutes i really wasn't paying too much attention but a full charge right here this is the the full gram that i've been chiefing on it's been about a week already man i really these things really do last all right so i'm gonna go ahead and switch this one out for you guys and give you guys a taste test of the gorilla glue number four all right so go ahead and put that right there but before anything my mouth is kind of dry i'm not gonna lie um i'm gonna go ahead and take a sip of this gatorade man make sure you guys are always staying hydrated okay don't be smoking until you're like literally dying of thirst but that's really really bad so before anything before i take this first hit guys i want to mention the battery i have the limited edition battery and this one right here is the normal starter kit battery it's a black version so i might be doing a giveaway for this one just go check out my instagram i might pop something up on there and then you know that way you guys can get potentially get a free one but for now the new normal gorilla glue number four full gram we're gonna be giving you guys a first you know first-hand impression of what cebi g thinks about it what do i think of the consistency of the 90 thc is it fire is it black you know what do i think of it overall man enough talking though let's go ahead and just hit it um cheers guys took a blinker right there [Music] oh honestly i didn't even expect it to hit me that hard but like once i exhaled that i had to literally stop for a second and just be like holy smokes dude because did you guys see that huge cloud that came out of my mouth that was i don't think it was a normal 10 second blinker i could be wrong but i think i counted seven seconds but either way the cloud is super fat that means that the proprietary battery they have it adjusted perfectly so that way you know with their pods themselves you get the perfect hit every single time you don't over burn it because i didn't taste over burned at all usually with blinkers you kind of get an essence of like you know all right you should have probably stopped it like at seven seconds but with that hit right there it was actually super smooth i got kind of like a lemony taste off of the first hit obviously i have to wake up the coil i'm actually not really too sure all right yeah there's definitely two wicks down there on the bottom you guys obviously i'm going to try to show you because you're not going to be able to see it but there's two on the bottom right there that hit oh my goodness dude that hit literally just smacked me but it was enjoyable it was actually really freaking smooth i liked how smooth it was all the way from the inhale to the exhale that blinker really didn't seem like it was hard at all to do and i think i'm ready for another hit alright guys so like i was saying um legal legality man this thing is actually um crazy to me how we're it's changing so much and this company is actually being really really consistent with their percentages as like like i was saying i've had a lot of people tell me like yo this company is super super consistent they taste fire they don't taste fake at all they don't taste like like bs they use really really high quality product in their um you know in their finishing pods and it's just overall fire so that's what really led to me i was like when i saw it i was like yo that the packaging looks dope overall i think it's just like something that was very very eye appealing and i just had to go ahead and take the leap but the gorilla glue number four it just hits on a different level man i'm just gonna go ahead and give it another hit because i want to taste more of it all right so let's go in on hit number two i should have probably turned off the air but honestly who cares it's way too hot in here for sorry about that guys but look at these clouds oh my goodness the smoothness though i'm talking about i haven't tasted i haven't like felt a smoothness in a in a pod this in in like a long time dude in a very very long time i feel like whenever i chi chiefs dizzies or i chief you know 510 thread cartridges or plug plays i i always feel like a really really harsh irritation in my chest you know that's kind of why i really stopped smoking those was because it made me feel really bad but so far i'm gonna i'm giving you guys my completely 100 honest sabby g um you know like i don't really want to say this a review but you know because this is just a normal video of me trying this out and then you guys you pretty much see the first hand impression if i like it or not so you guys are seeing like i'm not coughing i'm not dying like i used to um this is overall really really clean i feel like i can taste the the purity in the oil itself it's not like harsh and i can take blinker after blinker and just get smacked but the high that get that it gives you is like a super super super clean high it's not like a super groggy high that i usually get from pods themselves it's a very very uplifting and mellow high and it just creeps up on you it obviously the more you hit it the more it's going to get you faded and um but with 90 percent tc you got to be careful man you definitely got to be careful because uh 90 is a lot so imagine taking you know blinker after blinker of a 90 that you're gonna get you're gonna get pretty faded man so definitely i think this would be dope to do a challenge like one like one of these pods in one sitting so what do you guys say maybe if we can do like 500 likes on this video over 500 likes maybe new normal would be down to hook up a you know a video so we could do one pod in one sitting and we'll actually do it though this time i don't care how long it takes we're gonna go out to the woods we're gonna go out to the beach we're gonna go out somewhere walk around and win a finish one all right i don't care how long it takes 90 thc pod i know i know you guys want to see that happen so go ahead over 500 likes and i'll definitely go ahead and do it but i'm gonna go ahead and switch this pot out and i'm gonna be getting over the granddaddy pert because the gorilla glue number four so far i'm like i don't i know you guys could see it in my eyes i'm actually starting to get pretty faded and um it's like very soothing honestly it's like after a long day of you being out and about and doing things you just want to come home and just like feel this comfort so granddaddy perp slapping it back on to the battery itself it's going to go ahead and blink let me go ahead and show you guys one more time hopefully that's focused in it's going to go ahead and blink all right so girl of glue number four this is going to be a personal man i might have to save this for whenever i want to just get a big high and just you know say this for a personal for a rainy day but for now granddaddy purple it's like the oil is the same color there's really no no difference that's how you know the consistency is there um this one oh using it this one at night puts me to sleep every single time so right now i'm probably going to go ahead and have to take a nap after this let's go ahead and take this granddaddy purp cheers it was a blinker super smooth on the throw honestly like super smooth and it has like with the flavors it's not a very overpowering like taste it's not at all it's not like like i know with some pods and some cartridges you get like this super fake like additive in it and whenever you vape it just like it leaves a film in your mouth at least for me and i don't like it i don't like the taste of that at all i hate it but this this is just completely different guys this is just completely different way for me it's clean it's smooth it makes me feel like like wow i could actually be hitting this all the time you feel me so the more that i hit this honestly i'm just like yo i keep getting more and more faded i'm like i wish i had someone here enjoying this with me honestly so what we're gonna be doing i'm gonna go ahead and just give one away man so go ahead and go follow my instagram it's sebby2ys.g and i'm going to be doing a giveaway on this bad boy right here so i'm going to go ahead and have the details on that on the instagram post you guys should be

are awesome for them you know I'm just chillin you know it is hot as hell outside right now so I'm in the studio which is my car got the a/c pumping right now so I really hope you guys are doing good you know you guys being safe out there and [ __ ] but the really thing that surprised me about this cartridge it was it is ninety percent THC guys if you guys can see hopefully you guys get a good look but it says 90 percent THC that's what I'm that's how I was like what the hell you know ninety percent THC and it was a freak cartridge so it says aim high on the side so boom you guys get a little paper tag on the front I'll take that out and while I you guys have the cartridge there it looks pretty dope you know it doesn't look like no [ __ ] cartridge I'm really surprised you know just the fact that it was free you know you don't really get free [ __ ] man so this is just uh this is a thing I'm how to use it what not you know if you don't know how to use the cartridge you definitely not old enough to smoke it so here we have it guys it looks pretty nice you know as you guys can see I'm going to thinking about the packaging to show you guys a close-up on it so we got it out the box now hopefully you guys can get a nice close-up on it the cartridge itself it looks pretty nice you know there you have the California logo on the back as you guys can see it's a legit legit cartridge so it's a normal distillate cartridge so it's not no live resin nothing fancy like that guys so hopefully guys get a nice close-up on that it's some nice really really thick distillate doesn't move at all so I'm really excited you know it's ninety percent THC I've never had like a really high potency cartridge like this I'm really excited what its gonna taste like so we're just gonna go ahead and take this off get it out the way where I take these rubber caps off and I'm going dry hit and see what it tastes like now right off the bat to be honest it tastes straight like distillate would taste like no taste at all you know the same but no other better way just to try it out and I'm gonna try it out this battery I'm gonna have some new batteries coming in maybe like three different types of batteries from like different companies that they have sent me to review and so you guys stay tuned for you guys ever seen these batteries this one's pretty dope as well you know it's never let me down and it hits like a [ __ ] so we're not going to screw that on guys if you guys are smoking long let me go ahead and do so we're gonna go I said it we're we're going to go ahead and see if this free cartridge is really good or not and so cheers guys to be honest the taste on it the strain on it it's a tautology as yes could see on the bottom you do get a little edgy taste to it but you don't get like us you know like a strong taste to wit you get like us like a distillate taste you know if you guys never know what this really tastes like that's what it tastes like it tastes really good you know it tastes like a piney distillate it's really good the THC is 90 percent and it's really strong and it has me like it gave me a little good buzz already but I'm going to rip it a little longer this cartridge rips my Nana it's pretty strong too you know get you by the throat I didn't really expect this from a freak cartridge you know usually when you get free stuff it's either a nasty or it's good you know you just don't know but this is really good you know I was going to buy cartridge but I had just gone in for some Ace I had gone to eights on the grandma black so like I said the lady was like you want a free cartridge or you want some free wax so I'll like definitely I gotta get the free cartridge you know you don't get no free cartridges nowadays you know actually never I never seen where they give free cartridges but I mean it's free so it was pretty good don't get me wrong why not attend how to give it a 7 you know it's not bad you know regular desolated some distillate is pretty strong like this ones 90% so I'm already feeling the good buzz off it yes some really big fat clouds off this day she's ripping hard ma'am and the taste is not bad like I said it just tastes a lot like distillate and kind of no get me wrong it tastes like it's dizzy would you know it tastes really good oh [ __ ] now for the hive I'd give it a nine you know I'm feeling higher [ __ ] I was smoked all day this is like my first session of the day you know so I'm really feeling the polisi this is a 90% cartridge you guys so if you guys never see these centrioles I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure they're not expensive just the fact that they're just like cartridges but if you guys were to see them give them a try you know they're pretty good you know I mean it was free for me so it's pretty good but you know everything free is good hopefully you guys are staying safe guys I'm going to rip this again one more time before I cut the video hopefully you guys are with me man I'm already high yes a really big fat cause off this [ __ ] but yeah guys um thank you guys for watching I really appreciate you guys taking the time out your day to watch my videos and [ __ ] and I'm gonna try my best to bring out some more videos for you guys after more hot box leaders coming in some more cartridge reviews and [ __ ] but you guys don't forget to let me know in the comment section what kind of videos you guys would like to see ya guys let's rip the [ __ ] again man [ __ ] you [Laughter] guys you guys be safe out there stay tuned for more guys peace", "UreBP3U0O-U": "what's up y'all I know it's been a while it's been like a week or two I haven't uploaded a car video yet so I'm back I'm back at it again you know I'm saying back to chief and the reason for that was basically because I just wanted you know just it's good to take our tolerance a break every now and then like you know Express she was like wax and [ __ ] like that you know um your tolerance goes up very quick so you know you you know taking a week or two office you know that can be pretty good for you cuz then when you go back to it you know you don't need as much to get to where you want to be you know a couple couple blinkers and you're set for a couple hours so yeah well that's that and today I'm back at it again with one of these a supreme this is my first time ever trying this um I've heard that there's a lot of I've heard a lot of hyper on these um I don't know if they're real or not to be honest with y'all y'all let me know you know I'm just I just do these reviews you know I'm not saying that this is good I'm just doing a review this is honest you know I've never tried this before you know I've just heard a lot of hype around it and I don't know if it's good or not so y'all let me know so sativa picked up pineapple Express ninety-two percent THC CBD point zero 85% see that it actually has a batch number which I don't even know if that's legit I don't I don't know if there's an actual batch number I don't even know where I enter that in to see in pod 282 XY so yeah it's a full ground oh it's not in the box cuz I already took it out it came in like a tube it came in like a plastic tube you had to open the tube oven and the card had um the car was inside the tube but I already do the - boy I already have the card on my battery cuz I've already tried it out um I just got it today so I mean I've only taken like a probably about like ten posts out of it cause I wanted to read that CHC distillate or Pete medical use only you know all that stuff take it off the sake show a little ooh alright so here it is not gonna lie with you know it was really clean it's nice it's a nice gold it's a C so you can see to see so it has the holes um I like I like the white tip because I never I've never gone one with the white tip the ones that I usually get are the ones you know the metal ones like the gold one the silver one or the black plastic tip yeah those are usually the ones that I see not gonna lie with y'all this oil is very very very runny like that doesn't even look good I'll be honest with y'all it's it's it's way too runny it's clean it's not dark it's not like yeah it's not like shitty wax you know it's it's it's clear I'll tell you all that but it's look at that like that's way too [ __ ] running supreme or whoever's making these you gotta stop this [ __ ] up man you should is way too runny just way too runny yeah um well obviously I'm gonna try this out still I've already tried it um I'm gonna put on my battery and I'll be back with y'all ready to puff on alright got it back on the battery um I mean a lot of people this is obviously not made by supreme I know a supreme is the clothing brand I mean clearly this isn't made by supreme like supreme would not allow that like they would never I doubt they would ever make their actual own card so I mean this is clearly made by either people or like a company but I don't know why a company would still a supreme my quality take supreme user name I don't know why they just wouldn't make their own but I'm pretty sure this is made by somebody so um the batteries on and take a couple puffs for y'all um tell you about the taste and tell you about the high let's get it okay okay right off the bat you can taste the UM you could taste a pineapple a little bit Wow that's already hitting me already that wax is ready as [ __ ] man you take a good hit off of it you're gonna fill it you're gonna fill it it's just a TV so I'm already filling it in my head but um what was I gonna say um it the taste it has liked it has a little bit of hint of pineapple towards the end but honestly in the beginning it kind of just tastes like straight bud um terpenes barely mmm barely yeah there's not really tart beans in there I'll be honest barely there is a little bit but yeah there's not really a lot uh I like I like Turkey you know I like my flavors you know Mike hearts to be Turkey so if you really like Turks probably not the thing for you like I said very runny kind of like the Dinks tanks are super runny the exotics I know those are all fake I'm pretty sure this is fake to you I'm telling you I'm being honest I'm pretty sure this is fake and if you already know if I'm probably get a lot of comments saying fake fake fake trust me if it is fake I was right then I just do these reviews for y'all because at the end of the day it's just entertainment and I'm kind of letting y'all know like cuz somebody might see this and somebody might want to buy it that doesn't know that this is fate that doesn't know that this is extremely freaking runny that doesn't know that so now they can know so they can have second thoughts no honestly this was $35 for a full gram I would say just save you know spend the extra 20 and get you like a rope or something steep odd a plug-and-play pod you know something nice you know this you know there's so much better than this right here you know but I understand some people aren't in legal states and this is kind of like the best that they can get you know they can't get all the stickies plug in plays yeah so that's why they resort to stuff like this as for the hi I'm gonna be wrote you the height is nice it does have a nice high I would give it probably like an 8 out of 10 on the high it's real nice the Teva it's already I feel I feel good right now so uplifted I'm to go and take another hit then again my tolerance is kind of low right now so some people might have to take more than just one hit for me I wasn't like here anything another one I'm really a big fan of taking blinkers to be honest I just got kind of take it casual you're gonna take like three four second heads but yeah this is um yeah at the end you can taste the pineapple on dragon line I really like pineapple so you know I can taste that I can taste it so there is a little bit of Terps but I mean I've tried two other cards that are pineapple expressing yeah like it's just so flavorful like right off the bat this one it's like towards the end you don't really taste it right off the bat like the other ones the ones that like you know are really chirpy so on taste I would give it a 5 out of 10 turn five out of ten um the oil was nice it's clear just it's runny so it's really not that good I guess you would say um card is nice I like it cuz it's a t-cell so you're gonna get everything in here so I do like the card I like the white tip so it's nice and the coil is nice um cuz I did take a couple blinkers off this and I noticed that it doesn't taste burnt so the overall cart is pretty good so the person that did get this you know they actually actually you know got a good car because somebody would just give cars that are trash so yeah young y'all let me know if y'all want like a particular brand I can I can probably get it um I had just picked this up cuz I've like I've seen a bunch of videos on this and I've heard like the hyper on it so I saw this today and I was like you know what let me go ahead and buy that cuz you know I just wanted to try it will I buy this again no I will not I will not buy this again I'm gonna stick with my other stuff um you know like just like the West Coast cars I never tried those will I buy those again probably not I really just [ __ ] with likes Dizzy's brass knuckles heavy hitters the real ones so yeah but I will I will do a review on like exotics or Dinks but I'll only do one review I will never buy it again like I've never bought into danger before and every bond and exotic but I will buy one just for a video to do for y'all to educate y'all but will I buy it again just for my own pleasure no same thing with this I probably won't so I appreciate y'all like this video subscribe if you want some more common telling which I wanted and um yeah peace let me know what y'all smoking on to you man", "NwuI_vS2mAk": "[Music] hey what's up guys what's up youtube it's me ricardi and um today's video is pretty freaking cool watch the [ __ ] mailman oh my god oh my god man just give my damn man all right anyways so speaking of the mail dudes [ __ ] left goals extracts dude they sent me this through the mail dude holy crap so they gave me two uh half damn great babes um literally the day before new year's eve so i literally like walked in 2021 you know with brand new [ __ ] you know with some you know they hooked me up you know going 20 21 so thank you a lot of coast extracts big thank you so much for sponsoring this video and i'm saying so uh yeah dude so if you don't know what left coast extract is you're then you're probably living on their rock let's come on let's let's be real here um left coast extract if you can't tell her to you know this is like they have their own paw system kind of likes dizzy's you know they're up and coming they've been up and coming actually um i've known for quite a while now and i've always wanted to try their products out you know what i'm saying and you know i'm saying here we are today so that color out it's pretty light um yes so it's literally the same battery as like the [ __ ] it's dizzy but dance looks great so this works with the safety battery as well so but uh i gotta i mean i got a special left coast battery you know i'm saying uh that's all boxes i already opened it i'm see if you can't tell but yeah so go to the charger in there uh i have somewhere coming they have sativa indica hybrid on the yellow ones being you know indica and then um sativa being blue and then red being the hybrids if you see them in the shops but enough of that let's and here's what you guys wanted to see you know the [ __ ] pen you know how does this rip man this this this does hit someone to sizzy now i'm saying this is i mean it's a ponzi something you know the oil though oh my god let me tell you when i first smoked this pan it hit pretty hard by the way um okay let's try it um tokes up man oh yeah by the way this has a really good taste to it great vape cheers y'all thank you left coast for hooking me up man thank you thank y'all man all right cheers y'all i mean tokes we're not saying we're not saying cheers anymore we say tokes narrow we say tokes around here [Music] oh so yeah um this is a real company you know i'm saying this is a there's a cali logo on it and everything but yeah off the first hit dude that's it it's pretty hard you know it is disability just do a solvent list so do a supplementless distillation process now i'm saying uh but dan this is a really good taste dude like probably one of the best layers i've ever smoked for a great bait um this one's probably out there with plug and play for sure is if not better this pod does produce a lot of smoke i do think um me having the you know smoke in the left coast here and there i do notice that the this battery doesn't burn higher and uh you know that's that steady battery so i cannot find it man this is this is no joke man it's i'll just keep ripping this [ __ ] man um i think he's just wondering they are they're based in oceanside so that's you know what the flood that's crazy and these are only available in california you know what i'm saying just you know based off the name left coast extracts another another thing difference between uh this and city battery this one does not blink so for all you like crazy guys who you know thing believes aren't enough man this old actually i lied this does blink it only takes like 20 seconds though like it's like crazy amount of time for the league man but yeah it will blink but i can't i can't do that man i can't my friend did it though but i should have smacked it somebody just pulled up around my house yeah check it out the the cable that came with it um play the left coat extracts um this the great bait pawn that stays true this really does taste like literally grape it doesn't have weird taste at all i've actually you know wanted it you know give my full thoughts about it before you know go out and make a video um this is probably one of the best possible out there for your book you know um most definitely you know i'm saying like this is pretty good pretty good quality um especially if you're you know barely starting to smoke out this yeah barely starting to smoke this it will have you on your ass yeah um tokes another rip um see man i'm just gonna keep ripping this until i get faded faded [Music] the weed in this coil is pretty damn good left goes um like i said thank you guys for hooking me up you know um it's awesome this is a pretty good pen i love i do love um the design of this it's pretty unique compared to that [ __ ] you know stizzies i know they have the camos and all that but you know this stands out you know damn [Music] i dropped that [ __ ] but uh [ __ ] it i wanna show y'all yeah man i'm gonna find that battery um yeah this [ __ ] lifeguard had to be big um this is pretty good you know pretty good oil like i said like i showed you all this you know it's pretty you know it's pretty clear um it was clear than what i usually see for distillate but uh yeah man pretty fire i do notice though when you like tend to hit it for a long time it doesn't taste more burnt well that's just because you're eating longer [Music] dude i'm scared that that guy if i could look at that guy he didn't like try to shoot me or something you know he's in a bomb bam bam and it's like on my youtube video like that you know it's pretty scary out here nowadays like well you look at somebody in the eye and they're just like no like jay he's looking away in the eye like it's looking it's looking funny like like a psycho bad like they're gonna deharm and like what the [

video we are trying out something new i should tell by the title i am going to be trying out this delta a cartridge for the first time if you go back like two videos then you'll see that i did a goody kind unboxing and they sent me this delta a cartridge it's actually a new product on their line their store link will be pinned in the comments or in the description down below i didn't even have a battery for this and they went ahead and sent me a battery so i was like [ __ ] yes this company is so generous yeah i'm just so grateful that they sent me this and i get to try it but yeah um before we get into this i want to explain what delta a is because i actually just now started to hear about it so i'll try my best to explain what it is but basically delta 8 is a cannabinoid everybody's heard of delta 9 but if you don't know what delta 9 is it's like the main cannabinoid and thc that gives you that high effect but delta 8 is basically just like the reduced version of that you know it doesn't get you like high like delta 9 does it still gets you medicated you know but it's not going to get you like so medicated where you're just like i'm so strong bro no it's not going to be like that but yeah that's basically it when they sent me this i was like are they allowed to send me this but it turns out that delta a is actually federally legal and the reason that it's federally legal is because it is extracted from a hemp plant and that's super duper dope and i can't wait to try this i did smoke a bowl this morning but i waited until my high wore off so i could be completely sober for this to give you guys like a nice review on how i feel and things like that as you guys know i don't usually vape i bought a couple of thc cards in my lifetime before but they were never any good but this one's like legit it came it came in a whole [ __ ] box but i don't i don't mind vaping it's a discreet way to get even though this isn't like delta 9 thc it's a discreet way to get high to get stoney and you can't smell it maybe i should do like a video on how to be like a discreet stoner if you guys want to see that video comment down below let me know what you want to see from me but yeah um this is what the packaging looks like i don't know if it's pronounced goody kind or good kind but it is a delta eight thc vape card trick with 92 percent delta 8 thc organically grown pesticide free lead free co2 extracted no thickenings no flavorings third party test it and it gives like a warning on the package and tells you that it was tested and all that good stuff also they donate 1 8 to the navajo water project so go ahead and check them out they're very affordable focus beach they're very affordable and they're super duper nice company so please go check them out and i'm just very excited to get into this i'm gonna turn it on green there we go we got a flashing green and see if that does me well but um this is what it looks like you guys it's like almost clear i'ma go ahead and puff on this for you guys hold on it's flashing but i don't know what that means see i don't even know how to work i don't even know how to work vape pins y'all am i doing this right why is it flashing does it need to be charged oh my gosh y'all i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm doing i'm just trying to do a nice review but my ass does not know how to work vape pins it's like flashing and i don't think it's supposed to be flashing so i'm gonna charge it um brb okay so while this is charging what's up i apologize my ass was not prepared today you guys oh know man this pen didn't come with any instructions so i just don't have to figure it out myself okay so while we wait i'm gonna play some among us i wish we could smoke a bow i don't know how long this is gonna take [ __ ] yes this battery charged in like 15 minutes you guys that's [ __ ] dope but it finished charging right when i finished the round of a mangas we get to try this [ __ ] let's try this distill it out i'm do it on green we got it on free flashy flashy flashy i'm excited i'm excited [Music] oh whoa i'm in pain holy [ __ ] my ass was not expecting that this [ __ ] rips honey hold on do over do over do over cut take two my chest is a heaven then this [ __ ] knocked me out damn i should have started slow hold him a [ __ ] needs some h2o okay now we know that this pin rips well let's let's see how the [ __ ] delta eight tastes man i'm crying [Music] oh [ __ ] this actually does not have a taste it says no flavoring i said that from the beginning oh [ __ ] it says no flavoring but it hits so smooth you guys it's like airy you can't even feel it in your mouth that's how it took too big of a rip you can't even feel it in your mouth holy [ __ ] it smells like like a burnt coil to be honest like what you usually get from vapes that's also one thing that i didn't really like [ __ ] with with vapes is that like it gave like a a a metal taste and like a burnt smell but this one doesn't taste like metal it doesn't taste like anything it just smells like like a hot coil because that's what's happening right here you know this is nice uh this is nice what i read is that it gives you a head and and a body high so we'll see i don't know man i feel in a head rush right now but it's probably because i uh almost had a near-death experience this rips y'all and this is only on green how long maybe if i put it on blue it would have less of a smell unless you like sniff on it you can't smell it it still has like a slight smell but i just feel like that's just gonna come with any vape but enough about the the vape pen let's talk about the delta a i'm liking it so far you guys um it's very light it's not harsh on the throat unless you take too big of a hit like i did it's pretty most definitely it's so [ __ ] gorgeous it doesn't really have a smell just the pen has a smell it doesn't have a taste if you want something like really light and mellow like with like the effects and the taste and the the handling of it this will be perfect for you dude delta a is also said to help a lot with anxiety and i [ __ ] struggle with anxiety i've struggled with social anxiety most of my life and i know when i go outside i get all [ __ ] anxious and now i can have like something very discreet because i can't just like smoke like a cbd joint outside because people are going to be like the [ __ ] is that but nowadays people vape thc so they're probably gonna know what the [ __ ] this is especially if it's in a pen then they're gonna know something's up but you know no cop is gonna stop me like is it a vape pen and it has no smell you guys oh and plus it's federally legal even if the cop did stop me it is federally legal nice i'm actually starting to feel it in my arms and my feet i started working out lately you guys and my legs have been killing me my legs feel better oh wow this is nice i'm actually feeling a body high i don't know if i'm going to feel a head high i only feel like i feel like a head rush is because i cough so hard and you know once you when you cough so hard yeah your brain gets to like posting and [ __ ] like that but i'm definitely feeling like a body calm right now like i'm being medicated it definitely helped with my muscle pain that i was having earlier today in the past couple of days dude and i'm only taking a few puffs [Music] [Music] a lot of people like to use thc to help with like headaches and pains like that i have never felt those effects from thc i've had headaches and tried to just use thc without any ibuprofen but it never it never worked for me i feel that like cbd works a lot better for pain and things like that instead of thc but i heard that a lot of people use thc to help with pain but this has actually helped with pain it's weird it's so weird how this plant works dude it's like absolutely amazing and the fact that it's not accepted by most people that could probably benefit off of it is so mind-blowing to me i feel like this would be really good for somebody that has like a really low tolerance or somebody starting off like a newbie i feel like this would be really good for them i'm not talking way too much when i'm in a good mood i talk way too much this is nice y'all man i like this a lot i feel like my eyes got lower i don't know does like all cannabinoids do that or does like just delta nine make your eyes lower because delta a probably also make your eyes lower hold on we have a phone we have um wi-fi we can google it are my eyes red yes delta eight makes your eyes hella droopy and glazed over so if you do smoke delta eight then you will also have like the same effects in your eyes because i legit feel my eyes lower yeah i'm feeling good this is like literally just like a mild not even a mild high it's just like a little lower than that bro bro i don't know i feel like i feel like i'm feeling a high to be honest i feel like i'm feeling behind i think i took a lot of puffs and it's still it's still to the tippy top [Music] yeah i like this a lot goodie kind thank you i never knew my limit and i didn't know there was like a limit when i first started smoking cannabis and i would like green out i greened out like about two to three times before and i didn't know anything about cbd or delta eight and delta a is really good for nausea so if you're prone to green and out if you don't know what green and now means it's like basically overdosing on thc but you get sick like you your stomach feels sick you get nauseous i feel like if you were to smoke this like in between hits or just like smoke a few puffs before you smoke thc then it will help a lot with um that nausea feeling oh no i'm not trying to sound like a scientist but these are just conclusions theories

cat Cheers fam later peace-out much love and respect", "muwgyWEYHKk": "oh wrong pocket [Music] wait hold up hold up wrong wrong side boys and we got [Music] the pineapple express let's get it oh that is beautiful dude oh my goodness i love this colorway oh that's looking nice yo what is going on g fam welcome back to another video by your boy sebi g guys i got a new pod system for you guys this company right here is called left coast extracts i know a lot of you guys have heard about them because i constantly get them in my comments yo sebi have you tried left coast extracts have you tried left coast extracts and i i have never tried left coast extract so i took it upon myself to try them all right guys so you guys are probably like yo i thought you quit this lit bro what happened your last two videos with the new normal and now you got left coast extracts what's going on so guys i feel like the market right now it just doesn't have enough live resin companies that are making cartridges so it's not i have nothing to review for you guys so what i've been doing is really really doing some research and trying to see okay which distillate cartridges out there are really really freaking good and are really a reputable brand that makes really really clean distillate so i hit up some of my friends some of my homies that are in the cannabis industry and they've told me that left coast extracts has some really really high quality distillate okay so i was like you know what let me go ahead and try them out so i'm gonna go ahead and take the first hit of this because i feel like i've just been talking too much i haven't tried it out so this is gonna be my first ever reaction to this brand okay we got the pineapple express you guys know me pineapple express is one of my favorite strains of all time so let's go in cheers everyone oh my goodness yo that's clean literally not even cutting anything out that is so freaking clean that taste and the taste just hits you right the first hit you don't even have to wake up the coil but i'm gonna go in on number two because this thing tastes fine let me show you guys life oh yeah yo this is this is the wave bro this is good but this is oh my gosh like dude if you guys know me i've been rocking with distillates since the beginning of this channel since before i even started youtube and a lot of people hate on this other card she's like oh quit smoke and dislike and i even i said it before but the thing is guys like all right in the beginning of the game when distiller first started there's like there are so many companies out there making this product and i felt like you know me only sticking to those companies really didn't leave me room to try other companies such as left coast extracts and then now that i'm trying these other companies i'm actually branching out it's actually opening my mind and like just letting me know yo dude there's actually way better distillate than the normal stuff you usually vape like raw garden and stizzy and things like that so just you know this coming from me men really branch out and try different things because this thing right here guys i really didn't have high expectations for it i'm not gonna lie but you know after after what people told me that it's really really clean i feel like i heard that so many times and i just had to try it for myself and now that i'm hitting it this thing actually tastes really freaking good yeah that is super clean dude so after the first initial reaction hits dude though this is actually really really clean i can tell you because i have not been coughing i haven't even had the sensation to cough once just when i rip it really really fat and you know you get that sensation to cough with the really big cloud that's about it but honestly this thing tastes super spot-on with the pineapple express and it just tastes clean and pure all the way through so one thing that i wanted to talk to you guys about this device that's really really dope in my opinion is so you know there's so many companies that are just competing against each other nowadays and they're just like rivals to each other right no one's really trying to help we look out for the main person which is the consumer which is the consumer just like me just like you right so what they did they said you know yeah you might have to buy your own battery but if you really don't want to buy your own battery it's all good we still want you guys to try our pods and they they look they were like okay what's one of the biggest brands out there right now that most people have which is stizzy so what they did boys what they did is they made their pods stizzy compatible look at this all right stick it on your stizzy if you want to take fatter rips whatever the case is like this dizzy big peep this there you go they they took it upon themselves to be like you're really really looking after the community because you guys know everyone's you have those individuals that don't really mind buying another cartridge i mean another battery me personally i own like 500 batteries i don't mind buying another battery but you do have those small percentage of consumers are like you know what bro i already have one battery i want to stick with this brand of the battery and you know whatever the case is which is cool but left coast extracts man you know they they're like they're just thinking ahead of the game they're thinking ahead of the game and they're like yo you could put stizzy pods on this one you could put the left coast track pods on this one if you want to try our pause on a stizzy battery you know you could do that too you can mix and match and have so much variety and i feel like that's good man because they really really are looking out for the consumer and that is something that actually caught my attention right away i didn't really notice that that they were compatible with sizzy up until i read the box so i'm gonna go in for another hit yo cheers [Music] personally though i think that this battery is way doper than this disney not trying to bash dizzy i love sizzy you guys know sizzy's one of my favorite companies but the colorways guys the colorways that you're just spot on bro like i like red and i like you know i don't like it to look so basic i do kind of like to have some flair in my product especially when it's something that i use every day you know people look at your stuff and they're like yo yo what is that you look at this and you're like yo that's pretty dope it looks kind of it looks like someone actually put some design into it rather than just slapping a color onto it okay so talking i like i can't even stop hitting this bro this is like my sixth or seventh hit yo cheers you know i had to hit a blinker one time that did not taste burnt at all which is actually pretty astonishing man because usually when i take a blinker off of a pod system you can really really taste like the burntness now that i'm looking at the oil on this guys this thing is super clear like usually i don't even look at the oil anymore because i felt like you know at first when i first started looking at pods i used to base it just off of the color but now you know as a as someone who's been doing this for years you kind of have to know that not all oils that are super super clear are going to be good and not all not all oils that are dark are going to be super super bad it just depends on the way that the company manufactures it and in my opinion for some distillate you always really really want to go for some clean clean clean distillate because in my opinion from the clear the distillate the better that's what that's the way that i see it when it comes to this you don't want some really really dark stuff the clearer the better and um yeah man this thing is hitting on so many freaking different levels i also make wax just like syringes if you want to refill your paws and they also sell diamonds which i have some myself maybe i'll make a video on those because dude i've seen them i haven't tried them y'all yet i have them sitting in my fridge because i've just been waiting for the right moment and i feel like i have to make a video on those because man i've heard nothing but good things alright guys so i'm gonna take another blinker and just pretty much tell you guys the overall experience of what what i feel like you know this pod system is so cheers yeah that's good that is so good dude like i just love that it doesn't give me the sensation of cough i feel like i can literally hit take this hit after hit after hit and not be dying the high that i'm getting off of this is i think pineapple express is a hybrid if i'm not mistaken i am getting that hybrid sensation it's not like a couch lock and it's not like a sativa it's kind of in the middle i do feel faded but i do feel like i have like i'm kind of i feel light dude i feel like i could float around right now that's how good i'm feeling right so the overall quality man like i'm saying i love the fact that they made these stizzy compatible like me personally i really don't mind buying a proprietary battery like i said i feel like proprietary batteries are really do the job and you know they do what they're supposed to do which is burn the the company's oil at their specific temperature because everyone's oil burns at a different rate everyone knows what their strain um you know burning rate is so that's why i usually go for the proprietary better but if you guys don't want to go that route and still want to try the left coast extracts you know you could always use a stizzy battery so with that being said guys i would definitely give this a 9 out of 10 man i don't know i don't know what's not what's holding me back from giving it a 10 out of 10 maybe the fact that it's desolate you know but yeah i don't know i just feel like i want to give it a 10 out of 10 but you nothing nothing in the world is perfect so we're going to leave it at 9 out of 10 and with that being said guys we're shutting out the video here if you guys enjoyed today's video do me a favor hit that like hit those comments and most importantly hit that subscribe alright have a nice day", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you want to see more videos like this subscribe and hit the like and you will see more videos

review of the herba x three-in-one vaporizer before we get started I would like to thank the guys at Arras tech for sending out the herb bags and for sponsoring this review if you'd like to learn more about their various products please visit Arras tech shop calm now let's see what comes in the box with the herb X I've got a nice little pull apart sleeve a Preiser box we have the velvet case inside the comes with a lot of arrows tech products in the instruction manual we have an accessories packet that has the three little pods for concentrates I also have a charging cable cleaning brush a packing tool and the urbe X paper Iser itself along with an additional replacement washer I really like the shape and design of it it's kind of heavy it's very small and it's fully metal and looking forward to checking it out so now let's take a closer look at the era's tech one thing I really like is that curved heel of it it's pretty cool and then the controls are on the side we have the the lights the charging port and the power button or all along the side of the unit inside the metal outer frame at the top we have the mouthpiece it's fully glass mouthpiece that goes all the way down into the chamber which is ceramic with just that metal screen in between I really like that really simple design where it's straight ceramic to glass no interference there we've got the air pass in the bottom of the pretty good size ceramic chamber and then events through the side ports right there at the side of the chamber so I like that when the the airports and the mouthpiece and the chamber are all right there together at the top I always really enjoy those types of vaporizers I've got the USB charging port at the bottom there and again I really like that heel and then the vents on the side for the airports and then for the three pods that come with it there's one that's made for oils which has like a cotton bottom in it and then there's one also that's made for waxes and other concentrates which has more of like a ceramic bottom to it it's a closed bottom and then the third one is for actual but if you wanted an additional pre-packed chamber or if you want the like the smaller lower heat and that one has holes in the bottom you would definitely not want to use that for concentrates all right so now we're going to charge it up and look at the functions and features and lo and behold this unit came fully charged so it went straight to green but if it wasn't charged it would flash red if it was on a low charge and it would flash blue on a medium charge until it was fully charged and then it would be a solid green but our device has already charged up so we're gonna go ahead and jump right into the functions and features super super simple device here five clicks turn it on one click to cycle through the five different temperature settings which is really nice it just simple one-click there's no need for three clicks it seems like and then it stays flashing until it gets to the heat and then it's a solid green color and then simply five clicks to cut it off easy peasy [Music] [Music] so you figured out how to use it it wasn't very hard so now we're going to go ahead and grind up some cannabis and check it out this is always my favorite part of the reviews and favorite part of my job of all time actually testing all these great devices so we're going to load it up I really like the chamber on this too it's got a pretty good sized chamber considering that the device itself is so small so I really like that it's like it's all business I also like the fact that it heats up really quickly it seems like it's less than a minute it's all the way up to the highest temperature which is by the way 435 degrees and it's 375 at the lowest temperature and then there's the three different temperature settings in between I'm going to be testing the herb of both with the glass optional bubbler and without it and a lot of times when I use these bubblers I expect it to defuse the hits and not get very big hits but I was actually able to get pretty good sized hits even with a bubbler here so I have enjoyed that I really like this configuration of vaporizers as I said before when everything is so compact and tight right at the top of the vaporizer I was able to get good hits all the way up to the end of this with both the vaporizer attachment and without so kudos on the performance there as far as the taste and the puffs go but now we're going to take a look at the actual vaporization job or how it did it vaporizing the actual cannabis inside there and you can see there was a little bit of greenness there I'd say got about 80% good a good job there not great okay listen pros and cons it's got that ceramic chamber and glass tip that I like so much compact durable sleek design it's super easy to use it's got those five temperature settings from 375 to 435 it works for wax on oils and concentrates and it only cost $69 a good entry-level cons are you had that little unevenness on the vaporization of the cannabis as far as being even across the board overall I still think it's a really really good entry-level vaporizer I'm giving it four stars again I'd like to thank the guys at Arras for sending out the urbex if you'd like to learn more about their various amounts of products please check out

made just for you this is matt from ruff house studios thank you for watching [Music] you", "NF5b85T5PPo": "hey this is Jason with valve apes this episode I'll be going over the CBD products that I've used in the past I used currently some of the false misconceptions out about CBD and what to look for [Music] all right so when I first started when I first heard about CBD I was kind of confused on it it is legal in all 50 states it is it comes from the hemp plant so you have full spectrum and you have isolate if you get drug tested at a job you want to stick with isolate but some that our full spectrum still have zero percent THC in them in our lab tested like the koi products here I do get drug tested so I wanted to make sure that I don't have any THC in my system and that's kind of why I stayed away from it for so long because I was scared you know if I lost my job that I mean it wouldn't matter if I had anxiety or not that definitely caused a lot more anxiety so just some of the stuff that we have when I first started I went to a place and they gave me a little vape pen that this guy attached to and I think it was 25 milligram juice and I'd really didn't even couldn't even tell was not impressed I would not recommend using a vape pen like this so with this I used to tell it was empty and then wasn't even to go back to it and then I saw that people were actually using regulated mods this is a smock or smoke mag mod wood 225 watts and so all I do is I'll get a 0 milligrams juice till it about 3/4 of the way up or half and then fill the rest of it up one of my droppers of CBD oil i started using this so to begin with its him pellucid it's made for the vape it says vape drip on it this is 500 milligram I started at a hundred then went to 250 then I had a 500 I've used the 500 milligram two or three times this is probably my third bottle so I've been using this stuff for a while but it does work as far as vaping it I've learned that it helps relieve anxiety quicker then under the tongue well if you put a drop under the tongue but it doesn't last as long then eating like an edible or doing a drop under the tongue but it's it's what I like if you're gonna go under the tongue though I would recommend koi Naturals this is a thousand milligram most of these are scented or have a flavor already added to them this here is orange I tried a couple of them and orange is definitely the best like I said with this one you're gonna want to add something to it the hip in polluted because it tastes like you're chewing on dirt basically or just grab like a plant and putting your mouth start chewing on it that's what it tastes like so you want to mix it with one of your whatever you like is a juice flavor mix it with it I just get 2-0 milligram yeah it's it's still expensive but it the flavor really matters if you're going to be using it a lot right now I'm using the 500 milligram koi this is unscented and flavored and I've been mixing it with the air factory berry rush but I've tried a bunch of different flavors must of my like every one that I bought I liked enough to put back in my tank but air factor he's really good and it mixes really well I found that the hemp Lucid you can see how like gummy that is you want to definitely shake that up before you put it in and you want to mix it almost immediately then kind of roll it around in the tank just give it a slow mixes up pretty well with the cuy you don't have to do that as much it is it's more of a more of a liquidy it's not as thick as the other one but it's the same milligram zero THC lab tested you don't have to worry about it showing up on a piss test and you're not getting high from this this is this you can function normally I don't think you can know you can't overdose on this it just you just take a really good nap it relieves anxiety it helps with pain I've been I'm 40 now so I've been getting joint pain and just everyday mild arthritis it helps with all that for to be honest it really does and at first when I got my regulated mod I thought you know maybe this is placebo effect maybe I'm just thinking that it's it's helping so it is which even if that was I'm good with the it's helping me but I got one point where I was hit I hit it just a bunch a bunch of times in a row because I was trying to do a competition was somebody who was using zero milligram and I forgot that I had Z but CBD oil in mind and I was trying to take the longest hit that I could take with it and after that I was like just really chilled out I was like okay so this definitely works it's not placebo it's not something I'm just telling my telling myself that hey I'm good on the anxiety now and you know whatever it it really does work so after going through all these so far I would recommend if you'd like to vape to go with the koi CBD but they have different kinds so like this Naturals it's a thousand milligrams is not made to go in a vape it's this is made to go under the tongue which you know it might work in a vape but I looked on the website and they didn't say anything about vaping at all but it looks nearly the same consistency as the other one so I don't know it might even work but I haven't tried it yet so I wouldn't recommend it but the ones that they do have that are made for vaping oh yeah there you go see this one it says flavorless that's what I would go with I would go with the flavorless and then you add your flavor to it I've seen some pretty cool things out there that looks like it's kind of made for this they have dual tanks which is basically a regular tank and then split right down the middle um it's got a coil on each side you could put your CBD oil on one side and your flavor and the other and hit them both at the same time so that seems pretty cool but yes so far this is really really helped me with anxiety I've had a lot of pretty major life issues come up life events come up and these have helped out a lot and I recommend them to anybody that's dealing with anxiety or pain or you just want to try an alternative to like xanax or try alternative to pain pills this has been really amazing and I
