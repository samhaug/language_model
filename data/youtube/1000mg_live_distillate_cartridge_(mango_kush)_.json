{"7KDXXoIL28Y": "[Music] what's going on guys my name is Jeff Austin is popcorn welcome back to my channel if you've been here already if you're new make sure you subscribe got a lot of different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want to see in the future

figured I'd do a little review I'll just be my first one that I've really done but we just got done shopping at the new Terrapin station the grand open on Mississippi here in Denver and as we were walking out we ended up seeing the little table for sphere X okay they have a they set up distillate cartridges one of the good things about it is that he were about this that he was shown is it's got five separate holes down at the bottom which allow you to it actually gives you a bigger hit show you right now it's very smooth to hit there's no button to turn it on you just charge it and you just go so the distillates we got today we got a mango Kush vape this is what it looks like the 500 milligram and what it says or what he was saying is that they reintroduced terpenes into it so you get most of the you know a bigger bang for your buck stuff like this the mango cush is a hybrid and as you can tell I'll show you what a big root looks like so this think it's pretty strong it's smooth if you get a chance to check it out it's spheric s-- no button batteries cartridges are easy there's no refill so alright see boy hey man y'all have a good one", "Q3VgotWDLhM": "hi guys what's good welcome back with another video today we're gonna be reviewing Lions breath take myself up of mango crush not the first one I've had I've had I've had Gorilla Glue just didn't review that one so right here I have this gorilla oh wait mango push nicest walk and here I have this aspire battery so we're gonna be hitting this cart review on the cart and how it tastes and let me tell you guys I've had this part for a while so I know how it tastes already it hit strong [ __ ] I actually need water shield back so let me open this my mouth was ever joy I'm not taking no ten second hit off this [ __ ] because I know this [ __ ] it's hard so I'm have to put it on the green this is a five-second Alexa set a timer for five seconds five seconds starting now [Music] ten seconds but I truly think Alexa [ __ ] me over I do think that was more than five seconds Oh Alexa set a timer for ten seconds ten seconds starting now [Music] [Music] that's gonna be a frigerator view that was that was a pretty good car I would recommend it I don't know why this one this one's not hurting my throat because this one the gorilla clue when I would hit this one pretty hard it would hurt my throat and don't know what but this one doesn't not hurt my throat so hybrid mango cush totally recommend you guys go get yourself one from your local vendor it's got 41 point eighty ninety see how much does this one have forty point 17 so this one's higher tastier than that one 88 she is 40 100 point 89 90 G it's thirty one point seventy one totally makes sense total can eighty four point forty eight eighty four point 56 totally confuse well that's gonna be it for today's video guys see you guys on the next video god knows what it is but I don't", "whx9ytKios8": "oh hi i didn't see you there [Music] what is going on people my name is chillady back at you with another dope ass video and in today's video though it is nothing like what you thought it was going to be it's interesting it's new not really it's okay anyway today we're going to be talking about the hard truths and negative side effects of delta a yes that is right so as you guys know i have made two videos over delta eight i made an edible video which if you haven't seen go check it out it's awesome and then i made a video just talking about delta 8 the carts those are my two most popular now i don't want to be known as the delta 8 guy but i've tried to get that bag though there hasn't been a whole lot of research done on it and now i've done more research on it myself i've had time to you know use it whatever um and i want to talk about the hard truths now we're going to spark an actual joint of weed of marijuana so cheers boys so the first thing on my list delta a is similar to delta 9 which delta 9 is thc that we smoke the cannabis and the only dif real difference is that literally the chain effect of the cannabis or the chain number 9 or something like that t-god can pull it up delta 8 tetrahydrocannabinol has a lower psychotropic potency than its close cousin delta 9 thc it is known to connect to both our cb1 and cb2 receptors well so they're very similar delta 8 is being discovered as an alternative to 9 since it produces a less intense gentle enjoyable and manageable high when compared well in the aspects of healing and stuff like that but for delta eight even though you can federally buy it it doesn't get you as high as regular weed does you still fail a drug test so like that's pointless wouldn't you rather just smoke delta nine now i know for some people failing a drug test is a really big deal you know what i mean man i had to change my hair i was over here looking like a 13 year old emo kid you can't accept me at my worst you don't deserve me on my back you're still okay with failing a drug test but buying delta eight online why are you choosing that over delta nine you know i would much rather smoke regular weed than fail a drug test over that all right the second thing now if you watch my delta edible video you'll know that at the end of the video i was smoking a joint outside we're gonna i also did a 1500 milligram edible challenge delta 9 thc and i was not nearly as high as i was off of just 75 milligrams of delton delta 8. i mean i was uncomfortable i was tired i didn't want to do anything i got nothing done that day i just was like done i was like all i want to do is sit here and melt on the couch don't ever fit into the quote or the stereotype that you don't do anything but you need to do more when you're smoking that way people know first it was fine i was relaxed but then after like two hours i was like oh man i was like this is terrible all i want to do is like go to sleep i gave these edibles to a couple co-workers they all said that they were just like super relaxed off one but then i gave them two and they were like oh man it's too much my girlfriend could only one she ate one went to work and was like [ __ ] up she said it was terrible she would never do it again if you want to be lazy and like you want to do nothing all day and you just want to sleep uh i definitely recommend it it would be helpful if like at night on to the next one so the next one is the dab pins you can buy all this stuff online okay this is federally legal so just so you know like i'll put the link again in the description i wish they'd come and [ __ ] uh sponsor me man so i noticed though because i i had used two two dab cards i smoked two of them but first of all the price is ridiculous i mean it's like 35 40 and you gotta wait for it and that kind of sucks that [ __ ] was harsh look look look at me moss that [ __ ] was harsh okay like it really like i wouldn't even blow it out my nose and it would hurt my nose which is crazy and like it would make me always cough and it was like a anybody that i let hit it anybody anybody bro they would [ __ ] cough their ass off like people that smoke like what the [ __ ] it's like a really big rush of like this big body high like just right away and it was weird and then sometimes i wouldn't get high at all like one minute i'd be really high the next i wouldn't it's supposed to have really a non-psychoactive effect that's what makes it different from delta nine um i don't know i don't know if that's really true though to be real honestly that brings me on to the next thing is that it has a pretty bad stigma people for some reason thought think it's like that synthetic weed that spice that [ __ ] back when we were like young i can't believe anybody smoked that [ __ ] i did i will be honest i'll if you guys want to do a story time about that it is hemp it is from him it is hun no there's it is not that [ __ ] but it has a bad stigma i mean it's definitely not that spicy [ __ ] though for sure so that brings me to my last point okay so they're already trying to ban it like they're i don't know when they're voting i think they're voting in like november or december somebody told me in the comments it's like to me it's not you know to me it's not fake weed but i think it's still a little sketchy you know it still has a lot of positive benefits as well though and so i'm thinking if you had seven likes on this video if we get seven likes okay you guys have been [ __ ] killing it bro look look you guys been killing it all right i appreciate all y'all for real we're getting more subscribers i'm trying to hit 50 by let's see what is it september i'm trying to hit 50 at least by the end of october hopefully yeah let's try to do that all right let's get 50 subs bro seven likes we will do a positive review because there are positive things about it i know that i've said that the negatives of it but that's from my personal experience from me trying man let's finish this [ __ ] joint holy [ __ ] [Music] so now i've looked and i found a lot of positive things so hit that seven uh hit that seven light goal boy and we will do another review yeah man that's all i got to say

got back from the dispensary on Hayes dispensary it's um San Jose it's pretty good [ __ ] pretty good [ __ ] um they got I normally go to Garden of Eden and Hayward California but since I relocated to the South Bay I found a new place called Hayes and I'm paying $10 more for the product I want but I'm getting a full gram more of it so that's what's up I getting ripped off as much anymore so yeah Wednesday's Wednesday's antebellum Sundays at Hayes you get it that's a cool you get 25% off oil evade oil pens cartridges whatnot so uh it's a pretty cool bag they gave me this is sublime true flavor

favorite sentence club are the only two I've tried but uh this one tastes so much better than mango flavor hmm I need to go to relax get you high okay so yeah that's enough this box usually truth now the mouthpiece is plastic and it's all good I mean the ones I used to get were glad her you know glass and metal look really nice called diamond line cartridges yeah maybe that's why I had to pay so much for only a half grand anyway so Oh smells so good it's ridiculous like only thing about this [ __ ] I love marijuana flower you know I love the actual flower of marijuana but so every time I smoke the blood or something I love it but it's just not like this and my house go stink no more anyways I'm probably gonna take a hit of this and I'm gonna be cuffing so much probably maybe I won't but yeah so let's take a rip can't even see the smoke I have a technique where I'm holding it in still but I'm really breathing at the same time is sleek weird because you know how they say holding it is doesn't who doesn't make much difference maybe you're right maybe you're not so yeah yeah you know how to get more like but I'm all covering myself like there's people around yeah I was good didn't [ __ ] my throat like it normally does so that's good now when it [ __ ] with your throat like you're about to cough but you're not necessarily unless you wanna cop is that what they call sloshing in lungs cuz it lightweight is uncomfortable I like it but it's like oh no unless I'm mistaken on what you are talking about when it says massaging your lungs but you notice we're gonna take another rib and that's what happens when you just blow it out right away I don't know something about blowing it out right away right right after you did it I know you're not wasting it but I just I get this feeling of waste I'm saying beast anyways I want to marijuana products are legal now and Kelly so for all my family members who were born in the fifties they don't approve of my videos reviewing marriage you wanna I mean you guys got to get over it I mean I don't not drugs okay I mean if this is a drug so without the Paul so whatever so guys that was my review if you're in San Jose I highly

Wednesdays and Sundays go there for 25% off your cartridges him or other baked products for that matter anyways I appreciate y'all watching if anyone watched or whoever watches in the future I love you guys and I'm yeah man see you guys soon", "NYweYsi0x2E": "everyone Pope all's well so recently there's been some negativity when it comes to vaping and buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time face", "BL60ox4I_Kw": "[Music] ladies and gentlemen it is time it is time that you found out if the new cartridge brand that you purchased is a real company or just a package supplier [Music] so this information comes to us through DAP connection comm none of these are of my own investigation unfortunately so thanks to those guys who have no idea I'm doing this so forgive me and I thought it would have been a good idea it was too good of information and just kind of let go and doing my research on these guys that seems like it's pretty legit info but before we get started consider subscribing and punch that like button in the face if you end up staying or half of the video at least so that a deal deal okay so I'm not sure exactly how to do this [Music] you know what I'm just gonna the bran heads roll well I do a little ranting stay hydrated look I'll tell you right now that I've tried spotting faked packaging and it's always like the Mandela effect sometimes you're just like one comma away from being right and one comma is too big to risk a dead cart so I'm happy that these social medias are getting ahold of testing and sharing the information that we need plus a lot of companies are putting QR codes on packaging as well so you can see that they're legit also most legit dispensaries are posting QR codes of their license so you can check to see if those legit yourself as well the bottom line here is that anyone can make counterfeit carts anyone can make counterfeit packaging it's our moral compass that's the problem why are we gonna be lured in to buy something just because there's like a cute 4/20 nurse in front of us and we don't want to look poor there needs to be a change in the system to help professionals and everyday users identify and trust the brands no one seems to own these packaging companies like Mario karts or dank vapes the trail always seems to end somewhere in China it's too bad because there's a lot of great growers out there who make top-quality stuff if you want to feel safe and you want to be able to trust your purchase then I wouldn't buy from anywhere that isn't regulated I'm seeing way too many people unaware of information that's out there I seen the comes below that people just want to learn and grow and then comes another person it makes fun of them for how little they know this is a time for justice a time for parler everyone should be on the same level of information when it comes to legitimacy so as a bonus I'm gonna show you a few brands that pass testing now I'm not here to say that any of these are safe but they did pass phase 3 testing so do your research and what I mean by research is you know go to the brands website they should have authorized retailer on there and is that place that you got your cart from is it on their authorized retailer list and if not email them or message them on IG you know that's what I did with this cart you know this is a the Jade cart and you know I asked them if you know I got it from ie twin palms and the Inland Empire it's it's definitely a little cheap place to go but you know I mean I'm just that places license you know Jade Jade is licensed too so it's just like I mean everything's everything smells like like like a legit brand you know so plus these insights that display test results helps as well but what if research on your particular brand hasn't been posted yet just because it's a new brand doesn't mean that it's not legit you're gonna start seeing new brands popping up in the next few years a lot of older dealers are gonna start going legit with newly formulated newly tested and labeled content I want to make a video on what to look for when you visit these regulated dispensaries I'll have one coming soon but until then I hope this video was helpful things seem to be getting bitter and more

another favor if you'll like and subscribe this video and stick around to the end i will tell you how you can win yourself a brand new vape cart from vapeful supply on christmas day flavor of your choice okay if you'll go to maplesupply.com you can actually look on there and figure out what flavors you want and you'll also notice that if you use code whatever they are you can get it that's just 25 off um they're already you know 29.99 cards that they have the this happens to be my favorite card i'm giving it away because of that on christmas day i'm pulling out of my pocket and by the way um i was supposed to get a uh order from vapor supply yesterday today sunday um i didn't get that order yesterday it's not vapor supplies faults actually ups um they claim that um uh you know the delivery's gonna be arriving late so i guess i'm gonna get that monday which actually saved diamond cbd i talked to you previously about diamond cbd i my girl had ordered from them on thursday night which was thanksgiving i felt like they should have ran a skeleton crew or something on uh friday and saturday they did not um which you know which meant i didn't get my order on monday because they actually allude to the fact on their website that you get two days if you order over a hundred dollars but girls definitely ordered over a hundred dollars i felt like i should have had my order ran friday possibly got my water monday or tuesday had a couple days to do reviews on their great product um because these are good products um but again they're shipping uh just didn't get it there until late thursday night um i actually thought i was gonna get an order from make whole supply which would have put a chill brand on hold for a couple days um you know i felt like if they hadn't got it there on tuesday i would have had a chance to get i've got about eight or nine cards from them so and i really like their brand so i'm going to check them out you know my whole thing is with diamond cbd is i'm going to put a link for them down in the bottom because they've got really good products they're shipping about three to seven days i didn't appreciate the fact that they alluded to the fact that two days however um they do have a good product but you know the thing is with that is like don't don't spend forty thousand dollars on a car bro and then ten thousand dollars in your house you know i mean come on let's let's let's be honest uh this is a really good product um talk about the mango kush again like the previous two i i did a banana kush uh first and then i did um i think apple fritter yesterday and i don't know what they're doing with these cards man i don't know what the difference is in these cards and others they pull supply is my favorite part they're the most potent and they have a really good flavors in theirs um but again i got to give a thumbs up to uh chill brand for their flavors they have a a a lesser high it's a they eat the high eases you want in it's something that you can work with all day long um and they the thing is is when you pick this when you keep these cards up and you hit them you get the same flavor every every time it's not like when you you know you hit it sometimes what happens is you'll hit these and then two three four times you're not tasting anymore but you put it down and you pick it up and then you only really get it on the first pull that's not the case with these cards man these cards are kind of intriguing because they they uh whatever they're doing with their terpenes in here uh however they put them in or the type of terpenes they're using um these terpenes stick with you man you're this mango cush is a really nice sweet pool i would imagine that this would appeal to a lot of females you know because they like the sweet flavors if you if it doesn't produce any cough i mean these are really good cards um really light really light high not something that's going to interrupt with your work hey man you guys check out diamond cbd they're really good shipping a little bit slower that's you know than i hope you know than i wanted um but again you know if we stick on them and we get on top of them you know that customer service will go ahead and pick up you guys take a look at a car man it's a nice clean car a very good pool uh that's on my lowest setting um it's and it's freezing cold out here too so um i just turned my shop on so it's probably about 45 degrees in here right now 45.50 cause i'm a little bit chilly um but again hey man diamond cbd y'all check them out i'll put a link for them down at the bottom don't forget they pull supply go on vapor supply take a look at their flavors take a look at their tinctures and stuff um if you use code whatever you can get uh 25 off they're already on sell carts and barring that i am going to give away one of these on christmas day i'll put a link to this down in the bottom if you'll go ahead and just go down there to the link if you'll

clean it here soon if you guys have the best tips for how to clean a grinder please let me know today i'm going to be talking about a question that i really get all the time and the question in general so it can be regarded to delta 8 it can be guarded to hemp cbd whatever is is cbd just reggie is delta 8 just reggie is delta 8 flour just reggie are the effects from delta 8 pins just like reggie are the effects of the delta 8 flower the delta 8 edibles whatever is it just like a reggie feel [Music] and so i kind of want to break down what reggie is to me and then talk about what delta how delta eight thc is like and how cbd is like and then kind of get to my answer of whether i think delta eight thc in cbd is just reggie so in like my vernacular of what reggie is reggie is typically just outdoor grown very low potency marijuana like reggie is like so here in houston for example it is difficult to find like you'd have to go out of your way to go find reggie it is not just sold on the street i've never seen i've never had a dealer try to pass off reggie to me in the last five years if you're paying any type of reasonable price even like thirty dollars an eighth here in houston is still not reggie it might be some like mid but it's going to be like 15 percent thc it's not going to be traditional reggie which is like single digit thc the quality of the flour is typically like 80 stem a lot of leaf and then a little bit of flour which is a big reason why it's such a low percentage thc because a lot of times it's such a low quality flour if any flour on the stem at all and so people break down all of it and roll it all or pack all of it in a bong bowl or pipe bowl or something like that and smoke the whole thing but the percentage of thc in that substance is very small or in whatever you're hitting is very small so that is kind of my definition of reggie a lot of those older like brick weeds that were available early 2000s stuff like that and i know for a lot of people who even may be watching this video because i've lived in the country before and i've seen places where reggie is like prevalent where people are actually like day to day it's not uncommon for people to be smoking reggie and so i have to empathize with that fact i talked about in the live stream last night like the guy i bought um the delta nine flower from last year in houston has like jungle boys like seal packs in the city of houston and for reasonable reasonable prices less than you're going to find in a legal state or in terms of tax and stuff so with that being said to me reggie is just very low percentage thc bud um where most of it a lot of it's going to be stem a lot of it's going to be whatever is thrown into the pack kind of the leaves whatever but not necessarily quality buds so that leads me to what is delta 8 thc flour and cbd flour so cbd flour hemp flour is just obviously people say the cousin of marijuana but less than the 0.3 legal limit all that but it can be indoor grown it can be very very quality buds like the bud structure and the base of delta 8 flour is still hemp so it can be those same bud so the buds are completely they're different like for example one of the things i put into this j which i need to go ahead and pack all the way so i can light it let me find something here we go this plug is always here but let me show you this bud for example after i get this pack got a lighter today so today's joint salad one of the things that i have in there is some of this blueberry cheesecake from five leaf wellness i'm gonna show you some of these buds like this is not what reggie looks like i hope you all can see that this is not what reggie looks like i'll show you this is some of our rocket fuel delta 8 flower on sale now but i'll pull out one of these buds and i did not plan this at all so i'm hoping some of these look decent but these are smaller nugs but if you look at it still like this is not what this is hand trimmed flour this is not what reggie looks like and then we can get to the effect so if we can look first looked at the quality of the buds and next we can get to the effects so i think there's a question actually yesterday in the comments somebody was asking are the delta hate pins just like the effects of smoking reggie absolutely not first off because of the things that reggie a lot of times comprised of like i talked about before which are the stems the leaves all that stuff in my experiences which have been single digit times of smoking reggie um my head hurt every single time like the quality of the smoke was just poor the taste poor the effects afterwards poor the effects during poor it's not what it's not ideal it's not what there are some people that would choose that because that's what they're used to but overall in terms of just quality of butter the exact same way that there are some people who want to choose the very cheapest beer even when they can afford nicer beers because that's what they're used to and i can understand that but that does not mean that that's the highest quality so today i have the rocket fuel mixed in with a little bit of jungle boys mixed in with this blueberry cheesecake from five leaf wellness and it's it's very very nice the smooth smoke there's nothing reggie about the smoke it's relaxing and if we're talking about the effects of cbd versus reggie if i had to choose i can concede of course that reggie will get you a little bit higher because of this the thc in there it's much more thc but in terms of the quality of smoke i'm going to choose this blueberry cheesecake over that every single time in terms of even how i'm going to feel afterwards because this is going to have me relaxed reggie is going to have my head banging this blind video i should have made a long time but this is a question we get all the time but cbd is is delta 8 flower is it just your edgy first off don't take flour the effects are better cbd flour it's more relaxing but reggie will get you higher dose eight flour i would say it depends on the delta eight flour completely because there's so many varying qualities now um but most delta eight flowers i would there's some dots eight flowers i'm like nah that [ __ ] like tastes like reggie it's ad i don't like it i've had some of them like that but overall there's options there are options out there to where the delta 8 flower is nicer than reggie and in the pins the delta 8 pin especially if it's like cannabis derived terpenes even nice smooth botanical derived terpenes still much much better high if you will than reggie and the edibles don't even compare to like the smoking effects of veggie the edibles blow that out of the water so this video will probably put across a few channels but i just want to answer this question because it's a question that's asked often and i don't see a lot of the answers on the internet so to answer your question no reggie and hemp high quality hemp reggie and high quality delta thc products don't compare in my opinion delta thc products are much more superior product they have lab testing you know where it's from um this a lot of the reggie that you get is i mean who knows what's happened to it so in my opinion delta athc is the superior product hemp cbd products quality hemp cbd products are the superior product and that's just really what i wanted to talk about in this video and i kind of wanted to break down why i think so because of the quality of smoke because of the effects that i personally have been left with afterwards and from what i know about reggie i am not a current modern day reggie smoker maybe since the level of high grade cannabis has gone up maybe the bottom like maybe what reggie is now is like 10 thc 10 to 15 thc is now considered reggie that might be the case and i'm just out of the loop in the in the reggie market and that easily could be the case because i just live out in ohio and it was a much higher chance you're going to find some emoji out there than when you're in houston because in houston if somebody sold me reggie i would judge that character because it's like you can find good stuff for such a good price why like you're just being greedy bro like you're actually just being greedy like if you're out in the country or something like that it's like all right that's what the dealer could find this the week this week or whatever for this batch this p whatever he gets but in houston i'd just be like dude could've just been honest with me you're gonna come to me as a man but instead you tried to pass this off as your guest and i don't appreciate it and then in houston if you kind of look at just simple supply and demand principles here in houston we have a city of in the whole metroplex probably four and a half million there's a lot of weed dealers if i had to guess my apartment complex probably has three two to three you know so with that type of economy going with such a large supply of cannabis the price stays pretty steady and pretty steadily low and so if you lose your clientele you could lose them forever because there's so many options such a large supply high demand but the the demand and the supply they match each other pretty good i don't know it's people houston it's like i just can't find it bro no you can find it you haven't asked anybody i know i've just gone off a tangent on this i'm just smoking just hanging out with you guys i am done talking about the reggie and him delta 8 kind of debate i'm kind of just freestyling at this point i'm not really freestyling i did have a couple things i wanted to plan on talking about but as i smoke some more of this this rocket fuel um blueberry cheesecake and jungle voice mixed together i'm it gets harder and harder to stay on track if you will that's probably why it'd be better when sergio comes back because it'll be easier for the videos to kind of stay on track you know i just kind of just kind of just go with the flow you know however i feel that day i kind of just sit out there you know i'll be smoking i'll watch uh i'll watch some [ __ ] i might be on youtube on netflix something i'll be editing and i'd be like you know what now this [ __ ] ain't sitting right at me today oh my bad this [ __ ] is inviting me today and i'll be like and i'll get up immediately and then i'll come in here and that's why like i'm rolling up while i'm on camera with you guys like the shit's organic you know i wasn't planning to talk about the last couple episodes i did you know what i just looked in here saw the lay of the land you know you have a look at a room from a different angle nah it looks different here today or then you sit here you check that you turn the light off i don't know if you guys like artists you like change the lighting a little bit you said a different mood in that hell you know and the angles change and you're like no i have a different type of inspiration but you're in the same space maybe i don't understand what i'm saying but it's kind of just how i feel about stuff it's just you can even with how i've been just combining the thc and cbd and delta 8 products and stuff like that you know like you can just take stuff from different angles and then you can inspire new art but you can kind of stay within the confines of what you've already been doing i don't know if that makes sense but for anybody who's aspiring to grow as a youtuber as an artist finding multiple ways to be creative within the same space with what like the same confines is always a good way to go as an artist appreciate you guys tuning in we are taking pre-orders of 50 milligram edibles they're a very good price if you're interested please hit us up legally lifted tx on instagram and then i'll put the email below don't feel like reciting it try to look at your room from a different angle sometimes maybe you'll get some inspiration appreciate what the [ __ ] i'm just trying to do a little outro and appreciate you guys tuning in with me it's been another episode of cbd hemp library or wherever else this video might be found come back again probably tomorrow for another video maybe even tonight because you never know you're just dropping videos so appreciate it peace [Music]", "-cTVj0tqW9k": "i'm not george working used to vacation products and you're under the age of two and go ahead and get out of here right now so i am currently walking to where i would like to smoke uh today i'm gonna be smoking a marlboro red cigarette and i'm gonna be taking the filter off i'm gonna be trying a filtered cigarette unfiltered so i thought that might be an interesting video so i'm just gonna go find a smoke spot a little bit quiet a little bit of a quieter place it's not very quiet right here um and then i will uh start uh taking the filter off and smoking you know what i'm saying so uh hell yeah update y'all um this spot not very good it's too noisy i do like having a little bit of quiet in my spots so i think i'm gonna go to the typical park where i uh smoke and uh smoke there instead i was thinking i might try to find a new spot today to record but i think i'm gonna be finding a uh new spot you know what i'm saying so i will update y'all when i'm there you know what i'm saying uh you know what i'm saying yes sir yes sir um but yeah i'm gonna go there and uh then i'm gonna record yes sir so i'm finally here i'm finally at the little bench you know what i'm saying uh finally here uh i finally made it to the smoke spot so i think i'm gonna go ahead and get the video started let's see i'm gonna go ahead and put my little vlog stick down you know what i'm saying let's get that and uh put that up a bit you know what i'm saying and there we go all right all good for the video and everything alrighty see ya uh today i'm going to be taking the filter off of a cigarette and trying to smoke it so i'm using a marlboro southern cut today i'm going to be doing that and i'm just going to go ahead and just go ahead and get that filter off let's go ahead and do that let's just get that filter off there we go there we go got that filter off and there's a little bit of tobacco in there but there ain't too much just uh put that over there you know what i'm saying and i'm just gonna do a little bit get some of the get some of the stuff out so i don't really get too much in my mouth and uh yeah i think i'm gonna go ahead and try it let's uh yeah hey yeah definitely problem with these is that there's gonna be tobacco in my mouth but there's nothing i can do about that i might honestly smoke it like it actually is probably a bad idea but yeah i'm gonna go ahead and get this lit up and uh try it taking a filter off of a cigarette let's try it let's see how it is all right all right it's not too bad definitely definitely much rougher than i'm used to i got to be completely honest this is way rougher than i'm used to but that really isn't an issue because as said no filter it's to be expected it's very rough but you can definitely get the taste a lot better i've never tasted an unfiltered uh southern cut and honestly i think this should be really really good as an unfiltered cigarette it's definitely more rough than the lucky reds i assume simply because these are designed to be used with filters whereas the lucky strike reds are not designed to be used with filters but they are much much much rougher but honestly these are really good i am really honestly enjoying these this is um it is a good smoke good smoke all the way and as you can tell no filter so definitely definitely a good smoke yeah got a little tobacco in my mouth that's the problem with these unfiltered i'd be trying to pull as lightly as possible but it doesn't really matter i always be getting tobacco in my mouth anyway so but yeah that is really really rough that's like taking a big bong hit man that is a rough that is a rough cigarette but honestly no complaints i think i'm going to be smoking this whole thing you know what i'm saying i'm getting pretty buzzed i'm already seeing how much the filter cuts out on your buzz because i smoked a cigarette right before i left so usually i wouldn't expect to be buzzed and i haven't gotten a buzz today but i'm getting decently buzzed you know what i'm saying this is kind of crazy i'm not expecting this at all just keeps getting rougher and rougher man man that just keeps getting rougher this is really good though and you can definitely taste the taste it's a lot more sweet without the filter actually is it it's a lot more sour without the filter i would actually say it's a lot more sour um and i think it's because of the roughness the roughness really sours it up so i honestly i do prefer i do prefer the marble southern cut with the filter but honestly without the filter it's not it's not too bad it's not too bad man that's good cannot complain in the least you know what i'm saying oh man i can't believe it though that smoke spot i tried to go to it just wasn't open there was so much noise uh there are bugs all over the ground i was like i'm not sitting here there's sand spiders everywhere i was like i'm not getting no sand spider on me so i had to i had to i had to come over here you know what i'm saying a bit of a longer walk but it was worth it pick myself up some water on the way don't have that out right now i wish i wish i did but uh yeah you know what i'm saying i think i'm honestly just going to take one more hit because this is so rough this is such a rough cigar and i'm expecting this next hit to be the one that's going to kill me definitely a very very rough cigarette but honestly really really good honestly if you're looking for a buzz if you're trying to get a buzz or something like that you haven't been able to get a buzz lately take off the filter off of your cigarette it might honestly help a little bit and uh it was definitely good now of course it's not as healthy for sure um that's pretty bad for you getting all the tar directly into your lungs but really really no complaints you know what i'm saying um but

says they seized THC products with a street value of 1.5 million dollars focus was on making money sheriff Beth says two brothers 20 year old Tyler Huff Heinz and 23 year old Jacob hoppings are both facing multiple charges for illegal drug violations that's just the tip of the iceberg in this operation search warrant served at the residences last week led investigators to find more than 31,000 illegal THC vape cartridges almost 100 thousand unfilled cartridges and dozens of mason jars filled with THC oil imported from California they would take a syringe and they inject it into the cartridges the sheriff says they also found guns marijuana buds cocaine pills and $60,000 cash investigators say they may never have uncovered the covert business if it weren't for a couple of parents in Waukesha who tipped them off to a THC cartridge they found with their son I asked all parents out there this is a perfect opportunity and a friendly reminder to have that conversation with your

right up to i'd say 60 70 bucks i could pick me worth it it would be low it would be well worth it batman flavor is high quality i like that i like that i do i like it what do you know about delta a thc nothing nothing nothing okay let's try it and see how you like it yeah alright yeah cool [Applause] so i know it's a big battery don't be too intimidated i gotta just press the button tastes like lemons yeah for sure and this flavor right here i believe is grape so we'll see what her thoughts are on the taste and effects oh it tastes really good actually this easy to taste easy flavor and yeah it gives you relaxedness it tastes like a legitimate car like a legitimate card yeah like an actual cart the terms of stuff that makes it smell yes yes terps give it the smell and taste okay i know that tastes really good okay tastes good smooth for sure smooth yeah so it hit smooth i mean i didn't didn't tickle my throat at all how much is it smacking you right right now i'd say at least 99 percent nine i feel like chill just very like relaxed okay ready to take on the day ready to take on the day well what would you say on a scale like of one to ten how what do you think about the cart taste nine smoothies that's pretty good nice i don't know pretty i mean they're up there if you were to buy that at let's say that dispensary right there how much you think they charge you for it they charge like 80 bucks for stuff like this yeah so if you go to the dispensary there for a point five card it's like a hundred dollars after tax yeah definitely so they're you're definitely getting taxed so with this stuff because it's hemp there's no like marijuana attacks on it so it's a lot cheaper definitely it's nice i would buy it cool right now i want to buy a cart from there you do i don't oh you don't i don't because i want to keep hitting this one right here like i'm good oh [ __ ] like 100 percent hey you see it this first time with delta 8 thc delta 8 thc hope you enjoyed the

good y'all good morning it is zoody patoot you already know back for another cannabis review on the baked boys you already know what it is if you don't definitely look into these guys definitely look these up these are the best thing on the cannabis market right now for vapes carts whatever you're looking into just for portable dabs this is freaking it uh freaking rechargeable tastes amazing better than any cart that i've i've come across personally uh it's just like taking a dab it even you know tastes like freaking mango this is what the whole box looks like and then you pop them out of the box and then another another baked bar packaging just so if you guys are getting these make sure like they are double packed and if they're not they're probably not real but these are a brand new brand new uh company uh straight from cali and uh they are just getting started so if you want to go ahead and look them up on instagram they're on instagram i don't think they have built their website yet but you know i've been talking back and forth with uh the person on there so uh definitely a good brand definitely quality quality product right here and that's what people are looking for especially in the cart game right now some people are scared of additives being being put in there it already says right here you know max strength lab tested and solvent-free to stood so uh it's got all the little markings don't throw it away you know recycle it properly it's a disposable so you know don't don't just be tossing it in the wrong or california they got big recycling laws and all that stuff so that's up to your discretion um 21 and older what is this right here probably not for pregnant women i mean just just basic stuff that goes on on cannabis products out in california but uh just guys go try one go try one because these are probably my new favorite thing in the world right now like you know i love my dabs but just having a portable portable little it's just like a freaking it's about the same size of a jewel or a uh a puff bar you know it's the same thing as a puff bar but it's just it's distillate so and they hit so freaking hard like you're just sitting here pulling it and then like when you exhale you don't even realize like you're blowing out a cloud because you barely feel it inhaling and to me that's that's how i tell if it's good distillate or not you uh it's not rough on the inhale but it's rough on the exhale and that's just a rule of thumb for all carts if you're experimenting with carts right now but you know thanks for watching y'all go get you one the baked bars bake the bar official on instagram go get into the hype you already know zooteep appreciate", "kwNe1LBbEjY": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to make kind of brownie using distillate so let's get into it [Music] all right so the ingredients that i need to make this recipe would be a quarter cup of water a half a cup of vegetable oil and two eggs what i'm going to do is i'm going to replace the vegetable oil with a half a cup of peanut butter so the first thing we need to do is make our can of butter all right to make my peanut butter i'm going to be using 1 gram of banana kush distilling so what we need to do first is loosen the oil so i'm going to get some hot water and put my discipline into that bowl and let it sit for about one to two minutes but let's get into it [Music] all right guys so while your discipline is sitting measure out your butter [Music] now add a teaspoon of lecithin [Music] and now at your discipline [Music] now i mix everything together all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put this on a pot and let it simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes so well let's get into it all right my can of butter is now done so let's start working on the brownie so the first thing we want to do is add our brownie mints i'm going to be using dark chocolate brownie mix [Music] now add your eggs [Music] add a quarter cup of water [Music] add a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] add your peanut butter [Music] now mix everything together [Music] once your mix is fully incorporated add it to a baking tree [Music] hmm [Music] hmm [Music] all right so i recommend purchasing a baking tray that have these dividers it's going to make sure that all of your brownies are the same size so just keep that in mind but now i'm going to put this in the oven so let's get into it [Music] so [Music] all right my canon brownies is now done so at this point i can eat my brownies like this if i want to however i want my brownies to be a little bit stronger so what i'm going to do is infuse some chocolate and add it to my brownies so let's get into it turn your stove on high [Music] add a pot to your stove [Music] once your water begins to boil reduce your temperature to low heat [Music] now add a bowl to your pot [Music] now this is what we call the double boiler so now what i'm going to do is add my chocolate to this bowl i'm going to be using chocolate chips but you can use regular chocolate if you want to [Music] now we're just going to wait until our chocolate begins to melt all right guys my chocolate is starting to melt so what i'm going to do to expedite the process is i'm going to get this spatula and just stir my chocolate [Music] all right guys my chocolate is completely melted so now i'm going to add some can oil to my chocolate i'm going to be using keep oil but you can use peanut butter or regular kennel oil doesn't matter but um let's get into it [Music] now i miss everything

destiny honky [ __ ] this one right here just off the bat extra-strength get the [ __ ] out of here so that that oil is just going up faster and this one and also on the bottom does not say TK on the bottom but it says so this one is a real ticket saw source at that source kid which you'll know about it all right now this one has more of a matte mouth to graduate and the oil is so thick super thick like super thick man bottom is black pop the rubber TKO official baby and this just tastes so much bud like more like bud more like actual premium oil this [ __ ] thing if you just pull it it just tastes like [ __ ] pine needles and just trash so what were you buying for cards joint and this is childproof - so because we know you're smoking oh please", "RheR15yw8GQ": "[Music] what is going on youtube it's your boy turpy turn welcome back to my awesome medical cannabis review and this one little scenery change i'm on bear at the father-in-law's figure come out here with the wife get a little bit of fresh air uh we stopped at the dispensary marine health around the center if you guys follow me on instagram you would see one of the deals that they got going on here over there right so one of the deals that they got going on there you buy yourself a strain pax pod you will get a pax error battery for free and yes it's not like the pax era pro battery that links up the bluetooth and keeps track of all your your uh pods and and stuff like that you know what i mean but uh it does it does have no mass complete control unlimited sessions uh includes okay pax error device and micro usb limit one time warranty um i do not know where my batteries are well i got this one but that's not the tax thing anyway i don't know where my other battery is i can't compare it which i want to so i'm going to pause this and i will be right back all right and just like that i am back with the pax era pro i'm going to compare to two different batteries but before we get into this i'm going to show you what else i got from the dispensary i got an eighth of flower that i already opened up it's in the carts uh purple punch that's really really fire uh indica strained and then i got this uh grapeline ricky cresco liquid live resin cartridge which i'm gonna be super excited about that because that last grapevine ricky ahead by uh mpx [ __ ] fire right and then a subscriber was telling me about the cush mints now he was saying that for me to pick up a distillate cart by grassroots called cushman's the the um the strain but they did not have cushman so i got the next best thing which is concentrating and really to be honest i would prefer concentrate over a desolate cart 100 every day okay but this is cush mint sugar by grassroots it is indica so keep your eye out for this one and this one all right so let's get back to the packs pro in the packs era so the strain i'm going to be reviewing in this one is called uh snow shark it is indica strain i have not had this one before so i do not know um like the taste of it or anything like that there's numbers obviously right all right before i open this up i am going to compare the batteries right so you open it up nice little box you put this guy open boom and there you have it now the first thing i noticed is the charging port so you got the normal c cell to the to the regular older android um the one that takes out your controller your older cell phone control or chargers you know i mean [ __ ] like that so um and then the next thing i noticed that that the actual logo right there it's like not like this one where there's glass there you can kind of like see in it you know what i mean to wear this one yeah but they're pretty much exact same size the air hole is a little bit different as you guys can see that there right the air holes um but other than that it's not a smart battery like this one i don't think it keeps track of of uh all the different pods and stuff uh it's basically you just put it in there and you vape on it you know what i mean so with that said let's go ahead and give it a try right here we go snow shark you guys push in and pull and here she comes just like that now remember without that red band right there don't smoke it so called they're not real all right like i said always it always says it on the actual cartridge itself the strained name and uh the company of the cart so i do not know if this thing even has a charge i don't know what that little that is right there um maybe it's a light i have no idea but i'm going to it just feels like it got had a little

smoke channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host tyler green today i'm back with another entry into our cbd extract review series featuring the goods chatter and wax this time it is sour apple their new flavor that they've just brought out and i wanted to take a look at it right here on the icemoke channel let's get into it sour apple is one of the ever-growing range of flavors on offer from the goods cbd over on their website over the past best part of a year i've been looking at several different flavors we've looked at some of the weed inspired flavours like og kush and girl scout cookies we've looked at some of the beverage inspired flavors like mojito and we've looked at some other newer flavors such as tropical citrus which i've really enjoyed as well today we're looking at sour apple which is a fruity entry into the products lineup this is smelling fantastic i did have a sneak peek of a smell and a dab actually last night dabbed some of the wax before i filmed this video the goods make two forms of cbd extract they are gmp certified so good manufacturing processes and they contain zero 0 thc they're broad spectrum in terms of the cbd wax and cbd isolate in terms of the cbd shatter so this is 99 cbd and this is 80 cbd with broad spectrum which means it also has other minor cannabinoids as well both of these pots of extracts have the same terpene profile so that is the sour apple profile created by the goods as part of their new range that means that this is some unique tasting extract developed specifically for this company it is not following a specific cannabis strain with this in mind it's going to be really nice for people who might not necessarily like the cannabis tastes but want the benefits of cannabidiol we're going to take a look at it let's get into it opening it up then you can see the difference between the extracts i sort of jump about as to which is my favorite form of the goods extract sometimes i prefer the wax because i like that kind of that balance of additional cannabinoids and knowing that it's in there and then sometimes if it's just for the pure flavor i like the shatter as well i see the benefit of both when it comes to cbd you can get the benefits of cbd without the other cannabinoids but the other cannabinoids help not hurt got two forms of consumption method today i've got my dab rig here and i have my lynx ember pen which is also available with the goods products over on the hemphealth website so i'm going to put some into this and we're going to taste it right about now via vaping and dabbing just before i do i want to talk to you about this smell of this extract because it is very aptly named it has the same sort of undertone as like a granny smith apple that kind of the the not the sweet side of apple the sour side of apple actually reminds me of being a kid picking apples from a tree taking them home and my mum being like you can't eat them once is that it's that sort of sour appley sort of aroma you can really smell that that is sour apples i would say that the wax smells more like sour apples than the shatter which still has the same terp profile but is kind of coming through into my nostrils in a slightly different way but both of them smell great so let's dab them and see how they taste super easy to vape the cbd extract using the lynx ember you just need to put some of your extract into the device onto the coil like so and it is ready to turn on and vape so we're going to do that right about now and then i will use some of the wax in the dabrick so what i'm going to do is i'm going to press it twice to put it in session mode and now that's going to melt down that extract and we're going to get an idea of that flavor cheers oh both very smooth and really tasty actually very clean tasting there's less to that than i was expecting as i'm exhaling it's just kind of like a a smooth lightly flavored vapour rather than a sort of turps turps turps in your mouth that is nice coming through you get sort of slight fruity notes but it's not in forms of the sweetness that i was expecting despite the name sour apple it is more kind of just just making my brain aware that there's kind of a fruity perhaps apple aroma coming through a smooth vapor exhalation like a slightly like um flavored nice flavor but slightly flavored vapor taste as you exhale i'm gonna put some into the dab rig with the 80 cbd which looks lovely by the way it looks like a hard-boiled sweet i love the color of it so we're about to dab the sour apple goods cbd wax 80 broad spectrum cannabinoid extract this is gonna be fun join me for this one and i will see you all on the other side [Music] so that was [Music] a proper dabbing experience wowzer so vape that a lovely low temperature in the dabrick as you can see [Music] with the intention of preserving as many of those turps as possible and the sour apple extract did not disappoint what i sensed in the aroma i can now taste at the back of my mouth sort of at the back roof of my mouth but again a lovely sort of exhalation of this vapor like it's not too overpowering it's in fact it's not overpowering we've added turps it's just got a nice hit to it you know which is really really nice when it comes to the cbd wax out of the two which do i prefer i'm not actually sure because they both have a nice flavor i like the broad spectrum from a consumption perspective i prefer to consume it but i recognize that the chatter is a lovely form of extract as well despite being 99 cbd iceland as opposed to the 80 i'm just going to try putting some of the wax into my links ember device it's just melting into its own vapor that that's so cool [Music] yeah the wax has got ever so slightly more of a sort of terpenes to it that could be because i used more wax in this pen than i did chatter really tasty and they're definitely getting nicer as well so that i would say that tropical citrus was one of my favorite goods flavors and now sour apple easily matches it in terms of how nice it is so yeah i really like that i will mainly consume this either in the links ember or in the poda vaporizer that i got from the hemphealth website because they make it super easy to just load in some extract and dab or vape it i've also got my dab rig out so from time to time when i want bigger hits when i want nice chunks of extract i will chuck them onto this heated up banger and vaporize them that way but overall it's a nice form of cannabis extract on the cbd side you can find this on the hemp health website with the discount code i smoke 10 which will get you 10 off effects wise obviously cbd is not psychotropic so it is not changing my mental state to make me more inebriated however it is working on my cb1 and cb2 receptors meaning that it will have potential benefits and impacts in several areas related to endocannabinoid deficiencies or specific um diseases or illnesses that i may or may not have that is the good thing about cbd is that it interacts with the same receptors as thc but has its own set of beneficial properties so really cool stuff i personally noticed becoming more alert more easily able to retain facts when i'm reading and learning and less anxious as a result of my cbd consumption how does cbd help you i want to know leave your comments below telling me how cbd benefits you if you are using it and remember to hit that thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you're enjoying our content to help us grow that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep talking [Music] of the century you", "UirMWx9OdK8": "[Music] hello everyone welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you find wonderful folks make sense of that crazy crazy confusing place you call your dispensary today we are taking a look at one of those especially confusing what exactly are we talking about here kind of products that your dispensary may carry and what exactly kind of product is that well it's none other than other than tincture i guess what we're calling tincture in this day and age um and what we can also just call um emblematic of all of this sort of inconsistencies in uh weed policies especially when it comes to um dosage requirements so uh and how is that true well we are taking a look at an 800 milligram tincture that stretches the very definition of what tincture is and that is the five star extracts flavored tincture taste of peach oral uh tincture product again 800 milligrams of thc so what why am i so dubious it's not that i'm dubious of the 800 milligrams i'm um they have their lab testing results on this little confusingly curled up sticker here and you know shows the amount of thc in there i just bring this up because this isn't tincture by any traditional definition uh this is the exact same stuff that they were selling years ago when there was no limit on a thc in products and they called it syrup which was an allusion to the codeine sort of cough syrup that people used to drink i guess the idea was that it would get you so high it would be like coding i don't know i think but it shows you kind of how far off we are the mark here this is that exams exact same stuff which is now no longer able to be sold because the only thing you can sell over 100 milligrams is tincture so their notion or what they decided to do was not so much rewrite or create a new product but just simply rebrand existing stuff and i'm not saying that i actually don't know if they existed then or not but i've seen a lot of these syrup companies doing this cannabis is another one and i love them um but it i'm not blaming them i'm not saying it's anything wrong with them i'm just saying the laws are so stupid and screwy that way that you get weird stuff like um candy flavored syrup being called tincture which is nominally at least supposed to be medicinal um and uh this is again just like pink snow cone syrup except it will almost certainly taste gross now they do uh back when they used to sell this kind of stuff before they had you i think the consumption idea was you would take it like a syrup you'd mix it in with maybe soda or something here they really do suggest you take it like a tincture which i don't know if that sound is coming through it is just as thick as cough syrup so uh that seems kind of odious to me to have this much under your tongue of that thick goopy liquid but you know maybe we'll try it both ways and see uh so for an 800 milligram thc tincture i believe this was 60 bucks which is um more expensive than say your breeze uh kind of tinctures but kind of maybe in the range of some select those kind of levels so it's not the cheapest tincture out there either um uh it comes with this fancy and by fancy i mean the least fancy thing you've ever seen this little syringe for dosing which again thick thick syrup um so yeah not the cheapest um i've seen these five star extracts all over southern california especially in the long beach area and they usually come pretty highly recommended from folks as well uh and like all of our wheats reviews the way we're going to do this i know this is 800 milligrams i'm not going to do all 800 milligrams of this uh thing my guess is that it's gonna be quite gross um i uh when we do our tinctures the way i do all our edible reviews here on wheats is we do 100 milligrams because that's generally the size that you're going to buy in most edibles um and that's what we use as a baseline to review things off of so i will try to get as close to 101 8 of this bottle as possible really should have brought some scissors live and learn um i think i was able to just kind of pull it down yep there we go that smells like uh cheap gas station peach rings and weed lovely uh so yes as i said uh about 100 milligrams and then after i do all 100 milligrams it'll probably take me about i'm usually go over about an hour to do the whole thing i'll come back about two hours after that point let you know if this stuff is worth the hassle and the expense um my initial instinct is gonna be there are a lot of other tinctures out there that are cheaper and smaller so this one has some strikes against it already but we shall see you know maybe the thickness of the syrup something something yata cannabinoid receptors binding gabanoids done i don't know what i'm saying what i am now saying is wish me luck oh yes um our dosing uh instructions here on the back say that boy everything about this is just so cheaply uh or so rush put together 2.2 milliliters from here is 10 milligrams of thc our syringe is 3 milliliters um so you guys can do that conversion at home that's what roughly 13 milligrams ish in three milliliters uh in a full syringe which would be what how many of those in totality oh 13 times seven yeah like seven of those uh well no eight right yeah eight of these oh boy eight full ones of these that's gonna be fun well there's our oh my god okay they want me to put this all under my tongue that is ridiculous guys oh jesus okay well we'll try it um i'm guessing i'm gonna reserve taking this like normal syrup here we go oh [ __ ] um oh my god wow that is oh that's so bitter that is so insanely bitter wow wow oh my god oh that's um that is up there for most disgusting holy [ __ ] yuckers i've had to do that is nasty man at least i mean try to keep that all under your tongue as soon as it hits those taste buds ugh it is i mean it it tastes like cough syrup just straight up cough syrup ugh six more to go um i'm not going to be doing all of these sublingually i might try to do one more right here sublingually for you guys and then the remaining five i'm just gonna probably pour into a glass because and mix it with something this is just too much to bear [ __ ] okay oh [Music] oh oh holy christ disgusting oh it's still coming up oh jesus whoo well this is what i'm definitely suffering for you guys [ __ ] i hate this wow so what five six more six more of those for me everybody and just what um i'm gonna try to do these as uh over the next oh it might take me longer than an hour to get through all of these lovely little sons of guns but trust me i will and two hours after i get the last one of these hello buddy how are you doing the last after i get the last one these nasty sons of [ __ ] down i'll come right back here let you guys know if this is in any way worth all of the the uh rather prodigious amount of grotesqueness you have to stand ugh so far got a lot working against it sorry about the uh so much bitching um but you know we're just trying to be honest here and i will see you guys uh you know three three and a half hours pray for me see you soon [Music] welcome back to wheats guys it has been about three and a half hours or so since i first said hello to you um in about 90 minutes since my last dropper under the tongue of this five star extracts the taste of peach as you can see or maybe our camera i'll show you the level is down to about 1 8 down as we're doing only 100 milligrams and uh this is gonna be a fun little end of this review because not very often anymore do i get sort of conflicted feelings about things it's pretty binary at this point this is good this isn't good buy this don't buy this like you know it's there aren't so many shades of gray but here um i i there's some yeah some interesting things um first and foremost does it work hell yes uh this is the 100 milligrams i did which was a [ __ ] lot um of liquid uh hit very hard i have no complaints in that department this is among the strongest tincture i have done um it is yeah the i don't know what the formulation is here but wow uh very very very um uh positive when it comes to your uh getting your your actual high off the product 100 milligrams this did the trick and then some um but there are other things about it that are that may make me say like well maybe not you maybe not want to invest in this and um we'll go back to the price again briefly it's more expensive than some other tinctures uh for theoretically less thc but i'm gonna guess that this is gonna i mean with as strong as that hundred milligrams that first one was um it's gonna feel very much as if it had the full thousand milligrams or more uh in comparison to other sort of equivalently strong tinctures out there um so yeah again price theoretically it's more expensive but it feels quite a bit stronger in some regards um the other big downside is how much you have to do for especially for tinctures so i brought a comparison here i'm working on this review of this breeze um cbd thc one to one spray um and this thing has a thousand milligrams of combined thc cbd and i've reviewed one that has a thousand milligrams of just pure thc so this is oh it's half a fluid ounce it's not even oh my god okay that uh changes things again this is a half a fluid ounce 0.5 fluid ounces um and it has a thousand milligrams of cannabinoids in it this is six fluid ounces and has 800 um uh milligrams of thc in it and that is crazy um i thought this originally was one ounce it's not it's half an ounce so i have to change my calculation thankfully just gotta double it um that makes this right here 15 times literally 15 times stronger per volume than the syrup and the syrup is revolting it never got easier to go down um i did take it sublingually every time i did not end up mixing it i just decided to stay consistent but it is truly gross i am very much looking forward to doing the rest of this bottle because it's it's a really pleasant high but [ __ ] is it nasty um it way worse than i mean i feel like such a prima donna now with these um these are nothing compared to this so it's real gross real strong and you have to do a [ __ ] ton of it but it is real strong and it will get the job done you just gotta kind of suffer through it um and you know uh kind of hard to say whether or not it's uh you know that that is ultimately gonna come down to you those factors whether it's worth it or not um if i want a uh a really powerful high this may be something i go to in the future but if i'm looking for something more casual something that i don't want to just have to put on a clothespin over my nose and just gack down probably stay away um and before i go guys normally i like to save the cherry on top so a little something extras a little just extra recommendation that's not weed related um i usually like to save those for our favorite you know overwhelming two thumbs up style reviews however today let's give you one that i'm a little conflicted about not conflicted about the actual thing but conflicted about oh man it'll just make you uh feel uh conflicted in your soul uh and that is what a terrible segue by the way um i was trying to think of like oh [ __ ] i want to recommend this book what's a transition don't do it while you're high on five-star extracts try to think of one beforehand anyways the uh book is called oh my god why did i not look up the title exactly as hot as it is called um ah yes the book is called evicted poverty and prophet in the american city by matthew desmond uh released in 2016. uh i just finished it earlier today uh it was the pulitzer prize or a pulitzer prize winner uh for nonfiction in 2016. and uh dessert absolutely deserves it it is a book that won't make you feel very good it is a book that will uh continue to you know make you realize oh boy we've been kind of living in a collective delusion for a while but hey no better time to burst that bubble than in the middle of a pandemic so give evicted poverty and profit in in the american city a chance it it's as good as everybody has ever told you that it is if anybody has ever told you about it um but again if you're not looking for something that's going to thoroughly depress you to your core avoid uh and that's the conflict and because we were conflicted about our five star extracts the taste of peach super strong but also you got to do a lot of it and it tastes like rotting ass so thumbs up for evicted poverty and profit in the uh american city thumbs sideways for how it makes you feel and thumb sideways for the taste of ass boy this has gone long you can see how strong it is when i ramble it's because i'm high thanks so much for watching guys be sure to stay high but of course even more importantly stay healthy my friends it's crazy out there and in the meantime oh i already said stay high and stay healthy [ __ ] do those things and i'll see on the next review goodbye", "an0KTdXILiA": "[Music] hey we just ordered some pizzas and now we're gonna go smoke some of this weed so this is a pretty good time to say that i'm pretty excited about this weed right now but i actually don't i don't know if you go watch some of my other reviews of soleil uh they're not that good why because the name is just so late like it's just so lame okay it's so lame wheat isn't about soleil the sun is the vibe is the personality of the person smoking that we know you [ __ ] we use about fun enjoyment [ __ ] yo [Music] come on there's a vibe to weed weeds got the cool names you either stick with the old antique names people love old whitney like the cushes and the you know all that kind of stuff but the sun she gave us the weed we are the weed smokers we are the song but they got that good packaging balance is the name of the [ __ ] that's even more weiner it's balanced by soleil balance it sounds like a [ __ ] tampon or something you know like balance by soleil it soak up their blood it gives you the love oh my god look at the first [ __ ] warning do not use a pregnant or breastfeeding this is a woman's weed dude i just figured out this weed is for women and i know a lot of feminists say now they're going how could there be a woman for i'm gonna be there weed for women and weed for men because man if you ever smoke truck stop kush that's for men baby it's oily it's greasy it hurts your [ __ ] eyes what's the soleil balance by soleil especially does your life need balance do you seek that which you do not have well balanced by soleil will promise to bring you absolutely none of that because it says marijuana and what you look and seek for is internal seven percent thc it is getting weaker and softer by the minute with this wheat it's low thc it's got a soft little name nothing wrong with it i'm soft i cry for 10 more commercials but i also know when someone's going over the top to be a wiener our marijuana is not strong just like our name and our image we want you to like us especially if you don't like yourself [Music] let's see it's it smells real like press board a lot of you people watching a homeowner press board is it's like a type of like fake wood where they like use milled up wood and then they press it using some glues and then they can form it into things to make it look like normal wood but it's not it's like a fake wood has a very unique smell it's woody with like a chemical and this actually has this weird chemical smell to it you know i'll tell you what this wheat tastes like so specific if you ever were a kid and you fell down yeah and you ever fallen down when you were a kid and you got like gravel and [ __ ] on your face and you'd have to like wipe it off but then you went to go lick your face after just because naturally that's what you'll do it's going to clean your lips there'd always be a taste that you could taste that was of gravel what is it i don't know it's just it's all i could taste this actually tastes that's what triggered in my brain was a childhood memory of me falling on the floor getting gravel and [ __ ] on my face and you'd wipe off the little rocks and you'd have like a little cut but for some reason never hurts when you're you just wipe it off and then when you go like that there'd be a taste left behind of earthy gravel rock it tastes gravelly there's also a hint of something like a little bit of citrus that i won't lie i'll give dew words to do there's a little citrus there it's citrus gravel no it does not taste like the sun though that's really funny oh man it does not taste like the sun it isn't it is a balance of earth and citrus so here's my review it's probably some of the whitest ash i've seen in the last couple of reviews but i'm a man who loves his black ass you know what i'm saying girl back that ass up show me which i got it's good it's okay it's a low thc weed so you just smoke it and you get on with your [ __ ] day but you at the same time you hope you don't pay too much for it so before i find out what the price is the review of this weed is i give it a 5. it smelled weird but it smoked good and what do you want what do you want you want weed that smells good it smokes good clean as [ __ ] been flushed correctly how much is it 955 a gram if it was 950 i would give this weed and a 7.5 eight but that 955 kicks it back down to like a seven man and that's it so lay balance solely is the lp not the lp is furious or some [ __ ] is the lp but the brand is soleil uh the balance is the name of the strand seven percent thc smoked really good tasted kind of funky but it wasn't anything off-putting it just tasted woody and and i've smoked a lot of wheat that tastes woody nothing wrong with that um it was decent you can definitely get this and at 955 a gram if you make minimum wage you could buy it and still [ __ ] buy a meal at mcdonald's or some [ __ ] so i mean i highly recommend this week check these guys out i highly recommend this [ __ ] uh thanks so much man that's it you", "76etd8Ye6BA": "[Laughter] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another nug product video so yeah we got an authentic bag right here i paid 41 out the door for this shopping mall so yeah let's just see how much should i pay yes 40. 40 99 you see that for a full gram cartridge not bad not bad so this is ambrosia this is their nug live resin line and uh yeah as you can see in the back all that good stuff the the percentages i believe it's uh eighty percent exactly well not exactly but that's what they put it and also the manufacture date and all that stuff is uh fairly new about three three months old so not bad date of manufacture is a bit older i think april so but got the nug family i haven't had a nug cartridge in a while i've only had one of their cartridges i forgot what strain it was but i just remember that it was a actually a pretty pleasant experience um i did enjoy it and it lasted pretty long so i'm excited to try this other one and uh let's just see if i can find my battery all right so if you didn't know by now i lost my chill battery i dropped it in the hole when we went to sf you should have seen that video by now but it's unfortunate but we got the press slide right here so you just okay well it's a ceramic heating core as well so that's pretty dope and also nugg.com if you guys want to check them out so just pull it out to use attack wow okay you got the logo right there let's do a little box little thumbnail action hopefully it's getting it go up go down right there so we're going to be hitting it in my dash vape retro you guys already know the deal and uh yeah this is looking pretty good i'm not gonna lie screw that bad boy in let me know if you've tried nug before like i said i've tried it only once and i really enjoyed it it lasted really long compared to these other cartridges so uh i'm pretty excited let's see i haven't used this battery in a while i've been using my chill one so cheers boys oh very very smooth you can you can tell that ceramic heating oil works because i do not taste no burning sensation very very smooth hit it's very very comparable to an erza i'm not gonna lie wow let me take that hit again this is the ambrosia by the way cheers boys that's a blinker for a blinker it's not as fat hits that i'd uh i'd normally see from other live resin cartridges um but the taste is there wow i feel like i could probably like do a five second hit and then a blinker and that will do a pretty decent size hit which is what i'm gonna do so hold on oh there you go wow that is really enjoyable so would i like i said what i remember from the other nug is that it lasts longer than other cartridges so i'm hoping this one lasts just as long because i'm really enjoying the flavor here uh for 41 dollars is generally the price of what you get from typical live resin cartridges uh except for the exception of urza which is like 55 to 60. but this is good i'm not gonna lie like i'm honestly it's one of the better tasting live resins that i've tried lately lately and uh i don't know where i'm gonna be placing this but i know it's on my top five nug is definitely on my top five uh from my last top five video i said i believe it was four or three um i just feel like maybe buddies edged it out a little bit because they had more of a selection and it's a bit cheaper but this taste like i've been on a bad roll right now of buying products and not liking it and honestly i'm kind of happy that i bought this uh this was like the only one in the display that they had left that authentic so i knew that maybe out of all the strains that they had of the nut cartridge that this one was the one that was chose the most and honestly i'm glad i chose this wow i'm really enjoying this and look at it i think i barely even touched it and i just did maybe like two three blinkers maybe two let me take another hit for you guys so like i said the hints aren't going to be as fat for you know blinkers on other live resin cartridges but not [ __ ] bad not [ __ ] bad i'm probably gonna take two more hits off of this and then and then we're just gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed this video if you haven't tried nut cartridges i've tried two out of i've tried two of them so far and it's been two out of two [ __ ] a hit so uh i'm gonna take two more hits like i said cheers boys enjoyable so also i'll post the link to this battery if you guys are interested in that i believe the cheapest that i've seen it was like 15 to 20 i don't know and then there's obviously uh shipping involved but nonetheless very very good battery from daz vape shout out to them always supporting me um yeah just uh i don't know i'm happy about this cartridge right now i'm ecstatic that i bought this cartridge i was gonna buy another buddy's cartridge because i did lose my buddy's cartridge i was gonna buy another train wreck but then i was like let's just try something new and a nug well it's not totally new because i've done a video on their their uh i forgot what strain it was but it was a good strain i'm gonna take another hit for you the last hit and then we're gonna end the video here hopefully you enjoyed the video you know like it subscribe if you haven't already if you want to and yeah i'll take this hit cheers boys all right guys peace out [Music] [Music] you", "xpcK6q1eds8": "yo what is it house owner here and we're

review on this actually this will kind of be like what it is I'll just do a strain review on purple kush they're not purple kush um mango Kush under shear strain is behind the pretty guys right now so if you guys don't know how to strain your views ology basically um fight look at the weed smell it how it smells how it looks I don't have explained how it came so but me look at this just for me looking at it it's really like a light green with a lot of orange and white on the outside you know the trichomes are really there the smell I give it a [ __ ] definitely like a nine on the smell that smells exactly like mangles wood and got this good smell to it you can smell a mango when you break it up really good my hands are kind of sticky from it so look I love the way it look it's like an island oh look um but I also really like like my favorite kind of look is purple for sure that's why but like looking at it like it looks like a barrier up killing weed that you would want to write you know save and look at forever smell is there ten out sound smell smells exactly like mango smell like what it should you know we're just gonna basically rip the ball I got a little boy attacked a

walk around the park and just take pictures and stuff like that but i thought it would be dope to go like super duper faded all right so i'm gonna go stop by greenlit farms one of my favorite dispos to go to i'm gonna go pick up some bud and also maybe some other things just to be able to enjoy um you know the full time that i'm there so i'm gonna go ahead and take you guys along and show you

beautiful strain man i'm talking like greenlight cultivation farms you guys have some of the best bud that i have ever seen out here next time's going to be the marathon and then next up on the list this guy is the yes crazy this is some fiber all right i'll take um two eighths of seven i kind of like i'll take some marathon and i'll also take some of the champagne og ones all right for sure bro i appreciate it i hope take it easy man all right all right boys so we are back home we ended up copying you guys already know the champagne og we got an eighth of that we got this bad boy right here we're gonna be downing this whole freaking thing before we walk in or maybe maybe you know what's it called because i'm not going to be driving so i'm thinking about maybe taking it an hour before we even dip the house that way it could hit me as soon as i get there and last but not least we got another eighth of the marathon og so i'm probably gonna be rolling up a blunt and also drinking all thousand milligrams of that all right boys yo what's going on youtube so we're over here at knobs man hopefully you guys could [ __ ] hear me bro because it is so gosh damn loud over here that i can't even hear myself think alright boys so we're over here off of a thousand milligrams of thc i'm smacked off my ass i'm not gonna lie i can barely even function right now i'm chilling though i feel like this is just i feel like everyone should go to the amusement park chilling off of a thousand milligrams off of thc sarah bro because this [ __ ] is honestly pretty freaking fun honestly i'm gonna show you guys around real quick yeah boy that [ __ ] is [ __ ] lit i'm lit right now and honestly i the only reason i haven't really been recording this whole time is because i'm honestly just enjoying it i'm having a good time and i hope you guys are you know enjoying the the video man if you guys are so far make sure to smash that like button i'm gonna go ahead and go home um and finish this off over there man because i can barely even function right now all right boys so cheers so we are back home man after a long day and not scary for them that she was pretty cool so i really didn't end up recording as much as i really wanted to so i was like looking over the footage editing the footage i was like yo this is not enough footage for me to upload it was gonna be like a six minute video so i was like yo this is not enough i gotta record some more so what i did was i rolled up a joint of the marathon oh gee boys i'm gonna go ahead and put a video up on the screen to show you guys a close-up of how the flower looks man i love this flower i'm not gonna lie i've been chiefing it for the past ever since i got it and it's just phenomenal man the marathon og at um greenlit super gas all right boys and we got the supreme lighters you can see right there and let's just go ahead and spark this joint and pretty much just talk about my experience and how i felt that whole time alright cheers boys all right so pretty much as soon as i got there guys i ended up taking it like an hour the drive was an hour to get there so i took it literally as soon as i um before i left the house so it actually ended up hitting me literally as soon as i got there as soon as i got there i was like already slumped like i i felt like this really really grogginess in my body that was just like yo i do not want to even be here right now man i wish i was home just chilling so that's why in the clip you guys see me just like man just like sweating a little bit just having a good time just chilling relaxing and the whole time like i brought my camera because i was gonna try and record the whole thing while i was there but while i was there guys there was really nothing to record you know like i didn't really want to record me just walking around the park and just recording just random clips of like random people and things like that so i was like you know what man this is not gonna be enough but i'm gonna record what i can and i just pretty much just was able to record that little update for you guys but the whole time that i was there like i was saying i felt such a relaxation i felt like it was a lot more enjoyable being off of the liquid karma than it was just going completely sober so that's definitely something that i might even have to do again i think next time the next time i go i might even have to do 2 000 milligrams yo if you guys want to see a video of me doing 2 000 milligrams and then going maybe maybe hopefully you know universal studios has a has something this year for for their halloween themes but you know kobe 19 got the whole world still [ __ ] up and you can't really do that much stuff so with that being said i think i am going to try to find some things to do for you guys so let's try to get this video over 700 likes and i'm 100 down to do 2 000 milligrams and pretty much vlog the whole thing just to show you guys how crazy it is because a thousand milligrams for me is really nothing i feel like i've done so many challenges already i've done the thousand milligram challenge i've done the two thousand milligram challenge with the standard edibles and um i feel like doing another 2000 challenge would not be bad at all so like run up the video boys run up the likes on the video let's do it so far though i'm over here literally just enjoying this joint and the fact that i'm not even dying or coughing that's how you know the weed is filtered and so fire right i haven't even coughed at all maybe once or twice just because of how much smoke i'm consuming but i'm telling you guys this marathon og is some straight gas i feel the effects right away i feel like the overall body height is amazing i feel like i'm just enjoying

guys with a nice awesome medical cannabis review and this one i'm going to be doing a dislike cartridge durbin poison you guys know durbin poison is one of my favorite sativas right so as soon as i get out back in my little spot we're going to get straight into this derby poison the cartridge all right i'll see you right back so like i was saying this desolate durban poison grass root cartridge half a gram i believe it was uh 50 bucks and it was like 15 off i believe yesterday on their their sales they had so uh look at the numbers here guys real quick hopefully it focuses for you right you know i'll do my little zoom in thing give you guys all that nice info all right you guys remember uh it's a south african land race variety right uh energetic uplifted happy euphoric and creative well it's supposed to help the stress depression inside chronic pain muscle cramps and uh fatigue a similar strange like i was saying is jack hair super lemon haze ghost train haze uh j1 jack the ripper j or xj13 and clementine all right so i got my nice [ __ ] ooze stainless steel battery here i'm gonna hook this on it should be nicely freshly charged um there it is unopened all right let me get the sticker off um i haven't had a distillate cartridge for a minute um i mean if you consider co2 cartridges distillate then i guess that's a dislike cartridge but yeah i haven't had this cartridge in a minute so let's see hopefully the headspace is [ __ ] minimum probably won't be uh that's a [ __ ] man dude look at that headspace that is just crazy i feel like i get raped every time and i buy from them at least it's not 60 dollars for the [ __ ] sauce guard i guess i mean but still 50 dollars for a dislike cartridge bro i like the color on it but grassroots y'all really gotta gotta do something with this and i see that you actually changed the plugs up here so i'm sure it's going to be yes a hell of a lot easier so thank you for thank you for changing the plugs up on these things because my last video uh maybe the last few videos of the the uh grassroots cart like this i had a hard time getting this little piece out so thank you for that but man that headspace that headspace is just craziness like come on guys all right my dog's gonna bark so i'm stopping and i'll get married the head space yeah i'm really disappointed in this head space here guys i mean you're spinning 50 bucks even at 45 for a half a gram it should be [ __ ] full you know what i mean that is that's just it's just ridiculous it should be full i'm out back guys i'm sorry i can't i can't help the dogs bark in it and stuff like that uh it is what it is right but yeah let's hook this guy up to the [ __ ] battery and uh give it a go first i'm gonna do a dry test like normal all right it has that it has that super lemon that like uh lemon sweet a taste to it that taste word just wouldn't come out of my mouth there so yeah here we go once again thank you shout out to mark and uh young crews thank you boys here we go cheers that is definitely tasty you could really taste the lemon in this one guys this is really tasty and i was i was really expecting the distillate um the distillate tastes like like straight up um i really wouldn't say like a burnt cartridge taste but most thistles kind of have that burnt cartridge taste at least in my opinion it does right and this one does not have that burnt cartridge taste right now and for being distilled that's really good like i said this is a pure [ __ ] sativa guy so this is a good one for the morning it's a good one to smoke when you want to get stuff done yard work uh on a job site whatever it is and you got to get some [ __ ] done this is a good one to have on deck like i said they're really convenient they're really uh you know sneaky you know what i mean like like the smell on it on this one the smell is going to be like like lemon hazy kind of a smell sent to it don't smell like weed at all so i really love it i love these things and with the ooze batter it's nice slick too so uh if you can make sure you guys go pick up one of these nice slick batteries i think they're like 12 bucks 17 like that and they got the adjustable uh things too so i'm actually going to turn it up a little bit at 3.8 and start at 3.3 i'm going 3.8 and give this one a a hit a little hotter and see if i could get a little more uh terpene taste out of it let's go cheers all right so i had more of the lemon taste and had a little earthy taste as well uh so i'm guessing the hotter you get the more terpenes you kind of bring more to taste out and distill the carts some cartridges are opposite the less heat you have the more taste you have uh yeah so for for being a distillate cartridge after hitting it two times i would definitely call this one a win like i said i'm not happy with the headspace and uh normally most grassroots cartridges have that headspace it just the [ __ ] is there i mean what can you do about it you know what i mean besides [ __ ] about it and hopefully they fixed it they fixed a little cap issue so that's cool but yeah man i'm um thank you grassroots this one isn't too bad for being adjusted to the cartridge the taste is good the effect is good as you tell me i feel like i'm just just chit chatting away my eyes definitely feel a little low but they're always [ __ ] low right uh because you know your boy turbo tom stays turkey stays medicated uh 99 of time besides when i'm at work now with this new job but yeah anyway uh mama i love you guys make sure you smash that like if you want to leave a donation you guys know in venmo uh smash that like share subscribe all that good stuff yourself up money's durbin poison grass root this with the cartridges you won't be disappointed i'm telling you for being desolate you won't be [ __ ] disappointed alright peace out", "HPeCUvEf2XA": "I have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually I've been smoking on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up its up everybody youtubes and really busting my balls about their Community Guidelines recently so if you're under 18 [ __ ] off thanks oh yeah what is going on everybody and welcome back to another episode of free [ __ ] / I've been asked this question like a million times over the past couple days because of my most recent video so knock him out both in one episode you know what I mean before we get to that this video is sponsored by my goddamn self so a lot of you guys have been asking for merch specifically merch that doesn't say hey I'm a [ __ ] pothead on it because I understand that right you guys are like yo man I'd like to merch I want to support you but I don't want a pot leaf on my back and I respect that so just for you people I've dropped a piece drip tea it's pretty much the peace tea that we did before it says peace right here on the breast and then a peace sign on the back but it's like dripping it's like liquidy it looks really cool it's probably only gonna be available for two weeks let's make it two weeks so if you guys want to check that out link is in the description make sure to check it out by yourself one two weeks very limited they're [ __ ] awesome doesn't really scream that you smoke weed and yeah pretty cool so ever since I released that video a couple days ago which by the way he's doing very well the most common question that I get asked is Erik if you're not smoking these boo fast carts then what are your favorite cartridges if you know anything about the channel you know that these have been pretty much my go-to for the past couple weeks couple months I don't even know how long but it's usually the Moonrock carts which this one's empty and thus tizzy I found that these two right here are kind of the cleanest high and they give you the best high for sure like one or two hits out of these I'm not gonna lie that I've tried plenty of carts have tried kingpins brass knuckles like legitimate kingpins legitimate brass knuckles and there's a whole bunch of different brands out there for the most part it takes you like what two three hits and then you're like all right now I'm feeling good but with either of these with one solid not even a blinker with one solid hit like five six seconds I'm feeling it and that's that's kind of tough to do with a pen for me right cuz you tolerance just goes higher and higher and higher after every time I'm not sure how much is left in here it's a strawberry Nana car it's pretty much done tastes very good no best thing about cz see like a not a lot of pins make me cough bro I'm not gonna lie after a hit like that but the thing about susie that doesn't make you my daily driver is one it's only available in california and to its proprietary little battery so if this dies i don't have any other device but i have like a million 510 thread battery so that's mainly why this is nice don't get me wrong and they recently remodeled other package its new packaging it's higher THC percentages and there's no pesticides so sissies your thing then go ahead and check it out man but because of those two things it really just i don't really hit it every day you know i mean i don't get the opportunity to smoke bcz every single day however alright the game has changed man dr. zodiac who usually makes the moon rock cartridges said [ __ ] that i want to branch into other things [ __ ] the moon rocks and we got ourselves i'm not sure he's coming out with anymore but we have ourselves six different cartridges six different flavors six different strains from dr. zodiac himself the maker of the moon rocks and they hit the same bro and it takes a lot for me to say that about a cartridge bro there's not many cards out there that hit like a moon rock car but from the [ __ ] himself obviously it's gonna be pretty dope man have five of them right here we're gonna go through every single flavor individually i've been smokin on them as you can see if you've been in the streams you know what's up i actually gave Kyle one of them which is why one of them is missing so it gives me an opportunity to open it up so packaging is on point first of all you have some crazy I there's so much going on right here there's like a lion's a spaceship in the background there's like a little spiral galaxy right there like this is tight I've got to open it up and inside you'll see a battery a charger and your one gram cartridge I think they also sell them in half grams yeah yeah I've never seen him in half grams but there's a little spot right there for a half gram so I imagine that they do now the [ __ ] cartridges a low charger and we have ourselves right here what is this one the Lion Heart clear so a lot of these don't have the strain actually on them I'm not exactly Lionheart distrain I've never heard of it but the other ones I'll go through and tell you what I think this train is but I guess that's part of the fun man little guessing game so very first hit off of this cart by the way as you can see right here we got a little bubble right there and as you guys know I said in my last video I said hey the bubble moves it's bunk so let's go ahead and see if that bubble is moving I'm not even seeing it but I know the bubbles not moving beautiful beautiful man let's go ahead and just give this a nice low trip blinker yeah we'll get a nice rip and then we'll give it a blinker [Music] goddamn bro [Music] [Music] I couldn't even blink it man okay mm-hmm so I'm not gonna lie Lionheart was my least favorite which is why I gave it to Kai but after that hit man I don't know I might have to reconsider lion-hearted clear very fire next one up I think we're going to go through for my favorite to least favorite right now just as we got that one out of the way my very very favorite out of the six new ones that he has is called this Linwood lemonade clear this pen right here straight up tastes like I'm taking a [ __ ] dab bro it's ridiculous like it tastes so much like lemon like I have lemon gene aemon's right now and I think it kind of reminds me of that but every time I rip this it's flavor town and it's high town baby [Music] that's not saying that's insane man I can literally rip these off a pro I mean that would probably be really bad my tolerance but dude god damn I'm eyes and look [ __ ] all right yeah Lin would absolutely fired next up we have a Bobby blues clear which I believe is Blue Dream or something of the sort tastes very much like Blue Dream and it is the second most delicious one oh yeah that's blue dream for sure next up we have the silverback clear which i think is the best look and artwork in my opinion it's my third favorite and this is guerrilla glue like I said these are just assumptions I could be completely flow going wrong about all these but this is this is generally what I'm tasting what I'm getting the effects that I'm getting from these pants man every single pen also has the little logo or the little artwork on it instead of the little doctor zodiac bunny but we do have the bunny right there and we got the bunny right there as well mad goddamn I love these bro I don't know there's just a look about these you know I mean like every single cart looks the [ __ ] same man and at a certain point like when you're getting really high off all the cards still you look for a little something extra right you look for a little pizzazz you look for a little like all the cards are the same I need something that stands out oh wow all right that second hit was a little different hang on that might bump up man I don't know that might bump up to number two right there goddamn that silver bag is why you're next up this could actually this is up there man I'm not gonna lie next up we have the razzle dazzle clear there's a little berry hitting a cartridge right there which is very clean this color is nice I don't know there's something cool about all these like it's one thing to color one things the flavor when things like the plugins and say you should make it I don't know man one's a real bright pink with all the colors on it I think this one really reminds me of an actual moon rock cardiguez which is like a berry flavored moon rock art tastes very similar to that it honestly tastes like a DAB like I don't know man like not a lot of dab cards sometimes dab cards will just be Tudor P if that makes any sense like oh dude this doesn't even taste like weed this just tastes like like a [ __ ] candy cart or something you know what I mean and I don't really [ __ ] with that but these have like it taste like wheat like you know you're getting that wheat I don't know if all of you are under that there's probably gonna be some people that bro I just smoked with a flavor like alright these cards aren't for you then I'm not gonna lie these cards are for getting extremely [ __ ] medicated and a hint of flavor that's like enjoyable but not too much I don't know but it's some good stuff now this last one here is called Frosty's snowcone again don't necessarily know if that's strain or not um but this little it's a little Frosty the Snowman guys looking evil on here what is he I like that a little logo man it's looking [ __ ] cool there's color by the way purple is probably my favorite color like probably a lighter shade of purple is my favorite color but this is solid right here Wow okay wait I feel like I'm cleansing my palette between each of these hits it's kind of a long time and usually on the streams I'm just like so I'm getting a decent amount of time to actually taste these do why is it so [ __ ] hard to rank these bro that's unnecessary like these are all fire five had however much these retail for like fifty sixty seventy bucks I don't know how much I I wouldn't pick one [ __ ] wait hang on if I had people are gonna ask me but they're like dude I only have enough money for one which one should I buy hey I think I'm buying the lemonade yeah that's a no-brainer I think the lemonade ones like no-brainer no-brainer kind of number one there and then number two bro it's like but just pick your poison yeah I mean goddamn everyone's probably gonna ask for this part no we're okay there you go durability tests on the spot [ __ ] beautiful everyone's gonna ask for it Oh first of all we need to get this thumbnail hang on let's get a bang and ask them no going right now oh not today son not [ __ ] today try to do this on stream and it was rather difficult so we're gonna see what's good right here it's just a little difficult because like it's hard to create a seal around so when you're inhaling you're just getting a lot of air all right so if you're not in a state where you can get dr. zodiacs and Moonrock cartridges and you're like damn I still want to have a little so wanna have a little swagger so we'll have a little what are your favorite batteries Eric I can get my own cartridges what do you like to smoke the actual cars use em so great great move question bro I actually have a little something right here it's like a part to a cliche bro personally I like batteries that don't have a button I don't know what it is but like yeah it's an added luxury that you can change the temperature but give a foot most of the time like I just want to hit it take out of my pocket inhale put it in and then we're good you know I mean I have to like click five times turn on and then like one two three and like change the temp and then like all right you know I mean it's just like those added seconds it seems like some [ __ ] but it kind of matters I mentioned this battery and all of these batteries made by Batman on a video before they're on the one gram in one sitting video but their website only sells wholesale they only sell like two dispensaries and stuff you know what it means so you couldn't buy it individually however I've helped you out don't even worry about it we have found an online head shop that was willing to work with us they even gave us a discount code so head up J vape industries it'll be in the description down below and you can use code Eric 10 for 10 percent off I have this battery and all of the magic Bab ballad batteries they're [ __ ] late all right I got you guys don't worry I got you guys take the lemon one of course slide in there and they both have this magnet [ __ ] that's like I don't know why that's so sexy like I don't know why I meant these are both the same color - damn in here I like this little midnight look look that's not coming out man you got a oh you know what I mean like that's [ __ ] tight you don't getting the only gripe on the see cell palm that I like the VAM on better is obviously this one's smaller this one that's a light so you know when you're heating it you know what I mean this one oh there is a light on this one never mind [ __ ] I don't know man look bad the stick one might hit a little harder than this I'd say if you're buying a dr. zodiac pen and you got the battery with it there's no need to upgrade but if you in need of a new battery these are the movement especially if you don't have a proper battery and you have one of those stick low eight dollar ones at the local smoke shop get rid of that [ __ ] it's gonna die in like a month month and a half get either one of these batteries men Eric 10 for 10% off by the merch first but like a if you want to check these out too if you need a battery a go ahead and check them out man I hope you all enjoyed hope you all learn something this wasn't a drugs 101 I don't know why I said that but like I don't learn something about batteries or card in my favorites hey you know what I mean let's get let's get a solid little double hit here going both batteries actually get something cool willing you know yeah when you have three you can actually like hit it properly you know what I mean I'm like yeah look at this cloud that I made my opponent it's just like alright you won't turn it so I have to do it like this I got to hold it that's gonna be the video guys I hope you all enjoyed make sure to check out all the links in the

marketing branding entrepreneurship the black market legalization and so much more than hit that subscribe button down below I would very much appreciate it ok so today we are covering and marijuana moment article written by Ben Hanlin this is published two years ago on July 3rd as of this reporting title of this article is summer dreams of marijuana infused slushies are melted by Oklahoma regulators no not the slushies drive man this is it's not good anyway yeah it sucks but it does suck but you know let's just go over this article and we'll talk a little bit more about the bigger picture ok so bad news for oklahoma medical marijuana patients trying to beat the summer heat with marijuana infused slushy state regulators say the icy beverages quote are unlikely to meet requirements set forth in Oklahoma statutes and rules for cannabis products as the weather heats up THC infused slushie machines have been popping up at more and more Oklahoma dispensaries made by companies such as clay ZZZ which offers flavors such as watermelon and blue raspberry the THC infused drink sell from for about 12 to 15 dollars Wow sue but despite their populated with some patients regulators say the Salafis failed to comply with a number of state rules such as requirements that products be packaged in child resistant containers ok so that's a critical note remember that not packaged in child resistant containers so it's a big red flag violating the oklahoma regulations around cannabis products dispensaries themselves also quote are not allowed to alter package or label products and regulator said alright so they're not allowed to do any of that so state rules further require that all medical marijuana products be tested in the final form in this instance the finished product is the slushy mixture to be dispensed to patients / caregivers not the syrup regulator said quote if water ice or any other substances added to the product additional testing is required to ensure the product is safe for consumption in vial product and labeling for labeling is accurate regulators didn't specify how adding water or ice to cannabis products could affect the consumer safety however the Oklahoma medical marijuana 30th or the omma issued the update on Thursday in what is called a quote slushy machine guidance memo the office said it had received quote multiple inquiries regarding the processing and dispensing of marijuana infused slushies on site and medical marijuana dispensaries the memo was silent however on the likelihood of enforcement as a Friday morning slushy still appeared on menus at some Oklahoma dispensaries it's not the first optical obstacle encountered by Oklahoma marijuana businesses which began popping up across the state voters mastered medical marijuana law in 2018 earlier this year lawmakers passed a wide-ranging medical cannabis expansion bill which allowed for out-of-state residents to obtain temporary licenses permanent license businesses to deliver marijuana to cus customers and eliminated eliminated jail time for the first for first-time possession convictions but governor Kevin stit Republican then vetoed the bill and lawmakers didn't hold a vote to override the action Oklahoma's activists also filed a proposed marijuana legalization bill a ballot measure in December but it's likely the campaign can gather enough signatures to put the measure before voters this November the students gathering was largely delayed due to the crow bars pandemic and only last week did the state Supreme Court Rule that the campaign could initiate petitioning supporters now have about 90 days to gather nearly a hundred and seventy eight thousand signatures from registered voters okay so you know this is just an interesting quick little story that I you know medical candid medical marijuana in general especially you know the older markets the ones that you know a lot of times aren't here anymore for example Washington State had you know medical marijuana program that got pretty much completely destroyed it's still around now a newer form of it but it's much different especially now the recreational cannabis is there but you know in my experience when talking about these medical marijuana markets is that the regulation has really not ever been that big of a deal like there's been very little very regulation typically that has to do with less tax money meaning there's less resources put to regulator regulators right so now we're starting to see kind of new new generation new new era medical marijuana markets like Oklahoma right that are I still I still have a medical marijuana they said they have a medical marijuana market but it differs in the fact that there's much more regulation because they're prepping for there's already first of all there's already a ton of money involved and the taxation is already higher because there's other states now that are have legal right recreationally legal cannabis so you know stay a state like Oklahoma looks over to a Washington or Colorado or California and goes oh those are pretty high taxes we could benefit let's just do that with medical right now and then we'll have that kind of ease into eventually recreational marijuana right so it's interesting right so these newer medical marijuana markets are actually getting way higher much more attention in terms of rate regulation when you could in comparison to you know the pre you know twenty eight twenty fifteen recreational legalized markets in Colorado and Washington right and twenty eighteen in California are 2016 excuse me in California so you know I just you know I just wanted to highlight this and kind of show that you know just because the states are fragmented markets they're separate they also do influence each other in terms of there is definitely some overlap in terms of you know I guarantee you these regulators talk to each other you know across the country in different states about what they're doing and how you know they could be doing better or what's a better system or what's a bad system so that's kind of mean that's always been kind of beauty about I think this kind of slower legalization in a way not to say that there aren't a lot of problems with it because of you know the criminal aspect to it where people are in jail where they're in there are some states where it's recreationally legal right that's not right but you're starting to see you know because the whole thing about slowly legalizing is that you get a test out different systems right so in Colorado they know they have vertical integration in Washington state where I'm from there's there's no vertical integration you can't own a dispensary and a producer processor license you can't own a retail and produce Rasta license that split up now I mean people definitely go around that but absolutely though in terms of you know these you know we get to see what works and what doesn't and then you know once we all come together and you know finally you know we have federal legalization we already have data testing and you know experiences with these individual state markets and see you know what works best and what would be the best potential model for cannabis federal cannabis legalization right so that is that is a huge thing but this is kind of one little instance of right showcasing that you know I guarantee you this would never have been a problem back in you know the pre recreational days in Washington State this would never have come up now is that good or bad it's kind of up to you to make I mean I personally think it's probably you know I don't like I don't like to have too many restrictions in terms of products right but definitely important to always look at you know look look out for the the public safety you know the health of these medical patients and we don't want to you know have them exposed to any you know potentially harmful products you know if there's not adequate testing not say that there isn't a huge testing problem throughout all of these markets the testing programs are pretty can be pretty be kind of corrupt sometimes they can be just not very good and some are great who knows you know I mean they are great some of them are really good but just it there's a lot of a loose area there you know I'm gonna I have a an acquaintance of mine that's I became friends with recently and she is one of the most recent she's came when she come she comes she's coming from the pharmaceutical testing world and she's now coming to cannabis so I think I'm gonna have her on the frame flower podcast if you haven't checked that podcast I'll go check it out I'm on episode number eleven but point being is that you know because just because recreational just because you don't have recreational cannabis in your state does not mean there won't be more regulations because you know there's the the bars getting raised higher and higher the more we see recreative recreational cannabis markets get voted in through really right cannabis legalization anyways this is marijuana moment shout-out to Ben Adeline shout to marijuana moment the title of this article is summer dreams of marijuana infused slushies are melted by Oklahoma regulators Oklahoma by the way really interesting market it's gonna be a major hub in my opinion for cannabis grows they have no canopy limit there and there's you know a lot of other things too we'll talk about that in a future segment but thank you so much if you made say in this video I hope everyone had a great 4th of July you know I had a little a little bit of fun I'm not some fireworks and stuff you can actually go see that experience it's on my Instagram

watching and have an amazing amazing day [Applause] [Music]", "oSRUj0esUr8": "and what's up guys welcome to my channel or welcome back of your subscriber for today's video I'm gonna be reviewing the Lucky Charms cure pod I just searching on weed maps in the delivery dispensary near me was carrying lucky charm to tame that this is a new flavor I believe the strains of the Lucky Charms is the white and Appalachia alright that's all you do is push the side button and then they should slide out you know as the pamphlet and everything in there and she should pull it out I snuck up that Grape Ape on there from last video I'm gonna take off the Grape Ape put that aside alright I'm gonna click it in there I like taking the little drop first just to get the taste of the string what the hell this is what people probably talking about when they say like milky taste cuz invest tastes like milk and it is sweet take one more little hit this might be my new favorite flavor too bad I don't carry in the Grande pod [Music] well then I notice about myself because I when I edit the videos is that like my goatee trick is the always said it goes I don't know why and then when it's done right it just looks so clean there's a delivery dispensary near me that has a lot of varieties of the cure pods so if you're interested in seeing any other strains that I haven't reviewed yet just let me know down in the comments below and I'll try and get the pods that you guys recommend look you guys for his got me feelin pretty good it sucks that the Cure paws money coming hi friends but a nice dose my fingers that time they have it blink earlier if you smoking along I'm no way you're smoking down in the comments below Cheers oh the Lucky Charms pod tastes so good I keep moving around mama and you just open up the lighting if you see it around I do recommend this Lucky Charms pod loci that blinker wasn't so bad heavy-hitters battery in the last video I was looking at the timer appear pop and I think I saw about the heavy edges battery a blink last 15 seconds and this one last like 10 so that's why I think this blinker wasn't so bad is hitting blinkers on the ABS battery it just [ __ ] up my throat extra 5 seconds makes a big difference nobody I talked to her nobody around me knows that I know I started my youtube I don't know I just I just haven't told anyone just to see if I could build it up on my own but but yeah but now if I tell it sounds kind of awkward is this like I've already been doing YouTube 30 months but hey I might um eventually so shout-out to them if they're watching this they know who they are [Music] and you want to say thank you guys for 15 subs its is really crazy to me just knowing that 15 people like my content so thank you so much for the support I'm gonna have one more blinker for you guys Cheers [Music] see the blinkers aren't here aren't poking me up as bad nervous cuz the pods are smooth or just cuz the battery like I said just because of the blinker time but yeah as I'm [ __ ] on my throat and the flavors pretty good I saw someone mentioned the oil test here's a royal test for you guys I've been smoking on it and the bubble hasn't moved and during all those hits [Music] I wasn't even gonna hit a blinker right there but I was already like taking the long hit so I just like [ __ ] it I just I'll finish it if you enjoyed the video make sure you like comment subscribe and I see you in the next one", "PxL8RgmvK3I": "hey what's up guys what did do is you boy mr. bling see I'm coming back at you with another video I think I just cringed after I said that but uh anyway today I wanted to just talk about some carts uh in specific fake carts because like I've been watching a lot of other people's videos on like your views of carts and [ __ ] and anytime they review something that's like a dank vape or a dab wood or like a cereal cart all I see in the comments are over you smoking home to fake cards oh you've got no food carts oh that car doesn't have the holo graphics on it so I think that fake um I would like to just say shut the [ __ ] up cuz like I'm pretty sure everyone who smokes carts knows that all of these aren't real carts because I mean it's pretty obvious if you smoke them yourself you can get different packaging which are like fake our carts from a fake cart in general but just starting off this video all of these carts are fake these two are real though I'm just gonna show you the packaging on these real quick so first off they have the California label and that's something only some of these fake car companies can write or copy onto their packaging but uh anyway you have a sticker that clearly labels your total THC and CBD content your strain how many milligrams you're getting and what type of weed it is you have this sticker label on the top that seals the box you have this sticker label on the back that lists your THC and CBD again and a government warning all of this information is on this legit kingpin packaging even the way the packaging it comes in obviously I mean like these are long since weak but uh you get a nice little kingpin cart it looks very nice it's all high quality you can open it in case you want to take the wax out it's a legit kingpin cart it even has the like the label a you can't scratch off I just hit my camera mess up my then I think it was a shame all right so you have all of these other companies that are making black-market cards all of these are black-market cards the thing is it's just some companies do it better than others and I don't know why some companies decide to lie about what they're putting in the curt's like trap house they put a rough percentage of your THC content they put all natural high percent organic no PG VG or PE d and they even copy the California sticker the thing is trap house is an alleged company and so these aren't real cards they're fake cards but they're high-quality fake cards if I would say so myself I just finished their Venice og one and like the waxen this was just as good if not better than the wax and these kingpin cards don't hate to kingpin though these were nice um but yeah so like just because it's a car is fake doesn't mean that it's not gonna work the thing is these are full of harmful chemicals not full of them but like Oh some more but these are pure wax they're not gonna harm you these though even though they say they don't have PG or VG they do they're mixed with that it's real wax but it's mixed to dilute it in therefore you get more use out of it the way you can tell if it's a higher quality fake wax is if it moves slowly and if it's like a deep golden color or like yeah a deep golden brown um I think out of all of these carts the worst one I've had was this chronomaly skittles cart obviously the packaging is fake I never seen Khurana play anywhere else it doesn't even have like the fake California label on it oh yeah it does but it's like an even weirder one they always say lab tested on percent organic but they're not like it's very obvious when you're hitting these cards that they are mixed with something some of them here really harsh dank babes as you can see his had to change sorry about that I had to fix my camera back because I'm sort of hit it while I was trying to talk about these dang babes packaging um what I was trying to say was dank babes has had to change their packaging three times since January because other people are now taking their packaging and putting fake tarts inside of already fake cart packages which is such an insane thought to me but it's kind of good that dank vapes likes to like at least change up the way that they're selling theirs think their stuff so that people are at least getting somewhat higher quality wax under thinning that I like another thing that I like about dang vapes is that you can't open these see cell atomizers that they use for their wax they're stuck closed and that's a good thing because the fact that all of these companies mix actual THC like weed wax with VG and PG it makes it harmful for you if you take it out of the cart when you're smoking it in the car it'll make you coffee cuz it's kind of harsh it might taste really good but it's still not that great for you imagine that but worse if you take and open these car packages and then you try to actually dab the wax from them Auto break some of these companies make it so that you can unscrew the top of their carts you can refill them obviously but then you can also take the wax out and that's where you can run into problems once you burn the wax that's mixed with VG and PG on a rig it can be super harmful for you because we're not supposed to be combusting those chemicals they're used in actual vape juice that you would mix with nicotine for people to stop smoking they're not meant to be used for THC cartridges obviously you can use them and people are but I feel like people should just put out the information that yes these are fake yes they do work but you have to at least also be careful with them and know what you're getting yourself into before you start trying to like just smoke cards out of the blue and thinking that all of these these are legit I'm pretty sure even exotic like their wax is around the same quality as dank vapes I'm not sure if they're super legit but I know that their wax is not like an amazing quality wax it's decent but it's not great these trap house cards they are pretty good I would suggest them just as highly as I would suggest at King pen but only with the information that these are mixed with VG and that they can harm you and I think like my basic opinion is that these cards while they are fake are just as good as legit carts as long as you know hey I'm sort of damaging my body by using these and you just continue with the information in mind if you can get legit carts I would highly suggest doing that because while they may not like get you as high as these like immediately you might take me need to take a few more hits but these also last longer they're more healthy for you and I mean the smoke is super smooth so it doesn't feel like I was harming myself at all when I was using these cards these carts are probably cheaper and more available to you so if that's your like only choice try some of them out but like try to figure out what brands you prefer over the ones that are like sort of harmful um I feel like this video ended up being a bit of a ramble I'm sorry about that but I also hope that if you did watch you enjoyed and um yeah I'll just catch you all next time see you", "8DVA8ZJaiVc": "[Music] what's up guys p2 peeps and continuing our uh you know fake cartridge exploration we're going to be taking a look at some real fake cartridges so um background on these i have tried these before i have tried uh two of them before and now when the time i tried them uh they were definitely a really cheap price and i was thinking to myself like yeah dude i trust my plug these you know looks great oil looks like a good color and um you know it hits okay and i'm getting i'm getting loaded so it's whatever you know 15 a gram it's cool but uh now that i'm older and wiser i know that's kind of dumb like sure you could trust your plug but dude if you're not actually getting the lab results or anything that's really scanned or verified or you don't or like you know if you know or you don't know i mean if you don't know uh what is inside of the cartridge like you didn't see the person fill it up um then don't trust it that's just the rule of thumb here guys like when it comes to concentrates and um cartridges and things like that you might be thinking no one's got time to fake any of that stuff or whatever whatever but honestly they do got the time people make a killing off of these cartridges off of killing people so just be careful what you put into your body and if you're buying cartridges off the street please make sure that is not any any dank vape stuff or any of those weird you know cartoon graphics on the the box just because someone's got a box that's got like a graphic on it doesn't mean anything so guys um i'll show you guys first the worst looking cartridge of them so this is the uh container they came in this is a clear kings i'm not sure if anyone's ever had a real clear kings or anything like that but if you guys have please let me know down know down below in the comments and you know let me know how that was for you so it says here on the front store at room temperature exposure to direct sunlight may cause cartridge to leak or oil to discolor that's something that i thought was going on with this guys this is the cartridge we're working with you see those black splotches and stuff all around it that's that's not supposed to be there you know we see that the black spot just here down there and um you know let's just take a look at a thickness test i'm just going to turn this to the side look how fast just look how fast that oil is traveling that's not that's not natural for your regular oils yeah grab my cart right here real bear lab stuff look at that nothing it's barely moving on this one but look at that it's already almost separated entirely to the bottom see nothing's moving still from this nothing yet and yet in only about 10 to 15 seconds this is already dripping to the bottom so that's another thing that threw me off about the cartridge you know the color and um how fast it was you know moving down and things like that but when i first got it guys it was not this color it was not this color it was like a golden color so let's read a little bit more here on the label and packaging i'm not sure guys if this brand is exactly like a fake brand or not you know i don't want to call them out because for all i know this could be a real brand that's just uh you know getting getting under fire um or getting copied but yeah see this whole thing has you know all these uh labels and websites and you know warnings and things like that but those are really easy to print on to just about anything nowadays so you can't always trust your plug stuff just because it's got a label like i was saying the ingredients here let's see it says distillate and fractionated coconut oil uh on the ingredients there so um yeah that kind of threw me off so when i was first hitting these their flavor was uh the thing that really stood out to me i definitely tasted that little coconutty flavor so that's why i when i first had these i was thinking these are all right you know these aren't too bad i wish they could have better dirt flavors but you know for a small cart brand this isn't that bad 20 15 a gram that's that's way too cheap you know at the time of course i didn't really think about that so yeah this is definitely not good oil definitely not you want your oil to be thick if your oil is moving around this fast it is not all oil this has definitely been cut with something else and that's why it is super liquidy you know another reason why a cartridge may be super liquidy and move around fast is because it's it might be you know surrounded by a lot of heat things like that but in this case it's about room temperature in here guys i've been keeping this in a drawer this is not this one specifically has not seen any sunlight at all so the fact that it has turned this color is definitely alarming so that was this cartridge this uh wedding cake one and so now we'll take a look at the next cartridge we have from the same brand and uh i'm sure same source this one is a runts cartridge so like i said before it's the same same brand and all that stuff so it should have the same ingredients etcetera etcetera but the surprising thing about this one is i've had these for just about the same time and this one still retains its golden color uh it still looks pretty decent you know um one thing i'll also say guys about uh fake cartridges is the rod size so uh here let's actually do another direct comparison between this one and the bear labs car so as you guys can see this cartridge on the left here is a lot thicker in the rod the middle portion than the cartridge on the right here see the rod on this cartridge right there it it's a lot thinner you know it gets thick to the bottom base here but for the most part your cartridges from the dispensary or legal sources are going to have that a lot skinnier rod and you can see here it's just thick all the way down through there it doesn't really get too big towards the bottom there uh when you see the bottom you know what i mean it gets a little bit wider but not by a bit like by too much where as if you look to here the size of it gets a lot bigger towards the bottom so yeah if you see um cartridges with just rods that are way too big down and you know the ones in the middle that's another sign that you could be dealing with a fake cartridge so these rods uh the thicker rods here allow for less product to be placed in so typically you see these on the street because uh street plugs can just short you easily they can just give you like .75 in a cartridge that's supposed to hold a gram and it'll still look full because uh you know the rod's bigger now one thing i'll say is that sometimes uh oil gets stuck in the wick so when you do buy from dispensaries if something looks like it's a little a little under it's definitely just some stuff that is stuck in the wick of the cartridge so yeah this is the same exact thing you know same exact cartridge except for the oil now let's do the liquidy test here and as you can as you guys can see it's a little bit thicker than the previous one but still that bubble is moving way too fast guys way too fast so if if you're if your oils are doing something like this in just the span of like five to ten seconds i highly suggest you put that [ __ ] down because you have just no idea what's going on with that anymore um so yeah look i know there's some people out there who uh your plug might be your only cartridge source or um you know you might be in a legal state so it's just a lot harder to get legit things but um i just have to encourage you guys to please be safe these could these can like you know fake cartridges can literally kill you or destroy your lungs if you don't want it you know if you don't care whether you smoke more or you know like every day pretty much for the next 20 years then go ahead and smoke more fake cartridges it's definitely gonna bust up your lungs like i said guys i tried two of these i thought it was okay but on my second one i knew something was fishy because my throat was getting scratchy i was coughing on hits like that were not supposed to make me cough you know i was taking small baby hits of a regular flower and that [ __ ] was making me cough my throat was itchy and scratchy for days i wasn't breathing right for a little bit and that was just off a few puffs of a second cartridge so you know i'm one you know wondering what would have happened if i had continued to smoke that cartridge all the way down to the to the end you know some people will smoke their fake carts and feel totally fine and just keep going with it and for those people i mean do you you know i'm just encouraging people to to smoke safe and be safe because at the end of the day when it comes to concentrates people can put whatever they want in it man i'm not saying stay off it's just like you know stop popping off your plug when it comes to you know your meds or whatever do whatever you want um you know flour can be overpriced at the dispensary but when it comes to cartridges and concentrates guys please please try to make sure you know what's getting put in it and you know what where it's being sourced from all that stuff you know you want to know as much as possible about these concentrates because pesticides can slip in there pines i've heard people slipping pine sole into cartridges you know actual cleaner that's like pledges and stuff like that like that's that's crazy that's you know like i said it's poison so once again guys let's take a a final look here the one on the left has all those little weird black splotches and things like that the one on the right still looks totally fine um but again guys the way those bubbles move way too fast so we can do let's do a quick little comparison of the bubbles here um obviously the one on the left is uh traveling a little bit faster because i think the bubble is bigger you know there's less product in there and um another thing is i hit it a bit so maybe it's been heated up a bit and whatever was liquefying uh or you know was liquefied in there is a lot like more uh i don't know the word i'm forgetting it but a lot more movable but yeah i'm definitely not going to be trying any of these guys i'm really only holding onto these for reference so yeah i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did please leave a like comment subscribe and i'll be you know talking more about fake cartridges as time goes along answering questions uh dropping more knowledge that i know about them and things like that but uh yeah this was a good thing for i guess people who would want to know from an eye test how to tell if their cartridge is uh fake or at least how to know if i should be a little suspicious about it so yeah thanks everyone for watching if you enjoyed as always please leave a like comment and subscribe p2 out peace you", "DEHVLWHCezA": "[Music] hi guys welcome back to my channel it's the next day AB for 2020 we know everything is weird right here so I don't even matter okay today it's [ __ ] us [ __ ] I'm gonna just say this I have my car turned off all the windows are up it's a sunny being of course my dumb ass is wearing black leggings I'm going up here but let's get this bread today I will be taking um some edibles from heavy hitters and I didn't even know heavy hitters had edibles to be honest we've got hooked up at a dispensary that we go to so shout out to them go check them out Canizares Club in Los Angeles California and I will also be reviewing this cartridge it's Girl Scout cookies and it is a hybrid this is one full gram before we start let's go before we start let me go ahead and just say that I'm probably not gonna be looking at the right at the camera like right off the camera probably gonna because I'm I'm recording off my phone so I'm mainly looking at the screen so I do apologize for that let's go ahead and do a bubble test three four five six seven eight nine ten there we go legit [ __ ] you know that's a quick easy way to find out if you have a fake heart or not go with us I feel like we should start off with the apples cuz you know what I don't I like the best so far the best has been look at Karma I would definitely say and there's five pieces 20 milligrams in each so a total of 100 milligrams they're both packages so 200 milligrams strawberry favor mmm bro these are good you can help taste the strawberry mmm little bit of weed they're not too much out on like not an unknowable tastes of wheat how many days every trade day edibles we're just straight-up taste like me like I cannot do that up throw load these are fire and I'm not really a candy person either but I would definitely be munching on these little snack like when you're going to the movies just snack you just put a little sneak a little pack in your bag be eating this while the movie starts mm-hmm clean kind of is guaranteed okay so the instructions and back says heat one to two servings and wait 90 minutes for a fix so that's an hour and thirty minutes within one to two so how long now I also do have work at 4:00 p.m. but I'm honestly taking the risk because it's two milligrams 200 milligrams I mean and I know my buddy can take it so I'm not taking something forward then no I'm not going to be like for sure I would not do the good karma leave for work cuz I know at the end of the day I'm gonna end up being slumped as [ __ ] and I cannot be like yeah just pause there they're sugary but you know what I noticed about these um I have three laps out of ten and edibles like taco gummies and sugary things like they usually get me very dehydrated quick that's work and I feel like this one it wasn't like too bad at all like I feel like I should have finished all ten without drinking water you know and I did connect to my doctor zodiac battery I've been having this battery for a while dude like a while I lost like I had a purple and a green one and I broke one and then I always lose my [ __ ] and then like I put it into water like I don't know I just [ __ ] them up but this one is the one that and I've had this one for a long time now and it's hella less of me like hella lasted me it's a really good battery okay okay I think I'm using their own how many filming also right outside um my mom's came to visit my brother my parents I'm working my mom is wreaking getting high you guys I'm pretty sure these hits are gonna come in like painting me more because just me but whenever I'm in an enclosed space obviously it's a hotbox can hit you more second of all the heat I just feel like that has like a big toll on your time sometimes it can be cool sometimes it can like sometimes it's I can't stand the heat and being high like it's both together it's frustrating and it makes you like I don't know it's just it's very smooth I don't think unnerving I was about to say I don't think I've tried on heavy hitters like a real heavy hitters and the real reason the reason why I say a real one is because I come from a very small town and all we have around here is black marketing products as in cartridges the weed isn't you know verified we don't know what it is Tilly put they put in it like yeah some shake and get you high interests and stuff like that like I'm not saying nothing like it's not gonna get you high but you don't know how many percent if it's just to see that they're putting in it that's what I'm trying to say like you don't know what for sure you're getting in but all your cartridges or anything so I honestly would rather and I've said this many times but I honestly rather [ __ ] to the Drive more money you know spend more money unverified real products that are legitimately I'm not gonna give me 6 but I would but back then when I started smoking I wasn't much informed like I am now I'm not formed all the way obviously but I am for more than I am back then and I didn't know anything about black marketing or like I'll you know what all I knew was I was 18 and they were late as long as you were 18 they were living you in its shop as long as you had an ID um yeah that's all obviously girls like damn I'm 18 and I can go into the shops now that's hella cool um hey yeah I'm trying to get high and I the last products the better for me you know it would take it would be less and they would give me my life that was the deal for me I was like there's no better deal than that cheap weed and again yuh-huh yeah um I ended up moving to San Diego and I started going to dispensary close by where I lived and they were verified and I actually did try my first real um cartridge of heavy hitters or anything that was my first legal dispensary my very very first legal dispensary oh my gosh you guys one of these days I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna take you guys back to my very first leave with this ministry that I went to in San Diego like that's when I walked in there I was like whoa like whoa this is so different and as even before I walked into the actual dispensary like being in the actual dispensary dispensary just outside like there's a security um like an armed security you had to have your license outside already like on you and they were asking for it and they were checking you like they had that little beeping ping that they detected have like anything you know on weapons so they they they did that and then we walked into the into the building and it was like a little hmm it was a entrance basically and the late you have to register you have to like register if your new patient or if you're a returning patient where you just give them the idea you go in but if you're a first-time patient you have to like register and get my information and you obviously have to be 18 and you had to be 18 with the wreck and the very very very very first time damn I'm going up traffic topic traffic topic guys if you guys want to know about my first time going to dispensary comment down below because I'm going off-track of traffic I'm on topic with this video so I'm just rambling let's take a blink right now but the point is they're bomb like they're deaf it's definitely a better hit then versus the [ __ ] black marketing products this guy is literally going so I'm on a jet feels like in front of my mom's I parked on the dirt field and there was a car coming like just straight forward like it's gonna into me what time is it I don't have a watch I'm actually a xylophone I wish like [ __ ] it's Venice boom Thank You bombs like no cup missing your no cap is like [Music] I'll go ahead and get back to you guys I definitely better go inside [Music] honey how are you guys I hope you guys have a great day and until next time bye I just have myself alright guys so I'm currently in the Popeyes drive-through line I want my break food I feel I'm I'm sure those edibles definitely kicked in it's more of a body high with edibles for me because I definitely feel it in my body I feel like I need a nap [Music] I just feel very slung I need a nap tell me I'm hungry I was hungry I work a few snacks then I was snacking on them and they were supposed to last me throughout the whole night but yeah but overall they were pretty cool it was a it was something that was wouldn't like it's all I've done like a thousand milligrams I definitely wouldn't have been able to do it going to work because I would have been even more slumped I am right now it's something that I can tolerate actually some guys guys", "4FcDrBMv3hY": "hey what up with everybody hope you're doing great welcome back to another stoney review today i got a real special review for you guys the homies over at math labs hit me up they're like yo stoney you can't be smoking those fake carts anymore man we got you so they went and sent me a stoney care package a couple different strains let me get a pound of your swedish chibok damn something told me to bring a lot of weed man today we got this one it's nice knowing that there's people and companies out there that actually care about other people and don't want to see them smoking on no hot dog water so without further ado let's get this going and get this package open for the package feels nice and sturdy it's got a cool logo right here that's where i want to be to the moon hopefully i'm hanging out with this guy by the end of this review got the math labs up top a little design there on the bottom you got the strain name skittles indica got the sticker right there sealing it shut on the side you got a qr code so we'll scan that in a minute and then on this side we got the thc and the cbd so for the thc we got 89 for the cbd we got two percent and then the back it's pretty cool got the window right there so you can see the car so far the oil looks pretty good blasting off to the moon so this is where you start that's where you end up let's uh scan this qr code see what comes up so after you scan it it gives you the lab results and i mean the full lab result four pages now it tells you everything that it passed tells you the percentages and it tells you all the canopy nodes that are inside of it on the next page and um it also tests for pesticides as well as heavy metals wow that's awesome so that's good news the qr code works let's get this opened up just take that sticker off wow this box is really nice whoever uh created these boxes and made this design did a really good job want to smoke so the part looks nice too it looks nice and sturdy let's take it out and see what it's about i really like how there's a qr code on the inside too it's legit as you can see the cart is completely full not even a bubble inside of it so we'll do the bubble test once we put a dent in it it's looking good it's got this nice cap at the bottom in case you want to store it so for the package i really like this parts nice and sturdy package is sturdy got the window unless you got the rocket to blast off i'm gonna have to give this one a 420 out of 420 even though there's no stickers on the inside not a mercy they still got the qr code and it gives you a lot of information in there so that's dope right there definitely a 420 out of 420 for the package now let's see what this uh flavor is all about the battery i'm using today is the th 710 box mod and it's a really good battery if you're looking for a new one i'd suggest getting this it lasts for days anyways let's get right into this flavor test [Music] [Music] these taste really really good definitely you could taste skittles definitely could taste weak like this tastes like some straight cali oil that's where this company is from mad labs i just took a couple blinkers and a couple of small hits on the lowest temp and i'm already feeling them so i can tell you right now this is some legit oil this is good stuff right here let's do one more blinker and then we're going to rate the flavor and we'll increase the temperature and rate the high here we go cheers [Music] so for the flavor i'm gonna have to give this one a 400 out of 420 because it tastes bomb definitely tastes like skittles and it definitely has a good wheat taste to it like some cali oil for sure let's take a couple hits and rate the high so now we're gonna turn the temperature up there we go off the blue [Music] definitely uh taste the weed a lot more with that it's temperature nice smooth bit [Music] it's good in the chest i would definitely say i'm pretty stoned i felt a nice head change off [Music] that last hit was so good i started to cry thank you matlab [Music] for the high i'm gonna have to give this one a 420 out of 420 damn just killing it all across the board today because i am faded right now i don't know if i'm to be doing any more blinkers maybe let's increase the temperature so we can give this a total score here we go so before we get into the last test see how much of a dent we've put in it now let's see if do this for about 30 seconds that oil looks really good though whoa okay people are watching oil looks nice and thick i don't really see it moving that's good so it's a little bit over 30 seconds still exactly where it was at so that's a good sign hell yeah [Music] you guys probably thought i was using the wires [Music] i had to plug it in because it drained all the batteries smoking it so imagine where it's full potential on this battery i said it would have smacked even harder so for the overall score ladies and gentlemen i think we have our first ever 420 out of 420 here on this channel matt labs congratulations fire oil i would definitely suggest getting it this is bomb i stick by my story i'm from jamaica and i'm not just saying that because they sent me these for free i mean it and that just goes to show you right there they believe in their product they're gonna send it to somebody for free so known youtube i can't tell you guys how to get these yourself but you can add me on snapchat and uh yeah but you know the deal mad labs thank you so much for watching i appreciate you guys make sure you hit the thumbs up if you enjoyed the video subscribe if you knew because i do reviews all the time and uh for everybody that stuck around here's a little preview for next week's review math labs pink champagne so stay tuned stay up and stay stoney until next time peace i can't end the video without doing a blinker on the highest temperature so here we go one more temperature up white let's go to the moon still checking this no",

bunch of stoners he said everybody much love [Music]", "WwCPV68P4a0": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplicity here back with another video if you can tell from the title it is another wax video some diamonds today actually and what a coincidence you guys have been mentioning about west coast companies and stuff and i mentioned you know there's like a west coast company coming out every month um this one is west coast skier and this is actually a company i've tried before their cartridge so uh this has been around this guy these guys have been around and uh this was 27 out the door i will be playing a video of it right now but as with diamonds it's running with a high percentage of thc uh total cannabinoid is 95.4 percent um thc 82.5 and the strain is papaya cake and papaya to me is very familiar in tasting with guava so uh that's what i i'm assuming i think i think i've had a papaya before and i'll just like guava so uh but yes i already opened it it looks good smells good 27 out the door and it goes to say with all their stuff west coast gear had their diamonds live resin butter or whatever they were all the same price i believe at authentic and the smell is there you know i'm saying which is surprising because with diamonds there's not really too much smell or taste um so i'm i'm hoping that these taste as good as they smell but it's definitely gonna get me smacked up we got the dip no i'm saying oh i just turned it off but let's just turn that on leave this cap over here and get a big diamond for the people [ __ ] people are always saying like i take small dabs i'm like well it's not a competition i take enough for me to get high you know i'm saying it's not a race it's not a competition you know since when was smoking weed and relaxing a competition you know i'm saying like it's really crazy what like people trip over especially on a video on youtube someone you don't even know you know i'm saying like so what if i'm taking small dabs it's like that's so that's so weird you know the bigger dabs you take the higher tolerance you have you know and in turn just that's a lot of money cheers uh there's no taste i don't think yeah there's no days so i would suggest you get like a very flavorful wax like raw garden or something and then mix a little bit of that sauce with this kind of like what i was doing with the delta eight you know put more of the delta eight and then some of the wax that you've been trying to save and uh it'll basically just take over the wax taste will take over the distillate or in this case the diamonds so uh you can actually get like fat hits and actually make use of shittier lower like not lower quality but like lower potency wax you know mix it with this i can definitely see me using that like that but as far as like taste goes maybe maybe i just got it wrong [Music] so i'm gonna pack that one more time for this video but as far as the taste goes there is none it smells good though or maybe a that's the thing with diamonds guys i don't know if you guys know but like if you're gonna get diamonds try to get like the saucy diamonds you know with like 50 50 sauce and 50 diamonds but cheers guys might i say i am [ __ ] stoned i'll tell you that right now the other video i did of the cali blaze was like an hour ago i'm continuing the ride i wonder if since this doesn't smell or tastes like any air doesn't taste like anything if it smells right all right guys so for its price 27 it's not bad i probably should have purchased um alongside another one of their their cartridge uh they're i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned guys i purchased another one of their wax concentrates like maybe the live resin instead of the diet or not uh purchase the live resin and the diamonds and just mix them when i take hits that would have been dope but yeah as far as like if it gets you high it definitely does but i knew this coming in buying diamonds most likely not going to be like any taste if so minimal um so i i knew what i was going into just kind of sucks that the kelly blaze kind of tastes like all right so if i were to be mixing any wax it'd be those two and it's like damn i could have had another west coast cure or a raw garden you know but other than that hopefully you did enjoy this wax video check out west coast cure if you're looking for some affordable diamonds with no taste but it doesn't matter if it doesn't have no taste you can just mix it with some other stuff but i can see some people saying that you know like what the [ __ ] no taste [ __ ] that [ __ ] but it is cheap diamonds are usually i would say 35 and up so um for at 27 is a eye catcher to say the least you know but other than that hopefully you didn't enjoy this video i would do like i would do i i would like to mention that i'm pretty [ __ ] stoned right now so i haven't started like this in in a while in a video so that definitely means something but other than that hopefully you did enjoy the video peace out [Music] you", "NxEAgqkpn1k": "if you could buy the packaging online then you don't know what is in it but this could have been cup of vitamin e caught with something else kind of sauce you know i got to have grub but i have the granola okay all right he had a bunch of in there i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge when you're dealing with the black market remember that there's risk it's never 100 i just felt like i was going to faint i realized that there's something wrong with me on the news two or three people have already died [Music] it's interesting that a lot of these cases fell off in the fall of 2019 it's true it's gone and that's what puzzles us the most like where these people are still vaping out there we see them all the time like what happened why aren't they coming in anymore vaping illness blamed antifa is [Music] as clickbait headlines warp our view of the world we're going down the rabbit hole to ask how afraid should we really be on this episode the mysterious vaping illnesses of 2019 that created a media frenzy the centers for disease control is warning people to stop using e-cigarettes following several mysterious deaths linked to vaping the cdc investigating a medical mystery spreading across the country tonight two new deaths in minnesota bring the nationwide total to 31 deaths three-quarters were using thc containing products doctors are now warning the public about what they call ivali there was a lot of confusion at first was this an e-cigarette thing a tec thing there were a lot of question marks what we know now is that a lung injury called evali peaked in september of 2019. by february 2020 2800 cases and 68 deaths were linked to the injury but where did divali come from and should we still be afraid of vaping i started going down the rabbit hole by first reaching out to greg rodriguez who was sick with the volume in september 2019. i remember thinking that it was a miracle you know these vapes because there was no smell yeah no more no more dryer sheets right i remember i remember those days but yeah exactly tell me about the onset of you starting to get sick i felt very dehydrated i felt like i was my chest was just becoming very tight it started to vomit like a greenish yellowish type substance which in hindsight it was what was this vitamin e acetate that my body was trying to reject after checking into a hospital in queens greg was put into a coma by doctors and brought here to the long island jewish hospital we sat down with greg's physician who treated greg along with some of the first divali cases in new york so how did you meet greg so we got called from one of our sister hospitals forest hills uh that they had a young patient that they had just put on events later in the er they wanted to let us know that they were worried they were going to run into trouble and could we think about putting him on ecmo what is ecmo exactly ecmo's extracorporeal membrane oxygenation where we take the blood out of someone's body and we oxygenate it in an oxygenator outside of the body and then put it back in so we use it as a replacement for your lungs when your lungs are not working and it sort of buys you time for your lungs to get better i think we cleaned out his lungs every single day for the first two days and what came back with him was just this thick caramel looking stuff just his lungs were filled with it this is his original chest x-ray when he came in and if you look here you could see that both of the lungs are involved there's the lungs should all be black like that and his lungs you can see have a lot of white areas here none of that should be there what exactly in the vaping caused these illnesses i still think we don't know for sure i think a lot of people have a lot of different theories and some think it was the vitamin e that was mixed in with the vaping product and some people think it was the flavoring some people think it was just the marijuana the way that it was heated and mixed in some way so i think we have an exact answer while the science is not fully understood it's thought that additives in the vaping oils break down and change when heated at the high temperatures required for vaping when these substances cool down they may cause inflammation or coat the walls of the lungs and debris unprepared for these foreign objects the lungs push the body into crisis mode when these came out we started to see news stories like you should stop smoking e-cigarettes this is an e-cigarette thing and then it slowly shifted that the story the picture became a little bit more clear that it was oh maybe it's mostly thc products but then still certain people said that they didn't vape thc that it was only nicotine do you believe that it's possible to get some of these illnesses from just vaping nicotine or do you think that they maybe weren't exactly being totally truthful we definitely saw patients who told us it was they only were taking nicotine i think they were truthful i do think that they don't know what they were taking for craig that's exactly what happened basically yeah i had decided to stop buying off the street and then i decided to take the risk of buying them in bulk on the dark web so i thought i hit the jackpot and it turns out that i made a huge mistake with uh trying to get a good deal when i first started to vape it was easy to spot a fake car then summer 2019 these these fake cars um came out the oil inside it was so thick and it just looked the same color it just felt so real what greg is referring to here is known as the bubble test a low-fi way to spot a fake cart a high purity distillate would mean the bubble in the cartridge moves slowly or not at all when it is turned upside down however pure thc extract can be too thick to constantly flow to the coil so cutting agents like terpenes can be added for both flavor and flow counterfeiters who might dilute the product for bigger profits could then add vitamin e acetate to re-thicken the extract fooling the bubble test and the consumer the cdc says that vitamin e acetate is strongly linked to the valley outbreak in 2019 but how prevalent is this dirty card industry i asked greg how hard it was to find a marketplace in the dark web anyone who wants to know would just go on google and type in dark web best marketplaces okay it seems like you know it's that easy you know but yeah it really is after some surprisingly easy google searches i booted up my vpn downloaded tor and started browsing the dark web you're going on the dark web don't you want to go oh okay we're in the tour all right so now i'm on the dark web what do we got here you get a fake id driver's license to have lsd for 30 bucks euro bank notes wow you can get counterfeit money on here unbelievable just spend money to make money what if i find my credit card information on here that'd be really wild okay we're here for purpose we're just looking for weed cannabis concentrates live resin better than sex better than money is it after finding dozens of vendors at dell thc carts i slid into some dms well i didn't get too many responses back i did get a suggestion i could easily find dirty carts in places like liquor or corner stores with some spots in mind i met up with the dower hour aficionado and sometimes camera operator taji amin to do some undercover research so we're in brooklyn right now where cannabis is legal but that doesn't mean that you can't buy underground thc cartridges at a number of smoke and vape shops so we're gonna go look around see what these stores have and i'm wearing a wire and uh hopefully i don't get caught can't see anything right can't see anything i'm wearing a wire here look okay all right let's go check it out oh i'm so sketched out by myself i wouldn't sell to me all right hey man you guys got greens no no okay no go no go there's a couple more down here i think it was a little sketched out by me though i mean we just look like we're hanging out right [Music] right okay the next one's right up here and then what's going on you got any greens right now growth and these are legit right these uh these are bootleg right how much are they 140. all right one day when i get paid man i'll be back all right so you had a bunch of in there they were 140 a piece all right we're going just across the street hey man how's it going how are you doing good how are you doing do you guys have greens thc cartridges yeah how much of these guys 70 70. 45. yeah it's good stuff i've read about though i've read that they they've got the bootleg but there's bootlegs out there these uh so far people coming all right that's all good man thanks dude yeah uh he had a bunch of carts he had like half grams of grams i don't know it's kind of hard to tell about you know what's bootleg and what's not we were given a sample of a bodega bot thc cartridge there's nothing in these right now so i'm not in possession of thc it looked real to me with nice packaging and branding but was it i connected with push a distributor of thc carts in new york city to see if he knew anything about these corner store carts i went shopping for some cartridges at a bodega do like any of your you know i don't do nothing like that no you know where those cards come from i mean most likely they come from l.a if not somebody maybe they make them here the thc cartridges that you're selling out here are they licensed to be made in california yeah some of them all have that are actual have license and there's a lot of vape brands in california that operate in the gray market they have their own original packaging and their own original you know liquid but they don't want to jump through the hoops to get licensed what's the quality of something that's in the gray market sure i mean you can find really good  like i try to stick with brands that haven't gotten so big that they're you know counterfeited if i could buy the packaging oh mine i don't want that i showed push the sample we had obtained to get his opinion on it the main thing is the packaging like this is you know somebody spent good money to to design all this they got big enough and then somebody else said well we want to rip that brand off and they knew somebody a graphic designer they knew somebody in china and they just duplicated it and now this is a clone you don't know what the is in this it's not like you met big chief right right i don't know big chief sure so now you're doing the bubble test right well that ain't moving okay that's not moving so somebody that would only go by the bubble test would say oh this is good because this  don't move it's not moving at all [Music] which would probably mean that you don't want to hit this thing rather than the bubble test push showed me what he called the google test to avoid counterfeit brands so big chief packaging is what you showed me right so the first thing that pops up is that holy so let me see that again this is exactly okay look you could buy 150 pieces of this at 214 a piece wow that looks legit right so that yeah that looks nice that looks exactly the same holy so i have no idea you don't know what this is you don't know what's in that push showed me a number of different cart brands that have counterfeit clones each of them looking like the real deal big chief right now their actual website was all the way down here do they have anything on their side about you know uh yeah here's how to verify the problem okay is there a code somewhere there it is oh not authentic no way yeah so somebody's selling this at bodegas in brooklyn it is not legitimate that's just crazy man yeah google test google test google test for the win realizing that i had a counterfeit cartridge i had to find out what was actually in this thing i reached out to pro verde labs to run some tests on our sample the lab results that came back were alarming to say the least the sample exceeded the acceptable amount for eight pesticides as well as containing concentration of vitamin e acetate we saw this in there at about eight percent little eight and a half percent this is potentially deadly this this particular cartridge the pesticides were there at such a heavy concentration that we had to do further dilutions uh enable to analyze that and still be within our calibration per range wow it's unusual that they're this heavily contaminated were you surprised to find vitamin e acetate in in this cartridge i was it's well known there's better alternatives i thought by now that there would be no more in production and that what had been produced would have already been either purchased consumed or disposed of apparently that's not the case and then in addition i mean you usually find some levels of pesticides but this one had um a lot of pesticides you know we see in this one biphenyzate at 190 000 parts per billion this is 190 times what would be permissible in california i don't know what the long-term effect of consuming a product like this would be but it's not good the pesticides were not meant to be put in our body are vaping products safe or is the market just so unregulated that it's not even worth the risk all states now have a a supply chain of regulated safe produced products if you're sourcing products from reputable uh suppliers i don't think that there's any concern for that so i'm just curious to know as a professional like yourself what do you think the media got right and what do you think the media got wrong in this situation i think as as human beings we try to simplify things into our what we're capable of understanding and i think the problem with the vape crisis is it's a very very complex issue when we see these acute things happening people dying we look for the culprit and i think it's so hard because i think there's a mixture of components that may be responsible for the hazards associated with it not just the vitamin e acetate so the vitamin e acetate is very much like that could affect you in the very short term whereas these other other the flavorings and the pesticides we don't know what the long-term consequences of them are sure they could be they could result in you know generations of increased lung cancer because of these we don't we don't know you know these could be 10 20 years out till we do we understand it i mean think about the the tobacco industry and we may find the same thing 10 years down the road with vape products associated with cannabis or nicotine this story doesn't really have an ending toxic vape cartridges will continue to flood the streets nicotine thc legal gray market and black market it's out there and even though we don't hear much about a volley anymore it still seems very easy to find vitamin e acetate and counterfeit cartridges the news cycle seems to have washed away the story as we all moved on to more immediate problems which there are a lot of these days but whether you vape or are impacted by stories that have faded from the front page the only way to stay informed is to take matters into your own hands and do what push does google it [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign", "sPzdZQoyw-0": "what the [ __ ] is up for training me I am backing the episode today i just have an idea at work I picked up a West Coast cure court on Friday open

mania [Music]", "Y3vRyew74g4": "[Music] what's up Isaac Lucic here back with another new Intel entitled this is going to be another cartridge review and this is a pretty new company I've never heard of but this smell free cannabis company and they were kind enough to give me a voucher to purchase one of these for $2 and they actually let me try some of their stuff to they have live resin cartridges and they also have cured resin cartridges and her cured live resin cartridges mind you man from what I remember when they let me sample both of them I definitely remember that the cured lie breath and tasted so so good I believe this one's going to be there their live resin one another thing that they mentioned to me which was surprising was that that they're live resin cartridges also has distillate in here so I'm not too sure I mean I'm pretty sure they said that about that but I could be wrong so correct me if I'm wrong the free canvas company but we're gonna be using the pocket you guys already know I will have the link and the one description below if you guys are going to check that out this is a pretty expensive batteries so please check your other alternatives or other options before you finally decide on this because what I like does not mean you like it you know I'm saying I like it because it's a very I it's just a smooth sleek design and build it has a nice feel to it but it is pretty pricey so like I said please just uh know what you're getting into know what you're buying I'm checking all other alternatives because this channel is cool about cannabis content and all and stuff but it's also you know save you a few bucks let you know about the products and always trying to save you some money guys always at the end of the day money is how you gave [ __ ] so I'm trying to hit you I'm trying to help you guys get the best [ __ ] that you can possibly get but not to talking this is going to be strawberry [ __ ] guys very very good stuff [Music] yes I do in a car cut and yes this is the new bandana I'm actually washing the other one so like I got sick of the skull the skull is actually better than polka-dots only have this one because it's black and a black bandana is less is non-threatening at least the gang members you know if I wear a red bandana I could get a shot blue shot black maybe not so much you know so I'm going to open this by the percentage of THC is 86 percent guys you can see right here I'm going too fast and I am sorry right off the back they use the same as select you can see very similar to the select plastic kit from iceless leg and right that kind of smell strawberries so this could definitely be mixed distillate [Music] good yeah [Music] before I get into the review or talk about that hit you might be noticing a faint man noises because I got a fan outside the window so it mentally it's better my room has been getting hot lately it's just because there's probably a lot of electronics there's a lot of people in my room constantly so a fan that attaches to the window is pretty good and it's actually going outward so it's sucking all the hot air out and uh yeah getting into the cart it taste like strawberries not too much I can say about the flavor other than if it tastes like strawberries not too overly powerful you know I do it does fade away quickly just like this lid does you know you but this Li exhales you get that full flavor boat it goes away pretty quick I'm not sure if it's just this lip [Music] so free cannabis fun so like I said earlier there live present and then have cured live resin and their live resin is mixed look a little bit of distillate is what I remember them saying and let's be real like come on this is the way and it tastes like strawberry I mean like live resident tastes like strawberry there's got to be some sort of like terpenes or strawberry terpenes in there that they put in there you know that's definitely not from the plant that I feel like you know some people like the discreteness of oh this guy's just smoking strawberry vape or whatever you know but yes it is good but yes guys this is a legit company okay I actually went to come all the flowers and picked it up I will post their information right here also in the description below and I'd like to mention you know guys just be careful with the cartridges that you were smoking I've been smoking cartridges for a while and nothing has ever happened yeah I always buy cartridges from the dispensary never have I I mean I've tried a few but I don't really buy them like I've tried my homies he usually goes to the sessions and I'm not gonna like I've tried you didn't really like it but I've tried you know yes free cannabis company guys I really really am enjoying this cartridge I'm not gonna lie but you guys already know me I like that I like the cartridges that taste like so but like I said they're cured light resin has that taste so if you do see this company try their cured live recipe try both it does matter try them next to each other and you can actually tell the difference because that's what I did at the booth and yes hopefully you guys enjoyed this video this brand is not bad I don't know the pricing of this I actually have not seen this at my local dispensaries or on weed maps and malls are selling it pretty cheap at the Hall of flowers by a walrus it won't reflect what you're going to be seeing at the dispensary so I can tell you the price $20 for a program $15 $15 I believe it was $15 for the regular live resin cartridges this year and then $20 or the cured live resin but like I said these prices won't reflect what you will see at the dispensary but I am liking this definitely like the cured resin better but I'm not gonna clean about this one if you guys like strawberry taste water looting stuff I really really would recommend this we'll take one more and then [Music] [Music] and there's cloud Stephanie cloud but yeah other than that I'll see you guys [Music]", "NOLg9M-NiXM": "what's up ho means to afford greenery you guys already know what's good you know what's goin down we got some of that [ __ ] fight Oh extractions picked up some of

going to be doing a review on a cartridge i'll be doing a review on a select co2 oil cartridge the strain is cinex which i believe is a cross between cindy 99 and pineapple express so um i grabbed this one because this one looks really really nice you've seen it you can check my other videos if not but um check out the other co2 oil carts from them and they look like some standard co2 oil like fairly dark oil this one looks incredible same price same like batch as all the other co2 oils but it looked great so let me turn the camera around and show you then i'll take a couple puffs [Music] hmm [Applause] [Music] hey [Music] wow [Music] alrighty so let's get into this um first off i'll correct myself by saying it is actually a cross between cindy 99 or cinderella 99 and vortex i had not heard of vortex prior to this but seems like a good strain um very interested after just reading a quick leafly article about this strain seems like it's heavy on um less on the mirror scene in the cardiophiline which i get bored of seems like it's heavy on pinene and limonene potentially which i really like so first off trying to make more videos but struggling to find the time and motivation and also more so just not get greedy because i recently just bought like a gram of six star hash rosin that i was wanting to make a video on but i just got into it way too quick and didn't even take a picture prior to me opening it so i feel like that's not the best way to make a video so i'll buy another gram eventually and get a video on it and it was super great um but first let's start with what we have here cine cynix um so let's see it first off amazing for their co2 oil you normally don't get anything besides like that dark black oil basically which i'm not against for the price that it goes at it's pretty good stuff wow that's one of the best cards i've had in a good while um definitely has like a little base layer i always notice a heavier notes first a little bit of like that peppery taste but it is strong with the definitely taste a good bit of pinene in there and then maybe some like lemonade as well lemony is always light to me so if there's a lot i couldn't tell anyways that really really evens it out it's not it's always like such a standard boilerplate co2 oil taste which is a lot like whiskey or like there's usually a lot of humiliating in there this one it's got i mean it's got the slightest bit of that taste to it but it has so many other like terpenes going on that it overpowers that easily and that it's good it's uh it's very citrusy but it's like a heavy citrus it reminds me of grape with but it doesn't it's not like grape flavor it just reminds me of grapes grapes like a heavy fruity taste to me it's like um orange and mango is kind of mixed with like a peppery peppery main taste yeah so that's all i got on this one really but i mean that is a solid cart right there for their select co2 line highly highly um hats off to them because that's really really well done so thanks for watching i'm going to try and get more videos out especially some new brands not just the same old stuff but unfortunately there's not many new brands to work with so yeah i'll see what i can do but thanks for watching and grab one of these check it through the window of the cart first but even the dark ones look are pretty decent in my opinion but i mean if you see one like this go for it alright thanks for watching you'll have a great", "qhSRUwzR3Ko": "[Music] smoking what's good guys stony rob here back for another youtube video i hope you guys are having an amazing day because mine is going amazing like every other day in today's video i have a reddit can ready cartridge this is uh a cannabis extract this goes on my good supply vape and we're gonna be trying this out [Music] it's a og kush cannabis train today i've tried out the og kush i've reviewed it on this channel you can check it out i'll put a link in the description down below but today we're going to be checking out the ready cartridge by the company ready can og kush so without further ado let's get started so like i said here we have the ready can and the ready cartridge 510 uh thread it's it has a net weight of 0.5 kilograms the net volume of the contents inside of it is .45 milliliters it has 790 milligrams of thc and has a total of 79 percent thc 0.03 cbd ingredients cannabis extract terpenes this is what i guess gives it the og kush flavor and yeah here we have the og kush and i can give you the back specifications here we have the warning symbol uh it says warning the smoke from cannabis is harmful toxic and carcinogenic chemicals found in tobacco smoke such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons aromatic ammons and an air tube and n heterocyclics are also found in cannabis smoke i don't know what the hell that means but yeah this is the warning sign there you have it uh so without further ado let's open it up um like this bang and here we have the cartridge the og kush cartridge and yeah let's pop it out yeah here it is with the cartridge let's pop out the seal bang wow and let's whip on cartridge and here we have it oh yeah perfect great success here we are thc logo the r logo i'm gonna be trying it out i'm not gonna be doing a blinker that's obvious ha ha [ __ ] a blinker and i'm turning this on and yeah cheers guys i'm gonna take a nice fat rip off this dab pan and yeah i'm gonna see if it tastes good doesn't taste good i don't know does it taste like og kush i'm gonna find out in like a few seconds so let's get it cheers i'ma let it preheat first my bad let's get it not bad not bad at all hold up yep get a little sip of my timmy here i'm not even gonna lie this actually tastes good i can kind of feel the taste of the og cushion it that og kush taste but yeah cheers let's take another hit yeah this is hitting pretty well i'm enjoying it as for now i'ma let the the high settle in oh no it's making me feel good good og kush i honestly i'm just curious to see if it's gonna give me that nice ogeekush mellow high yeah it's settling in what i like about wax the distillate that goes in this is that it's almost the insta buzz it doesn't take some time for it to settle in so yeah do you guys enjoy dab pens i don't know i'm smoking this right now because i just did my wisdom teeth and i'm trying to find the alternative as to like smoking harsh tobacco backwood smoke and yeah i'm trying out distillate for now well i guess wax dabs that pen and yeah it's doing the job right it's not hurting me too much i have a little bit of pain right now but yeah whatever i'm uh medicating myself with this you know what i mean yeah but it it tastes pretty good it's not too harsh um i mean i guess it has that og kush taste but like it's not as strong or prominent as smoking the bud itself like obviously there's some sort of difference in the taste of the distillate like i'm pretty sure if you'd give me like og kush distill it and like i don't know another strain and i'd be like yeah i mix them up right yeah but like if you give me og kush bud and you'd give me like rock star bud and compare the two i'd be like this one's oj kush this one's rockstar kush you know like i'd be able to taste it smell it and feel that this one's oj kush this one's a rock star you know i mean and this nah i can't really taste the difference mostly it tastes like distillate wax you know it tastes like concentrate um i'm gonna take another hit yeah i want to give you guys a close-up yeah so i'd recommend this pretty good i give it like a seven out of ten i'm no way shape or form also encouraging buying this product i'm not encouraging the consumption just saying it is a good distillate good taste in it's by itself is very good you know i mean the product itself is good um not gonna hate it too much i'll probably finish this like fairly quickly because my other 0.5 pod like finish in like a day or a day or two right i'm not complaining too much it tastes good it's just fun to puff it's smooth it goes in quickly it gets the job done it gets me high has thick smoke thick enough smoke for me right now because i can barely puff i'm not supposed to like suck in air you know but it's getting the job done that wax high you know i'm out here i'm elevated i'm stoned feeling good i hope you guys are feeling good too so yeah this was the og kush by reddit can here's the box oj kush recommend it if you have the time to go get a car or whatever try it out oj kush 18 plus never go wrong with og kush the high's mellow it's kicking in right and i kind of feel the same way kind of sedated that nice indica uh sensation but anyways this was oj kush if you guys enjoyed this video then drop a like and hit that subscribe

cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice

__ ] up so got the stygian go half a half year to know what it is I'm not really into the CBD THC [ __ ] but you know go for a duel for the loved ones and then the juicy melon they're both of half gram because for some reason they don't sell it full Grammy even though they say self will Graham on there but that's a whole nother story guys and then I got the Rove cush I usually don't smoke

short vlog because I gotta go out and I gotta go eat real quick but yeah this is a row took off my own arse extracts but this is the row of it's called cush I think it says it on there I don't know if you can see it but it says cush on there this [ __ ] tastes [ __ ] fruitiest [ __ ] that's why I got it I already tasted this one already but I had to do it on camera for you guys cuz it [ __ ] tastes [ __ ] fruity as hell and it just tastes hella good and I highly recommend this [ __ ] for the people that like I don't know a lot of people I feel like they don't want to taste the weed smell or taste why did I say that we saw they don't want to taste the weed the dankness I like the deadness that's why I stick with like Ursa extracts raw garden [ __ ] that has more of that earthy dank smell but this [ __ ] has a flavor too it's kind of like brass knuckle but brass knuckles suck sorry guys brass knuckles suck but this [ __ ] rose [ __ ] get you a rope guys but um hold on let me get that a melon raga or that melons dizzy cuz you know I got to show you guys all right guys last one last but not least the mango I'm trying to get as clear as I can for you guys but I'm got the mango sticky comment below what you guys think is better than Faygo or the Bella I'm honestly filling the melon right now I'm not really feeling the mango that much it's just as good as sweet it's got that good sweet taste to it but I kind of like the melon taste more I hope everyone's hidden weed smoking out of a bong doing something right now you're not smoking I don't know what you're doing just pause

[Music] so we both got where peace [Music]", "e_JivQOlEDc": "this mango push is looking pretty good she was topped right about here a few weeks ago and some main branches splitting off to the sides kind of creating a nice circle up here and the leaves are looking pretty good we did have a little heat last week and I wonder if that's why the leaves are a little skinny and the little bit of cash much are the term of use you can see the ridges the ridges are raised there we go but other than that everything looks pretty good we got two months left on this plant so it should get a little bigger a little fatter and a little heavier", "3ZgJBoZwj-A": "hey guys is dabbe connection and we are taking a look at the eureka vapor syringe and doing a review and i've been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "9pXvpOr3ztw": "what's going on everybody but I'm just recap for today their compost tea this morning they got in a couple hours I'll be spraying them down some compost tea for way as soon as the Sun Goes Down but everyone's looking nice everyone's looking nice I'm hoping that barley straw and that cover crop those cover crop seeds come in this well they will come in this week I just don't know what day yet I should I need to check my email to check for some tracking information but as soon as those get here I'm gonna finish cover cropping and get some barley straw on these last three pots right there I'm also kind of defoliated these plants so I'll open them up as you can see this one looks the best defoliant and got down there took everything off so that and he's going to get that burger to the upper and outer branches just same for this one but the point of this video right here isn't to show you the old girls this is to show you the drumroll please BAM I want to go pick up some new plants today just in case those four that are flowering don't pop out and don't revert fully back I need to have a backup and if those do revert then yeah I got five more plants to add to the garden so I got three more Gerardo's so enchilada here once you are over there and once you are over here I have a mango kiss I'm excited I'm excited about this one and I have another purple punch yeah so those are the girls and I'm going to pick up a skittles grande and purple in a grape eight in a few weeks you just cloned them last night so I'm in a few weeks I'll pick up that Grape Ape Grandaddy purple and skittles yeah yeah so I can get out here so also let me let me know guys you think it's worth waiting for this plant of these four five plants right here these three right here four five you think it's worth waiting to these to hop out of flower so I looked at the bus today like these these buds are there their butts I know I don't I don't know refer a back or not so let me know what you guys think everyone was telling me to say be or I just let it let mother nature do its thing but I don't have all to I don't have all the time in the world you know it's only four months to get these plants you know ready so let me know what you guys think like is these are these are but these aren't like even though I got I don't stink they're still growing but those are buds so please guys let me know I need I need to make this decision quick within the next week or so so by the time Harding I'm a Harding those off these plants off because well actually the only ones need to be hardened off for the tomahtoes the mango cush and the purple punch are already a acclimated to the Sun but I'm still going to harden them off just be on the safe side yeah so by the time next monday rolls around and you have a decision about those about those over there do I need to cut those out or or keep them in like this one this one isn't really no it's okay but it's not really doing anything I'm saying no I got this one the same times I got this one so I tells you something that with that is the same clone as this cut from the same mother so let me back up and show you cut from the same mother same day big difference but I put a lot of time and energy and money into these right here so you know I really if I can keep them I want to keep them if not oh well some I really looking at my backyard I don't know where I can put five extra points at so yeah no I mean oh so after the compost tea let me let me show you guys what uh how how I do out the compost tea you know everything clean ready for the next go-around I have this pop this under my water that's a good dust dechlorinating right now I always want to have some dechlorinator water on you know ready readily available so every time nope not doing compost tea I still fill it up I have readily available water all right you guys mom is hot go back up under the shade and watch the girls drink a beer so I definitely catch you guys later peace", "F1Gj0gPR_Lk": "hey everyone how's it going hope you're having a great day today we're gonna be answering some questions that you sent to us through YouTube or Instagram and yeah everybody's gonna be anonymous for privacy purposes so here we go question number one new to vaping what factor does voltage play in to vaping amazing question first of all I would say in order to understand voltage you need to understand mas casa t so viscosity is just the thinness or the thickness of your oils so if you have a thick oil which basically you can tell by flipping over your cartridge upside down and if it doesn't move or takes forever in a day to move you have a thick oil if it takes like five seconds probably a medium and then if it's almost instantly you got a you got a thin oil so thinner oils would need a lower voltage and thicker oils would need a higher voltage if you vape thin oils on a higher voltage you run the risk of burning the oil itself and if you vape thicker oils at low temperatures it might not heat up all of the oil in and you might not get the draw that you're looking for also cartridges play a factor into this sometimes because of the air hole but that's a whole nother video I'll link I'll put a link to it like right around here somewhere so you want to make sure that you get the full inhalation of your draw and you also want to make sure that you're not burning your oils either alright question number two can I refill my cartridge with new oils absolutely I would say don't do it more than twice otherwise you run the risk of clogging old oils might get stuck in there and so don't burn your new oils correctly you might lose flavor taste vapor production it could leak you know because it's just over time I mean you know you want to change the oil in your car and with this it's just like this is you're actually inhaling it and this is going in your body so you want the best quality of you know oil that you can find plus if you're like a flavor chaser and you know somebody who likes to try and taste different strains you know it's best if you change your oils you know once maybe twice and then dispose of them because they're they're not meant to last forever next question says do these work with normal vape liquids no no they don't uh vape liquid is too thin it'll drip out it'll leak out into the battery you know that you'll have connectivity problems if you do that I wouldn't put a juice in it odds these aren't meant for a juice how do I put a juice into my ex5 cartridge so again not free juice but all the cartridges that we sell they're all top fill so you unscrew the top cap or if it's plastic and it has a plug you just fill down the plug if it's a ceramic mouthpiece just take the mouthpiece off fill it around the heating tube because the heating tube is gonna or the heating post is gonna be directly down the center there's gonna be a hole down there where you can look straight down through it that's where the air flow comes from do not put anything in there what you want to do is have the oil drip around that post touching the glass and and being on the inside of the glass you want to be able to see the oil rise up you don't want if you put it through that post you're not gonna be able to see anything it's just gonna leak straight down into your battery and the ex5 cartridge is as a top fill you just remove it I believe the heating post is actually connected to the mouthpiece so you just squeeze it on in there it's it it's it's a dope it's a dope cartridge you can control the air flow through it - it's pretty hardcore um next question how long do I inhale while holding the button so the button will usually just hold for a good 10 to 15 seconds and you uh you can't you can't hold it for for more than that but usually as soon as you put the cartridge you know to inhale you're gonna hold the button down and then let go when you're done and just you know it won't last more than 15 seconds and then the really the rest is just up to you how long do I have to charge the battery for it does the pen light have to flash or the battery and the charger have to stay green so I know it's full it really depends on the unit you have and for the most part for the most part pins that have adapted connectors or you plug you plug them into the 510 threading you plug that into a computer it's gonna light red and hold red and then it will transition into green and hold green if it's something like this sometimes they'll flash 20 times I know the snap flash is 20 20 times and this one it flashes eight times and then it goes blank um you know just read the instructions I would say so to answer your first question how long do you charge the battery I would say no more than two hours you know some even less than an hour depending you got to watch them and get to know it you know it's something that you're gonna be carrying around in your pocket with you all day every day you know so it's good to know like what what you have on your body but usually what I would do is when I first get it use it up let it die twice charge it for two hours and then never past one hour again alright and can you use it while charging he was talking about the wolf duo no you cannot you cannot use it while it's charging it's not it doesn't have a bypass on it but this one does this is the wolf uni you can charge it or yeah you can't vape it while you're charging it next question hey I just got a new cartridge and whenever I put it in my uni just flashes but when I put in another cartridge it works fine what should I do the best method is basically what you did you know you tried another cartridge inside of the battery and it works so you ruled out that the battery was fine it was just the cartridge that I was having an issue the cool thing about all vaporizers is that they'll try to talk to you they'll try to okay with you if it's something internal with the cartridge it'll probably read as a misfire which will flash three times if it's something as simple as like the cartridge is fine the battery is fine maybe there's a magnet involved it's just not getting a connective touch to it it just can't read the cartridge it'll flash five times just an error like that it could be something like with the magnets you know the magnet might not be screwed into the proper length so sometimes maybe you want to back off the magnet a little bit from the from the cartridge itself back it off put it back in and see if that works so right now it's telling me one two three four five that means I cannot it cannot read the cartridge there's nothing wrong with the cartridge nothing wrong with the vapin but five times tells me that it's just not connecting to the battery so when I screw it back on I put it back in I'm able to get some draws try different cartridges different batteries different batteries and different cartridges kind of rule them out rule out problems if they indicate if you don't understand what the indicator is trying to tell you other than that I would say you know give customer service a call I'm sure we can take care of it for you that'll do it for today guys hope that was helpful let us know if you want to see more of these send in your questions I want to know I want to answer them but yet peace",

this is a move pure cartridge this is the black mamba strain we're smoking on today got some nice golden black oil in there golden uh yellow oil in there nice uh translucent this particular strain is a half gram cartridge over there from move florida like i've said 50 for the half gram black mamba is a indica the lineage of this parent of this strain the parents are unknown but thought to be uh gdp or granddaddy purple crossed with black domina or black domina and i think both those strains uh accurately represent this at least the uh granite purple of course it's very similar to that granddaddy perp uh with effects as well as uh taste particular thc in this batch is 430 milligrams per half gram cartridge or 86 percent and uh 1.8 cbd in this particular batch i'm glad move actually put the uh stuff there on the package i know it's backwards but black mamba they're up top 430 milligrams 0.9 and that's it's half grams 1.8 but yeah you got your vape pure there this particular batch was harvested and packaged uh this was june 8th 2020. now that we got that out of the way guys let's go ahead and get another rip in before we get some more information and uh go ahead get that out of the way we got your blunts your bongs your joints your vape pens whatever you do to get it nice and right get nice and medicated with me let's go ahead and get this cheers everyone the particular blood structure of this strain is said to be very dark green hard dense buds with purple and dark green leaves uh sugar leaves on those i definitely agree with that i've never seen the buds of this particular strain but from what i i can taste in the pictures i've seen online i definitely agree with that according to leafly it helps patients with stress insomnia and pain definitely agree with the insomnia uh the couple times i have medicated on this i've only done it a couple so far but um very sleepy definitely had it definitely holds true to those uh og uh what's it called og uh what am i saying og gdp genetics there they say this strain had me feeling clear-headed mellow i would definitely say it's a nice indica to have a conversation on or uh listen to some great music you definitely enjoy it we're gonna go ahead and get another room here guys cheers make sure you check me out over there on instagram on that platform the weed funnies all one word uh definitely check me

mostly uh most pens but it's also the body high i'm definitely feeling here in my chest as well as melt it into this chair definitely it'll give me a nice nap or perhaps watch some uh some tv clutch up on some tv i don't know yet for fifty dollars can't beat it i like this a little better than that blueberry one i previously reviewed if you haven't checked out that blueberry cartridge review definitely go check that one out like just like this pure i believe i did that last week and for fifty dollars for the half gram here on that medical market that's not very not very bad competitive wise i should say for the price i mean i think the cheapest distance cartridge we have right now is either the 30 ones over there from one plant which i don't like or the 35 dollar ones pop azure cartridges over there from liberty health sciences i believe i believe those are the two cheapest but um yeah i think it's worth more to pay for those better terps as well as i think it's a little better quality distillate as well go ahead and get one more rip here cheers everyone i don't know if i said the smell and the taste on the strain um i would say it's sweet fruity and peppery in my opinion and that would be for the smell and the taste uh the taste the fruit in there i can't decide if it's citrus or grape in my opinion maybe a little bit of both but it reminds me of that granddaddy purple in uh no contest i would say i would whoever guessed that on the genetics i would say is pretty damn close i want to say this is named after that basketball basketball player kobe bryant that passed away i'm not sure though because they did call him black mamba don't quote me on that though this is a little bit stronger of a cartridge over there distance-wise 86 percent i'm liking that as well i think that last one i reviewed was i want to say 75 i'm not mistaken really good i've been enjoying this uh truly battery as well i've been only had to charge it a couple times i think i've charged it i wanna say twice now in the three weeks i've had it maybe four weeks the only thing i do hate about it is that magnet there on the bottom that metal piece is very strong with the mechanism there inside i think you can see that you gotta pull pretty hard i can't get a grip on it with my fingers i mean look how big that is i can't i can't get a grip on that i gotta use my shirt or some kind of cloth but besides that i like it all the same especially the little window here you can see how much product you have left it works out a lot you got just over just over half there all right in conclusion definitely enjoy this uh pure black mamba cartridge over there from move florida and uh definitely recommend it to indica lovers as well as people that enjoy i guess granddaddy purple you know or moved products moves dislike in general it definitely holds up to uh products and the consistency of uh what moves putting out over there go ahead and get one more rip here everyone and get out of your hair this is weed funny signing off spoke with me so good for your mama have a great rest of your day everyone cheers have a great day everyone sweet 27 now peace", "rJMjnifYgts": "hey guys what's up my name is Mary I look like [ __ ] right now so I'm not really going to show myself but hello I'm here anyways so I'm going to be doing a quick little review on the King pen cartridges the strain one is trainwreck and let me just firstly say how disappointed I am I tried their cartridges before I didn't have that big of a problem with it I thought that the concentrate thought was in there was kind of thick that was kind of I guess a little indicator that there was something up with it but this the current time that I needed another one alright this is only one I could find so this is what I was dealing with and it was a lot worse than last time so mmm let me just show you I guess what this looks like as you can see instantly this looks just absolutely disgusting this is something that you clearly don't want to smoke let me focus game clothes do you see what is in there can you guys tell me what you think that is I mean this is clearly some type of like DIY cartridge or something that someone have [ __ ] me over on like Ivan like look at this color separation right here in this like air bubble that's neither floating up to the top may I tell you like this has been in the year for about nine hours and it has not moved let me flip it upside down nothing you can see it is slowly hardly moving at all but it is just so so alarming this is clearly my fault that I purchased this I got it for about $50 I don't know I'm just very upset about it I don't really know what is in there like I said if you guys know if you guys ever seen thing like this please tell me what you think this could possibly bleep like be cuz I'm actually scared too I smoked it a couple times clearly not that much because it's uh I didn't notice it until it got down to this bubble like how bad it was so yeah guys please be careful with the stuff you buy you never know what's really in it and that's the truth so yeah if you guys can just comment down below and let me know what you think what is in there cuz like I said clearly it's some some [ __ ] and I'm trying to figure it out yeah yeah", "SXMTTO5fcQs": "hey there everyone welcome to my channel and if this is your first time here welcome my name is Courtney Crosby I currently live in Portland Oregon working in the cannabis industry and I want to share my love of the cannabis with you all but before we get started got a little Bowl packed here if you want to join alone that be awesome [Music] your best resource for smoking without the smell is going to be cartridges there are a few different types and styles of cartridges I mean with a prequel Tabar battery this is going to be my favorite battery that I have and it comes with the battery itself a charger a micro USB charger which I love about this battery two different bottom pieces for your cartridges that you had attached to the bottom of your cartridge to make it a magnet connection to the battery itself a few different cartridges to this battery and show you how well it works and everything screw this little bottom on the metal bottom piece on here making it a magnet connection to the battery and see so it doesn't fall out which is really nice look at the button five times to turn the battery on and off you can also double click the button here and it will do a pre heat setting which is really nice if you've ever had your battery laying on the side and all the oil has run to one side of the cartridge or it's just really cold and your cartridge and the oil inside is really cold you can put that pre heat setting on and it'll preheat the cartridge in together ready for use which is really awesome also has a temperature gauge up here at the top which is really important three cartridges to burn at different temperatures also when you set your cartridge down on the lowest temperature you're gonna go through your cartridge a lot slower it's also gonna taste a lot better so if you have your cartridge turn all the way up on high which is good for some cartridges to work or to lay other cartridges it'll just taste really burn you'll actually burn your cartridge and sometimes it can actually pop through the top of your cartridge and burn you which what you don't want on our cartridge oh just turn it down I can help with things like that so I'm gonna hit this bad boy and show you what it can do [Music] so taking this metal piece off and transferring it to you let's try out this buddy's cartridge these specific cartridges you can tell there's a little bit different we got two different mouthpieces here also the different types of oil on the inside which is really important just depending on what kind of cartridge you want I'll specifically really like the flat tips because you can hit it from any direction where is these tips you can only get it from the front or the back you have a specific battery with a button on it you have to hit a specific direction that can be difficult if your cartridge is in at a funny angle I just transferred the metal piece on to this cartridge here so it is now a magnet connection to this battery here so it doesn't fall out and you try it with this cartridge [Music] moving on to evolve I have their living resin cartridge and their battery to go open up this battery check it out another micro USB charger which is really great just plugs in down here on the bottom which is really awesome it says evolve across the battery with a nice button [Music] a button for your battery is also really important because some cartridges actually require a button it kind of just sends the signal to the cartridge saying okay it's time to warm up and activate the cartridge so some cartridges actually require a button on them some batteries are just a pull-through battery some cartridges work with those but not all cartridges do the last battery that we got here this is going to be a disposable battery so the battery comes with the cartridge you don't have to buy them separately just really great but once you're finished with that you would actually recycle the whole bad boy together so let this one it will be one of those pull through batteries it doesn't have a button on it or anything this is the Nano here there's also this type of a battery here that also has the button but also has a screw on USB charger on the top really great if you're looking for just an easy accessible battery on the go most of time these bad boys had lifetime warranties on them but unfortunately most the time if you lose this charger please piece in is irreplaceable that is why I like the micro USB chargers it a lot of these bad boys gone here [Music] please let me know down below what you thought in today's video I'm going to have any questions tips or things to add please let me know I love to hear about it thanks for watching and I hope you all have a great day", "DJSPey5vWGA": "[Music] then [Music] yes yeah you should hold it i should hold like no no um i might do this as a thumbnail we'll see all right what's up guys simplisik here with rj eats subscribe to the boy if you haven't already you know i'm saying but if you can tell from the title we finally picked up the bear labs cartridge and i know you guys are probably gonna get mad when i tell you the price that we paid for this do you have the you have the [ __ ] uh receipt you don't toss that [ __ ] oh sorry it was 32 out the door for a full gram i swear 32. no it was 32. they trust they believe me you know what i'm saying it's not on weed maps yet you really can't check it honestly you're not going to see this video probably for like two weeks but it's 32 out the door lemon sorbet i'm gonna have him uh so as usual i like to um film this so get a better look wow i like the packaging very very nice the bear and then the labs yeah sorben what's the percentage percentage also show yours so the homie got uh his uh strawberry cheesecake [Music] and then the back of the strawberry cheesecake [Music] now open mine so live resin cart as you can see oh that's very light okay yeah i don't have my pants i'm just like okay i got mine my bro is bad too i can't get too harsh on my back all right so boom boom we're opening this up baby let's go ready until then pull out that for a thumbnail [Music] so uh from what i've heard from uh p2 piece this is some fire [ __ ] you know what i'm saying so i was really a fan of the lemon sorbet so all right we are gonna try this so very much very light what i've noticed is with that light lighter stuff it might have uh terpenes mixed in with it instead of reintroduced i mean instead of uh already being in there [ __ ] wait what is it that you just don't know uh when i when it's lighter i feel like they add turkeys but when it's darker they don't really add much children to it or if not any but that's just an assumption i don't really know but he's going to be opening the strawberry cheesecake and we're just going to take some ribs off this i don't have my battery on me you guys and my bad and maybe we shouldn't just meet get out the car we'll just use this battery let's trade them off oh yeah that tastes like the [ __ ] lemon sorbet oh wow refreshing hits that's like super lemony like if you haven't seen my lemon sorbet video it's exactly the same way it tastes like a lemon slushie oh my god that [ __ ] this is the [ __ ] that this was 32 buck that 27 [ __ ] even though it's still it's all right the cartridge itself is good [Laughter] damn bear labs you guys go check them out that's the damn seatbelt is it oh no i'll pick it up later all right taking a take another hit off this and did you want to try this one too yeah yeah oh yeah that's why i pulled it out [Music] i should probably like keep the keep the packaging actually still because i haven't finished my other one yet yeah you're right here but you want to take another this is the [ __ ] fire yeah i'm trying to smell it yeah this is a little surprise but yeah this is this is it 32 out the door 80 plus cannabinoids well and it smells like lemons you're not gonna get caught up with this [ __ ] bro and actually looks nice with the white the black tip coming out of the the device the black on black yeah all right let's try this one oh yeah all right if it tastes bear in mind we gotta switch no no no that one's [ __ ] good i feel like they're both gonna taste hell again if this one doesn't taste good we got a [ __ ] problem i didn't just say it doesn't work uh yeah there's something wrong with this car it tastes like [ __ ] it says strawberry cheesecake but it tastes like [ __ ] let's try strawberry cheese [ __ ] or what strawberry cheese [ __ ] all right cheers guys i'm excited 32 for bear labs i kind of want to just go back and buy like two more but i'll reserve myself because that's not the way what's the way that no it moderation taste like strawberry i don't know but not even the wires came out right there i think that was broken well did it taste like strawberry cheesecake i didn't even taste it it tastes flavorless to me i need to try it again i'm bad y'all need to try to slightly like a little bit in the beginning but not really huh yeah damn i always get stuck with one of them [Music] turn again try it again i should have got me uh the other one that they had the gg4 or some [ __ ] i don't know do you think the gg4 would have been good that's crazy this is strawberry cheesecake you would think it would taste like strawberries no something you know we shouldn't taste like the name sometimes or sometimes it does happen you know i don't know i don't know i mean it doesn't taste bad but it didn't taste this good no they're not it's not bad yeah that's not bad i've had worse doesn't taste like that limited sorbet but it definitely hit so i'll tell you that right now thank you uh but yeah that's uh it for the video uh i'm really excited that we did get to try uh bear labs the cartridge but i'm a little bit disappointed that randy didn't get one as good as mine um but at the end of the day he can just use that one first and then he has that other uh the other jetties one that's way better than that one so yeah yeah but it's only 32. you know well it's not like you're paying 40. that's what happens when you're not moderate [Applause] yeah see he was actually going in there not trying to buy a cartridge he was just gonna buy wax and then i saw this beauty i thought that was beautiful it was all right it's not bad it could have been worse yeah but whatever strawberries okay and we also got uh i got a bad fish so expect the video on that um you got anything to say to the people before we end it hope you guys enjoy the video man continue like i said to support the homie and stay safe out there you guys cover 19 is still a thing uh let us know what you thought in the comment section below man and also yeah have a good day peace out [Music] you", "ZHJqEUTD11U": "hey how's it going i'm here to uh make a quick review for this vape cart right here called the willys reserve oro blanco distillate card as you can see here it's made by buckeye relief and it does have cannabis derived terpenes and cannabinoids and as you can see the uh thc percentage is actually a little bit above the uh 70 legal maximum here in ohio and the terpene content is quite high uh two i think 20.9 milligrams per gram is the same as two percent and i actually got a couple other carts out to show this was the highest mercedes content that i've seen on any cart so far and it was a buckeye relief aeropro live flower series so that should be really comparable to this because they both have distillate and cannabis derived terpenes and here's a little container you can see this one has 20.9 and mercene is the highest and on this one it actually has 40.75 so aeropros are just extremely high in terpenes and that's why they're probably my favorite but i really do like this reserve cart and i actually have a little bit of the willy's reserve flower here that i got a while ago it's not the same strain but this one's called cocoa and i really like it i have a couple little buds i've been saving and then also i just ordered a couple things uh from a uh a guy that i know from reddit and uh discord he actually makes these extensions and also this like this base thing right here it's pretty neat i haven't really tried it out yet um and see how i have it set up now is with my divine tribe atomizer here but i'm gonna take that off and just use use it with the cart just to show it but um here's my regular little card atomizer or battery oh and he also sent me this too which is a nifty little luster pod holder so that's pretty cool has a nice little ohio with the cannabis leaf on it on the bottom so it's really nice yeah so here's my regular seed battery pop this thing out of here i've been using it um i definitely i like it so far wr for lily's reserve has a little thing in the top there a little plug yeah i'll just go ahead and take a hit off this first it has really good flavor um just like i would expect from buckeye relief i've really enjoyed all of their products that i've tried so far [Music] they seem to have really good effects they uh you know they they seem to work um they have really good customer service i've emailed and contacted them a few times um oh another cool thing about this mod that i bought is it actually already has the uh different firmware on it so that's pretty cool so hopefully i'll be showing you guys more of this setup soon but anyway i have my dab cap here i don't know if you're familiar with those but it just lets you use a cart with uh like a water piece so i like this a lot let's take this off for a second let's see here just unscrewing the divine tribe atomizer base right now and attaching the cart it's not really meant to use a cart with this extension but but i figured this would work okay so here we go oops this would be easier just make sure it's not turned up too high that's pretty good all right just set that there just hold it like this now just go ahead and hit it works pretty well i'm a big fan of this this little guy this uh dab cap here that uh accidentally turned my phone off there so hopefully i'll get these two videos connected to each other but um yeah take another hit off this i forgot to push the button yeah i i'm a big fan of this so far um the willys reserved cart oro blanco which means white gold um i think that's that's about all i have to say um shout out to fear and lawyering who is the the guy who made this stuff this uh little carousel thing uh and base here and then also the extension um yeah that's all i have to say thank you bye",

because I've had a lot of stuff going on at school some really important tests and stuff I usually have really important tests all throughout the year but this this specific course in my school kicking my ass it's really difficult but we're good through it we just finished today so I'm treating myself I'm treating you guys we got a new video it's about to be smack right before we jump into this video let's go ahead and throw it out there this channel is a adult smoking cannabis channel only it's for 18 to 21 and up depending on your state and how legal medical or recreational marijuana is I'm here in Arizona I have my own medical card everything I do on this channel is legal yeah so now that that's out of the way I guess we can get right into this so I'm completely sober right now I smoked a little bit this morning awesome an old cart that I had actually was a venom acts I was supposed to do a video for that but I just like I said school was just training me I was stressed I just couldn't do it but I the two cars that I showed in the last the strange Saturday which we're still debating if we want to do Sunday or not but the let's train Saturday I said I had two carts those were venom X's I think they were tangi I don't remember pineapple tangi or something like that I got i don't remember the strain but i threw out the boxes but they were supposed to be two different ones now it's going to review them and have two two videos two completely separate videos but since they were the same it would have been useless and only one video and like I said I just was stressed as [ __ ] so I just skipped out of it and didn't do a video but we are we're here with another video and I got to cut two videos coming up here so this one and then another one the cards were reviewing on these two videos are gonna be pure earth no I don't remember exactly I could be wrong but the first pure earth cart I did actually was one of them I beated viewed videos I think in their first or second which is actually insane so if this video can be even like 1/4 or 1/2 of that that would be dopes mad appreciation so the cart we're gonna review today though is the pure earth DJ short right there I don't know if you can see that there you go um uncut VAP cartridge is a half gram I won't lie to you guys these are probably my favorite boxes I've seen out of any descent cart they're just so [ __ ] elegant I don't know it's just it's super dope um I don't know if y'all are into video games or anything like that but there's this game called destiny - there's this raid at the boss by Calvin our model remember that narrates called but this [ __ ] color scheme anyway flashbacks if you play that game but yeah this box is clean and and just like the other one they're the same box got a little pull tab there I'm pure earth it you know somehow some rep saying this or whatever [ __ ] yeah you guys killed this box gorgeous box so on the back here says in infused with authentic cannabis terpenes no PG propylene glycol propylene glycol PG I don't know what that is or MCT I don't know what that is a proprietary pure atropine and cannabinoid profiles so that's what that says right there on the back right there then there's their website and then all their other information blah blah says requires pure earth battery for use this product has been tested for potency wow that's cool so that says that on the back right there and then read above that it says right here this little like black dark black line so the extremely potent cartridge use small draws until comfortable with the effects so that's super dope I'm excited this isn't my first pure earth like I said I do not remember at all what that one was what the strain was how it hit anything like that so if you guys want to know before you see this video go ahead and check it out you know check out my channel you know life subscribe do all that [ __ ] if you haven't of course but well let's go ahead and open this [ __ ] up I think you just pull okay there's a sticker right here the best thing to use lightning cables for if you have an iPhone is for cutting a little like [ __ ] piece of corners like that [ __ ] yeah cool boom and then not a tape no that's done boom she just slides on out there and it oh no I thought it locked um so it didn't fall out but it doesn't uh box [ __ ] hollow box it's a very sturdy box so that she you know you could take this [ __ ] and eat it and not really have to worry too much about breaking the cart which is which is really nice that's uh that's a good feature to have on carts let's do a little hydration break here guys drinking another pees tea Georgia Peach you already know yall already know so here's the Box simple box right there on the front it even says it says the this is an indica dominant so I didn't even say that this isn't in a kendama net strain it's like 8020 ad indica xx sativa but you know basically indica just oh that's nice so this is a little really soft foam packaging so it's gonna be even harder to break your carts in here if you drop or throw them in your backpack or whatever you got to do that was loud I apologize for that um yeah so here's the cart so this is pure earth there on the front super dope and then here on the back yeah well cuz I'm a terrible youtuber and everything like that it says the strain which is oh I drew that [ __ ] it says the strain which is DG a short and then it says that it is an eighty indica 20 sativa so it shows you like the breakdown which is super cool it's going to pop this cap off alright there we go there's the bottom authentic see so [ __ ] you know you already know here we got the dr. zodiacs Moonrock battery here I really want to get another one of those cards just to have the battery to be honest but those cards did smack as well we just charged this one up you already know how I am when it comes to hits on the cards I think a fully charged battery is always gonna hit hella harder that just makes a [ __ ] ton of sense to if you'll think about it I mean you know but if you guys like to you know use your batteries all day that's fine I do - I did - I burned through them then I charged them for the [ __ ] video so cuz I want to show you guys the potency I had its finest so let's do one more quick hydration break here without out of what what did I just say and with that out of the way let's go ahead and take our first draw up this DJ short nice it was cheesy shortcake doesn't say it's on the bus it says DJ short but anyway guys Cheers hopefully you guys are smokin medicating along with me let me know if you are now in the comments I'm always interested to see what you guys are smoking on guys well tooth Wow Wow that tastes man i that tastes exactly like like a strawberry shortcake that's that's part guys that is that is delicious man awesome let me show you the wax here kind of got a little piece of paper here so you can kind of see a contrast there super dope so that was I just realized like that was me probably shelling off the goddamn lakhs for like 30 seconds and I'm gonna tell you why because I'm already feeling this [ __ ] hard I was facing now I just face that [ __ ] showing you guys what I actually hydrate afraid but oh I hope you guys can't hear that noise I was watching Bohemian Rhapsody outside a little bit of a Bond movie if you guys haven't seen that Mia shut the door boo boo that door shut look at that Pro youtubers - the yellow shouldn't have heard that but you got it anyway nice um back to the part I'm a big fan of this part already I'm a big fan of all my cars to be honest but this one's flavor wise right on there probably not eight out of ten nine out of ten easily potency just not one hit man that's a it's like a four I'm already gonna for pretty good so [ __ ] let me just kind of regain my breath here like nothing like hitting anything all day so I'm a little Oh what are you doing eating yeah but just gotta get a couple hydration breaks video and you'll be chillin just fine so god I feel like I have to Kaufman try get it out there we go ladies and gentlemen we are gonna do number two guys truth yeah if you guys if you guys are a big fan of like strawberries or like short like case like Strawberry Shortcake's anything relative to strawberry this is your cart um I don't think I've ever really had any any cart or anything like that hmm that was like cherry pie or no like cherry cream or whatever they short um but for the first one that I've ever had like that pardon me it's hurting me deep but for the first one I've ever had nobilis I should like a shortcake or strawberry anything definitely definitely solid it's highly recommend to start just off the taste potency I'm feeling it for sure I'm feeling like really loose just chill just you know a good vibe just feeling myself I send it real weird I don't know I just feel like some popping out some good music after

page over the past decade swine to a fresh high of a hundred and seventy current last year according to the Institute of International Finance the IAAF said total debt levels including households government quarter debt climbed by more than 70 trillion over the last ten years to a record two hundred and fifteen trillion in 2016 I mean that's 25 percent of global gross domestic product what's happening here is we have this debt bomb can this debt bomb is about to go off and they're awarding us saying that this debt cannot be sustained and what is happening is we're continually putting on more debt this tells us right now that things are rapidly falling apart and they're telling you right now they're noticing and there's no way to avoid it anymore we have to report on it because people are bringing it up and there's no end in sight Japan just passed a record high government budget thirty five percent of which will be borrowed the u.s. added 1.3 trillion to its federal debt in 2016

empty so I'm gonna pick up a raw garden so then we can do a review of these new cars that I got up in Finn and I've been waiting to even try these I haven't even tried it yet it's called Ursa extracts Ursa extracts this is live resin I don't think it has any additives or anything so we're gonna test these out I'm gonna put the link to their Instagram and stuff down below check those guys out there kind of a new wax I've never even heard of them so we're gonna try them out and we're gonna compare them to the raw garden we're gonna see which one's better but we got to pick up some more raw garden

thing I'm mad about versa extract and I want them to explain to me is how how is this a gram when it's 659 milligrams of THC and 2.3 milligrams of CBD that makes no sense it should be a thousand milligrams all together for 1 grand if I'm trippin tell me I'm trippin in the comments but I'm pretty sure it's a thousand [ __ ] milligrams this is almost like I have [ __ ] gram it's like a big-ass bubble it in [ __ ] but it's probably hella good we don't even know if it's good so I don't even know but no cars guys new cards so we're gonna see what it is I'll get back to you guys when I faith

garden half gram comes in a smaller box probably wait a little bit before we try this you know so happy to finally find a better spot to do it nothing out here because we're still at the dispensary but I'm popular with these girls we don't see what's poppin I figured out that all the men dough like all the ones that have punches you told me to they taste better I feel like so if you're looking

to it so it just tastes like straight dab it actually tastes pretty good it looks pretty good I don't know I like it but I could see if people don't like it because they don't like the taste and they're used to smoking like this Jewett's and all types of [ __ ] but if you're a person that's into [ __ ] taking straight dabs this will be the pin for you I feel like hold on I gotta get the raw

it open for you guys you guys cuz you like the unsealing part of it since I haven't done that in a minute I've been opening up all packages before I get to film and I got some uh I'm gonna show you guys everything you just have to wait but I got some uh some wax and I already ripped it up in this video you know so like this quick bubble test for you guys alright so that's basically it I want to cut that [ __ ] over figure Hydra quit I'm not going to go into detail but anything you want to cut that open real quick and next to either this will be the first clip I'll put this in between but either way back to the original video and just the case I lose it or see you later how are you have it right here with me right now so I might as well film this real quick the a leakage cartridge actually ended up coming out to 34 dollars not 37 and that wax how\u00eds is $55 the accident accidentally charged me 55 instead of 24 I don't know how I'll probably cuz the name mixed up but yeah so I show you guys that all right man today we're going to continue the LA cush cartridge review video unboxing thoughts with stone know there's literally couple hits list this is a Tuesday now what is Bradley Tuesday it's like poker him right now that video that he has just saw right now when I was shouldn't you guys cut open the baggage ship that was [ __ ] Friday so three days later in this it's almost gone and this honestly is not even like that it goes by quick it's just Friday I was kicking at my homies she got out of hand got a little faded and I just kept passing the pattern man kept passing the pan like a god they're good but uh I didn't get to chose like the video you know just to show you guys a little cut all I don't get me smoking in and getting the full experience all I did was help the video so you know don't matter so this is how all your boxes are going to be looking like the only thing hasn't come different in every box is gonna be this sticker or just gonna be according to strain this one's called jackpot so as you know so it has the slot machine on there and all the information in terms of THC percentage CBD manufactured date and all that Cindy found right here on the side this one's containing I think this one of the hardest fitting sativas it's containing 79 percent THC and 7.2 million Oh Lee Shin Semin point 2 milligrams of CBD that's a lot for a [ __ ] card to be honest you the side view and then on top she said I like Kurdish from the bottom 1000 milligram for the 1 gram cart and then the back has all the [ __ ] all the regular has all the regular warnings issue like that and to actually open the package its employee just open it at the top and you're gonna have your little Lakers bag right here and they're all gonna come sealed me on the top so you gotta cut it with scissors I think that's like the old grade now I even think it like rip it open with your hands hard so make sure that when you go to cop this cart and you want to smoke it you get need to have a pair of scissors on you and in terms of taste I've only had two la Cruz cartridges this won the jackpot which is Deva and the black gelato which I think was the indica or hybrid indica and in terms of taste this should taste way better but in terms of how high gets you or like the way he hits I would definitely definitely go to black Salado I mean yeah she was like a woman hit your query right this one you know I could take my complete not even to be here it's actually kind of hard to see but the agree with this elderly curse would definitely go on my top 5 cartridges although I wouldn't put this man I would put this above select for sure because I feel like that I'm like I really really really really extreme potent wax taste will select and that's one thing I don't like the bottom with these it's like a nice even Terpening flavor and wax you know and honestly like I said to this I got this what is today eight I think today is the 28th 12 I'm on my back today's a 27th August 27th 12 a.m. and I had about this August 23rd at 1:09 p.m. so that night I had to split it with like 4 different heads you know so we're taking this [ __ ] to the dome in the last two equipment and we're some heavy started you know but you know there's gonna last you a minute there's relax me this because know and interpret looks from all the cars ever used so far my top three would have to be Corolla LE push and vitamin I thought what I really like about this one is that it's white so it looks very like high and you know it looks more like clean like you could tell once when you see a white tip in terms of the jackpot strain itself your sativa liver I would definitely go with this strain because just two three hits of this will really get you up there man but if you take a hit round when you get up from bed bro you're gonna be up high that black the lot on I didn't get treating you that was before I was actually even making videos but man I should have nice long that she was in the good this has really high THC content so sativa gives you like anxiety I ought to be really careful with the dosage that you take from this because what's the team goes to like straight heart sativa sometimes I find to give me like a heartbeat or like going anxious but with this you know I take rips not to rip and oh cool but if you go just a little bit so you get really anxious off the teeth like to be very careful with this I just take people know they're hybrids just to be safe you know so now the only thing really left to do is hit the pen give you got some clouds give you guys some ghosts and give you guys some more review of the flavor itself also another thing to know guys that and notice with this cartridge and the other cartridge that I got a couple months ago is that when you leave them sitting down I'm not sure if it's because I leave it like sitting like this but I find when you you know set them down for a bit and you go back to hit it clogs up a lot and I hate that round this leg does that to men and you know how it has appeared tip after and I finally done is just a whole bunch of whacks at the tip I just gone to waste so I hate one cartridge claw girl that's something that Lucas really needs to fix because isn't just happening with the first one it also happened with this one so I know that [Music] [Music] eyes are Agrabah [Music] you gotta see just after those hits oh my god yeah my digital bling crop this year huh I'm gonna do it for you guys but I'm live pretty [ __ ] high just a little she hits does like what for his so yeah man shit's intensity he has loves TV I'm [ __ ] recommend [ __ ] but if what I said scare you guys like if you think you can handle just try it you know it's not that bad and it's a cartridge you know you can control gates I have not to get blink on this party but I'm gonna take his big brother listening I gave you got his that blinker on reg ascending on the rock garden you guys saw how that went so here we go guys [ __ ] that licorice blinker it's on the low setting bucket Jack pasta team I kind of this award-winning cut up [ __ ] strange he would go and this is a long time

phone exited on the camera so uh I'm where do the blinker real quick as you can see it was kind of filled up about the video new kind of new stuff I got this check for that plane and you guys get distracted with everybody so plane it was like gas-powered it really worked just crazy badass thinking this [ __ ] did that bear goodbye last night will be this shirt man this series not isn't on the

want to start going up a little bit you know that look today and I don't really have that music every year so I guess I've been a good way to get subscribers but let's take the step by step actually got me high not gonna come you know was the right I recommend this [ __ ] [ __ ] idea let's go with the turn like a tiny house I'm uh I'm officially beginning that [ __ ] the Ellie curse just that

"SsC4jaIY8sQ": "[Music] welcome to wheats the marijuana review show where we help you make sense of your dispensary and I've got my trusty pour one out 510 vape battery that is finely [ __ ] the bet on me after 15 cartridge reviews or something it finally [ __ ] the bed and my trusty 510 battery has died so I'm pulling out the backup the cheaper chintzy er one here that's okay we'll get a new one we'll get a better one but I'm gonna miss my old friend there has died but outside of the funeral for our trusty 510 vape pen we are here for a joyous celebration and we are here to review the product that I have had to me suggested the most of anything I have ever reviewed or intended to review and that is brass knuckles we are finally reviewing brass knuckles I have had you guys a lot of you recommending me check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles check out brass knuckles and I've used brass knuckles in the past and but we won't talk about that but today we are going to be reviewing brass knuckles finally found some here in Long Beach and I'm very very excited to give it a review so this is the one gram Gorilla Glue cartridge and it comes in some a primo packaging that I have no doubt I'm gonna have difficulty opening here really nice packaging as you can see plastic on the outside it's got all the information you want on the inside lab tested contaminant and pesticide free that brings me up to the controversy I I know that there was a big controversy with brass knuckles for a while about pesticide usage but apparently that is no longer the case I hope that is no longer the case I I would a vet suggest you do your due diligence and research if you're really worried about those kind of things what you might probably should be maybe so do your own due diligence make sure you know this is something for you but from what I've heard they have all of their problems in terms of having pesticides or whatever fungicides or whatever I was that was in there it's no longer the case so Gorilla Glue is my favorite strain as I have said many a times I have seen it listed as both hybrid and indica this is a hybrid gorilla glue I like it both as hybrid and indica this cost me as you can see $52 at my dispensary which is a bit of a miss which is a bit misleading because really with the 35% taxes it can cost considerably more than that but $52 is the base price so you know pretty expensive but not outrageously more expensive than other cartridges this one just has the reputation sort of throughout Southern California as being the best of the best and I think I actually got it open without too much trouble there maybe here we go here's our cartridge in its little packaging there for medicinal use only not for redistribution and we can see their weed maps all that logos blah blah blah blah blah they have a snapchat how fun alright we have got our standard 510 pen here not our former best friend bottoms cap just like all the others with these little rubber stoppers whoever makes these little rubber stoppers must be doing pretty bonk owes business right now I would imagine let's screw this in ooh I like the color of this oil nice dark golden oil beautiful looking oil there a nice brass tip I guess that's where the name brass knuckles come from and a nice wide intake hole there so very excited to give this a drop let's give it a go oh wow that is a premium experience that is a smooth with smooth draw Wow ignore the cough that's my fault not theirs I'm a coffer this does not burn hot at all you can barely feel it entering along it's wonderful the taste is exquisite and Wow I'm already feeling pretty nicely medicated actually oh wow they use a bad word on their packaging here I'm gonna have to read that for you guys I don't see what their THC potency is listed at on here but I do know that they are among the highest in the state I think I've seen before that it's over 90% it certainly feels that way I'm already feeling quite high after just 3 3 little puffs there one negative thing and it might actually be this pen is I'm not getting this huge a draw as I would want for pulling I like the bigger clouds but it's sort of ameliorated by the fact that even the small draws are getting me quite high and it might actually just be this pen doesn't have the voltage to get the huge clouds I'll double check I'm gonna be getting a new pen before I finish this so I'll I'll be sure to let you guys know in the follow up if that still the case Wow but up into this point brass knuckles definitely definitely earns their reputation tastes great hits like a dream oh man really really really enjoying the brass on my brass knuckles experience here guys if only it were a little easier to draw from it would be perfect but again that maybe the pen and I'll be sure to let you know guys because I'm gonna review this entire cartridge I'm not just gonna take a couple of puffs and say it's good I'm gonna come back to you guys after I finish this whole Graham here to let you know exactly my thoughts let you know if anything's changed if the starting to leak if the oil got tacky whatever the case may be I'll be sure to let you know in the follow up so I'll come back to you guys probably in four or five days after I finished this bad boy off and let you know exactly what I'm thinking thank you so much for watching weeks to this point guys and I will see you in just a bit it has been actually I believe eight days since I last checked in with you talking the one gram brass knuckles Gorilla Glue cartridge so right off the bat I wasn't doing this really any less than any other cartridge I don't feel like but it lasted a long long time I really got your values worth with this one certainly a gram in there the other thing is it is still very potent this is a potent a blend that they've got in here this is certainly as strong as its sort of reputation lends it to believe but all that being said my initial I'm not as emphatically as in love as I was with my initial impressions or as I was when I gave my initial impressions there have been a couple of things that have walnut spoiled me on the experience have certainly damper the experience one is it became significantly more difficult to draw as time went on I did get a new battery to test it with and even with a new battery it was still kind of tough to draw from and it got harder and harder as time went on and which is something I really have a problem with with the VBA I much prefer the ones that have nice easy drawers that you can make nice big you know take nice big inhalations with as the kids call them make nice big clouds this wasn't really that and I'm not sure if it was this cartridge in particular as you can see there's actually some oil left there at the bottom I just had such a tough time drawing from it that I think I'm just gonna have to leave it there the other thing is it did start to get a bit of a burnt taste as I got closer to the bottom the closer I got the more burnt the taste was it for the most part tasted great I really enjoyed the taste but as we started to get near the end or trim it's the end of its life that burnt taste started to amplify so tough to draw from and increasingly tough to draw from and an increasingly unpleasant taste those aren't good things for sure those those weren't those theirs don't keep it and there's hold it back and getting in my highest remarks for sure but I feel like I'm definitely gonna get brass knuckles the second chance I've heard enough about them that I'm wondering if maybe I just got a bad card what the case may be so I'm gonna give him a second chance we're gonna review something else from them in the future but for now between the two because they're so often compared and they're so look alike I actually think I might prefer the heavy hitters to brass knuckles maybe yeah I think in my initial impressions I would go with the heavy hitter of the brass knuckle but let's get let's go ahead and do another brass knuckle review before we give it any the definitive conclusion and overall my impressions are still pretty positive this is a potent a long lasting cartridge that you're gonna get your money's worth from so you know I it's still really positive review it's just not as good as I initially had hoped but we will be examining them and given the future so fingers crossed and that guys is gonna do it for this review but before I bounce I want to share with you a little cherry on top just something I can share with you guys that isn't necessarily weed related but could be enjoyed with weed or with or without weed and so on this cherry on top what I wanted to share with you guys was something nice and simple something nice and easy an 11 minute web clip from the fine folks at where I guess fine folks the mostly male folks over at Adult Swim make Krueger's of creators of chosen Rick and Morty or at least the hosts of such shows as Rick and Morty but that's not we're here to talk about is Rick and Morty we are here to talk about their 11 minutes short too many cooks too many cooks too many cooks it is an 11 minute video and if you haven't seen it a lot of you I'm sure have that sort of tries to replicate many 90s opening credit songs but things go awry and that's about all I want to say because you should know as little about it as possible before going in because it is who it's gonna be one of the most surreal 11 minutes of your life Definitely Maybe recommend if you do have some cannabis on hand doing some before hand if you're not prone to paranoia if you are definitely pass on it but it's gonna be enjoyable I think for you guys again that is called too many cooks on Adult Swim I'm sure you can find it on YouTube just search too many cooks so guys that's gonna do it for this review here on wheat sand that's gonna do it for this cherry on top as well thank you so much for sticking around to the very end here guys I appreciate it as always and we will see you on the next review peace", "tCNZnYk6xMU": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from that if you couldn't tell from the title it is another cartridge video uh it's another populous herb cartridge video you know i only have i would say about one and a half videos on it i do have another video where you know we're we've just picked up pop herbs but i didn't really you know get into detail um the other flavors were pretty good um but i just had to i just had to try blue dream for myself i don't know i'm not really fond of blue dream but i rarely see it in a cartridge and i figured you know it's nine dollars you know if you didn't see my other papa herbs video it's nine dollars for a half gram cart of blue dream so you know i had to pop cop it and uh let me know you guys opinion on blue dream homie stevie says that purple punch is the new blue dream let me know your thoughts on that that's what he says but yeah it's the cartridge itself i already been smoking on it as you can tell you know they don't come this low but very very enjoyable very very candy-like uh i wouldn't say blueberry taste but i don't let's just get it handy i'm gonna put it in my tutron family so cheers like i get a slight weird taste to it like the similar taste that you would get from like i don't know it's like that weird black licorice taste i don't know if it's exactly it's like a weird taste but then you get the the the sweetness uh kind of um like a like a candy taste um but overall good it is just lit when it comes to papa herbs it is going to be distillate uh if you didn't see the back it is running at 87.60 or 87.63 percent uh packaged on packaged on august 10th of 2020 and uh it says right here manufactured by sublime so yeah uh i mean the cartridge itself very very nice but for those of you who are expecting live resin you're not going to get that for nine dollars for a half gram but overall very very good for your budget cartridge smokers you know if you have nine dollars after you purchase all this stuff and you want to get a cartridge you know i'll definitely recommend this and i'd like to say that nine dollars is the price that i pay in modesto california obviously it's going to be different where you're from even different dispensaries in same cities range different prices so just please just keep that in mind when you're like looking for this car it's not going to be nine dollars if you're not where i'm at you know i'm saying so but yeah blue dream very very good strain from them uh as of right now the probably the best strain that i've tried from papa herbs their cartridges is the gelato but i would say that maybe this is the second best out of all the ones that i've tried i've tried forbidden fruit i've tried wedding cake the consensus with my friends saying that the wedding cake is actually the best but i didn't really like it it's too i don't know i just didn't i mean it's not bad but i didn't enjoy it as much as i would say this or the forbidden fruit one which kind of added like a little pomegranate taste and you guys know like i'm not i don't prefer my cartridges to taste like fruits and all that stuff because it just i think it they don't get me as high when it tastes like fruit it has to taste like wheat to me and it might just be a thing in my brain that kind of just does it's like an anti-placebo or placebo um but yeah it just i don't i don't hate it you know obviously there's some pros to it you know like if i'm smoking this they're just going to think that i'm hitting a blueberry vape or something but yes i do prefer you know when it tastes like the butt itself cannabis derived terpenes instead of fruity terpenes but nonetheless still a really really good buy you know i still this like maybe the the second this is the second time i bought a papa herbs cartridge and it's because it's so affordable and why not you know and uh yeah like like i said in the first pop earth video when it costs nine dollars uh and it's good it's a win-win because at the end of the day it's nine dollars and it's good and even it like it's so cheap you know what i'm saying like even if you did pay nine dollars and it's shitty you just paid nine dollars you know so i'm gonna take one more hit one more no actually two more hits i'm gonna take another one and then i'm gonna show you guys how much smoke i'm actually getting or vape or whatever cheers oh you see don't have that much left but it's been getting me getting me through the week you feel me oh all right let's take start here peace out guys [Music] you", "mfawz0ujn_8": "[Music] hi guys I'm going to talk to you about five of common CBD vaping mistakes number one concentration levels of CBD so here we've got a 10 mil ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please do us a solid share it on to a friend subscribe here baby juice TV and stick as a comment below if you've got your

this indica I usually smoke it at night when I'm going to bed late at night just doesn't help me sleep really good that's got a nice deep sleep this one is one of my favorite pens it tastes so amazing it tastes like a lick one of them orange creamsicle ice creams it is good super mellow high smoke it's pretty heavy on the lungs compared to some of the other ones I don't mind that the flavors really good I actually did a review on the flower of this it was probably the highest THC that I've had from truly y'all want to check it out I'll put a link in the top but yeah this is good stuff if they pens all your thing and you like sweet stuff like I said this one's got like an orange vanilla taste to it it's amazing I'm sure they used some of the orange terpenes and just a little bit of vanilla toffee knits because you know this isn't cannabis derived terpenes in this one that's only in the live resin which truly doesn't have yet but thank you for tuning in guys I'll have a bunch more coming

one might be a little long one because i got some things to show you some stuff to talk about uh and some dabs to smoke okay so without further ado i stopped at simply pleasure here uh in hagerstown shout outs to simply pleasure thank you guys awesome i didn't have what i wanted but i got some other cool [ __ ] which is pretty [ __ ] cool i did need a new torch so i picked up the new torches the first thing i'm going to show you i thought this was pretty [ __ ] cool it's these nuts torch and check that out these nice torch lighter professional butane torch right this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope they had a couple other um you know characters like mario and uh i i don't know any of the other ones i really didn't care to look at them because they didn't catch my eye but this one and mario caught my eye uh i think it's badass i did um already put some fuel in it so nice big torch right beautiful that's exactly what i needed so i got gotta get used to get used to that thing what else did i get here all right uh i did get a new optimizer for my puffco but uh i do not think it is the right one so i might have to uh take this thing back you heard me i might have to take this thing back if it works for my for my uh puffco thing then so be it i'll use it but if not i'm gonna have to take it back i'm saying that because the same pleasure i know how you guys don't like to take [ __ ] back ain't give me a receipt and even offer so i mean my shit's on mine everything's in the in the [ __ ] there you know what i mean but first thing i want to show you guys um of course the rig it comes with a a normal uh flower banger right the normal ass [ __ ] flower banger and the one cool thing is about this if you have a round uh cartridge not like this you might be able to do it like that but if you have a round cartridge you can actually put it in like that in your ball and uh take a pull off of your pen which i have showed that uh in previous fought videos i bought a new box of dirt wipes shout out to [ __ ] dirt wipes and go anywhere without [ __ ] some dirt wipes right all right this is the cool thing here so this thing is called a uh a reclaimed banger the lady lady at the head shop sold me on this i thought this is pretty cool aspect uh what is it yeah oh i'm sorry a recycler banger for dollars okay fifteen dollars i thought this thing is pretty [ __ ] dope so you guys probably seen it on on the on the net somewhere along the line you pull this little guy out there check this out right so you heat the bottom up it has this weird looking coil type i don't know thing in there right but anyway how she explained it you put your oil when you have to heat it up and as you're you're hitting instead of the the reclaim coming out through this bank going into your rig it goes through here uh or comes back down and then up and then back in so therefore you don't waste anything it's always a cycle of of uh catching your recline so once again instead of your recline going in through here it goes down and up and then back into the [ __ ] that coil looking thingy there okay here's the aspect of that 15 okay 15 i'm just gonna sit that right there in the thing all right now let's see the actual main piece what i got you guys ready you guys know meme i like i like my little uh my little rigs but i seen this i fell in love with the colors uh this was sixty dollars ready check this thing out man i absolutely [ __ ] fell in love with it my normal size rigs you guys know it's kind of like a beaker right a beaker style um yeah i mean it does remind me of my other one there with this type style thing there but yeah check that [ __ ] thing out right uh only thing i'm worried about is these little slits you see these little slits there if they get clogged with oil uh it's gonna be a rough day you know what i mean but you guys know me i don't i don't let my [ __ ] get too [ __ ] dirty but uh yeah so that that's pretty much what we got from the head shop so check this thing out yo this thing looks sweet check that out right right down now let me get the banger they come with a uh a carb cap you guys the carb cap here all right nice big ass [ __ ] bubble carp cap and right as long as it's supposed to go straight up and like like that all right right up in the middle boom so that's uh that's everything i got from the head shop i do not recall the [ __ ] price on uh the total of what everything cost but i do know the rig was 60 that thing was 15. um the [ __ ] puffco thing was 25. this was i don't [ __ ] know it was like 120 something 130 bucks but anyway here we go so i'm going to try this out for the first time i'm just going to heat it up i kind of like sterilize it a little bit i'm gonna put some water in this uh new rig here and uh we're gonna you know do a dab but before i i do do all that i do want to show you and talk to you guys about these g-leaf cartridges okay these t-leaf cartridges i am not rolling over bubble wrap rolling over bubble wrap i am not too happy with them liquid live carts by g leaf um they didn't even last me a whole day to be honest like they were [ __ ] the headspace is just [ __ ] killer okay i bought four of them actually i bought five of them but one was distillate but so i bought four of them of the [ __ ] live resin fse full spectrum extract cartridge right here's the la chocolate i saved this one because i wanted to uh like do like a little review on it right i don't know what this one tastes like but i will tell you the um the star dog was the only one i liked i didn't like the [ __ ] the uh what is it pineapple skunk pineapple skunk live resin cartridge i did not care for uh the taste was was that's that's actually a good one there the taste is just yeah it's terrible i don't [ __ ] there's another nation so i'm just gonna say like they're nothing compared to cresco cartridges um i'm gonna hold off from buying them from now on g-leaf like your live resin cartridge are [ __ ] whack and and to me it's a waste of money like i said uh i only smoke like when i'm on break like i don't smoke throughout the day like like a normal person would like that you know just constantly puffing these [ __ ] so like i think maybe i don't know it's i don't smoke a lot it's what i'm trying to [ __ ] say and it didn't even last me a whole day which is [ __ ] ridiculous but oh with that said i do want to open up this one on camera and give you guys my opinion on this one here okay so as you see it's not opened all right not open you're gonna crack this [ __ ] open bomb there it is now check out this headspace okay all these [ __ ] headspace or just killer i thought cresco was bad like my wife is really tired of me saying oh headspace headspace headspace but look at this look at that guys that's crazy now i could say oh it was sitting down inside yeah it was sitting down inside but still i can heat this [ __ ] thing up just a hair just to get it warm and uh you will [ __ ] see the headspace in it this is crazy like i know this [ __ ] sucks into the wick i know it settles and you know i know all that but i'm just saying like that's pretty rough guys you know what i mean you're paying top dollar for for your medicine like i expect uh i expect some some you know some full stuff you know what i mean can you really taste it but hopefully that that heated up enough i mean you guys can tell just about how much head space is gonna be right down to that [ __ ] base of that coil there i can't [ __ ] see it but while we're waiting for that to uh that bubble to go down you're gonna let it sit right there um stop hating on on geely [ __ ] live resin cartridges because they [ __ ] suck and i'm never gonna buy them again uh unless they actually change something about it but like i said the only one i did like out of those four is the [ __ ] star dog that one was not bad at all but getting into the tea leaf that i did buy i did buy a two gram jar of mai thai cured sugar okay and that is right here and i'll tell you what guys this stuff right here is [ __ ] fire look at it [ __ ] fire i would suggest if you got that on your menu from g leaf there in frederick or even in rockville go pick that [ __ ] up like asap once again i'll show you guys the numbers real quick there's that cart falling over on the side that's a wrap get that right there's the numbers stay stick okay so um i'm gonna go ahead and pause the video heat this thing up get this thing nice and sterilized and then i will return all right so i'm back we got that thing uh nice and clean and fried up toasted i've been downstairs rinsed this thing out got this thing on nice and clean nice bottle of water all right let's put some water just a little bit above that huh what do you guys think i know i think maybe i have too much maybe just a little bit too much i think just a hair too much all right i believe that's good all right that is [ __ ] beautiful that is beautiful oh yeah oh yeah all right well let's try it shall we let's see all right now i believe she did say that you heat it up it did say you heat it up first so let's uh let's

are in everybody's pocket why not add some style add some fashion add some class to it for every product that we sell we donate a meal to one of seven food banks in California Nevada well we've donated about 1.2 million meals over the past few years really we just try to bring awareness to it so that you can make it positive impact and I'm think you guys are doing a great job you know you got some of this for the host of the show a couple of these to take with me couple of these and y'all are doing good this year I'll tell you the truth the first one right here this is our high THC version we call this highlighter Plus this is about a 80% or more THC right next to it is our rose gold highlighter that's pretty it's pretty right yeah it's beautiful it's a it's a one-to-one CBD to THC ratio and then on the right side here we've got our highlighter uncrate special edition we only made a few thousand of these things a nice matte soft touch finish it's also a one-to-one CBD THC ratio [Music] that's clean give me some pricing so these are right around $100 a piece well I guess the show is the most expensive it's right sighs I'll pull up here how many how many how many pumps in this thing uh well it depends on how big a puffy take yeah so this is the most expensive is tech break and this would actually be smart the great way to check", "YSjmQy42BWk": "[Music] what's up youtube this is shabazz and i'm back with another cbd hemp flower review what's up tomorrow can of sewers welcome back to another shabazz short today i'm reviewing something that i know a lot of y'all are going to be excited about it's another delta 8 product and specifically delta 8 vape cartridges by effects delta 8. now effects offers granddaddy perp strawberry cough and cali orange kush or calio they have one gram cartridges and guess what i have one of each cartridge so i'm gonna try each one let you know the flavor profile and by the end of taste testing all of them the effects should be kicking right in i do have a couple concerns right off the bat in the package i didn't get any paper test results and most importantly i didn't get a notice to law enforcement now when you're dealing with cannabis product and even especially with delta eight products because there's such a thin line between legality with delta eight there's such a thin line of legality with delta eight i feel like anything like this needs to have a letter to law enforcement what i did get in the package though is this absolutely massive effects sticker so here is the cartridges themselves one gram each says effects delta eight savage brand you got the granddaddy perp the cali oh and the strawberry cough they do have percentages on them so granddaddy perp has 82 percent d8 the cali o has 48 and the strawberry cough has 65.5 percent so let's start with uh the lightest and going up to the heaviest which works out for me too because of those terpenes so here goes the cali orange really nice packaging by the way i really like the packaging this packaging it's you know this is premium looking packaging it looks professional here we go pull the cartridge out the rubber caps on each no branding on this cartridge i don't know what brand it is i don't know where it comes from there has been a big issue in cannabis community lately with people using off-brand cheap carts that have lead and other things in them i don't know about this but it's always a plus when you're using good trusted name brand cartridges like c cell anyways so this is the calio i'm gonna get the screw right on here remember these carts fit on any 510 battery so any little battery like this if you're a stoner if you're in the cannabis life i'm sure you have a couple of these laying around [Music] i really like the terpenes on that really has that citrusy orange wow this is really citrusy and really orangey yeah 48 percent we'll take a couple hits of each one really smooth i mean it's a vapor it's it's it's it's a smooth i mean it's the smoothest vapor gas [Music] cali oh all right i like that one that was really cool and right here on the top i didn't even notice it says hybrid so this is going to be your hybrid smoke and i guess the hybrid terpene i probably should have started off with the sativa which i think is going to be the strawberry cough but that was cool now here goes the strawberry cough sativa terpene profile 65 d8 same packaging once again no really nice premium packaging okay now this one is a different cartridges this is one of the clear top cartridges i've had these before from a different vendor all right got that strawberry cough on there it tastes like strawberries [Music] very smooth the great thing about things they are super convenient they leave no smell you don't have to burn anything smoke anything pack anything clear anything out carry around a lighter go somewhere because the smell no vaporizers you could literally if you're at work you can literally go in the bathroom hit your vaporizer and walk back out no lingering smell nothing nobody will ever know so if you enjoy cannabis whether that be hemp or high thc flour and you are in the interest of being discreet definitely check out vape carts i think this is a good time to to warn everybody about delta eight delta h is very potent generally it doesn't come with the anxiety and the rush and the racy heartbeat and everything that delta nine thc does but that is only if you use it within reason do not overindulge on delta a because delta 8 is still thc and it will mess you up if you are thc sensitive and you cannot handle a thc high don't go crazy on the delta a it is far better than delta 9 far less anxiety but still it can get you there i got overzealous one day i was doing tiny little droplets of delta 8 distillate you know every 30 40 minutes and i was like uh you know this is nothing so i took a bowl of hemp flour squeezed a big old glob of d8 on there smoked the whole thing 10 minutes later i felt like i was dying if you've ever had cannabis induced panic attack you know what that feeling is you feel like you're gonna have a heart attack you can't stop breathing fast because if you breathe normal you just feel like you're not breathing enough racy thoughts you're worried you're paranoid that whole terrible thing that happened to me granted i did take a huge amount a very potent delta ate this to it but still don't go crazy with the delta eight take baby steps and just be cautious with it delta eight can be a very great time but if you overdo it it can also be a bad time all right let's move on over to the grand daddy perp which is the indica coming at 82 i'm gonna take a little bit more light on this one because i definitely feel the effects coming out from the other two same packaging this cart is actually branded so interestingly each cart for each different flavor is slightly different i actually like that because it's easy to tell them apart all right here goes the granddaddy perp and i'm gonna go easy on this because i'm already feeling crazy oh that's extremely creepy i think they might have overdid it with the terpenes on the granddaddy purp that tastes like purple kool-aid straight up it's good it's smooth but i'm gonna have to end that there all right vape cartridges d8 it's convenient no smell no odor no smoke i mean with this product i'm gonna definitely give it the shabazzle of approval good vape good terpenes my only concerns is no letter to law enforcement and they didn't appear to be name brand cartridges so i noticed while editing this video i got so faded i didn't even talk about the effects i don't know if you could notice if you go back and rewind my eyes got super duper red this is what i mean delta 8 is super strong a tiny bit goes a long way and it is extremely easy to overdo it needless to say the effects on these cartridges are very good they're very potent they're so good that i think i need to warn everybody that just because it's delta eight if you are prone to paranoia or anxiety intrusive thoughts you've got to take it easy but yes effects are very strong the terpenes definitely do make a difference whether it's a sativa hybrid or indica feeling afterwards a couple puffs go a long way so don't overdo it but within reason with the delta eight yeah i actually really like that that's a much more convenient way of getting the delta eight rather than smoking or dabbing distillate anyway so y'all that's the review make sure you go down in the description check out the merch hit me up on ig here here i appreciate everybody watching my videos if you liked the video hit like hit me up down in the comments subscribe to the channel and turn on post notifications so you can see when i upload new content i hope everybody has an amazing rest of your day or night and please stay tuned for the next video peace you", "OM5r3zFdvPg": "so real quick before I even start the video I figured the reason you clicked on it was to find out how to see if a Wankel oil card is fake so let's just go over that really quickly first up the Wonka oil label will be raised but every individual letter will be embossed into the packaging as you can see this is raised but every letter is like the same texture so that's not a good sign secondly up here it should say Wonka's Cecil not Wonka ceramic and thirdly there should be a sticker in every package that was your quick thirty second guide on how to tell a real Wonka oil cart now let's get into the video [Music] all right hey guys what's up it's you boy mr. bling seat back again with another video today I'm gonna be doing a little rapid-fire review of these Wonka oil carts I am 99% sure these are fakes but as I'm unboxing them I'm gonna actually like look at them very closely and confirm whether or not my suspicions are correct um so yeah let's get into it I'm gonna start by looking at this trainwreck Wonka oil cart the reason I think that these are fake are the boxart for starters it's a lot more faded than the actual box art you'll get from Wonka loyal carts 'as it has the same writing on the back as the normal packages from what I can find online but the thing is when you open a true Wonka oil cart and you pull it out there should be a stick I don't have a sticker they come with a little Wonka oil sticker so you can like put it places and I guess the fakes they didn't decide to like recreate the sticker that long ago oil gives the cart feels heavy the wax looks a nice color and let's see if it moves at all it looks like it's barely moving so that's a good sign for this being a fake cart but that being said even that TKO cart I looked at uh moves really slowly also there's a white ring on the inside of the cecil atomizer and a lot of you guys in the comments have been telling me that the white ring means that it's a fake sea salt atomizer so that also is discouraging considering the fact that like you know you're buying these carts you want to have good atomizers with them the wax is still barely moving but that just could be because they mix it with something hella thick so I won't be able to know the quality of the distillate until I actually get to vape on them so imma go ahead and open the other box for you guys just so you can see that one maybe that one's like a real cart um but yeah I'm open the other box and then we'll go ahead and take our first puffs okay so next up we're gonna be opening the savage easel Wonka this one looks like it's already been looking a little bit before that's discouraging I don't think whoo I got these from would take out the stickers but like they're still out there here's the card let's check the wax quality same as with the last card it moves barely at all like that I'm really happy with it and I'm really hoping that these end up being decent because like I'm tired of buying really crappy fake carts it's got the white ring which means that it's a fake see cell atomizer so just like the other current I'm pretty sure this one's a fake so let's go ahead and puff on them see if they taste good at lease or if they hit hard and then hold you take a day to review them like usual and I'll come back at y'all tomorrow all right so to cut down on time I already loaded my vapes with the carts this is the train wreck and this is the Sour Diesel oh these are DAB cap compatible so I'm going to be hitting them through the deaf cap as well as hitting them just through the vape so first off we're gonna go with the sour diesel off the seesaw silo just to hit it see how it tastes and see how it rips so cheers guys okay it's not hitting like immediately and I don't know if I've like screwed on my vape thing too tight so let's see if that was the case okay so no it wasn't the fact that I screwed on my date base too hard it's just not hitting this is gonna be really disappointing I'm unscrewing it and it smells like how these discipline cards usually smell like so I doubt that it's like fake fake fake fake like a bad fake so let's just try it one more time I'm not even getting a draw on it I don't understand what's going on okay I might be experiencing technical difficulties with my silo so I'm gonna see if it hits off the m3 so cheers on that hopefully oh that tastes really good that actually tastes amazing there wasn't that much draw resistance on it at all after hating it off of this battery um the taste was amazing and it felt really smooth if you notice I didn't even call and I'm pretty sure I got a good vapor cloud so I'm gonna hit it off the dab cap real quick just to show you like how it will rip through a piece so cheers on that [Music] [Music] it really does taste very good so like I'm a fan of that that's the train wreck so after trying nated the Sour Diesel off of the Cecil m3 I noticed that it didn't even work either I'll show you guys real quick it's not hitting so I'm gonna have to transfer the distillate from this car to another atomizer and hope it works then so I'm very happy I ended up buying an actual Cecil atomizer so before I get to the other half of the video I'm just going to take one more rip of this trainwreck through the dab cap through this guy cactus right from pepper and then we'll get to the other half so I will see y'all tomorrow Cheers [Music] and that really does taste amazing I'm very happy about this train wreck at least so yep see you tomorrow guys all right so rapid-fire review on both of these carts first off the Sour Diesel after changing it to a sea salt atomizer easily my favorite out of both of these this cart hits right up with the grates of this channel like the dab woods carts and the dank vape I'm going to show you it through the dab cap real quick and then I'll talk about it a little bit so Cheers alright so the sour D it's like a tank three rips out of a dab cap is amazing with this cart it's easily enough to get you a good buzz and even sometimes get you high depending on how long your hits are five hits and I am fried for a good two and a half to three hours I would highly recommend getting these carts but if they're fakes switching them to better atomizers because I'm sure they would hit better that being said the train wreck it hits alright just not nearly as well as the Sour Diesel out of that new atomizer that being said this one worked from the box versus the other one where I had to actually transfer it thoughts on this cart the highs are okay but they take forever to get I think six rips from this cart or what gets me high and I have to like keep smoking just to keep the high going um the high off of this cart can best be described as just feeling tired and kind of heavy headed but also relaxed so that was a good thing um the high on the Sour Diesel though was very energetic it helped me focus a bit so I was very excited about that but yeah let me go ahead and take a rip out of this through the dab cap just to show y'all and then we'll go ahead and wrap up [Music] so as you can see the cloud wasn't as good but it was still pretty smooth um but it's not really gonna get me high it takes quite a few rips out of this atomizer to get me high overall I would give the Sour Diesel in this new atomizer an 8 out of 10 and I would give the trainwreck in the regular atomizer a 6 out of 10 that being said they both got overall positive reviews so I have something special planned for our final hit we'll be right back so this is something I usually do for my friends on snapchat but uh I've hooked both of these carts up to the dually from hemp er and a dab cap so I'm gonna hit them both at the same time through a rig I'm gonna try to do a blinker so uh stay tuned for that let's go so you know nothing can mentally prepare me for doing this but anyways if y'all made it to you into this video thank you so much please like and subscribe and leave in the comments some ideas for other upcoming videos I have a few ideas but I'm always looking to like see what y'all want to see on the channel I plan on doing a timebomb for a thousand subs cuz we're about to hit that I'm so excited and thank you all for 500 like I think that time I'm uploading this out be at 600 but like I'm blown away by the support I'm receiving thank you all so much from the bottom of my heart and there's blinkers for y'all so let's go cheers guys [Music] compilation' bees", "gVRdnEq4in8": "[Applause] today an alarming breaking news report about vaping it's a new piece of the puzzle that may explain the mysterious vaping injuries we've been covering here on the show from double lung transplants to even death I mean big complications is the culprit black-market THC the chemical in marijuana that gets you high and listen products are being sold to unsuspecting customers that have no idea what they're buying may be lethal senior legal and investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden brings us this as an NBC News exclusive our investigation took us to downtown Los Angeles where in a 12 block radius we saw dozens and dozens of storefronts advertising vaping products we're in pursuit of what black market operators come here for the empty packaging and cartridges that they fill with cheap and often tainted substances sold as legitimate THC products within minutes we score we were able to go in one shop one-stop shopping by these dank VAP containers the packaging and a hundred of the cartridges into which you can put whatever you want there's no ID no tax no nothing and it's counterfeit marijuana babes like these that may be making people sick I do believe that I was given black market stuff and I do believe that had a had an effect on me Fabian says his lungs were slowly beginning to shut down he ended up in the emergency room I couldn't breathe I couldn't talk I really couldn't even move my hands so what is lurking in these black market vapes and are the legal ones even safe no one not even the FDA or the CDC had tested the actual vapor people are sucking into their lungs until now we revealed those results Cynthia joins us what exactly is marijuana vape and how do you compare it to the typical East cigarettes or tobacco baby ok so a step backwards vaping is just taking a liquid of the compound heat it up and then that vapor is what you suck into your lung so if it's nicotine like a Joule which has 80% of the market that's tobacco THC the active ingredient in marijuana it's made into a liquid form and then it's heated up and then you suck that into your so again the cartridge looks like this that's what we were buying that's what we were buying on these are the ones we bought on the street so we bought for a hundred bucks we bought a hundred containers and a hundred of these so if I'm a black-market manufacturer of THC oil I'm in business when you walked into that store yeah what actually transpired what was the conversation like you said I got a hundred bucks when you got for me did you have to sort of lead him along how'd you hook that the fish well the first thing I would say is that we had our choice of dozens and dozens and dozens of stores in downtown Los Angeles all of them selling these kinds of illicit products and so we said hey we want to buy some containers we rolled off a few of the illicit names that are popular dank vapes is one you've got it right here dank vapes it is associated with many of the people who got sick it is not a legitimate brand there is no company called dank vapes so the black market on this which is what's concerning to me seems to be dominant there doesn't seem to be any way of digging taking them out less consumers are unsuspecting well even more insidious there are legitimate brands that aren't contaminated of THC oil that you can buy in states where it's legal and these counterfeiters make boxes and carts that look exactly like those legitimate brands so the consumer has essentially no idea what he or she is going to get so the Mac market operators fill empty cartridges with their own substances and then they're selling them as legitimate tested products but what exactly are they putting in there and is it dangerous Cynthia brought the stuff to a lab to find out if the chemist a flabs in Los Angeles considered one of the top marijuana testing facilities in the world can a safe executives Aaron Riley and Antonio Frazier explain they've come up with a brand new test we wanted to design a system that would be able to provide reproducible results to do something they wish the government would do analyze the vapor produced by illicit THC oil Canas they've tested seven THC cartridges from licensed dispensaries and six from the black-market we come back the shocking results from the lab [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I'm back with NBC News investigative correspondent Cynthia McFadden and for the very first time a new lab test is able to tell us exactly what is in the vapor produced by THC oil when you vape what's actually going into your lungs to remind everybody what you tested okay we tested seven legitimate products these are licensed brands from licensed dispensaries and then on the black market we tested six black market these are listen what did the kind of safe lab testing show was in the vapor coming out of it okay there were no contaminants in either the oil we also tested the oil previously either the oil or the vapor here if that was used at the temperature that's recommended we can talk about that let's say that the lowest temperature or lower temperature lower temperature because guess what when you crank the thing up which is what kids do because it makes more vapor Oh carcinogens yeah so not safe anymore not safe anybody know what happened to black market cartridges even when it was turned at the right power setting on the low side okay under the best set of circumstances this stuff is dangerous it's contaminated this is just you're asking for it you vape this stuff you're asking for it well they're stealing your money it's not surprising they would steal your health well what percentage of America is given products that are counterfeit yeah you're asking questions really hard to answer because this is the illicit market the black market it's underground law enforcement is having a really hard time getting a Tanz around this think about it I mean the FDA isn't testing this stuff why it's not legal across the country so the FDA doesn't have the authority to test these brands but you know states are doing the best they can but the best they can it's not good enough in my opinion because we've got a population doesn't appreciate I just the things I've read maybe it's a quarter maybe it's half of all the stuff is counterfeit it's being brought basically from a drug dealer all right the THC oil let's go through exactly what kinds of things were found in your testing by the way it's state of the art and I would applaud you for doing this because our own government is in doing this we've finally got the answers from you well some of the things none of them good carbon monoxide formaldehyde pesticides well we're in the counterfeit stuff the ELISA stuff for rat you find a couple things that surprised you yeah it'll surprise you to cyanide yeah you don't want your kids breathing that stuff you just don't or yourself and vitamin E oil which is a little bit confusing it really sounds healthy but what they want though is the consumer to think it's real THC oil so they mix it with vitamin E oil why they pick that one because the viscosity the thickness is the same as vitamin E oil so these are really crafty dastardly criminals so let's talk a little about vitamin E because I think it's exam it's emblematic of the problem here we all know substances like pesticides and sine are dangerous let me talk about it but vitamin E sounds healthy right but when you inhaled the vapor with vitamin E in it it goes into your lungs right at the high temperature it's converted into an oil to a grease in your body once in a long some say that it coats the Airways and when it does that then coats the Airways it starts an inflammatory reaction making it really hard to breathe the information in the oil get into the tiny little sacs these little sacs alright of your lung they're not hard to treat now the CDC thinks vitamin E is that big culprit behind these marijuana vaping deaths and injuries but we're no unsure and if these black markets your products are being sold like this the question I'm having everybody is what can people do to make sure that they're getting something that's safe well don't buy illicit products buy from a licensed dispensary is one thing I just want to add a little bit to your vitamin E oil here's so the Mayo Clinic as you know did a of testing on 17 patients who had that vaping illness and they discovered that the lungs of those patients looked like someone who'd been exposed to mustard gas so it's why it's important they're only state regulated marijuana dispensaries in states were its legal right to your point the government won't regulate it because it's only in these states so when you look at the country if you're in a red state maybe you're buying marijuana from a legitimate place right if you're in a great state guarantee or not then if it in the red states from Cynthia Stella me is there more of the illegal places illicit places than illegal ones which means you're buying the stuff from drug dealers they're not legitimate sellers I don't see a difference between two groups so you've got another big warning which I wanted to point out which is the temperature warning just make that really clear to folks so when we tested the legal product that didn't have the contaminants that are horrifying the cyanide and other things cranked up higher they produce what the lab told us were carcinogens but you know if your kids are doing it tell them making those big vapor puffs is just not worth it it could be killing them so if you're not buying THC cartridges for a licensed dispensary in states where they're illegal here's the picture again right you're buying them from the drug dealer don't do it and if your vape pen is an adjustable temperature setting don't crank it all the way up because it's dangerous lots of data support in this now use the low power setting Cinthia wonderful reporting thank you very much you can catch Cynthia's reporting on today and NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt and be sure to check out Cynthia's latest report the results of a year-long NBC exclusive investigation where she uncovers an underground army of child laborers in Africa they are digging up a mineral being used in everyday cars planes and cell phones that's where I'll use them we'll put a link to the special report on dr. oz comm I'll be right back [Applause] [Music] be sure to subscribe to my channel so you don't miss anything and remember to check back often to see what's new", "4OlmQRxY3QU": "hey what's up everyone it's your boy mr. blinky back again with another video today I'm gonna be looking at this fake heavy hitters cart and showing you guys the signs to look for when you're buying your own heavy hitters carts to see which ones are fake and which ones are real so let's go ahead and get into the video all right so there are five big signs to look for when it comes to identifying a fake over a real heavy hitters cart so I'm just gonna quickly go into each of those first up we have cold filtered at the top real heavy hitters carts that are sold as one gram cartridges do not say cold filtered at the top they just simply don't have that they just say all of this stuff so that's already a big red flag second red flag would be that California label on the inside of the box that I'm trying to show you guys that should not be there that should be blank and it should just have the hh4 heavy hitters on this silver foil type thing or the silver foil type paper on the inside of the packaging that California label that you see right there should actually be right here unauthentic heavy hitters packaging the third sign is right down here where you see the 2019 fluids manufacturing ink and all of that other [ __ ] that should not be there which should be there is this push to release embroidered into the Box where you have to tear it to open it you should not be able to open real cart boxes this easily because obviously that can make it easy for anyone to just put whatever they want into these boxes so the fourth sign would be right here where it says instructions that should actually say suggested use and then finally you have right here where it says Bubba cush that is not a strain that heavy-hitters offers in there one gram cartridges I'm gonna link the heavy-hitters website in the description but you can actually go there and see a list of every strain they offer so if your plug is trying to sell you one that's not on that list on their website then you know he's bullshitting you those are a few very quick signs that you can look at to see if you're gay faker a real heavy hitter skirt now I'm gonna go ahead and plug it into my battery take a few puffs on it to see how it tastes and see how it hits and I'll go ahead and come back tomorrow until you guys how the high is how it makes me feel and if these are even worth buying so yeah let's go ahead and get into that all right so the 710 carts that these heavy hitters are using are not DAB cap compatible unfortunately it's the same kind of tip that you can see in exotic carts it's sort of like a funnel but it's too small to actually clip on or not clip on but like attached itself to the dab cap so unfortunately I can't show you guys a rip through a rake but if these carts are actually decent I'll figure out how to do that for tomorrow so for now let's just go ahead and take a few puffs see how these cards taste and how they rip and I'll let you know my thoughts so cheers guys [Music] so off that rip I'm getting a bit of earthy taste it tastes kind of like dirt if I'm being honest it's not very pleasant but the smoke is really smooth and it doesn't really hurt my lungs while I'm hitting it so that's a good sign I'm gonna go ahead and take another rip and we'll see if I'm starting to feel the buzz off - so Cheers [Music] yeah I'm getting good cloud production on it I don't feel a buzz or anything but these are so it doesn't feel like a chore daf-2 puffs on this cart I'd actually definitely hit this thing all day so I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'll come back tomorrow and share my thoughts and we'll see if these cars are worth buying so I'll see you guys tomorrow all right guys so I'm going through so much [ __ ] to get this video done right now this is my third time recording this part of the video because the first time I recorded it I didn't press report the second time I recorded it I had a Miranda sings hairline so we cut that [ __ ] out I'm gonna leave the other half of this part in simply because like I don't want to re-record that I do not want to get that high again you'll see I was super fried during this F um and I look terrible but anyway so things I went over in the part where I had the bad hair line so I've used this hurt for two days now and I used it for two days because I didn't think one day was enough to get like a good read on the highs of the potency and all the other good stuff I like to review oh and what got cut out was when I was talking about the potency it's really good four to five hits gets you a nice buzz six to seven hits gets you high and then if you get to nine hits then you might be slow to order in space like this current really does hit heavy even if it's not like a legit heavy hitters cart um and yeah now I'll go back to myself in the past um to finish off the video so see you guys oh yeah and the camera angles suck right now because my tripod literally just broke while I was trying to finish this video so you know we're just having fun it's a it's a great time book ago or I'm right but uh yeah so I'm ordering new tripod so I can fix my ankles again we might have to go back to the old recording area yeah so channel updates yay next up we have how long these cards last I have been using this card for two days now and it's about 1/4 of the way done so that means I would probably last around eight days if you're lucky um I've also been sort of with this cart not gonna lie but it does get me high for a long time so like being sparing is also easy with it my next point is the flavour and wax quality I know in my initial review of it I said it just tasted like straight dirt but after hitting it a few more times I can start of I can sort of start to taste more earthy tones like when you taste coffee um it doesn't taste exactly like coffee but it does taste sweet and earthy like a coffee beverage would um I would highly recommend getting this cart honestly like the wax quality is decent it's very slow-moving which was it like a good sign for me and unlike what the TKO cart even though it's slow-moving this one actually does hit really [ __ ] hard um if you guys have these around you and they look around the same like quality as these ones I would highly recommend picking them up I would set these up like right there with tanks and dab woods um easily an 8 out of 10 um I already filmed this review and I'm really high right now so it's kind of hard to like keep a steady train of thought but I think all I have it done for the second half is take hits on camera so let's go ahead and take two rips out of the battery then we'll go and take two rips through violet and then we'll end the video so thank you guys so much for watching if you made it this far please leave in the comments what your favorite cart brand is right now because I'm trying to find new brands to try I already have dragon's breath on my list um and I really want to try ROH soon um but yeah and please in the comments stop telling me to try likes dizzy I can't try Suzy's even though I really want to so every time you all tell me to try as dizzy I just died a little bit more inside um where I live we don't have like studies all right so I cannot try though thanks for the suggestions though I really appreciate it and if I do ever find its dizzy the first thing I will do is record myself dry again so um yeah let's go ahead and get into these rips guys Cheers yeah it just tastes really good and the hits are actually starting to be pretty smooth off of it too um when I first recorded it I coughed like a [ __ ] after all of my hits but now that I'm already high all these sets just feel smooth and it tastes really good so let's go ahead and take another hit Cheers my throat bout dry as [ __ ] so let me go ahead and drink some water and then I'll take another hit I hope y'all can see how high I am right now cuz I believe is [ __ ] fried right anyway so Cheers [Music] I tried I tried to do a ghost I don't know if it showed but yeah but we tried all right anyway let's go ahead and take a few ribs through violet and then I'll end the video so the hard part is trying to figure out how to smooth these through a dab cap so I'm gonna get behind the camera and just show you real close-up like the easiest way to do it so that in case you guys have a dab cap in these kind of tips you can smoke them through rigs too so to get this with a dab cap this is so hard to hold with one hand you have to like put the dad cap upside down and then you just have to like hold the car on top of it see if it'll focus and then you just have to hold the car on top of it like that and that way it funnels into the piece anyway I'll go ahead and show you guys I hit yeah so just for the record real quick this will be my third hit through violet off off this cart since I've started my smoke sesh um and I've probably taken five hits of the cart like on just trying to do this review and I'm already like this fried so that should just speak for the like potency of this cart alright the pink incident I didn't realize all right I know this next hit is gonna send me so I'm gonna go ahead and say peace right now thank you so much for watching and I hope you guys stick around my next video is gonna be sort of a channel update I think and I'm gonna be talking about this giveaway that I want to do but yeah leave them in the comments some ideas of it keep it kind of like under a hundred bucks or around 100 bucks cuz I'm just having to pay for this out of pocket so thanks again for watching all of my content thank you guys for subscribing and commenting and like my videos all of it means a lot

but we are in my car because I have to go to [ __ ] school on a Friday which is my second day which makes no sense because I started yesterday on a Thursday I don't know it's my 2nd year my final year of my trade school [ __ ] I don't know I'm excited to be done but the reason I'm doing this review right that voice crack I'm 12 uh the reason I'm doing this review is because this morning I broke my toe in the shower like a dumbass so that hurts like a [ __ ] and like I said I don't want to go to school cuz it's my second day on a Friday so [ __ ] that you know so today we're reviewing z skittles um I was gonna do like the whole gram challenge but I don't know I feel like that'll be a lot and I should wait till like 100 subs or something like that if that happens I'm whenever but maybe we'll do like a half gram challenge or something like that but this right here is a full spectrum distill it it's a full gram it's the same distributor the so like the dispensary doctor Rosa dispensary way out shits build Deer Valley and then it's not that far so the last one definitely [ __ ] my ass cheeks up so I think this one will to that select cart by the ways I have it in my pocket actually I really hope nobody drives by cuz this will be weird I'm just kind of out in the parking lot little Chipotle because I wanted to get Chipotle but I don't think I'll have time after this video unfortunately you guys always come first up the nice elect cart that shits got a little bit of wax but you know that that stuff does not ever get hit ever I don't know why but it says nom we were hitting battery juice before we didn't that stuff so this card is completely dead I threw it on the anodized battery because this one died and I had to charge it and I didn't want to wait so good as Carter went really fast I did feel like but you know it's a half gram and I'm a little [ __ ] so I probably complain a lot it so we're gonna just jump right into the review yuuji strobe I kind of looked at me a little bit anyway like I said for probably the 15 millionth time z skittles blah blah batch you don't need the badge number y'all don't want that crap let's go ahead and rip this bad boy open boom there she is mmm not even open yet there's still Ziploc thinking I was just smelling bag hold on mmm I don't know what that that smells like a very like fruity maybe of fruity cushion kind of taste yeah not bad I'm a I'm a fruity kind of guy you know what I mean let's do this anyway I can't twist off the battery today we're rockin lean doctor zodiacs razzle dazzle moon rock Barry battery to take this bag don't get people don't live they can't seat you if you don't move go ahead and pop off this sexy ass rubber cap shit's girthy rubber cap on this one oh no they parked over there oh no they're gonna come join my review surprise review guests the Civic driver we're gonna pop that cap back on this old cart here just because I like to have all my cards but the cash back on kind of works out that way here you guys go here's the oil I don't really have a white background per se I mean I kinda have to book this thing but it's the wax it moves it does move but not tremendously fast so that's good as it gets hotter obviously don't move quicker and quicker but you know no dang fades no PG no VG none that [ __ ] so we are chillin hard with this stuff and well without further ado wait it's important important hydration time boys go ahead and move up the throat here hydration drink of hydration drink of choice yeah hydration drink of choice is some Aquafina it's what they had at the circle-k it's on the way here [ __ ] I don't know okay anyway boys oh let me just say real quick this is for 18 to 21 years old depending on your state and adult smoking cannabis shits I can't make the rules I just got to tell you them you already know how it is if you're if you're still here let me know what you're smoking on in the chat the chat the comments the comments let me know in the comments huh otherwise I have nothing more to say except for that's a big-ass list a truck cheers guys oh [ __ ] that brings me that taste brings me back to like when I first started smoking didn't like carts like when I first started getting some real gas not from the dispensary but some real gas from a whole meet up that's ooh hell yeah that tastes real good guys I'm not gonna lie that gives me some good good good good flashbacks hydration break you know honestly out of all the carts I've had oh no we have another car dude I spilled water on my old bro this car out of all the other ones I think so far this is honestly like the smoothest hitting I mean it don't get me wrong this [ __ ] like hurts you know it hurts inside right but it feels good I don't know what else hurts inside usually there's so many people around here it's like everybody's just staring at me like I don't really mind I don't really care I just think it's weird then again there's only two people and they're like 100 feet away that way and then there's like one more person wait that way and they're like 300 feet away I know cheers let's do another one I hope you guys haven't been able to hear my a/c going probably coulda heard it more so in the Jesus Christ you probably conquered it more so in the beginning of the video I turned it down like a couple minutes ago you might have noticed a difference in white noise I hope not but maybe me bring it up you probably do notice it now a [ __ ] terrible person I'm sorry what kind of cars you guys in doing I'm just looking at like these cars around here so many kids at my school like have these lifted trucks bro I don't know I don't know where their parents get this money like I had to buy my own car I have to pay my own rent you know like these kids are showing up in like $35,000 lifted trucks and there's 17 I'm like what the [ __ ] you know I'm 18 driving a Mazda 3 hatchback shoutout to you if you like the hatchbacks you know I like to call her the panty-dropper the panties drop because they're so wet you know why they're so wet cuz me just kidding cuz my car just kidding it's not has this has not got me one car anyway I like this card a lot so far guys um I tried telling you to taste it's kind of like a fruity plunging almost taste it and you definitely taste a lot of cushion there as well it is honestly I don't know if I'd call it fruity actually it's it's got some taste in there of fruit but it's not like super strong it's more of like a pungent cush kind of taste over anything and I'm usually like a fan of fruity flavors I guess when it comes to courts but but this one is definitely a great contender for what I'm gonna top tasting karts I've ever had if you like that the less of the terpenes but more of like the cush the pungent like wax taste I guess if that's what you're looking for then what strain was this jungle last one was jungle juice this is the skittles I guess this is the one to go for it I don't know how closest this will be to like other ones you know obviously but if you're going to dr. roses and you want one that tastes just like I described go for Zee skittles for sure and like I said you do get that you get a free half gram select cart which was my last video if you haven't checked that one out go back and look at that for being a first move a first time patient there and then I think if you refer somebody you also get another half gram cart as well for free and then they get that first time one and then if they refer blah blah blah keeps going which is actually stupid cool I don't really know a lot of homies I have their medical cards but you know if I did I'd be getting a lot of select cards you know I'm saying say I say we take one more one more good one right and we call it there right is that three I think that'll be three I'm feeling pretty good I got still got school guys I can't be going like the last video all like inbred looking [ __ ] you know I was that should have me [ __ ] up you know like [ __ ] up but I kind of want to go to school like that cuz that'd be fun ah I don't know let's do one more for sure one more and we'll see how we're feeling we'll see cheers guys mmm yup there it is there she blows hydration break you know that one video I think it was the kind sweet cart speech one I had that really good um piece T the peach one I think it was peach or was mango one of those too but I'm pretty sure it was piece the piece team Pete that [ __ ] was so good bro I've never seen it at another establishment since then I saw a quick trip that one time they saw all the other three flavors of peace tea but not peach am I the only one in the world that likes peach or what I don't know what I got to do but I'll do it I don't know if I gotta slide him a 20 under the table and put that [ __ ] back on the shelves or if I got a light not gonna dance for somebody maybe you know it's not not up to my morals but that tea have teas worth a dancer till you know I'm saying but pretty I hear guys I'm I'm pretty hungry too Oh guys bro I just parked outside Chipotle when I say something that was why I party bro bro that's some great news since I just got some great news I'm gonna give you awesome green news we're gonna do number four might as well write Cheers oh no Jason brake [ __ ] send help I'm dying all right guys my conclusion with this cart for this quick little sesh this for hit sesh right before school right it's a [ __ ] Cenac or there's no other way to put it I'm on four hits and I'm I'm pretty high I'm I'm not like slow like to level right but [ __ ] I'm in like I don't even know what kind of hide this is well guys I'm gonna end the video there this will probably be up on Saturday so you know maybe maybe Friday maybe Friday depending what time or how school goes and [ __ ] hey there's a person a problem would be Saturday it'll probably set solo [ __ ] I just want to say thank you guys very much for watching let me put down this water I don't know why I'm in the water thank you guys so much for watching the supports been awesome let me know what other kind of reviews you guys want

notifications anyway especially for YouTube anyway later guys I'll see you all in the next one deuces", "DKOD64GSTvE": "I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon shot - Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or have a medical marijuana card I don't know my personal information I know what's up guys running right back at you so this video I got another card review for you guys if you guys like these like car reviews and like weaved reviews uh videos like tell me down below in the comments so I know to keep doing them otherwise I won't make these videos anymore and I'll put more effort and content that you guys might put out content that you guys do enjoy watching so yeah let me know down below in the comments if you guys like these or not so I know what to do but this video I actually got a cart review like I said in the beginning a detective a few different strains from this brand ego lapse Evo lab I got blueberry strawberry lemonade and sweet melon so we got a sweet melon blueberry and strawberry lemonade this is the one that we're gonna review today in this video so uh yeah if you guys want to see a review for these two stumbled on ball I'm gonna do that the reason why I actually like got three of these is because they had like a fire eyes do they actually have it thrown off the next week's that's [ __ ] dope um we buy two of these for $29 each so I'm down to like 60 bucks they give you a free one it's like a free car and a free battery with it so this is the battery I had to open the battery to charge it when I made this video so a PI two cards you get a free car and a free battery so 60 bucks you end up getting three carts and a battery that's the [ __ ] CEO in my opinion um yeah that's the [ __ ] crazy deal so though they're only half gram cards obviously so but still 60 bucks for 1500 milligrams and a battery I mean you can't really beat that and this from a dispensary so you know it's like I leave some quality [ __ ] you know what I'm saying so the battery I had to open it up so it looks just like a simple stick battery it comes in here this was the box this is evil lab a battery that's pretty much all that says it's evil evil a battery that's what it says that's pretty much all the box that and then um inside there it came with obviously the little stick battery no little stick battery the charger for it I think it's just a regular Android charger the charges with and then it comes with a little instruction paper so it says uh to charge the voltage this fate battery has three temperature settings low is the green green light medium is a blue light and then the high temperature is a red light to change the voltage setting click the button three times quickly quickly preheating your batteries key to a quality burn to preheat the battery turn the battery on by clicking five times then press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds the user can stop reheat in my press in one time so so I guess I supposed to picked up the temperature you want low medium or high obviously and then a preheat it and then hit it I don't know that others like pain if you guys see my last couple reviews I didn't have to preheat it you literally there's no button or not and you just [ __ ] hit it so that's a little bit different oh I see myself with that in a second so the bag that I opened this up already um even like all I did is just slides up you see that's all I did I didn't really take it out of there but this is a really [ __ ] sick packaging I can look at this for how cheap this [ __ ] like how for how cheap they're giving this away like three cards for 60 bucks for the battery they look [ __ ] fired - like watch so this is the packaging obviously yeah let me show you the packaging yeah so this is the package in one more time for you guys evil lab strawberry lemonade down there contains marijuana keep away from children contains 500 milligrams and I believe these are called the Cuomo colors that's what the Spencer you're saying if you see you right there I hope that label doesn't have any of my personal information I'm not supposed to be showing you guys on it hopefully it doesn't and if it does please don't [ __ ] me over but yeah so 500 milligrams it's also a hybrid are you guys that are interested it's a hybrid cart so it's called a chroma colors by evil lab that's the name of them and actually I think these cards are extracted with co2 like in the house some companies a cracker or you know like there's a million different ways to do it now but I believe that these are these are co2 yeah I believe it you co2 come correct but don't quote me on that but I'm almost 90% sure basically everything thirty years ago so I guess it's tested at 80 percent THC yeah there's test results for you guys very interested all that [ __ ] and then I'm what school you just slide it out of here and I think this is though I haven't seen anything past this part I just let it out of here and I seen this oh yeah so right here I saw yeah you see this college car or co2 card you see what I'm saying so yeah I'm pretty sure it's me I co2 here's the little bum tube inside a box I don't know what the [ __ ] we want to call that so you pull that out nothing really inside there it's empty now evil laugh this contains marijuana keep away from children basic [ __ ] then again up their CEO - like I was saying before so yeah all you guys see this if you guys want you can pause this and read it I'm not gonna eat the whole thing it's just kind of going over the brand some of the other products they have and just some information if you guys want you can read that I don't feel like reading the whole thing right now do you guys yeah posit if you want today I came with that that was inside the tube and then besides for that use the cart so every they called what chromo colors or something like that I said every flavor cart so the strawberry lemonade is lemonade is obviously yellow no I'm saying blueberry is a blue the sweet melon is I got green I think and like just all the different flavors on the cartridge in the color so I think that's just like a little cool thing they do a little small detail that you guys really though the actual oil itself is really really really clear actually but you guys can see that tell me your opinion down below in the comments also there was the bubble so you can see I think it is the oil for like 10 bucks a car basically I mean I'm not complaining and I know it's my dispensary not I mean so I has to be safe so tell me what you guys think down below in the comments for sure definitely interested in knowing what you guys think but um let's just pop this [ __ ] off throw it on my new battery and see what happens sorry so we got those two yellow things a lot this is what it looks like without that yellow tips so I'm not gonna lie um this looks pretty badass like all black battery with a few labs and black card with like whatever color accent flavor you got and not I'm saying this [ __ ] is actually pretty doh so I guess we're gonna go medium so it's about to click it five times real fast one two three four five all right so it's on I don't know if you've seen it blank so let me wanna so click it three times one blue that's green ice oh I'm blue I don't know if you've seen it we're on medium set medium temperature so now I'm preheating your battery is a key to a quality burn to preheat turn the battery on my collecting five times and press the button two times quickly to preheat for 10 seconds all right so I'm supposed to preheat it before I hit it I'm supposed to I don't know I never had a car was supposed to preheat it before you hit it but no one to the red light came on that's a preheating it's bubbling up now I hit it I got you so it preheats and nothing you hold so obviously that strips I don't think I hit it all the way I don't know what the [ __ ] it felt like um I wasn't getting like at all like the curette airflow it wasn't hitting correctly that should hit smooth as [ __ ] um I definitely got the long expansion it did oh I did like hurt my chest a little bit like that just do you know I'm saying I have a high tolerance if you guys didn't know by now but this is a far as Cara I can taste the lemonade a little bit I don't really taste the strawberry lemon at least the regular lemonade really else I'll call it not a strawberry lemonade and they're gonna call it strawberry lemonade I really do they should have put like a pink color on it not [ __ ] yellow strawberry lemonade is pink not yellow but just my thoughts and opinions um I first said I mean I liked it it was dope $10 card pretty much I'm not complaining at all the battery into this [ __ ] looks sticky ribs I'm not 10 bucks I'd buy if these are in stock for 10 bucks for like every I would keep on buying these forever because you can't go wrong with this [ __ ] his fire was [ __ ] 500 milligrams I only hit it once but it's 10 bucks for this what the [ __ ] is definitely weird there yeah so 10 bucks for this [ __ ] is definitely [ __ ] worth it in my opinion um if you guys ever see that the owner area Duncan Copp lemon hey if you guys ever tried this brand and we don't belong the comments what you guys think of it let's hit it again real quick [Music] so that tasted like it was a little bit burnt I thought it off you seen that but I'll put it back on the low temperature heads up on the medium temperature I feel like that was I tasted a little burn so let me hit it real quick on the low temperature your sleep affects it taste or anything at all you know I mean you guys are smoked off I didn't say in the beginning in this video I always [ __ ] forget I should have edited it and don't watch this video Lester 1821 whatever the legal age is in your state or you have any medical merit or you have your medical marijuana card like I do myself um yeah just gotta say that [ __ ] to cover my ass I can't get this channel to lead it don't want a copyright strike you know how it goes so yeah long time that's it I was a lot Betty whoo all right so definitely got a lot more flavor on that um definitely got the lemonade tastes a little bit more tasted I think that I don't know if I did something wrong when I preheated it or well I don't know because my first time using this battery I have to give it a little bit more used to it but it does taste a little bit burnt um but I think I might that might be my fault I think I did something wrong but for 60 bucks for three cards 1500 milligrams and a battery I'm not complaining at all that was a hundred percent where is it the cart I'm gonna give the cart the oil I'm gonna give me like a 3.5 out of 5 it's not the best oil if you guys you guys seen my own select elite premium court views um those half gram carts are so [ __ ] fired but they're 40 bucks a half-round recipes right here these are [ __ ] fire this is actually pineapple Express I dropped the review on this I'll go watch that video if you want these are actually 40 bucks for a [ __ ] half gram that's [ __ ] expensive but these are so [ __ ] fired for the basically like a little bit more than the price of one of those cards you could get three carts of these with a battery you know what I mean so just personally my opinion I like saving money I like ballin on a budget you know what I mean so I would go with these but the oil is in the best I'm had better like I just said I said 3.5 on the oil quality but the looks like the aesthetic just like everything about it like just the way the battery looks the way they carved like looking complements the battery that [ __ ] gets a 5 out of 5 a [ __ ] it's sexy [ __ ] like you got a mitt but it's it's not the worst though so it's like I'll definitely wait rather I'd pay 40 bucks for one of these before I pay 40 bucks for a [ __ ] Mario Kart or an exotic card [ __ ] those so yeah that's that's one thing never smoked one of those so yeah overall reading the battery before I rate I mean first impressions on the battery I like the battery a lot I don't know if it's the car or if it's the battery that has that little burnt taste like I'm talking about so I need to try the battery on a couple other cards first before I can really give it a full rating you wanna mean but I really like it I like the way it looks like oh saying and I like how it has that pre he said and how it has three different temperatures that shit's all badass that little like burnt taste I don't know if that's coming from the car or the batteries I need to figure that out so I don't know right now I'm gonna give the battery a 4 out of 5 but that's really because I've only hit it 4 times maybe maybe once I hit it a couple more times might give it a better or worse rating I don't know yet the evil labs oil overall I'm gonna give it a 4 out of 5 - because the oil wasn't the best quality yeah I've had way better quality [ __ ] before in the past I've said but compared to some of other exotic all that [ __ ] this is some stupid fire compared to that [ __ ] for the price too though like at least I got a for 60 bucks for three cards and a half I mean for 60 bucks for three cards and a battery that's a [ __ ] stupid steal like you can probably find that [ __ ] unless you are you're getting some fake [ __ ] you know I mean like at the dispensary you're not really fun and you always like that of us it's recreationally legal in your state but that's the reason why I'm [ __ ] with it I like the price point on it some people it's like for people that are ball on a budget that don't wanna I don't have 40 bucks you spend that I have you know I'm saying so I think that should Stoke and they just look sick you know what I mean how everyone's a different color and the pack you know they just for and for how cheap they are to all the small little details they have that shit's crazy but if you guys ever tried the brand like I said time we don't blow in the comments what you guys think if you guys haven't just putting a video I guess tell you how many of your opinions and if you guys actually like like these reviews I might not blow in the comments like I said so I know to keep doing them not I won't okay so if you guys want me to all review these other stream cards the blue baby and a sweet melon so I'll get these out of five um I guess massage for that if you guys like this video big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] follow me on my Instagram at all money read please I'm not the hit 10,000 subscribers really really want to hit 10k you don't have to do but it'd be [ __ ] greatly appreciated so I visage for that peace out", "c4SZOLT_ccc": "yo hey guys and welcome back to my channel it's your boy real maddie smokes

going to go ahead and take one last rib and that's gonna be it for the video that's it for the video make sure you guys leave a like subscribe comment do all that and this ethan signing out [Music] peace you", "tpRjCsSQ0Do": "by the title the video as you guys can see man I'm be telling you guys how to bring in either your pen how I got it in I'm gonna tell you guys what I went through why I brought it I'm pretty much like this is gonna be a little story time because I wanted to make a video and while I'm out here so when I get back I could just upload and you guys could see something while I'm out here so yeah today guys we're gonna be ripping on the West Coast curd I'll take up close a close-up after this yeah very very nice man I'm like I'm a little bit more than half no a little bit less than halfway he's done with it but I've been trying to use this so scarcely but we're gonna take a quick rip before we get into the storytelling stuff like that oh so cheers boys if you guys are 18 and over 21 and over you guys know the deal [Music] man it's nice to being able to smoke outside dude my tolerance has gone down a significant amount surprisingly cuz since I haven't really really been able to smoke all day how like I usually do or at least every couple of hours like literally the past week that I've been here has only been like maybe two times double so if you guys are coming in from any legal state flying out you know it's an illegal state I'm gonna show you guys what I'm not gonna show you guys I'm gonna tell you guys what to do cuz I'm already over here there's no way I can do to him so the way I did it first first and foremost let me show you guys the way I did it so if you guys are have a girlfriend a wife girl that you're going with on a trip this will just make things a hundred times easier so what you can do is just obviously attach your cartridge to your stick and then just all you do is it'll just pop drop it in her makeup bag and then that's it dude you're good to go you could probably do up to two or three cartridges I don't recommend doing a lot of them and I don't recommend compact inch if you're gonna take we do not compact it because I learned a few tricks over here my uncle he works for the airlines and he knows a bunch of tricks up his sleeve and stuff like that he was telling me like what they live for so I mean let me just boss you guys up in a little game right now so we're usually in airports what they're looking for is in drugs that's not what they're looking for like you guys making like oh they're looking for toys and looking for my wood and my weed you know things like that but that's not the case even though it's not gonna be hard for them to know who has it like just don't don't overdo it don't be stupid don't just go in there thinking like oh they're not looking for drugs so I can go in there and go ahead and walk in with an ounce that's definitely not the case so all right they're looking for obviously explosives guns anything that can pretty much cause any damage or danger to anyone inside the airport like if you guys don't know lax is one of the biggest or not well this isn't only lax but I'm referring to LAX abuse out to the airport that I flew out of so yeah and LX are looking for explosive guns et Cie things like that so drugs is it's not one of their top priorities so as long as you're not overdoing it man there should be no issue to be honest like he was telling me as long as like one thing that you have to do if you're like I'm not advising this I'm not telling you guys go do this and go like try it out but if he has you know I have medical issues if he has I have anxiety like me personally I have so much anxiety dude like that day that I was flying out I had so much anxiety that I literally [ __ ] was crying bro like once I landed it was horrible I mean I'm not ashamed to say that I cried cause it's just anxiety man it's where humans everyone feels it specifically you know and cheers to them here I remember take up a trip for you guys so yeah like I was saying oh yeah this car is so amazing by the way by West Coast cure if you guys can see it hopefully you guys can very very amazing and yeah let me just get back to my story so one thing he told me if you're gonna bring weed um weed in general cartridges don't really matter because it's a liquid usually everything scans through liquids you can tell very very hard to detect and yeah so I'm not saying this isn't me saying like oh you can take as many cartridges you want I'm the same be smart and take one or two three hemos you know you don't really need to have more than that unless you're a fiend bro so now on to the weed if you don't like cartridges and you guys are more about weed them he said he went from what I know he told me that all you have to do is just you can carry in there just make sure it doesn't smell and make sure you just like wrap it up stash it you know but don't compress it too much because usually what comes up on the RFID readers it comes when they're passing it through the little readers what they're looking for is compact compressed items so basically because if you guys don't know that's usually how bombs are made you you compact what it is whatever the material is and then that's what makes a bomb you can't have a bomb with a little super piece of [ __ ] you know material it has to be very very mass amount compact until like it doesn't have to be a ball but you guys know when I'm referencing to so that's a little trick and then honestly you guys there's another one that I've done it at like shows and stuff like this I've never tried this at an airport I mean I don't recommend this type if you guys really are trying to get through when you can do is just hide the cartridge on the bottom of your plastic piece of your shoe and when you're passing through the metal detector just slide your foot like walk put left foot over whichever isn't carrying the cartridge and then on your right just slide slide it down you know just fairly you can barely lift it I think it's like an inch from what I've done before so yeah no more than an inch so you should be good after that and yeah I'm just sorry if I keep you looking away there's just so much scenery around me and it's just catching my attention so we're gonna take another hit and just keep talking keep ranting seeing what what this day is about man so yeah I brought this on here I left on Monday it's currently already Thursday it's Friday tomorrow man I go back on Sunday so which means I have two more days out here and this pen has been coming in clutch because like I said my anxiety dude my anxiety was kicking my ass since the morning I had a good on the plane like it's not that I'm scared to fly or anything I've flown before I've flown to Mexico I've flown to other places but just the anxiety of being away from home it's just something that I've had you know there on my whole life so wait to whatever this is this is something that has helped me a lot throughout my last couple years I'm dealing with anxiety and stuff like that so and I'm gonna show you guys this one I know I already made a video on this with a West Coast cure cartridge I'll go ahead and post that in the link in the description below if you guys want to check out that video but I've made a video on this um battery before and it's called the X tube so basically what it is it looks ugly right it looks ugly like this and okay whatever you're not supposed to have a beautiful battery but that's just a [ __ ] thing in your head for if you if you're one of those people that likes things that are aesthetically pleasing I don't blame you man I'm some sometimes I'm like that too so but this battery isn't for you so this value what it does this little detachable piece right here so as you guys can see I have a little a little oil bubble right there right little air bubble I mean so what this does I'll screw it on there click it twice and then what it does it'll start preheating right you'll see it oh it's already dead because I've been using all week so I can't use a preheat function but what it does it'll heat up the outside of the cartridge and then it'll make the oil warm enough for it to move up and so how good that is is because most a car batteries that pre-heat your [ __ ] they preheat from the coil within so basically what that is it's burning the oil that's why when you take hits you can still puff like with this if I were if it was charged and I were to do that you wouldn't know smoke would be coming out at all like sometimes the only downside is the tip does get hot sometimes because it does get heated up a lot so if you guys are looking for a cartridge that I mean for a battery that does it all now this is my favorite one for sure the only bad thing about it is I don't think you could fit like a tank of apes and [ __ ] like that it's more of that just the regular - really really slim cartridges so yeah man I'm gonna take another hit hopefully this battery still yeah so we're just gonna oh no it's still it's still going you just can't preheat it because the preheat function does I think that's what takes up most of the battery life because it preheats it for like a good 20 to 30 seconds because it wants to get all the oil out obviously man this West Coast cure is amazing yeah I'm gone man I'm just gonna go ahead and end this video here enjoy the rest of my time here I hope you guys are enjoying the rest of your week you guys are gonna see this on Monday so enjoy your week from now on you know and for all the new people here thank you for conforting me and for the people who have been here for a while thank you for the continuous support you guys are gonna be seeing some big things coming within the next couple of weeks so look forward to that and yeah if you guys enjoyed today's video go leave a like comment sub and we're out you can", "erXpR_x6YzI": "what's up YouTube it's your boy mr. bling seed back again with another video today I'm coming at you with an unofficial dank vapes comparison and review the carts I have in question are pineapple express an ace of spades OOP I move the pineapple Express so the reason I'm making this video is because I know that dank vapes carts are all illegitimate but there are still some that are better than others and some that are more healthy for you to smoke are at least more safe for you to smoke than others um and if these are all you have like availability for it then you should at least know which ones you should buy and which ones you should just stay away from altogether because that way you don't waste your money and you're also at least being an informed consumer and you're staying relatively safe so today we have two different cards as you can see the packaging is also different the strains are different but they're both say tank faiths which is wild and you can see like if you look more closely there is a lot of difference in these cart packages you have this one which shows the card from this side it says 1.1 grams and DANC on the side it has raised sort of like background art I guess I could call that and a holographic dang face logo on the top the front the bottom and the side except this side on this side it says dang clips official account all organic no propylene glycol and on the back it says Ace of Spades is a creation from TGA sub cool seeds that takes advantage of the popular sweet and sour combination that never goes out of style a crossbreed of black cherry soda and Jack the Ripper this strain has an earthy berry and citrus smell that carries over into the taste with distinctly lemony flavours Asus blades pants ace of spades plants grow fast and need a lot of space because they will get both bushy and tall flowering occurs at eight weeks and they are generally large and heavy see the funny thing about Danks vapes is that on the back of all of their carts they just have the leaf Lee articles written right there which I mean I don't hate because it's easy for reviews because I can just read the back of the packaging but like it's also kind of lazy what do you think about it anyway so the Apple Express card we have raised letters but flat background art we have irregular art on the front and Danks waves on the front you can't see the cart from the side but it still says dang faves official account all organic no propylene glycol on this side it says the same thing and it has a holographic tank on the top and bottom the description for pineapple Express after I drop the cart and focus pineapple express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strange trainwreck and Hawaiian the smell is like into fresh apple and mango with a taste of pineapple pine and cedar this hard-hitting sativa dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes so there is the packaging review of these cards now the question is which one is real and which one is fake so after doing a bit of research online you can find that there pretty much four major ways to see whether your dank babes carts are real or fake and that would be looking at the packaging itself which I just showed you guys but now I'll go more into detail with that the Instagram account that's on the side of the packaging the C cell atomizer itself and the wax quality so I'm gonna go over each of these cards one by one and just show you like the different points to look at and then uh I'll go ahead and review them and show you guys how they both hit and I'll give you my opinion on which one tastes better so after doing a bit of research online you find that they're pretty much four major ways to check whether or not you have a legit sort of official tank vapes cart versus a knockoff that your dealer just kind of put some snake oil in the four major ways would be looking at the packaging itself the Instagram account on the side the there are signs on the bottom of these C cell atomizers that'll tell you and a wax quality so in this review I'm gonna be going over each of those four points with each of these carts and showing you which ones are more trustworthy and which ones aren't but then I'm also going to be hitting both of them to show you guys the wax quality and I'll tell you how the hits feel if they're chemically and burn or if they're like sort of smooth and tastes good um and then finally I'll tell you guys about the highs based off each of them so yeah let's get into this review I'm actually pretty excited for starting this recording I did do some like light sort of examinations of these karts to see which ones I thought were real and fake before starting the video and I'll just tell you that right now I'm pretty sure this one is legitimate banks vapes carts and this one is not so let me show you why I think this so according to my research and I'll link all my sources in the description below but first off it says that the dank vapes packaging that is legit has the cart shown on the side and that's kind of funny to me because I've had a dank faves carts like this before which was the strawberry shortcake one and it had the same packaging pretty much exactly except a sort of like red theme because it was obviously strawberry shortcake and that being said I've also had carts that are like the pineapple Express ones I'm going to this more in a little bit let's go back to the Ace of Spades anyway so online it says that legitimate dank babes carts have raised lettering for the stream but like lowered lettering for the actual date vapes logo and the back art should be raised and that the theme of these carts are basically all black secondly on the side it should say dank vapes official account because that is the only actual dank vapes official Instagram account that exists some fake carts will just say like dank vapes official or like dank vapes account but if it doesn't say if it does say tanks beeps official account then usually it should be a more legitimate current than others I say that because as you can see on the pineapple Express it also has the right thing so next up if you open the packaging and you take out the cart first you can look at the wax quality and see that uh this one is a bit runny it's not slow it's sort of uh the air bubble transfer is really fast in superfast which is not really a good sign for wax quality so I would definitely watch out for that oh when I actually hit it I'll be able to tell you more about if the wax like is good but for now I'm not very like excited to try this cart um if you look at the bottom let me see if I can get that to focus okay yeah so you see this K you see a stamp number and you see C so though that shows that this is an official C cell cartridge or atomizer at least zoom out there we go looking beautiful um so yeah as you can see this is a real C cell atomizer with some lower quality wax in it which is kind of funny to me because well I go through the process of like getting the best packaging getting good like atomizers and then putting late some kind of crappy oil in it obviously I'm saying it's crappy just based off of these like visual tests but when I actually get into like tasting it maybe I'll be wrong who knows umm another fun thing that I did look into or my old C cell cart or atomizers so we have this one from the serial curtain they see that this is a real C cell cartridge as the C sell the CA and decay on it if it's a fake it could still have all of these but the font will be um kind of stretched out and big and not like actually etched in to the cart like it is with these um on this traphouse Curt atomizer that's supposed to also be a C so you can see that it doesn't have C cell on it it has like another brand so this would be one of those knockoff sort of atomizers that are sold from China and that's on this trap house card so a lot of companies have been using DC cell cars because they do hit nice and they give you good flavor but some still use legitimate C cells and some also still use like knockoffs so this is the ace of spades one final look before I go on to the pineapple Express and I'll be right back alright so with this pineapple Express cart you can see that you can look at the wax itself and the atomizer from the front of the packaging which if you look online and will say that this would be second-generation tank vapes packaging which I'm not really sure how like believable that is but I mean everything else on the packaging checks out the Leafly description on the back it's got raised lettering on the front and not a raised deck vapes logo but those dang capes logo is still holographic and gold um it's got raised artwork it has the actual like tank vapes account on it and the packaging just feels like it feels quality and premium which i know sounds weird but like if you're getting a fake packaging you can sort of feel that the Pat the paper would be like kind of shitty and not like good quality and thick like this is let's go ahead and open up the packaging and look at the sea salt cartridge itself now looking at the sea solid cellphone this is what leads me to believe that it's a fake because as you can see it checks out it looks fine um the bar in the middle is not thick on some fakes that bar will be hella thick but uh when you look at the bottom of it its it will focus it's a sea cell but it says M 208 when you look up see sell em 208 on google it'll bring up the Jupiter Cecil atomizers and in case you didn't know Cecil also owns Jupiter so like the liquid 610 or batteries and any of the lake Jupiter atomizers are also legitimate Cecil atomizers except for the fact that Cecil atomizers always have to have three prints on the bottom it'll have either Jupiter or that little K C cell and then a a lot number or a serial number this only has two so it can't be an actual C cell cartridge so it's a fake atomizer bought from China but if you look at the wax quality you can see that it's sort of good the bubble is small and it's moving very very slowly so this needs me to believe that the lacked quality itself is either very good or it's mixed with something very thick to make move slower which is why you have to like look at all these sort of uh signs that I'm trying to show you guys versus just like one or two of them so what I'm gonna go ahead and do is throw these cards onto my C cell m3 battery and I'll just show you guys how they hit um just so you can see a bit of like the wax quality and like the clouds you can get but I'm not gonna do a full review until tomorrow because I'd like to have a day with them to actually be able to test the wax quality and the highs because when I'm doing a video on something that could be like like health risks I'd like to at least give you guys a real review that's comprehensive so I think having a day to test like if the wax gives me a headache or if it makes me feel sick or if it just burns and tastes bad like I can tell you that better based off like a full day of using these than just um like a little five-minute review so let me go ahead and take these first hits and then we shall see tomorrow what my final verdict on these cards is I got a new sort of filming spot for now because it's summer and oh my god it is [ __ ] hot as hell in this house anyway so we're gonna be taking our first hits off of these dang babes carts what I'm probably gonna do is I think I'm gonna hit the Pineapple Express one first than the ace of spades second because while I think the Pineapple Express could be a fake I really want to test out this max quality more than anything because really that's what matters when you're buying these carts too is wax quality so let's go ahead and screw it on with the C cell I'm three let's just take a rip cheers guys so as you can see that's a pretty nice cloud I think especially for like a first hit off of a cart that's not even like preheated yet so let me take another hit and then I'll talk about the taste and like how it feels but so far I'm having positive opinions on this it tastes really good it actually tastes like like a bit of mango and pineapple so I'm already becoming a fan of this pineapple Express cart I'm gonna hit it one more time and then I'll go ahead and switch over to ASA spades Cheers yeah yeah I'm definitely a fan of this right now plus as you can see like I'm not coughing right now and if you watch any of my other videos you'll see like Ike off like a [ __ ] with baby lungs so positive opinion on pineapple express tank vapes let's go ahead and check this Ace of Spades over the next we're gonna hit this ace of spades card let's see how that goes okay packaging go ahead and screw it onto the seesaw 11 3 let's take our first rib Cheers okay so it tastes kind of bad and like I don't even think that was a very good cloud from it so let's try again I'm not sure how familiar you are with Indian food but this current sort of tastes like cardamom which is a very big seasoning in Indian food and I'm not a fan of it um it also just kind of burns the back of my throat when I'm hitting it so I'm not really feeling too confident about this an ace of spades card from dang babes let me hit it one more time and see if my opinion can change yeah it is really spicy not spicy but it just really tastes like cardamon and I was expressing a sort of like sour sweet taste so I'm kind of disappointed but either way I don't think it'd be a true mr. blinky review if I didn't hit these cards out of the dab cap just to test them out even further so I got the daily high club piece from a a blue dab cap in this cart let's just hit both of them through the dab cap for today I'll see how they feel then tomorrow I'll come back at you with like a full review so Cheers on the Ace of Spades so late even ripping it out of it to have cab it took forever in a cloud of the piece and then it still just didn't even taste good so hazel speeds right now I definitely have a negative opinion of it it could change you to eat today and tomorrow but for now I really think this pineapple Express is gonna be the better card let me go and load it up and then I'll take it through the top cap and they will end for you today all right so we got the pineapple Express on the dab cap let's go ahead and hit it through this piece and then I'll catch you guys tomorrow Cheers okay so I cut out the coffee but they ain't very nice you could see the cloud it was very uh thick and dense and it tasted amazing it made me coffee lot that was because I think it was just a really good hit so i'ma go ahead and review these carts in like my personal use and then tomorrow come back and tell you guys like which one is better or not I can tell you right now though I am fried as hell so one of these carts are maybe even both of them who knows they definitely work so yeah I'll see you guys in the next day I've been vaping on to ace of spades which is this current and the Pineapple Express since yesterday evening and I think I have an actual good review for each of them so my ace of spades review would be that the atomizer itself doesn't nearly hit as hard as the Pineapple Express won which in retrospect isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means this wax will last longer then the pineapple Express wax but it'll also take you considerably longer to get high initially when you're trying to smoke in um the high on it lasts three and a half to five hours which was really cool and the way I can describe the high for me at least was that it made me feel kind of tired but relaxed enough and like it also helped me focus enough that I could edit like this video as well as do some studying so that was really cool I really like that so I'm a fan of the high for that the negatives of it would be that it did make me feel a bit paranoid which I'm not a fan of because like just having like general anxiety this cart made that a bit worse so I would definitely only smoke this car at night and if I'm trying to actually like either just go to sleep or maybe get something done at night other than that I would not smoke this during the day simply because it would make me paranoid and it just doesn't seem worth it especially when the Pineapple Express makes me feel pretty like energetic imma go into it more in a second but like my overall review of the Ace of Spades would probably be a 6 out of 10 it would get a 7 if the atomizer hit a little bit better and if it didn't make me paranoid but uh I would recommend these dang babes carts pretty much only if you don't have any other choices or if your other choices are like exotic carts or Mario karts cuz these are at least a bit better than those but they're not like amazing so yeah that was the a subspace I'm gonna take another hit as the final review hit of this cart so cheers guys hope you're vaping along or smoking something let's get it so ya didn't cough so that's nice it's a nice smooth hit this is a fully charged C cell m3 so yeah Ace of Spades six out of ten would recommend only as an alternative for like worst cards now let's get to this pineapple Express find out will Express if you guys can remember is the fake cart which is funny to me because it's my first cart out of the two um the wax is definitely thicker and it hits better than the ace of spades cart but like I said the ace of spades cart is definitely gonna last a lot longer than this one um the high off of this cart makes me feel a bit energetic helpfully focus on my tasks and one of my favorite things is that it makes music sound a lot better and more clear which I'm always a fan of when I'm smoking because I love listening to music um well I was a high off this drain I went on a walk I cooked dinner and I cleaned my room so definitely a very very like good day stream especially if you have some stuff to get done I'm about to edit or finish editing this video on this high so I'm very excited for that which is funny to say because like editing is boring but uh now this card makes everything feel a bit more like interesting and definitely just helps me focus better um a negative of this cart would be that I sort of felt maybe a little bit aggressive at like when I was coming down from the high so I'm not really a fan of that but other than that it's pretty much all positives this car I would give like an 8 out of 10 it's better than a lot of other like brands that I've had like chrono Polly is not as good as damn boots but it's uh it's as good as most of the other dang babes I've had so it's funny to say but I kind of almost prefer this little fake packaging on the pineapple Express card just so y'all can see it hopefully it's in frame like this is packaging that you can buy generically but the wax ended up being better quality than the real dang vapes so I guess what I would do if I were you guys would really be to just test that wax quality by like flipping it because it seems to me like that is what is like the biggest indicator of if your wax is gonna be good quality versus like if it's an actual see saw cartridge looking at the packaging really all you got to look at is wax quality because all of these cards are fake although they're not fake but like all of them are illegitimate and they all have the pesticides in the loop so at this point you just gotta like choose which is the biggest bang for your buck and the biggest like risk you want to take and I really don't think this is bad quality wax like it tastes fine to me and it doesn't really hurt let's just take a hit so I can show you guys it takes so amazing I really can't express that enough but uh yeah so eight out of ten would HIGHLY highly recommend the pineapple express if you ever come across it um make sure to stay informed and try to stay safe guys cuz like this [ __ ] black market card business it's kind of wild I'm learning more about it everyday and I'm just gonna keep like showing you guys what I learned I hope you enjoyed the video welcome to the channel if you made it this far please subscribe and like and I'll catch y'all later stay warm lacet Cheers", "1iIENII-lVo": "everyone is talking about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first episode is about the respiratory system so click here to watch it and let us know what you think as we continue to evolve this new idea", "Pm_MC3QLa10": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another reaction to fake cartridges video this is part 10 we finally got to the double digits not sure if i'm gonna make any more after this but i know you guys have really been [ __ ] with it and you know from the bottom of my heart i just really like like to thank you guys you know what i'm saying for just the constant support and this will be the second video i upload today the other video will be um three blinkers in one breath and mind you that these reaction videos they're most of the time their current day or at least a day behind but when my regular uploaded videos you know like that blinkers video that was filmed like two weeks ago so you know i'm saying people are gonna ask me if i still have that cartridge from that video i don't it's long gone it's out of here you know i'm saying so i figured you know i just get that out of the way when i do reaction videos i try i tend to at least uh upload the same day or the day before or a day after so when people watch these videos they can still kind of see the most recent posts you know i'm saying uh but yeah let's start this video off with a [ __ ] hit and i got the plug and play i do have videos that i already edited but they're scheduled on a certain day but this is what i'm on right now that mango mang that's just the preview but i do have a dedicated video that will be coming out in a week or so um but yeah let's just not take a regular hit though you know what i'm saying let's add this dab cap or dab cap i'm sorry [ __ ] up but uh video will be on this as well because you know you know i had to like just make a a video on this but look at it look at what i'm able to do now cheers boys i actually don't have any like wax to dab off of my b nails uh wax pen so i'm on this but you know what i'm saying we're making it work cheers don't have too much left of it but you know i'm saying it's all good i thoroughly enjoyed this but you'll see the video too and take another and let's start this reaction video right so cheers [Music] oh oh yeah so with these videos i like to post the best comments from the previous video so let's go with that right now [Music] now let's get started so we got tea savage salty's on ig shake my head let's pray for all the lungs about to get these are those robes those are okay i know these are fake as [ __ ] but my homie is saying they're good and from michigan dispensaries what you all think i've never seen that brand uh let me know if you guys any of my you know subscribers from michigan let us know are these on the street are they sold in dispensaries you know because i mentioned this many times many many times you know i don't know all the carts from each state you know some of you guys are from michigan and you guys can like shed light you know i'm saying in the comments below because you know a lot of these brands are coming out of the woodworks you know left and right it's it's really hard to keep up with them even if you're in just one state it's hard to keep up with all the [ __ ] fake cartridges or the legit cartridges in your state you know what i'm saying so just be safe at the end of the day and uh you know i never claimed to be like an expert on anything these videos it's just me reacting to it never have i said that i was a car expert you know i just smoke a lot of them you know i'm saying at the end of the day i would say that i have some knowledge in it and you know you don't have to take my my uh my words you know what i'm saying like it's far from that you know i'm saying i'm not your parent i'm just making these because some people you know i'm saying they're not as aware and they're very gullible especially with high school students you know they're getting this from their their homey you know i'm saying and they probably think it's legit so it's good to make videos like this to spread awareness and like i said i am no car expert people are always commenting another guy that thinks he's an expert i've never even said that you know what i'm saying so at the end of the day i do have a pretty big following on youtube and i feel like not a lot of people go on reddit frequently you know i'm saying and there's a lot of valuable information that could translate or transfer into a video therefore you know get more exposure and you know people know more about like these certain cartridges that they should steer away from or certain cartridges that they should buy you know i'm saying because this is some valuable information this could possibly save someone's health you know what i'm saying and i've had comments say you know you saved me from smoking fake cartridges and all that stuff it's very rewarding in itself but in the at the end of the day i can't even monetize these videos you know i'm saying like there's no gain in it for me other than to just you know get views and spread awareness you know what i'm saying so that was a little random sorry posted about found out it's fake now i'm sketching now that one i've been hitting for about a month had one just like it already finished it might be fake too don't have a box anymore in my experience most of the time when i see in rove they're very light and yellowish that's a very dark amberish color what do you all think about this hoe know what brand that is let's see what they think fake no leave it known as a cart it's definitely not a guardian what thoughts filthy laboratory [Music] it's a booth card a pretty decent boot looks like a normal display that [ __ ] looks like the craft ship but it's crave it's a distillate i don't know if you guys seen my cure company it was a premium distillate in a ceramic cartridge or some [ __ ] i think that's what i titled it looks the same like that the oil color and the cartridge so glad i moved to a legal state first part in the audience tastes like kool-aid rape dream great dream sounds pretty fire you know i'm not a fan of blue treating but grape dream sounds delectable can be very salty when you post up the real [ __ ] is that the canadian uh warning label damn stuck up on me those buttons like blinkers man even with that bubbler that [ __ ] top off my dick with a butter knife and set myself on fire than take a single hit from any of that garbage damn now tell me why you would want to cut your pp off rather than take one hand over yeah he's right you know i would i would probably not say that yeah that's funny raw garden cartridge cloud chaser review fan got one on a fake damn anything vape you know i i have bathing ape shoes i bought them like 10 years ago no like 15 years ago they're they're silver ones i'll show you right so these are mine these are so old i mean the [ __ ] shit's cut peeling off but these are real i'm saying i've only worn these like maybe 30 times in my lifetime i actually uh so me and flynn or calamity as you may know uh uh he had the spider-man ones and i had those grey ones and he spent like 300 bucks on his and i remember the uh the packaging it came in mine's different mine's the regular ones mine's not the superhero ones because the superhero ones come in those like you know when you get uh action figures they come in that cardboard box on the back and then there's like a like a plastic thing over it you know but bathing bait come on [ __ ] all that [ __ ] never become your own [ __ ] stop stop it cheap blackberry and the black hole scout cookies black is black market but it's rather because i saw evans farts smacking on them honestly not disappointing okay so a lot of you have been telling me to try big chief and you guys know my opinion on big chief but if you got it and if you stand by it by all means you know what i'm saying like i said i'm not anyone's parent in any way this is just information that i'm spreading you don't have to take it you know what i'm saying so just be careful with the big cheese because at the end of the day gambling with your health like that like that is not good and i've heard good things about big sheep don't get me wrong i've heard many good things about big chief but i've heard bad things about it and you know what i'm saying i'm really i wouldn't take that risk you know i'm saying but you know that's just me uh stay big chief stay big chief and then this fool bought nine of them he really loved that blue dream though yeah be safe man be safe horse head man toxic turtle so like like i said with the big chiefs i heard they're actually going into the legal market now so maybe things could be looking up for them i i don't know myself so like just be careful [Music] what the [ __ ] is crooked that [ __ ] ben [ __ ] that i think this plug i mean [Music] i'm still recovering from those hits anyone ever heard of gg organics i have not no no that's a big cartridge wow when the phones are obviously happy to see it ff is active on here so i hope you know comment to let me

i got was you didn't show how the [ __ ] you spot these bad cards how do you tell that it's fake i got a fake plug play guys these are real i talked to them after that video or actually while i was making the video and told them what's up and they hooked me up with real ones these look nothing like the ones that i brought to the lab you could tell they're [ __ ] different today guys i brought the man himself peter from plug play yes the guy you see on plug plays instagram all the time i brought peter he's gonna actually sit down with me show me and show me how i can tell everything's fake how to tell their bad how to go through all the packaging the seals everything because honestly guys i mean i got played so i have no knowledge in this but let's get started so guys here's the investigator dopaziola again my homie has somebody i told him i was doing this video and he says oh i have a homie that makes fake plug plays and i go hey man can you get me the guy's [ __ ] number so i could talk to him and see how cheap these [ __ ] carts he's doing because these are real i want to know how [ __ ] cheap does it really get i'm going to call him real quick hello hey what's up dude yeah i got you yeah no no i'm looking to uh get some of the plug play cards i know that he said that you probably haven't cheaper than my guy how much if i get 500 they're they're 10 bucks for the cart package and everything ready to go do you do a price break at a thousand eight bucks um could i give you a call back just want to make sure that we're good to go all right dude thank you bye-bye eight thousand dollars for a thousand plug play cards i want to show you guys right now look at i'm in my house and i could have ordered a thousand fake plug play cards just like that here's your phone back thank you so much yeah that never calls you back block it this is what's going on today while i'm doing this right now peter's on his way over here with the plug play team he's at a trap spot buying fake plug play cards yes the guy that you see does plug play is going investigator 2 to go buy fake ones he's gonna buy real ones and fake one every question you ever had today guys is going to be answered how to spot fake cards let's get this [ __ ] started all right here's peter right here hello here oh oh i see the car you know we had to make it official oh my god thank you brother get this side real quick just real quick you're rolling around in this to drop drop off orders and [ __ ] yeah it's a moving billboard all right guys here we are this is peter from plug play i'm sure you guys have seen them online what's up everybody so please do me a favor just tell everybody what plug play is about would you guys start and just the whole get down of it so we're a group of homies started the company three years ago came from the streets hustled our way became compliant became legal and now we're trying to build this as big as we can possibly do it but most importantly have fun with what we do you guys know this is the most asked for thing on my channel of all time for um for of all time the second i ever did a vape video people just asked all day like yo these are the best ones you guys gotta [ __ ] try it out i'm glad i'm sorry that it's uh that the first time i ever showed you guys on my channel it was a [ __ ] fake ass car i'm sorry about it i saw that [ __ ] man i saw that and i was like wait a minute to school me on what the [ __ ] happening bro it's a headache for not only us but everybody in this industry right now we're all battling it and most importantly it's up to our community to make sure that everybody stays aware of you know what the [ __ ] is happening they see your car however much they cost and then they see the ones i get two for 20. yeah but it's poisonous you don't know what it is and people are choosing like i want the brand name but i don't want the brand name as far as legalization and and the point that we're in right now it's just a very crazy difficult challenging time for the industry itself because this wasn't legal before and now it is with that change there also comes this area where we have to learn how to adapt to what's about to happen there was a time where nobody was compliant three years ago because there were no licenses there was none of that so it was like literally the wild wild [ __ ] out right it was just trapped but there was a code during those yeah it's bad because now it's the everyone jumped in because they saw money here to me so the people that really cared are getting pushed aside because they don't got money like that i feel like right now it it's eventually gonna find this perfect median to where everyone's happy the taxes are cool um i hope things are just different the black market that it's all trash products because there are some there's some bran there there are some good ones that have really clean products true are trying to make a name for themselves because everybody started off as a trash product and got legal yeah it doesn't mean that this was bad before it was legal they're entrepreneurs and they want to get into this space they want to do it right but the the industry is holding them back to to do it the right way never really thought about it that way because i mean i'm already in this [ __ ] i never thought about what it'd be like i'm trying to get it as a legal company as a compliant company that sells safe products we're very big on quality and making sure that there is absolutely nothing that gets through for everyone that that does [ __ ] with plug play this [ __ ] smacks right and smacks for a reason we focus on quality we focus on opponents he put that into our device i'm gonna be honest bro i do those blinkers i just don't wanna ding ready go [ __ ] i gotta take it again yo shout out to the plug play fam because everybody's been doing an amazing [ __ ] job with like banging on like unlicensed retailers right what we've come to find out is like we started calling around and a lot of these spots that that had been reported they no longer had them so it was actually it was actually pretty challenging for us to find a spot that had the fake ones all this [ __ ] that's getting sent out of state right where nobody's really informed they just see one what they want to see here busy brand here but this video today is going to show you how to never get it again i sent david in go go check it out and sure enough you know like they were fake he ended up buying a bunch of different products just so we can kind of [ __ ] around and look at it and yeah see uh what you can see what it is this is the bag that they give it to give you a paper bag it's a paper bag this is my wig at least staples this paper bag for me this is a shop this is a shop oh my god that's not good that's not a good look all right oh no that's trim look look what fell out that's trim automatic i'm gonna tell i'm gonna tell everybody why when i look at this it like freaks me the [ __ ] out what is it yo it says springfield cards that has bart literally guys do you think the simpsons licensed this no that's why you could tell it's automatically [ __ ] fake this this can fool some people so how can you tell that these are fake because this is the same looking one that i got but they've even made copies of these with the compliance package and the stippling and the sticker they can knock the sticker off yeah they knocked everything off the only way you can tell really is the way that the letters are printed so the difference for like the the fake ones that i've seen they don't have these plastic tabs on the side the ones that i've seen they have older batch numbers we sell out a product pretty quickly so if it's two months old you know it's probably fake let me talk about this specific one if you look at the difference in the actual sticker that's on here this is a completely different sticker i want you to compare it you see him oh [ __ ] it's not even that it says one gram on here and this doesn't have a shine watch so yeah point them out yeah look at it apple slushy looks identical dude except there's yours is outlined there's isn't yeah like such small details if you look at it even the color of the blue it's different yeah it's a little bit it's just different and then right there look at the exotics is a different color yeah and there's knockoff says but look at this this is the scary part look at their oil it's like clear just like yours clearer than ours oh [ __ ] but that doesn't mean there's this actual oil exactly it could be something else it could be something else all right which one's fake what do you [ __ ] learn so far there one gram automatic fake basically look on your instagram and see what the updated logos are too this is scary show us what is that this is tangy bang we don't even have a tangy bang flavor how can this can somebody go to like a website and see that what flavors you have your ig huh yeah just follow their ig guys so you can stay up on what flavors for sure it says packaged last month yeah this one this is this is ten this one's real that's the one you brought also this is scary this is scary too this oil might not be oil and say it is say it's [ __ ] great say it's [ __ ] bomb oil it's not tested well if these guys are doing such a great job at making this type of quality if it is good quality i'm not gonna chance it if they're doing that type of quality like go compliant right that or stop knocking off my brand and make your own [ __ ] brand for that damn good we have a responsibility to make sure that like we take care of our community so if anybody sends us a dm about a fake car or a concern about a fake car we gotta look at it that's your [ __ ] if someone were to get hurt i did i didn't answer dm and then that person had gotten hurt that's not like i don't want that it really is on you though that's the worst part about it i never really thought about it it's the stress yeah yeah it's so stressful the water building up i have like a body high now you're right oh yeah oh man i'm pretty big you're gonna get high as [ __ ] at the end oh my god no no i'm doing that i'll put my sunglasses back on have you ever seen the [ __ ] on the news where these [ __ ] vape pen batteries explode yeah and basically it's shrapnel to your eyes yeah i don't want that did you know people knock off plug play batteries everyone's batteries i didn't know that these can explode i got one right here he brought a fake battery they're knocking off these the batteries and it looks the [ __ ] it looks better than ours what you smoke a lot i do but not this extreme real plug plays real ones will [ __ ] you up apparently he's definitely not hitting the fake ones hell yeah yeah he's getting he's gonna be good jesus jesus christ just wait till the end we're about to get oh my goodness thumbnail right there i gotta go lay down your time oh my god my video came out try and hold on there as long as possible [Music] i had a pause for a moment because it got way too lit and needed to take a quick nap on this table they bought a fake plug plate uh battery also remember if they could blow up in your [ __ ] face how can you tell that they're fake well the thing is though with the box you couldn't even tell right i couldn't tell where the box was out of the box it's like boom like just look at the print so right off the bat the fake ones have white is this plays in white right yeah plays in white for the fake ones two months from now they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna catch on to this they'll catch up when you guys update your [ __ ] so it makes you guys on your toes all the time huh that packaging's dead on the same oh guys when you see the packaging look look at the [ __ ] barcodes they got it down they wouldn't bought a real one copied your barcode that's crazy right peter yeah almost there why is the big deal buying a fake uh battery there's a protection chip in there so when it's being charged and it's like fully charged it stops pushing energy into it yours yeah what's the big deal those could they could burn your house down they could blow up in your face anything they blow up right there because the chip they don't have a chip so it keeps pumping energy into it so it like overloads it too much basically the fake ones don't have the protection chip because that costs extra money exactly they're trying to pay pitch everyone's trying to get into the market right now corners like i said cutting corners man [ __ ] people up you back to life slowly that's because you're dope as yola bro i smoke a lot of weed i'm pretty much an alien when it comes to weed tolerances oh it's like a box all they don't hit they don't do [ __ ] to me that's what we does i'm high but i mean i'm here it just goes to show and proves you smoke he smokes these every day every day he took a couple blinkers and he's done that's how strong these are so i'm going to let peter get out of here so you can go take a damn nap peter thank you so much for stopping by i'll see you soon so thank you so much peter for stopping by these are right in front of me and i could still not tell they had the same barcodes so like peter said they can get this packed this is the knock-off box this is the real box they can knock it off they can make the same sticker everything guys they're getting so good with it how can you tell you're not going to get some fake stuff that could poison it could poison you so make sure you pay attention to this stuff this doesn't say one gram this does say one gram is outlined apple slushy on the fake one is not outlined those little things matter you literally have to be like antique roadshow [ __ ] to be able to go well you see this is here that's how you have to be right now those counterfeiters are following me too they're going to watch it they're going to watch us go damn all right we got to switch it up guys plug play you everybody all big companies they update their packaging often for counterfeiters this is the reason why counterfeiters are they're good they make fake gucci they make fake nikes and you couldn't even tell i'm sure somebody one of you has bought fake jordans once you guys can get dupes so don't get duped on shoes that's cool don't get duped on things you put in your lungs you guys heard it earlier i talked to that [ __ ] on the phone that means he's packaging these making them for probably five dollars five dollars there's no way that's thc real fake if you have any questions come back refer to this video and make sure you have the real ones real quick guys before we get out of here these right here they said they got for free for coming to the dispensary can we get a close-up i want to rip this open they gave him six free joints for coming in no no what is that why is it

can see but when they come they come with this hard thing to open so i didn't even know how to open this so i'm not gonna lie just kind of cut it off but we're gonna take a couple hits off this i've already hit it a lot as you can see but i'm going to tell you how i like it so let's go ahead and take a couple hits so the flavor i have right now is the um london pound cake so it is pretty good there is the website there and then the batch number and all that here so um it does give you a nice head high um i wouldn't take too many hits of this because it will get you a little too baked so i would say just a couple and you should be fine but this is how it comes wrapped i don't really know how to like unwrap it it says press in and then slide but it wasn't really working for me because i've never seen someone else open this so i don't really know how to open it but i'm going to go ahead and take a couple more hits and end off the video because just a little review but yeah there's a nice card this will be the last hit and i'll end it off the video so this is a nice cart let me know if you guys have seen them around i haven't seen too many around but if you have let me know and if you tried it let me know what you guys think about it but that's gonna be it for the video thank you for watching and this is ethan signing out peace [Music] you", "_VMm9uJnG_8": "hello everyone once

well nice clouds so very good flavor tastes just like the wait smells and smells like melon it's very good this is this is really good I try this one all the time when I'm studying for exams you got a Fresno State for those of you who don't know and yeah I prefer to use pod like this that's 101 CBD but I'm studying or taking exams just it's it's not overpowering like just a regular or THC pod and it just lets me focus but still feel good stick let's go ahead and take another hit yeah so very good very good flavor sorry yeah but overall I think you should get this one if you're into the CPD

hello everyone and welcome back I'm Dave and today I have something really great this is the open reserve sfv OG the co2 oil cartridge this is a half gram cartridge that tests out at 89% THC and zero CBD I picked this up and connected cannabis and Stockton the link to their read maps menus in the description now let's get this cartridge out of the box once I get this out of the box the first thing I notice is this beautiful amber color of the soil now let's see how that bubble absolutely now let's check out some close-ups of this cartridge let's see that one more time [Music] now I'm gonna get this cartridge plugged into my yo can you guys I love my yo can if you're looking for a reliable portable box mod I can't recommend a yo can enough I'm gonna check my settings and get ready to take my first hit from this open reserve s FV o cheap cartridge and while I do that let me know down in the comments there's a brand new cartridges you think I should check out so how did I like it this cartridge is excellent five out of five all around with a highly potent slow burning oil this cartridge is a total win this is the best kart I've had so far and I can't recommend it enough if you see this at your local dispensary check it out I picked this up from connected canvas in Stockton a link to the read maps menus in the description hey Pam you know I had a great time checking out this Partridge with you I hope you come back and join me next time until then have an awesome day [Music]", "6X3A9BVYnFo": "I was lucky all su boy master blue see back again with another video today I'm gonna be looking at this TKO skittles part I just want to make another video hopefully maybe the last video I need to make on fake TKOs um just because there's a little bit more information that I have now that I just like to give to you guys and because I finally have a box so I could show you guys really what a fake looks like when it comes the box is for wedding cake I didn't get a wedding cake current I just got this get one anyway let's get into the review so first off when we look at the TKO extracts cart we see that it has the fake symbol on it TKO extract symbol does not look like that I'm gonna do a walk-through of their website in this video so that you guys can see what strains they offer and what their pens actually look like but these are always fake and the tubes are not their real packaging they come in boxes also the fact that it's a full gram cart makes it a fake because TKO currently only sells their carts as half grams and they only sell them in two states I'll go over that more when I'm going through the walkthrough of your website but either way let's look at this wax quality as you can see whoever I bought it from and I have been hitting this cart just a little bit I think I've hit it like three times just to make sure I wanted to review it and yeah the wax is nice and slow and I will say right now that it's also very smooth on the front of it we see TKO and then it has that very fat chimney which is also another side of it being a fake I ended up weighing this cart when I first got it against this one which is one of the old atomizers from those last TKOs I got and it ended up being only 0.8 grams of wax in this cart versus a full gram so if you are buying these TKOs with the phat chimney you are getting ripped off so if you guys would like me to show you how I scaled these carts I can show you guys in an they're video just so you can do your own checks at home either way for now I'm going to be going into the first rips so you guys can see the cloud production on this cart and I can show you guys how smooth it is so let's get into that alright so I have the cart loaded onto my Cecil m3 battery and I'm just gonna go ahead and take my first rips so Cheers this cart is so smooth honestly it rips very nicely and it tastes amazing um the cart being skittles which is a mix of grapefruit and grade 8 it tastes just like if you would take the flavors out of orange juice and grape juice and then mix them into a cart um very very nice it's a pleasure to hit this card I find myself wanting to hit it more than I should simply because of how smooth and good it feels so cheers again [Music] all right so that blinker made me coffee around five times but honestly that's not that bad considering it is a blinker and I haven't really been hitting carts too much today um the TKOs or at least these batch that I've been getting have been very smooth and very nice they hit very hard as well after three to four hits I get pretty high this being my probably third hit now I don't know if I got all three on camera but it being my third hit now I'm getting lens flares with all the lights around me I'm feeling very very light um and very talkative and sort of relaxed as well I really really love the strain Skittles has been my second favorite strain for a long time I really like these TKO cards but unfortunately I cannot suggest them um now I'm gonna actually go into my computer and just show you guys some stuff about fake TKOs that I think is important for everyone to know um and is the biggest reason why I'm not gonna be suggesting them before I go into my computer and show you guys the TKO website and talk to you guys a bit more about why fake TKOs are dangerous um basically what's going on is some people actually being admitted into hospitals now because of breathing problems related to smoking fake cards and unfortunately TKO has been sort of one of the bigger companies that's been sort of under fire because of it and it's really not even their fault because they're taking the steps to produce high quality wax and all of these fake companies are just using their name and sort of soiling it which is really unfortunate um so that's why I can't really suggest these cards simply because I don't want to lead you guys into getting hurt um because well I did get a good TKO card I don't know if you will and if yours looks like mine and you hit it at least once and it feels really smooth and flavorful then it's probably a safe card to smoke but you probably shouldn't also take that chance if you know what I mean so let me go into my computer I'll show you guys TKO is website I'll show you guys the four strains that they actually do offer let's go ahead and do that and then I'll do a wrap-up so see you guys there all right hey guys what's up so I'm just gonna walk you through TKO products website it's not TKO extracts its products and then their division is called TKO extracts and as you can see here they only have four strains which are pineapple express rich gelato Northern Lights and rose gold um they also only sell them as a half gram cartridge that's fully disposable um they do not sell them in full grams and they don't sell them in tubes it will always look like this if they are legit now um and I also wanted to show you something else that's really cool so I'm in my email right now I'm a kind of bit out so you guys don't see some of my more personal information but basically I reached out to TKO extracts and I said hello I'm a small youtuber who makes videos exposing fake cart brands I've done two videos on fakes of your products which I can send you links to I'm just reaching out to find out if you can give me a list of things to look for when spotting fakes over real products from your company any reply would be greatly appreciated thank you so much master blinky and TKO actually did respond to me so I'm gonna read you that email right now says thanks for reaching out I've seen your videos and appreciate your work at exposing the fakes you are on point about what to look for including how to check if carts are cut or not we are getting reports of people getting sick from carts including a person in the ICU for lung issues what do we don't know is if the issues are related to smoking carts or other issues that were made worse from smoking anything all we know is that after years on the black market were no standards had to be followed I do feel bad about what I put in my own body being pesticide free especially after talking with people from the lab and hear about the crap they find and some of the tests they run best but for people is to only buy from licensed shops and states that require testing you pay more but quality does cost money I would also suggest looking for high potency test results RT ke o of HR testing around 85% THC we use distillate that tests in the 90 % rage 90 to 95% and after we add terpenes for flavor it reduces the potency to 85% anything advertised over 90% is [ __ ] unless this period Issel it with nothing at all at it it won't have any flavor to it as to do so will dilute the potency bill so that plus just showing you guys their vape products is a big reason why I can't suggest them to anyone simply because I don't want any of you guys to end up in the hospital because of what you guys are vaping so I'll go back to myself now um and do a wrap-up but basically I just wanted to show you guys that email and their website so you guys could get just a final like example on how to see if it's a fake or a real TKO extracts card so yeah alright hey guys what's up so it's been around 3 days now and I've still been smoking on the skittles cart I'm sorry I didn't come back sooner I've had a very busy past few days but uh I definitely just want to do this wrap up so after showing you guys all the stuff online and that email that is the biggest reason why I can't suggest these cards to people simply because I don't want any of you guys to get hurt but that being said this batch that I got or at least this part and the that last mango gelato part were both very amazing they were very smooth they hit very hard and gave the effects of the strains that they were supposed to and they tasted the same as the strings they were trying to emulate um this current is very nice if I could suggest it to you guys without having to worry about the health risks I would give this fake that I got an 8 out of 10 um flavor was good the high length was around two and a half hours so I'm not completely at three but it was very potent as well um and they hit super smooth just go ahead and take a blinker through this regular clip just to show you guys how to smooth they are so Cheers [Music] very nice I was able to hold that and I'm not coughing and I don't feel like I want to call I don't even have a dry throat right now so for this cart I thought anyway for this cart definite eight out of ten but I can't suggest it for two days of heavy use I probably have around point two grams left and I started out with 0.8 so I'm happy with my experience with this cart but if you all are trying to get some or if you guys see them around you and want to actually look into them just make sure you watch for the oil quality and if you hit it and it's dry and it hurts do not hit it anymore please either way this was this might be the last video I do want to fake TKOs I'm thinking it will be because I don't really have anything else to say about them but if you guys want I can still review ones that I get if I end up getting four so I'm master bling see thank you guys for watching if you aren't subscribed to the channel do that please I really want to try to hit 10,000 by my birthday which is in February so yeah I'm about to start really trying to get on that grind there's gonna be a few changes to the channel coming up I'm gonna try to film the channel update soon but either way I'm master bling see thank you guys please check all the links in the description peace [Music]", "40UPmwIpak0": "oh gee shout to Ronnie ray and his grandma I love you guys [Music] [Music] [Music] this is for educational purposes only don't watch this video olestra over 18 don't smoke marijuana less you're in a legal state or medical marijuana my personal information alright yo what's up guys Ronnie right back at you so this video I got another car review for you guys I'm gonna be reviewing the same brand that I didn't like that the last to court review videos I think if you've seen him on Excel labs promo colors they just had a fire a steel so I picked up like I think six it yeah I picked up six cards in total so I still have two more flavors left of those to review so two flames I have left are tropical fruit and blueberry so I think in this video I'm gonna be smokin on the blueberry if you guys want to see a movie one in the tropical food and we're down below in the comments and I'll get that out yeah blueberry in this video so I'm not gonna spend I'm not gonna spend too much time going over a pathogen in this video I'll show you guys it a little bit better you guys want to see the packet more in like that detail go check out like I think it's my first or a second review on this company cuz I wanted like really in-depth detail on the packaging I'll give you a quick little look at it you'll break so the front evil labs blueberry contains cannabis so obviously um tested at 80% if you don't know how to use it it gives you instructions so and yeah so that's pretty much the package it's a half gram car the thing that I really like about these two um they're really really cheap I got doc they havethey oh I'm six cards you get six half gram cards and you get a battery like this battery right here eat more labs battery for sixty bucks so three cards and a battery for sixty bucks um I don't know if that's like ideal what they have like everywhere but at least that dispensary that I go to let the deal they have right now so oh yes I'm gonna take that off the battery so yeah this is battery right here this was just a regular stick battery evil laughs not I mean but uh it has them three different temperature settings low medium hot then it has a that preheating setting option where you gonna preheat your portal before you hit it to get like a full hit and yeah so I mean this it's pretty dope battery I mean you get it I'll be used for like the deal they have three cards and a battery for 60 bucks like 1500 milligrams that I mean like smoke shops usually sell these for like what 10 15 bucks so like I don't know how that's just like a fire SEO in my opinion let's just hop into this review with something aside this open this is something that I really like about this company really cheap it's like I was saying and they have all you small little details that are like fire like like I know this doesn't really like mean too much it's the quality of the oil that really matters the most but I I don't know I just always cool to have like some dope packaging make you know I mean so when you take a better uh yeah some once you slide it out it has this little part inside of that that has a evil labs this little white um container what do you call this so you open this up and the cards in here like I said to call the chroma colors yeah right chroma colors did I say that right I don't know but so every every every flavor comes with like a different color you've seen how this one is red so it has like a red tip blueberries blue I think this was sweet melon so that sweet melon was like a green that's just like another small little detail that they do that I think is like really really cool for especially at the price point that like I've been saying like they're so cheap and like it's all all those smaller details they do are like so dope and something else I forgot to mention it's actually a CEO to vaporize cartridge so yeah yeah blueberry cart here's little club close up of the oil said where's the public s so the bubbles right there this oil was like really really really big yes I'm down below in the comments what you guys think about the at least that looks to the oil I think it looks [ __ ] fire especially for being so cheap like I said uh you get three of these cards for 60 bucks with a battery like you really can't beat that the old my opinion and it's coming from the dispensary you're not getting it off the street so you know it's not like some fake [ __ ] like there's Mario karts or exotic you know it's not so [ __ ] like that it's actually from that's that's from like the dispensary so it like it has to be like umm Sayyaf II know what I'm saying so so yeah so just pop these a little blue blue little caps off of here we got the card screwed on to the battery I also really love like the aesthetic like the way this [ __ ] battery looks with the card on it like I mean like with this blue I mean like yeah that [ __ ] looks [ __ ] fire but with it any color it looks [ __ ] sick I don't know tell me what you guys think down below in the comments like I said um this video was saying this is like my review video but I'm also really interested to know what you guys think of the products - so beep like leave your guys's review go in the comments even even though you guys don't get to like actually smoke on it like I'm doing I get it like you review on like the look since [ __ ] you know I'm saying so tell me what you guys think down below if you have tried them like if you have tried this company in the past I tell me what you what you thought at the Brian you know what I'm saying but with that being said I'm gonna put this on the lowest temperature so I can like get the full at the full taste the full flavor and I'm saying so we're preheating it up right now so that way gets the it gets ready for me to hit it so it's ready for me to hit it so cheers if you're smoking along with me let's get it the thing that I am found out about these carts is like if you really want to get the full full flavor like their folk well it's kind of common sense but um like if you want like the full flavor like they taste so [ __ ] good if you put it on like the lowest temperature and like you barely rip it like you just for a couple seconds like he's like you see nothin I didn't take like the fattest trip I just kind of like hit it a little bit to get like the taste you should taste like a [ __ ] vapor oh it doesn't even taste like the wax like it tastes so good so flavor I'm already giving the flavor five out of five that [ __ ] was [ __ ] so far mmm what is that his like um it tastes so [ __ ] so familiarly I don't know what that [ __ ] flavor is but the flavor it tastes so I mean it tastes so like familiar like I've I've tasted this before somewhere like um it has like that artificial like blueberry flavor you know what I'm saying like that artificial taste but um like I don't I don't even know what the [ __ ] of your blueberry tastes like but like the article fit okay it's like the artificial flavor you're not I mean but it tastes like a really familiar like I don't know if it's like a gum or like a candy or something that that I had when I was a kid or what the [ __ ] it tastes like but I can't I can't think of it but I know it tastes like something that really really similar to something that I've had in the past but yeah like you know like the flavor on this though like five out of five like I said like it tastes like you're hitting a [ __ ] mod like oh my god I nicotine mug you know I mean like it tastes fire oh one of the best tasting [ __ ] wife spins I've had by far like a hundred percent um so I just put it on medium tempo I'm gonna take a couple fatter hits and get a little rating for the high the high I guess and the smoke so yeah Cheers [ __ ] I [ __ ] up on that one mmm that [ __ ] tastes so fire made that one more time so I mean you see it [ __ ] rip so like um the taste 5 out of 5 the way it smokes it gets 5 out of 5 the high they're not the [ __ ] best cards like I've had way better cards like if you seen in my last couple reviews I did a brand called select um select elite premium vapes um their cards are stupid [ __ ] fire but they're like 40 bucks for a half gram card which is like really really expensive but that [ __ ] is stupid fire um these are definitely not on that level but that for the price point [ __ ] is [ __ ] fire um if you ever see these in your area definitely pick them up tell me what you think of them or even if you don't have the chance to tell me what you think of them just [ __ ] pick them up because they're fire I'm not sure like but they have like their own store or what it is but I said that the price point on these were it was like 22 or 23 dollars yeah I'd definitely pick one of these up if you have a if you ever see these in your [ __ ] area definitely pick one of these up evil labs extracts are not just evil labs a cannabis and vault evolved that's what it's called that's that's the brand um yeah topaz packaging definitely picked one of them up you can't beat it for the price point in my opinion 1500 milligrams of THC a battery for 60 bucks that's that's a [ __ ] steal so the tastes on this is a 5 out of 5 but that's [ __ ] crazy I can't like it tastes [ __ ] insane the smoke do you see I'm getting like fat rips watch yeah so I don't think the camera really picked that up as well as like you could see it in person but this [ __ ] [ __ ] rips um this the way it smokes you get a 5 out of 5 to the price point 5 out of 5 quality of the cart like I said I've had way better cards in the past but for the price point I think in the past videos I gave him three and a half but after smoking on them for a couple days they're kind of growing on me and I come I'm kind of liking them a little bit more so I don't know just after smoking them for the last couple days I'm gonna I'm gonna raise my score up to a four so the so the high gets a 4 out of 5 and I guess I'll keep the quality of the oil at a 3.5 Obama raised too high though for so yeah I guess the overall score at the cart a 4 out of 5 that's like the overall score for the everything combined 4 out of 5 3 cards 500 milligrams each totaled 1500 milligrams and you get a battery sixty [ __ ] dollars that's how [ __ ] steal can't beat at my opinion definitely picked them up like I said definitely tried them out here's the brand I was talking about was select this is actually Paris oh gee yeah if you want to see a ever actually did a review on this course if you want to see that go check that out but like I was talking about they're [ __ ] a forty bucks for a half a gram but yeah those are stupid fire you can go check it out if you want the review but yeah like I said this card 4 out of 5 but I still have one more left to review so if you guys want to see a review on the strain or flavor of tropical fruit tumble down below in the comments and I'll get a review out for that and then they just got some new fire ass card set the dispensary right down the road for me someone pick a couple of those up if you guys want to see some more these videos um if you guys enjoyed these like car reviews or if you guys want to see some more like maybe like wax wax video is like actually like shatter or like need Davin instead of just cards or like some fire a spud like me rolling up loans and smoking either you have one of those up but you want to see more of those time with that down

now so those should be up so uh those should be up soon um besides for that if you guys like this video get a big thumbs up comment like subscribe do all that good [ __ ] it's been around here a peace

those numbers I read a number right now they're gonna pop their [ __ ] open see sighs first impression um like an initial initial first impression would be I'm impressed and I guess I'm happy with how absolutely filled to the brim this is like I don't even like see oh there there we I usually look for those I see how a viscous liquid is but that bad boy ain't going nowhere so I can't wait to screw this on I'm gonna show y'all how this hurts so I have the forbidden fruit I'd be quite excited for this side of that forbidden fruit in quite some time I'm a honeycomb - let's see if it's a really 83% I was really clean the taste I gotta tell on because I get smelly part the terpenes were clearly they're not overbearing from the first it doesn't taste anything like that wait then it feels like a clean cannabis distillate like a regular cannabis extract don't worry I distracted by a squirrel [Applause] [Applause] all right so okay so a bit in tell you my second blinker I did double tap the battery and preheat it the flavor came in more full it's still not overpowering okay let me pick this up you know any of those a battery parts I have I'll be able to tell not obviously I didn't bolts if I'll be able to tell what strength this is what I was doing a closed I hate based on the taste and that's good so what's going different strains have different taste is that's how it is in the real we'd world so right there I'm gonna show y'all the best I can the best audacity of the cartridge when the mango will start to understand from the air the standard you know this really is one in Japanese with impunity for thousands rooms permit is not to be summoned three in a row of three round bursts I've greatly to attack to find him back I felt a little [ __ ] [Music]", "G7GklIFSSAU": "Delta time THC there's now a huge thread regarding that and don't live when we had a fun little for it for take a little for a layman's background so so depending it specifically yeah everybody's different and I'll all have their own special ways of a festival but depending on where or how the different pieces of the molecule are laid out you you know the difference between THC delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail and no boxer group carboxyl group and in another thing there's Delta 88 C which has gotten really popular with the water clear trend and people would you know they would throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and stuff into their boiling flask and then they'd start distilling it and it's coming out beautiful water clear they sent test results or they'd sent testing labs and then it's yeah like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually we started they got standards for Delta 88 C then started quantifying that there's more THC in us that there is but then there's still a little missing piece that like you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids and this water clear stuff that you know it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and these are things that happen through different reaction their reactions that happen through heating and the presence of acids and bases and given the different environmental things or what was sprayed on those so that that can actually be a big indicator what's happening into the reactions as well so so good all that distillation method we're like you put stuff in a pot it boils at different temperatures and all that well throw catalyst in that pot that you don't know is there like you know people spray put sulfur on their plants or people you know certain things get sprayed on plants and when you concentrate that thing in a hot flask under vacuum where fires and fire attack there's a whole bunch of ways you could do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC that until recently was it is yes in different income in different ways they affect all three of those can affect a single person completely different no they've been discovered but they're only being mass-produced yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows about him and he has and we are just now mass producing them because we have the freedom of the market to start and start playing and then we also have the competition in the market to try to make the clearest most beautiful looking oil which you know well it used to be Delta 8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm saying historically historically when they first started getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil it was Delta eight and they would do this refluxing carbon acids and but but but yeah and that was it then they would use a catalyst in the flask that they were boiling in one we're talking about people who appreciate the clarity that clear net the secret is that the consumer is that an expert consumers okay and what's your opinion on consumers have been led to believe that the clear the oil is well and and and that clear could come from a lot of different things it can be cut with another clear oil that it makes you know just diffuses what color is in there there's a lot of things that can clarity is definitely an indicator of purity though it was an indicator but the a slight yellow amber tint the these are little little atomic level refractions that are happening with chromophores that hold into the the tail end of the molecule these these are what a chromophore is uncle mela these they're they're basically like atomically small things that will refract light at a different color so you have so by breaking that bond you you like that's when people distill with certain things on the flask you can break that at that chromophore bond and it you can also break that bond by through chromatography as well which people eventually developed a method for Delta 9 THC does anyone clear water clear yeah and it that was just a method of taking a single pass distillate and then passing it through a series of usually magnesium silicate or floor so actually and then but different color remediating adsorbents that were also being used to remediate past asides and they still are used to remediate pesticides and it just happened that you make water clear delta 9 after remediating pesticides properly as sometimes depending on the oil and what kind of colors and that the condition THC 8 and 10 have been known for and their-their prevalent in the same way that THC is in Canada like there is it kind of like a is it a totally different cannabinoid that is in very low percentages in well zombie health of ours not so much on the cultivar it's a reaction through processing so you're not gonna have those you're not gonna have a bunch of Delta eight or delta10 any in your flowers you're gonna have it in a kind of a crazy their isomers correct and it was the one thing everything we're talking about is like the ability to narrow the bands of what you're capturing well if you cuz you're right it's it's these little slices but the only way that's possible is that we've now created these massive machine that will process a lot so we get bigger trends you know we we see information come out of plant material from farms all over California grown differently going different ways different yields different strengths different compounds or the makeup of the cannabinoids in that specific strain like it's really interesting we get to see a lot of those so at the same time as we're narrowing the focus and really like getting to chop down into you know now we're we just picked up a machine that will separate out individual cannabinoids so you can collect them individually it's a centrifugal partitioning chromatography this company called rodeo cron they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry THC eight and ten are kind of like mine or like other cannabinoids that we've known about it but haven't been able to isolate so on the market are we gonna eventually see like THC eight tinctures and THC ten tinctures in the same way that we see other kind of my hair cannabinoid totally and we've been seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of THC eight cart hay in cartridges and there is subsequently a decent amount of Delta ten THC that's in there well no they're just calling it if you're buying a card off the traditional market you they're saying it's one thing but who knows what really is in that cartridge right so but because you can take garbage oil and by attorney by doing this process to convert it to Delta eight clean it up to make it look clear a lot of guys do that ii buy a really cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction of that off and this really nice-looking oil and then it's just cheaper the way that that's produced then I like water clear Delta nine it takes extremely expensive absorbance and a process to do it with the Delta eight you throw some activated carbon in their flask and if you distill right here you can get water clear I mean there's a few other a few other parameters to change but you just dump a bunch of garbage in your flask and then just mix it with your oil and your oil is coming out nicely that was what a bunch of people were doing to fix their dark oil especially in the early day when people really weren't distilling very well", "0zF-4g8WZhU": "what is up guys mr. Tortoni roast begging in with another video and is falling and today we're gonna do another video on a tank of a cartridge review and a quick little quick little update i think i think that i think babes had updated their their supply of of inventory because i they have like these packages look so different like I'm just gonna let you know like the old packages you guys remember they had it right here in the front like the cartridge these are on the side kind of like nectar vapes have you seen them but it's they still stink vapes and it's just ink babes official account on the side I mean that's as legit as you I don't know how legit that is but it these these are what the new cartridges are gonna look like from what my homeboy told me so and apparently my homeboy has some pretty good some pretty damn good connects into the whole what's it called designer cart industry so yeah I should be interesting I mean the price is still the same which is amazing $20 a gram but I have seen lately dang tapes and shops like a weed maps and [ __ ] and I've seen them for $30 per gram so yeah but usually like you buy one get one free so you buy one for 30 bucks and then you get another one for free but I think you have to or that's what it says like I'm not Paige but you know like when you go on the store they could always change it up on you and say something different disgusting remember Rd that good because that is disgusting so yeah it's interesting that these cartridges are having a little a little change in their own in their appearance because I know that mario karts has has been doing a little bit of a little bit of something different with their cartridges like something to do with like reflective pieces that they are putting on the back or something like that like these stuff like the mushroom the fret the reflective mushroom tip but I don't know they still have that on there right now [Music] it smells better than it tastes well this is just some pain medication for my pain it's phone yeah I'm not gonna say what there is because yes I know it is this is not a review on that today because it's just not but I thought I just added in here for you guys because you know it's always it's always something different when you guys catch into my videos reaction and daddy da pink Spreadshirt just a little bit of pink nothing too special I don't I just need something different pain because my foot hurts like a [ __ ] someone about the heel of it but anyways enough of that um let's get on to what the [ __ ] we're gonna do so I only have two cartridges today and that's D Stewart here now the other one I smoked and I forget where the [ __ ] I put the cartridge so the cartridge pack but it is bogum but this is a Mingo cush and then this is the mimosa mimosa you guys know is orange I believe like a warrior's juice mix with a champagne or something similar like that that'll be that's what I think it is I believe is I think that's what it is in a Mingo Kershaw you see it's just the Oh mango Kirk um one problem that I did have with this and it's not anyone's fault but I guess the suppliers and how they packed how they'd stored everything because you see here I had the problem on the other one too I don't know what the [ __ ] happened but it like it's cracked yeah you could see like that little right here she that Christ it's not supposed to be like that and it's not on the outside it's on the inside and the the crack let you see it yeah you go it like [ __ ] with the airflow really bad so it's like whenever I vape it with this one it's like the heat has to be much hard in order to evenly produce the same amount of clouds that uh the mimosa would produce like I'm gonna tell you like real quick what this tastes like this is on three point today by the way is I'm just gonna sure mango cush DC airflow decent air below the Tucson that tastes kind of candy ish not really mango II I don't I guess you did one more time just make sure that's not mango also the oil is very loose air different things from different people if somebody were saying that if it moves really fast it's not a good day move was really slow it's not a good thing obviously anything that you're paying way way less for than advertised I mean then what it should be like a full gram should not be twenty bucks at this time moment in time unless it's it cycle like I said large-scale disciplined process I know this is video but it's guys named agent Phil oh he's not YouTube he did like a whole review on him what carts are stuff like that so basically what it is is really is just a brand like one person started it and then everyone just hops on a bandwagon you could buy these carts like the packages and stuff for cheap and then the carts themselves for cheap as well and then just fill it up with your own distillate I know the people who fill these up with their distillate and their distances solid quality it's very good does it well is there a possibility that it might have pesticides yes am I willing to take their [ __ ] risk yes because this is not the only product that I'm using I used this one I'm like I have absolutely no at the time I am NOT it'll not have to go into shops yeah and oh sure I haven't seen in the shop yet did isn't allow anyone over 21 so I don't want to go get a [ __ ] wreck those things are priced [ __ ] I ready just do what I'm doing but I still do get shop quality little things don't ask how I'm hustling die horribly so uh yeah the main go could taste like I don't know bro it really [ __ ] this one up the taste I mean it's not offensive but the same time is not like mango it's nothing like doesn't even taste fruity honestly I don't know what the [ __ ] I think they just used some type of like and [ __ ] but I don't know what the [ __ ] that tastes like just tastes like piney love sweet I guess you could say a little bit can you use but not fruity not only not citrusy this one on the other oh so it's just a one sauce this one as you guys can see clear no yeah no cracks like as you can see this song like you see that visible very visible crack no crack whatsoever oh so I don't know this [ __ ] just sat on it while he was looking driving over they fell like I said because he ordered these through the [ __ ] mail a couple of critical a smacked around so first time I've ever had that problem with that Oh tastes good good I'm hitting some figures 3.3 stover stone 3.3 now you saw the loan how this dowel don't hit don't you see how this one it my trip in dude you know this one definitely smacks harder yeah this one definitely hits [Music] much better take some free to he duped I call him but this one on three point three hits like this one would hit like on my 3.6 3.7 um which is not super bad because this thing can hit pretty damn hard because it's adjustable a little lip to four point four point eight the only problem is that what I have this on the go this one just forget about it like I'll get a couple hits in before this [ __ ] thing just dies because for this battery to last a while I personally leave it on three point three because that's usually all you need to you know you don't need anything more than three point to me so I like how discreet it is and how much think you can last especially like you're taking like big hits like I am like it's perfect for being a public but this [ __ ] up car keys out to be right by a battery sources oh [ __ ] my back is [ __ ] soda you know soda so I'm at my home I'm using this one if I'm out in the street so this one because yes I mean unless one of them runs out hopefully if someone is out first not this one because I like this one better and hopefully the next ones that buyer aren't liked it as well also this one tastes amazing is it the best tasting one out of the ones that I've just had it tastes like candy soda like those little candy soda that you would like to like little tiny little pellets that you'd put in your mouth and it would foam up it tastes like the orange soda version of that it's like the perfect analogy right there social my candy sodas and tiny little candy soda does that make foam in your mouth we would play around with them make sure make believe that we had like rabies and [ __ ] out in the yard chasing people around but yes this [ __ ] tastes amazing yeah the new den grips looking pretty tight they also put like the decal a little few little black spots that's like goes an orange or tangerine and then right here there's mangoes like in the background it's hard to see yeah you see little black imprints like tiny little details yeah so this is one problem grounds I'm not gonna lie I'm gonna miss the older one so this is like the only ones that they're gonna have from now on cuz I did like the drawings on the other ones a little bit more like the Durbin poison a blue dream you know the Diablo and the other ones but you know you know these things will keep going on then things'll evolving I guess they go for the fruitier flavors now does my mosa is a newer flamingo fish I do not know when they get room but he seems to be kind of newer strange so yeah with that being said I hope you guys are having a wonderful day I hope you guys saw this video to the end and I hope you guys will continue to watch my videos because I will continue to post that month [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] feeling good she episode", "sBVtvnJi1N0": "in the cat welcome back everybody to a brand new wax cartridge review today we got yet again another Rob guarded man you guys know raw garden man

how I'm always just kind of puffing on a you know I'm trying it out the moment I usually get these raw garden cartridges these cards you know that it's like I'm already like kind of puffing on it you know I want to really check this out but like check this out man we got a cookie pie regarding man this one I was talking to the but the to one of the bud tenders and he told me that this one he likes this one a lot look at that right there it looks kind of green but this one actually I'm not gonna lie if I put it up to the light let's see but put it up to the light yeah it's still yellow it's yellow but let me know that comment down below if you guys have tried the raw Garden card so I'm pretty sure everybody's tried them it's because of you guys that I've actually found out about raw garden like before this channel before I made this channel I had no idea that raw garden was a thing and I know there's a lot of other cartridges that I don't even know our thing or like the brand was but a definitely raw garden man with the sauces you know the wax the wax is the carts all that stuff man raw garden does not disappoint man it's their their fire let's get this battery and this time we're gonna try something new we're gonna and this time we're gonna try this we tried last summer I'm gonna turn off the lights I'm gonna try to have a cool little back setting you know oh that's actually kind of nice I'm not gonna lie got my computer screen on and if we turn this off now I don't want to turn it off I think this is just perfect right look at that oh that's actually kind of nice you guys are you know it's a 5-10 thread hmm so there was a time I'm pretty sure I told you guys this last time I actually went to UM so I went to Lake Tahoe with a couple of my buddies right and one of my boys he had a full ground with this rock garden a Cartwright and oh my god the stuff that he had man was I don't know if the if the grams are a lot stronger than the half grams but one rip just one rip and that she got me loaded hard let's check it out everybody rock garden cooking part number four so there's number one two and three that's the first hit man instantly live and the taste is like so lemony like a lime taste it's like and again everybody this is some live resin - it even says right on that it even says right on the cart on the on the box - but um definitely it taste like this this is exactly what it tastes like you guys see this little logo this piece of leaf I talked about this in other videos - like let's say there's like a bush you rip off a leaf and you just start chewing on you start chewing on it and it tastes like a lime you know like that straight line takes that's exactly what it tastes like and it makes clouds - this one definitely tastes a little different than the other ones I was like a little distinct taste let's buy that cooking bar click buy taste tastes pretty good yeah if you guys have rock garden carts you guys know exactly what I'm talking about let me know in the comments down below you guys for those people that have smoked these rock garden cars before write down a comment and try to describe as much as possible like how it tastes like you know drop a comment thank you guys for clicking on this another yet again another podcast oh I'm already late I've only taking like a couple drags on already [ __ ] stoned but make sure you guys drop a like a comment subscribe click that bell so you guys get over five every time we upload let's take another [ __ ] trip you guys like the background she looks sick huh I'm not gonna lie damn that [ __ ] that was like one of the some of the best one of the best investments I've done to this room right there's someone asking about this little square that's actually a part of my am my VR headset so I got the HTC vive comes with two like this size and look they look like speakers but they're actually sensors you put one right there and the other ones right here on the other cross you know so it's kind of like the rooms like that you're pulling her hair one right here so it detects like all the motion then you got the headset and then like the gear and it kind of it's just a sensor you know so it makes the game a lot better because if you guys haven't played the are man that [ __ ] is fun it I mean I'm not like it's expensive you need a gaming PC and then it the headset and all that stuff it's a little pricey I spent like 600 bucks but it's so worth it that's one thing is so worth it man I'm gonna start doing some VR live streams so make sure you guys go down in the description man I got my main channel I got my Swiss channel I got my social media all that stuff damn she got me [ __ ] lid I've been trying out pretty much a lot of just a lot of 7:10 Labs a lot of rock gardens like a notice in this channel it's been a lot a lot of 710 labs and a lot of rock garden but you know the brands are pretty [ __ ] fired man they stay dropping bar [ __ ] I did have one theory though is that when you buy a half brown for some reason if you guys were to buy a gram instead of a half gram I feel like the gram is more fire like I had I've literally hit two different pens um pretty much they both had a full gram of raw garden and I took a hit of it and I started coughing I got so [ __ ] lit you know I'm just like what the [ __ ] something about the bull gram you know and then I try this right I try the half gram and then and then another thing - I'm just like maybe it's just a different strain maybe it's just like a little it's a little stronger you know but the one that I tried half dry man grandma's the dosha something no videos a jungle rush I think but pretty much I took a hit of that full gram and bro I'm [ __ ] just stoned out of my mind three all right let's chop the million sensitivity list see when you guys kind of build some clouds oh that was like I feel like all regard I feel like all carts are super fired you just gotta put it on the right on the right heat set on the right heat mode on the right temperature you know I think the medium is fired for this one and these actually go for around thirty dollars so I'm not gonna lie it's not that bad but the Moxie cards these are way stronger than the Moxie cards man the other time man you guys you guys seen a man saying I had to take like maybe like ten eleven hits to be like stoned and this one I'm only like what like five six and I am [ __ ] Dan rock garden ladies and gentlemen it shows the test see this is another thing too but why I really like Robert and I like the way they have we did this it says right here test you could literally go online and check the test results of this wax cartridge who knows you who knows you know they can hey little do we know people could be lying you know but at the same time it's just like it's pretty much like you could say it's like it's been government approved so if they are lying blame the government so I got some more raw garden reviews everybody I hope you guys enjoyed this video again this is the rock garden cut u54 I hope you guys enjoy this [ __ ] man cuz [ __ ] I sure did man [ __ ] raw garden you can't go wrong with raw garden see now that's that's doable that's pretty big brick and that's doable I said hey let's check it out [ __ ] it I want a career oh yeah [ __ ] that [ __ ] that that redwood high setting wall you'll place smoke this in my 10 hit city they [ __ ] let that [ __ ] and it comes with a little container to keep it safe it also comes with like little protectors this one's for the bottom this one's for the top for the tip remember everybody safe sex and paychecks that's what it's all about you guys have a good night", "5r7-z1DRz1o": "[Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another fake cartridge video this was actually part 2 and I give a shout out to my boy Christian who actually requested this video you know I feel like when someone requests a part two of a video I'll try and do my best to provide that for him and also I'd like to shout out my 15 members you know I haven't shouted them out in the video lately so for all 15 of you thank you I'll post them right here and all that stuff but getting on to the main topic of this video is fake cartridges obviously you know there's many fake cartridges that have basically just faked from a real company you know we got raw guard and brass knuckles all that stuff and every now and then you get other companies that just come out nowhere that may have been legit kinda cleared I mentioned in my first part video and then another one where one of you guys mentioned that there's another card called Lions breath something popped up in my reddit and for another thing when it comes to fake cartridges and you're very unsure of if you have a real one or a fake one just look it up online and ready is a very very good source for basically anyone uploading their opinion on the cartridge so it's easy to find if these cartridges are faked or being faked QR codes are fake or whatever but the other car in question is called Lions breath and these look pretty legit too QR codes holographic stickers all that [ __ ] and it's very hard for people to tell if that's legit or fake and honestly in my opinion I haven't seen that it like near me I haven't heard of Lions breath until I made that other video on the fake cartridges so I feel like it's my duty and other cannabis content creators to make videos spreading awareness on you know all the fake cartridges that are possibly out there so we can say hopefully save someone's lungs from permanent damage you know I'm not saying they're all bad but when there's so many fakes out there is it really worth the risk you know and this is not this is like he's like counterfeits and fakes aren't like you know if Louie Vuitton or fake then you buy something it doesn't affect your health you know it doesn't even affect your bank account as much as a buying a real Louie Vuitton would you know that's why people buy fakes but when you talk about fake cartridges this is something that we consume that we ingest so it's a very real possibility that maybe you might get permanent damage smoking nice you know backyard cartridges you know and I want to spread awareness on this as much as I can you know I don't really but I like making these videos but I feel like it's my duty as a cannabis content creator to make videos like this so that the public is a lot more safe when it comes to purchasing just anything cannabis you know I feel like I want my channel to be where like people will go to to find legit products just have a good time in smoke you know and hopefully I'm getting close to that goal every day you know I try and you know every now and then I try to make these videos you know and like I said Christian Torres requested a part too so I'll do my best to do it this is not going to be the only video uploaded today this is going to be the first video uploaded today and then I have another UFC video from like a week or two ago that I want to upload so yeah definitely stay tuned for that this is not gonna be the only video you know as much as these videos are important I know that not everyone watches them you know they'd much rather prefer like a smoke session or a vlog so I got you two videos today but this one's gonna be the first one because I feel like this is very important I should really get it out there and yeah shout out to Christian be aware of Lions breath carts you know I'll post it right here this [ __ ] looks pretty legit holographic sticker all that stuff but in that reddit post that came up it said that it was probably the worst tasting cartridge that he's ever had so just you you know as much as packaging influences your opinion on the product you still gotta be careful you know even though the packaging looks so [ __ ] legit you know you gotta be careful and best way to avoid you know getting fakes is to buy from a reputable dispensary if you're in a legal state I mean you didn't have to wait until you know cartridges are in your area but you know just be safe out there guys because permanent lung damage does not sound good you know saying so please if you guys have fake cartridges I'm not saying they're bad I'm just saying that there's a chance they could be bad you know there's a [ __ ] chance you know and it'll be pretty ignorant of you to say that there isn't a chance you know so just be careful other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video like I said there will be another video out today 4:15 p.m. peace out [Music] you", "tD9jDNjYzA8": "yo what's going on guys thanks for bringing

blinkers i did take throughout the whole video but peace the hell are y'all", "BMSHUp-OMew": "what up guys it's my clear three back here in another cartridge review I know it's been a minute but hey better better late than never but never late is better alright so back today I got another cartridge so I hadn't been uploaded I just been busy you know but I was excited about this one I don't know why I never tried this brand I tried a lot but anyway let's get straight into it today I we're gonna come up at you with evil lab colors tropical fruit it looks bomb it smells bomb I haven't tried it but I smelled like the cartridge tasted it a little bit let's get into the details shoot its flavored tropical fruit I don't know how flavors in the taste in it but I'm more so I'm more of a strain specific dude but Abe I try whatever like as long as it's like some good stuff and evil lab out here in Colorado is known to make good cartridges all right let's get into the details you can see it says the total cannabinoids is 80% which is okay I mean it's pretty good actually THC seventy six point six seven percent and there's no CBDs in it and this is that it's called colors people lab has three different kinds one called alchemy a full spectrum 100% cannabis derived this is a hundred percent a hundred percent plant derived flavors so anyway let's just get into it man do the unboxing by the way I like I really like the packaging like so is that they really care about like their customers and they really promote their product comes in a little tube like this again all the back all the health information batch number you know all that legal stuff tech you got to do and she I mean screw this battery today I'm not the same as last video I'm still using this smoking dragon battery it rips well that's all I could say like I've tried different batteries like a Willie Nelson battery and anyway here we go here's the actual Clarke real looking nice cartridge says evil lab right at the top and like there's virtually no arable move like this is sealed all the way to the top just show you how it looks up it's a white background no runny oil so that's always a good sign if your oils runny surprise stop smoking that [ __ ] man I don't know what the hell you smoking but here we go without further ado shoot it's my first time trying it I'm excited screw this bad boy off if it has a nice little I don't know I just think it's I don't know I really like presentation go there they got me they got like a good presentation and it makes you want to buy this stuff actually thought further ado cheers guys it just hits man kind of thing it does taste food fruit punch but you also get that cannabinoid flavor I got a hot flash well it's real good man like take one more hit I really like the start I think I want to try the other three cards they have the bail range and like prices from $20 for a half gram they got $30 half grams they all range from big prices but otherwise I'm gonna get out of here I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep poking you guys and do you guys want more reviews let me know and I'll keep I'll keep doing them yeah hi my friends", "IEVuTvzPGbc": "hey guys what's up it's cyn here back to you guys today with another [ __ ] smoking video and in today's video we're going to be reviewing the flying monkey uh half gram disposable cart um i want to point out one thing uh just so you guys know um on the packaging it looks like it says five grams i don't know if you guys can tell the point is super unnoticeable i know that most people aren't gonna think this i thought that it was a five gram cart well okay hang on let me trace back i didn't think it was a five gram cart i just thought that it said it was a five gram cart and it was actually gonna be like a gram but no that's it's a half gram cart um but anyways we're going to be reviewing that and i also have i i didn't want to do a stand-alone review of it but to anybody watching this video we're going to quickly review this it is a pod twist a 2500 puff uh strawberry lemonade disposable vape i've never seen these before but they have them at lucky's and i told them i'd try them out so oh i like that i don't really like too many vapes i have been trying to quit cigarettes as you guys know and this is the one that i've been sticking to is hide um i really really liked oh no never cough on the vape but anyways i really like the flavor of this one i'm not gonna say 100 that i like this one better but this is i do not like like any other disposable vapes or really i've tried box mods this has been the only one that's helped me but i can see this one helping as well i just don't like the like ice feeling that a lot of the disposables are like pushing um but yeah go ahead and if you guys smoke vapes they have these over at lucky's they're called pod twists i highly suggest this they're uh 14.99 i believe um and i highly suggest them so go ahead and check those out um but let's go ahead and get straight into what you guys came for which is the flying monkey review i'm gonna go ahead and open that up now these will run you anywhere between 20 and 40 depending where you get them i believe lucky's sells them for i think it was 35 or something like that um but you can get these online you can also get these at lucky's um i'm sure that some of you guys smoke shops carry these um we already tried the flying monkey uh pre-roll and that was super [ __ ] worth it so we're gonna go ahead and give this a shot uh like i said we got blue dream um so last time we tried the fruity pebbles uh we tried the fruity pebble guys my brain like completely stopped [ __ ] working there but we tried the fruity pebbles pre-roll by flying monkey so i'm not gonna lie i was looking at the fruity pebbles cart um but i didn't want to try the same flavor twice in a row so i got blue dream and fun fact about sin um my favorite uh strain is dream queen and that is a mix of um blue dream and space queen so this is one of the things that makes up my favorite strain so i figured i'd try this one out so we're gonna go ahead and grab whatever the [ __ ] you guys are smoking on and cheers oh god okay so jesus [ __ ] okay so the first thing i want to say first hit is um in terms to relating to the other delta eight thc products that i've tried this doesn't taste as good as any of those um doing honest reviews over here guys i really like their pre-roll tasted [ __ ] amazing got me absolutely [ __ ] baked now that doesn't testify to the quality of the oil inside and it doesn't taste bad that's not what i'm saying at all it just doesn't taste as good as other delta 8 products i've had actually this probably tastes more close to to an actual cart then um then like any of the other products i've had because the other delta eight products are like a lot higher i think in terpenes um so that could speak volumes for this or it could be a downfall it just depends on the person you are um it doesn't change too much for me but like one of my favorite things about that herb cart was the flavor of it so but i'm also not somebody that's just gonna buy something because it tastes good or at least like in the weed world i'm not going to um i'm more concerned about the quality of the product i'm getting and how high it gets me basically so let's go ahead and jump into the second hit now one super positive thing i want to give this guard is it rips i'll be right back okay now that i'm able to breathe again [ __ ] man um yeah this rips like a [ __ ] um super cloudy um obviously a very enjoyable experience there um another pet peeve of mine when it comes to vapes like this one is i personally like to know how much dabs i have left you know and how fast i'm smoking them but you can't really tell on this of course it's a disposable that's kind of not the point but that's every disposable i can't see how many puffs left i have on this i can't see how many puffs left i have on this honestly someone should go make a [ __ ] disposable of disposable of this disposable of those disposable vapes carts everything [ __ ] that's disposable that way and hey what's up mikko anyways um they should make a counter for how many puffs you're having on these because these are 2500 puffs but i can tell you i've had a couple of these where it did not feel like i hit that 2500 times before it ran out i will give this one points because you can kind of see it's not super clear but it's better than most disposable vapes so i'll give it points there i just don't like stuff to like randomly run out on me or anything and i kind of like to know how much i have left or how i should be smoking based on what i got um so if you don't care though this honestly hits better than like a regular cart to me uh so i would highly suggest this it's got a good clouds got good draw um flavor's good i don't really got anything to complain about in that department um i want to give a huge shout out again to lucky smoke shop for sponsoring this video uh we super appreciate you over here and uh if you guys for all my local subscribers you guys gotta go check them out it's a super

haze is the flavor of this one these are a little different than all the other cartridges that we carry and that they're not actually a cartridge they're a pod system so it's going to use a different type of battery than the standard c cell that the rest of our our cartridges use but i really like these they hit really well they have really good strains this one is hawaiian haze it has like a really nice smooth coconutty flavor really smooth hits really strong and it's from the brand core which if you tried any of our tiara grow flower it's the same same company that's making these core pods really high quality i just really like them be sure to make sure you have the right battery to go with them if you do get them but it's definitely worth the investment to get the battery because they're great great price great effect i really like", "JG0_YdcLap0": "hello my children and welcome to wheats as we turn corn syrup and high and potassium sodium tartrate into not wine but weed welcome to wheats guys uh we are here with jesus and all my other homies today to talk moana that's right we're back with wanna uh surely i'm not gonna take the time to link below uh the video where i screwed up reviewing them before so we are here to review them in earnest today they're watermelon hybrid gummies uh this is a vegan gummy from wanna coming in at 20 bucks from my dispensary so this puts this at the uh highest end of the gummy um edibles at my dispensary so a bit of a premium for the wanna gummies um but nothing else too fancy here pretty basic packaging from wanna with their hybrid watermelon gummies we're gonna do it nice and short and quick here so that we don't upset the j-man we're going to pinch here as it says open it up and there are our wanna weed watermelon gummies manufactured by high life farms we've got our wonderful lab testing results and all of our stuff my cameraman is currently being uh pulled away by the dogs at this moment but that's okay here we go here is our watermelon gummy looking really nice and square how wonderful watermelon sugar weed aftertaste not bad pretty good well i am now my own cameraman again um and these wanna weed gummies well if you've had a weed gummy before you know what to expect um a lot of sugar to mask the taste and a pretty hefty cannabis aftertaste but i have certainly had worse uh and haven't had too many that are quite a bit better in terms of taste but it's not about how it tastes about how it makes you feel and for that guys i'm gonna come back to you in about two hours after i finish another whole hell a lot of a hell of a lot of these gummies and once i do i'll come back and i will let you know if these wanna weed gummies are as good as we all wanted them to be ugh anyways say hi stay healthy we'll see you back here in just a bit goodbye welcome back to wheat skies i'm back from paradise on earth or what was it called jesus's cameraman do you remember desert christ park welcome back to wheats guys i'm back from desert christ park or something like that the place with all the jesuses uh where we first tried the wanna cannabis infused watermelon hybrid gummies and these are pretty good gummies uh i'm not a hundred percent sure they're worth the 20 premium uh they are uh sort of better quality than the cheapest gummies for sure uh but whether they're the uh sort of eight dollar premium i'm not a hundred percent but they are definitely good quality and if you are concerned about um healthiness in your gummies excuse me guys there's a dog who's really just insistent go get them get out of my face um so if you're really concerned about your uh health and all that these are vegan uh and they are all natural flavors and colors nothing artificial here so uh they also claim to be artisan quality whatever that means anyways uh good quality stuff still pretty high from these uh it's been about three hours since i had my last one and still i am quite high so that is a pretty good endorsement right there and then anytime we have a product we like this much i'll take that camera person she's driving us all crazy go get just get out of our face just just just kid it's it's going to make it worse anytime we have a product we like this much i like to give a little cherry on top a little something extra that's not weed related so i'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the middle of uh god's country and anytime i'm out in the desert i think you know area 51 ufos sci-fi and we've been doing board games recently so i'm going to give you one of my favorite board games of all time one very cosmic and theme and that's cosmic encounters plays like five six seven eight players uh it is too hard too difficult to explain right here but i can tell you it's going to be one of the best times if you have friends who are into board games if you've never heard of cosmic encounters and you have a group that is willing to um do something different give cosmic encounters a try don't even remember who designed it right now that's because of wanna gummies and these wanna i was gonna make another one a pun but i'm too high so just you know uh know that that is an endorsement and that's going to be endorsement as well for cosmic encounters on your local board game store or online in some way i guess we're still in the middle of a pandemic board games are a weird thing to endorse but um they're an optimistic one and i'm rambling thanks guys it's been a it's been a blast here i'm sorry about the dog i'm sorry about all the jesus stuff you know uh we're just uh we're out here on vacation having a good time here on weeds stay high stay healthy we'll see you soon", "4T3xo27vhNk": "if you're not a canvas patient or of age please cycle for this video yo

top but yeah there's all that so i know it's a bm brand but from what i heard the oil is pretty good so that's why i want to go ahead and give it a try so let's go ahead and take it so it does taste like a regular distillate do you eat the little lemony taste let's go ahead and take another so i'm hitting this off of the toki 510 thread battery and like i said the lemon haze not elapsed cart so

but this one's going to be on the clean cards not the fake carts you guys have been asking for a part four for a few months now you know and uh now that um for tuesdays i'm mainly gonna be doing reaction videos till i can stream again i wanted to do a clean cart one because one of the videos is actually picking up steam right now and if it's picking up steam might as well add another one because that that tells me that people are watching that and i know you guys have wanted this one as well and uh before i start this for any further the clean cards moderators i do not know any of them i don't give a [ __ ] about any of them uh because most of you guys say that they're mostly douche bags and stuff and like self-righteous in some ways but i would like to say that i am in no way affiliated with them it's just me reacting to their subreddit and uh just seeing what the legal cards are in the whole country you know what i'm saying i do have a card for this video you know i've been slacking with cards in terms of you know i'm making a fake cartridge video i don't even i'm not even smoking out of a cart this is actually the moonwalker brand uh video will be out in a few days but you know with these reaction videos i try to get these out the day that i record them that way you can follow along you know while i'm watching the video i guess but cheers for those of you who don't know this is delta eight it's called moonwalker the strain is called grape runts and honestly it's one of the better distillate cartridges that i've tried d8 or d9 it's just really flavorful now you do get a strong taste of grape if you guys are interested in this it will be in the comments below you can actually buy these in 38 states so shout out to moonwalker like i said videos on this product will be out in a few days but let's take another hit oh you can see the clearness in it that was bad so as usual with these reaction videos i like to post the comments from the previous video at least the best ones so here we go right now [Music] all right now that we're here let's just see what the clean card subreddit's been doing since uh since the last video right tnt extra expo in new york is this legit or did i waste 40 bucks [ __ ] come on what the [ __ ] let's just let's just take a look at what people say use your account to rebound or another thing [Music] well if it last time made you sick and you bought another one come on come on well let's be honest washington state bans iso isomerized tse and recreational marijuana system what is isomerized oregon to limit use of delta eight tac and other artificially derived cannabinoids really this week's lineups from com can in millis massachusetts we get the pax error okay okay friendly farms terp hogs so this is clean cards guys so don't be expecting any like fake ass bougie cards just appearing i know there's probably going to be some because people are you know still going to be questioning what card they have if it's legit or not and uh most mostly on here you're gonna see legit [ __ ] and i'm interested to see what's legit in oregon washington colorado all that stuff so i feel like these videos they uh show shed light into that you know ever more dark safety but recently learned about reagents and leeches during isomerization and when i understand the only d8 that steak will be extracted from real cannabis to avoid these leftover cans and crusts however these are sold in dispensers possibly because of height delta 9. what method which method to make delta 8 is used to get a real clean stuff and not bathroom chems or is it all blue also i don't care about your favorite brand coa unless you got tests for reagents and bleaches i like you you get it from what i understand the only thing this is the case which method to make d8 it could be clean but they did a lot of lots of cleanup work after the synthesis but not real rn no one test enough for us consumers to know and worse every time so far that brand has been independently tested it variably turns out to be low potency and contaminated to be considered clean synthesized or hemp derived d8 must have safety tests for each and every of the following solvents metals pesticides microbes mycotoxins and reagents and bleaches block to prevent the chills from the dirty pizza from telling you to smoke their dirty deed so disturb spark or whatever i think i mentioned him in the last video he's one of the guys that a lot of people are saying is a douche bag in some sort of way and um he brought up some really good valid points you know obviously d8 has to be safe when it comes out from what i've tried from delta it seems like pretty good you know this is just some stuff maybe that they write to scare people honestly i don't know but uh it is some good stuff that they brought up because obviously you would want your delta eight stuff tested as much as your delta knight and i do see that um but speaking for myself the delta eight brands that i've tried delta eight hemp moon walker serene tree all pretty good i didn't taste any you know chemically ass taste or anything it was just you know some good old distillate and stuff um but then again distillate can be you know iffy as well you know you really can't tell um but just be safe you know just be aware of certain brands and just look out for your own health at the end of the day um like i said this this guy right here that brought up the d8 very good questions but uh i'm gonna have to say that the guy that responded is a moderator of this and he's been known to be like questionable you know what i'm saying like i don't know garlic cookies life hazard ross or live hash rosin cartridge clean pleasant trees that's a [ __ ] nice name liquid trite okay yeah this is only a half gram too it's probably worth so much we're selling for so much real or fake there's the flare right there it says fake and y'all i need help bought this from the weed man and i can't tell if it's there's no lighting and it came in a plastic bag came in a plastic bag come on can i post a picture of a few raw ground cards to help try and verify authenticity and see the community's minions 99.5 percent sure they are real from this message just am super skeptical about cards given my poor health but lemonade lemon pepper from cookies in there not bad yeah i don't [ __ ] with i don't [ __ ] with half gram cartridges or i mean i do but i don't [ __ ] with companies that only sell half gram questions i think that is some [ __ ] [ __ ] and i think that that's their way of saying hey i want your money and i want you to pay for less or get less from it so to be honest anything any company that's still to this day only half grams and are selling it for 60 to 70 for a half gram [ __ ] you washington dispensary anyone tried 30 a gram put in a card in the skittles tastes like grape soda with the hint of wine that's crazy this doesn't taste like great so this is delta eight as well and honestly this is one of the smoothest hitting cartridges that i've tried are none like for distillate usually i'm coughing well most of the time when i'm hitting this is plug play and those those pods and that battery they'd be hitting of course you'll be coughing but this is very a smooth this is a very smooth experience i believe moonwalker is also featured in high times too so i don't know if that brings you some sort of uh clarity but i mean it's it's high time right cheers all right where can i get this tested i know it's fake but i'm curious just about how just i'm just curious to how bad found it on my sister come on bro what the [ __ ] is this 1.1 like what stop solvent free 97 tac like what solvent free or solvent lists and there's a difference right i believe solvent free is no solvents in it at the end product solvent list is extracting without solvents so what that's at best is going to be distillate uh making my own cards terps plus delta e can i mix tears in delhi i want to buy from natural extractions so i've read something about we don't really know how much terpenes we're supposed to be in taking so it's not really good to mix terps homemade you know you don't know the right amount you're not a scientist you know what i'm saying and most of these guys on here aren't scientists as well they ain't going to be able to tell you how much terps and all that stuff to mix delta 8 with so just be careful with that do your research uh i recently just saw that article so it could be like some brand new study or something but it says something about not taking too much or too much terpenes might be a bad thing if uh paraphrase it oil forms around oils from local dispensary here in miami truly i think i've seen truly videos and they're from florida so that should be good i don't know uh the cartridge scene in florida so if if true leaves are fake then just be careful you know what i'm saying you eat raw garlic let's see peanut butter bread sauce never seen this [Music] looks okay that looks so lame with their instagram handle right there on that packaging it looks so crafty looks good west coast cars real or fake no comment i do have some west coast wax though actually no more but did i have some very popular in my state i mean you know a couple people with them obviously improvement there's no branding and everything do you think it's fine because they're getting high i'm not sure i'm just going to pass that anyone recognize this brand as a fake oh sorry it's fake live terpenes delta 9 thc distillate cartridge live terpenes huh not live rising terpenes just live terpenes how do you spot a fake delta eight disposable my buddy runs the smoke to tell me this but there's nothing but the paper and vaping inside come on bro getting from a smoke shop albeit there probably are some delta good delta 8 products and some smoke shops but are you willing to take that risk buying it no like when you can buy it online these people these are the type of people that want it right now they can't wait they can't wait to order online they want to go to a smoke shop and get it they want a little club and get it they want to go to their buddy and get it no patience on these guys really all i have access is to black market but dispensary or so can i put that rsl on but it's working possibly it was probably going to make your butt taste like [ __ ] i bought rso before and i thought it was just regular dab i thought hey you know in a syringe it it was black as [ __ ] i dabbed it it tasted like [ __ ] rso is for the medicinal side rso means rick simpson oil and i guess that's the guy who like popularized it or made it or so so uh you basically use it to to fix your ailments you know what you're smoking on tonight that is the yocan right i believe okay cleaner trash this brand from a local dealer there yet [Music] keep fake carts it's your plug okay i'm gonna end this like if you're getting it from the plug 99 of the chance it's fake you know there's maybe a one percent chance that plug can somehow get it from from the real [ __ ] but come on from the plug from snapchat like

stop damaging my body warning chili dilly is a trained professional do not attempt anything you see on this page what is going on people of earth my name is chilly dilly back at you with another dip ass video and in today's video i foolishly told you guys on the delta egg cart review that if you gave me 15 likes that i would eat this whole [ __ ] pack of edibles right here 200 milligrams of delta eight okay you guys obviously got it literally the first day and i'm gonna stop making such easy light goals for you guys um because you guys are [ __ ] awesome obviously that's why you're killing it uh we're gonna eat all this i mean there's nothing else to say effect send me these um shout out to them i'm just doing this because why not [ __ ] it right i'm probably not gonna eat them individually so i'll see them all okay uh yeah i have eaten three delta edibles before and all it did was just make me really lazy so i imagine 10 is just gonna make me dumb lazy i'm just gonna get really tired all right well let's get these open i'm trying i'm just trying to get right into this man honestly see what the [ __ ] these look like i'm really not happy about their candy because i just don't like candy that like sour candy and [ __ ] it's not a big fan of that honestly they smell fine honestly supposed to be um [Music] strawberry mango green apple which i hate green apple blueberry razz and mystery and i already off rip see like three [ __ ] green apples so that's cool bro honestly uh let's just go ahead and get into this man if you guys are new here make sure you like

it was all candy and it was so much candy definitely go back and watch that video um there was it was just so much gummy candy and it made me sick like all that gummy candy so i'm going in here hoping to god that i don't get sick if you guys are dabbing smoking eating whatever the [ __ ] you doing to adjust the lovely thc do let me know in the comments um yeah i definitely don't recommend you eat a whole bag of edibles i definitely doubt they didn't tell me to do it obviously i doubt they'd even want me to do that but [ __ ] it the mango is good damn this kind of reminds me of those uh those scooby snacks remember the gummy scooby snacks that were super fire i mean i think you can still get them but um it reminds me a lot of that to be honest this is mystery they got little triangles on them no no no i wasn't good all right oh that's true strawberry not bad so man so if you guys have ever watched my edible challenges i'll generally just eat all these wait an hour come back to you it's gonna be the same thing all right now i was gonna roll up a joint for right now but um i think for the first hour i want to see just how i feel off these before i smoke just regular just so i can give you a clear answer and then go smoke i guess that's like the responsible thing to do i don't know i don't [ __ ] we might have to come back early and smoke all right all the edibles are [ __ ] done the mystery was garbage green apple garbage but i hate green apple if you guys like green apple let me know man that's crazy because i do not drink some water all right man we are going to come back in an hour see how we feel um i'm a little nervous to be honest because i've never eaten this many edibles on delta a um but i do feel like my tolerance is high enough it's only 200 milligrams like the whole pack is only 200 milligrams so that's why i don't really think it's that big a video to be honest so yeah all right we will be back in an hour boys all right one hour later all right boys it's been about an hour and a half now maybe a little over off of the whole bag of edibles and um you know man i will say i do feel a little high i will definitely say that i feel pretty focused

this time because it feels like I've easily it's easily almost been an hour since I've taken the drink right alright you guys so we went to prestige and they ended up being shut down so we're gonna go some but somewhere else maybe another smoke shop and maybe go home because I'm feeling [ __ ] - hi I don't like being out of my house when I'm this I I don't know about you guys but that's just me I'm probably at the our point right now you guys I'm just not feeling good I'm almost really kind of nauseous right now I shouldn't drink that much it was better when I just sipped on it throughout my day definitely do not take all that at one time I would say like what I'm feeling right now you guys is more of a body high more than anything you guys love the most intense crazy body high right now feels like when you're coming up on psychedelics it's just intense I don't know if you guys ever feel like thought on edibles but with me you guys it always hits me in my body super heavy cool wish me luck go happen bro you parked like [ __ ] damn bro how you feeling that for your boba cuz I think I'm good right now on the shopping you ready to go let's go let's go bro I was cold as [ __ ] out

part though well [ __ ] look look you guys real smallest part I don't know the last time I sat at our Park bench like this I don't get outside too often but I just wanted to update you guys a little bit on like how I'm feeling right now I'm feeling cold I'm feeling tired I wanted to knock out soon that's kind of what edibles do to me I have a hard time staying up on them I'm probably fifteen sixteen hundred milligrams deep first time in my life so forgive me if I don't finish it I might try my best to I just feel like if I finish you right now I'm gonna be knocking out way too early you

don't know what I'm doing I feel like I just want to go home right now but um yeah I'm tapping with you guys soon I feel like I'm flying right now you guys I'm only going 40 I'm so high so that felt so [ __ ] crazy I feel like I'm gonna die with this guy's driving right now it's not gonna drink the rest of this I hate the surfing bottom as a [ __ ] worst just trying to race right now damn I don't know about you guys the edibles to me feels like absolute [ __ ] tap I don't know why anybody takes them definitely not for fun I mean if I was feeling sick and I couldn't smoke or if I was an edible type of person I probably was just do it in moderation I would never do anything to it what I took today was 44 doses so pretty much one bottle is 22 servings when I ended up taking less 44 servings today you guys and I'm just feeling the effects of the first bottle right now so I feel like the second ball is still gonna hit me and I'm just gonna be floored we're on our way right now back to my

our\u00a0\u00a0 new delta 8 gummies with you guys i want to tell\u00a0\nyou how i feel when i eat them what they taste\u00a0\u00a0 like and all that good stuff i'll even walk\u00a0\nthrough what is delta 8. i do have a prior\u00a0\u00a0 video that i made that goes through what is delta\u00a0\neight so you can watch that if you don't wanna\u00a0\u00a0 hear about what the gummy bears are like but you\u00a0\nwanna go straight into the what is delta eight so\u00a0\u00a0 right now on our site we carry delta eight in two\u00a0\ndifferent flavors we've got a few other flavors on\u00a0\u00a0 the way but for right now we've got two flavors\u00a0\non the site we've got a berry white which is an\u00a0\u00a0 indica indica is really good at night for sleep\u00a0\nbut it's got all the same benefits as the sativa\u00a0\u00a0 which is really good in the daytime because it\u00a0\ndoesn't make you as drowsy the sativa comes in\u00a0\u00a0 an orange crush flavor and the indica comes\u00a0\nin a very white flavor they're both delicious\u00a0\u00a0 the whole container has 30 gummy bears in it\u00a0\nthere's 750 milligrams in each container so each\u00a0\u00a0 gummy has about 25 milligrams of delta eight\u00a0\nin it so these are the two we carry right now\u00a0\u00a0 we also have these little sample packs so if you\u00a0\ndo order anything from mypaynecenter.com and you\u00a0\u00a0 want to try delta8 but maybe you're not willing to\u00a0\nmake the commitment right now to a whole bottle of\u00a0\u00a0 delta 8 just let us know in the notes section\u00a0\nhey i want to try a delta eight sample can i\u00a0\u00a0 get a sample and we will send you a sample so\u00a0\ntoday i'm going to take a sample of the indica\u00a0\u00a0 the barry white um because about 9 30 almost 9 45\u00a0\nhere at night and i'm probably gonna try to go to\u00a0\u00a0 bed by eleven eleven thirty so this should kick\u00a0\nin way before then and we're gonna have a great\u00a0\u00a0 night's sleep so i'm gonna take this now and\u00a0\nthen i'll walk you through what is delta eight\u00a0\u00a0 okay so here we go so it's just like\u00a0\nthis okay so i'm gonna eat it it's chewy it's pretty sweet too a little sour but\u00a0\nit's like a mixture it's like a sour bear i should also note the delta eight can\u00a0\nshow up on a drug test because there is\u00a0\u00a0 thc in it not the thc that's in the\u00a0\ndelta eight like there's delta a\u00a0\u00a0 thc and then there's delta nine thc and\u00a0\ni'm going to tell you the difference so i will say the gummy bear was sweet and sour it\u00a0\nwas a good taste you could taste the berry in it\u00a0\u00a0 there is like a slight aftertaste to it like a\u00a0\num like a bitter aftertaste to it so it's not\u00a0\u00a0 as smooth as a cbd gummy where you can't taste\u00a0\nany cbd in it you definitely can taste in the\u00a0\u00a0 aftertaste that there is something in this but\u00a0\nit's not gross or overpowering or overwhelming\u00a0\u00a0 but just be aware that there is an aftertaste\u00a0\nokay so we're gonna let that seep through my body\u00a0\u00a0 it is actually 9 54 right now so we can keep\u00a0\ntime on how long it takes for this gummy bear\u00a0\u00a0 to really take impact on me so what is delta eight\u00a0\nokay so i'm gonna i'm gonna make it really simple\u00a0\u00a0 there's delta eight which is\u00a0\nwhat we're talking about today\u00a0\u00a0 and then there's weed and in weed there's thc\u00a0\nand that thc makes you high paranoid stone\u00a0\u00a0 increases your anxiety whatever it does to you\u00a0\nmay make your mouth dry it may make you hungry all\u00a0\u00a0 that stuff that that's weed thc also called delta\u00a0\n9 thc okay this is delta 8 thc the difference\u00a0\u00a0 is a carbon bond and that's what makes the what\u00a0\nmakes them different now they both have the same\u00a0\u00a0 properties to them in the sense of what they can\u00a0\ndo for you they have the same benefits per se\u00a0\u00a0 so just like when you smoke weed to relax to lower\u00a0\nyour anxiety lower your stress chill out calm down\u00a0\u00a0 maybe use it for pain relief anxiety relief\u00a0\nsleep maybe usually for nausea maybe use it\u00a0\u00a0 as an appetite stimulant delta eight will do all\u00a0\nof that for you as well but delta eight will not\u00a0\u00a0 make you high stoned increase your anxiety make\u00a0\nyou paranoid make your mouth dry but this is\u00a0\u00a0 legal and you can buy it without either a medical\u00a0\nmarijuana id or for buying it from a dealer behind\u00a0\u00a0 the garbage can or i don't know i don't know how\u00a0\npeople buy drugs these days i'm really not sure\u00a0\u00a0 um but this is legal because it comes from a hemp\u00a0\nplant so it is legal under the farm bill of 2018.\u00a0\u00a0 i should also note though that this does have\u00a0\ndelta 9 or weed thc in it less than 0.3 percent\u00a0\u00a0 because if it's more than 0.3 it's not legal\u00a0\nanymore in the united states but if it's less\u00a0\u00a0 than point three percent it is legal however\u00a0\nthat means it will show up on your drug test\u00a0\u00a0 so be careful if you are going to have these\u00a0\nokay so i'm just gonna let it sink in um and\u00a0\u00a0 i'll just keep reporting out to you guys as i go\u00a0\nthrough my process here okay y'all i had to go\u00a0\u00a0 lay down because then it started to hit me and\u00a0\ni was like oh my god so how do i feel it is now 10 36 so it's been what is that 40 minutes yeah\u00a0\nit's been 40 minutes since i took the gummy\u00a0\u00a0 um i've been watching tik tok videos\u00a0\nso probably not the best thing to do\u00a0\u00a0 if you're trying to go to sleep but uh\u00a0\ni feel relaxed i feel calm i am feeling\u00a0\u00a0 drowsy like i can feel my eyelids getting heavy\u00a0\num they started watering for a hot minute too i feel kind of like heavy if that makes\u00a0\nsense like i'm lying down and i just feel\u00a0\u00a0 heavy not fat heavy though i don't\u00a0\nknow what's going on over here but like\u00a0\u00a0 just you know like when you're sleeping and\u00a0\nyou're just dead weight yeah i feel like i'm\u00a0\u00a0 already like a dead weight like i think my body\u00a0\nis already sleeping and it's like shut up now\u00a0\u00a0 and turn this off and go to bed so i'm gonna do\u00a0\nthat i'm gonna go to sleep and then i'll report\u00a0\u00a0 back to you guys tomorrow morning how i slept and\u00a0\nhow i feel until then good night good morning so\u00a0\u00a0 i slept great uh i went to bed around i think it\u00a0\nwas like 10 30 when i stopped talking to you guys\u00a0\u00a0 i was feeling sleepy at that point i wouldn't\u00a0\nsay i felt high or stoned or euphoric but i\u00a0\u00a0 definitely felt something and i've been trying to\u00a0\nthink of the word to use to explain it but like\u00a0\u00a0 nothing was spinning nothing was dizzy but i\u00a0\ncould feel a shift in my body but it wasn't like\u00a0\u00a0 a bad shift but i knew something was happening\u00a0\nbut it wasn't like concerning or anything but\u00a0\u00a0 i just want to let you guys know that so that\u00a0\nyou don't feel that i didn't tell you that if\u00a0\u00a0 you do start to feel that it was totally normal\u00a0\num fell into a really deep sleep like i could\u00a0\u00a0 tell i was in a deep sleep according to this my\u00a0\nscore was a 95 out of 100 which was great sleep\u00a0\u00a0 um i i did i did notice that i was in such a deep\u00a0\nsleep that i usually have to wake up in the middle\u00a0\u00a0 of the night to pee um for those of you under\u00a0\n30 and don't know what that feels like enjoy it\u00a0\u00a0 because the minute you turn 30 um like at least\u00a0\nfor me when i turn 30 and now i wake up to pee\u00a0\u00a0 in the middle of the night and i had i struggled\u00a0\na little bit trying to get up because i was in\u00a0\u00a0 such a deep sleep i couldn't wake myself up to\u00a0\ngo and do that like it was like it was a fight\u00a0\u00a0 you know what i mean like my bladder was like let\u00a0\nme out and my resume my body was like no we're\u00a0\u00a0 not going anywhere so there was that and then in\u00a0\nthe morning um even at 8 am i probably could have\u00a0\u00a0 slept more um that would have given me nine hours\u00a0\nof sleep and i could have slept more but the other\u00a0\u00a0 good thing about this is like when i woke up and i\u00a0\ngot myself to wake up because of my alarm clock i\u00a0\u00a0 didn't feel groggy so like i used to take advil pm\u00a0\nand if i woke up before it was time to wake up i\u00a0\u00a0 would feel groggy i just shook this off like so i\u00a0\nam uh excited about these i think these are great\u00a0\u00a0 i'm gonna definitely use them on the weekends um\u00a0\ndefinitely do not use these before you're driving\u00a0\u00a0 a vehicle or if you have to wake up early like say\u00a0\nyou only get five six seven hours of sleep stay\u00a0\u00a0 away from these but these are like my new favorite\u00a0\nthing i cannot wait for the weekend to try one\u00a0\u00a0 of these i will be back with a daytime video on\u00a0\nthe orange crush since it's a sativa it's really\u00a0\u00a0 good for the daytime so i will be back with this\u00a0\nreview but for then i will talk to you guys later", "-OrePsULJII": "all right what's up everyone it's your boy master bling steve back again with another video today we're gonna be looking at this fake dr. zodiacs clear cart um I'm actually pretty excited to look at this because I've been wanting to get my hands on some dr. zodiacs for a while and even though I got it fake I'm okay with it because I get to show you guys how to tell a real one from a fake one um and I think these are pretty popular so I think this is a video that definitely should be made so stay tuned [Music] alright so before I go any further it seems like there's something missing let me see alright that looks a little bit better I think um I think we're looking a bit more familiar in the new setup so let's continue with the review first off this is fake packaging for dr. zodiacs clear um the dr. zodiacs clear packaging actually looks really dope this looks pretty cool but I'll show you guys were the real packaging looks like right now I reverse up you guys so I was actually no I was actually kind of wrong I was wrong that kind of wrong I was wrong when I was talking about the packaging this is what the Frosty's package looks like let me try to zoom in we can see it better the picture won't get bigger even if I do that it doesn't help but you can see that the package is the same although it does look like it comes with a sticker and it should always come with a battery that being said homie I bought it from could have taken the battery but I still think mine is a fake because it said you better because it has no battery and because it has no sticker um I think if we look up dr. zodiac frosties no not for STIs frosty I cannot spell you look up dr. zodiacs frosty it'll come up with these or like this video and I know Eric Conn did a video on his on them too um but I think the biggest thing that I want to show is a Seattle picture will zoom hopefully it's from lifted and I don't really like trust them as a source usually but can you see how thin that chimney is and how thin that see cell bottom is see cell atomizers always look like this they have a very thin chimney and a sort of fat bottom but not as fat as the one I have um to hold that ceramic coil inside that's why I really think mine's a fake because it's not an actual see cell atomizer and it's pretty easy to just brand any atomizer like another you see it all the time in fakes so yeah let me get back into the actual video now I just wanted to come and show this real quick on this box it says that there's 90 plus percent or 90 percent plus th seeing this upload a pic slash video smoking this product to win merch I don't know why they're encouraging you to flex a faced cart that's kind of [ __ ] up um but you know it has the snow cone clear @dr zodiac on the bottom and this uh california label has it it has snowmen on the side and a California label somewhere out here I know I'm sorry yeah right there California label right on the back above another government warning and frosty snow cone uh the box I'm not really a fan of it feels kind of cheap um obviously whoever had it before me was like [ __ ] with it but that's fine this is the actual cart though it has a snowman on the front and it's a Cecil cart but uh if y'all can see how thick that bar is jesus [ __ ] christ um I will say one good thing about this car or at least the guy I bought this from he was really trying to encourage me to not get this cart he I uh I was talking about he's like yo these cards honestly aren't even that good I have much better stuff are you sure you want this cart I'm like yeah I really want that dr. zodiacs card I didn't tell him I was gonna make a video on it but yeah that's why I wanted it so I could show you guys I'll go ahead and show you guys the bottom of it as you can see it's been leaking a bit so that's also a bit shitty and it says Jupiter C cell and it has a serial number on it so even though it has these three things on the bottom you can see that it has that white Oh ring which also means it's a fake um and again that bar is the biggest telltale sign anyway you know what happens next now I'm gonna actually talk on the cart and tell you guys if it's decent but uh first I'm gonna clean off the bottom so I don't mess up any of my batteries so I'll be back in a second one thing I do want to mention while I'm creating it though there's no air bubble in this cart I can't find one so I'm probably about to make one Cheers [Music] that's really interesting this cart tastes really good it almost tastes sort of like I'm trying a dessert right now if I had to describe it in my own words I would say it's like if cinnamon and nutmeg were made into like a Laffy Taffy flavor then that would be what this tastes like exactly let me take another hit Cheers so I just felt that hate in my soul but it tasted really good I'm already starting to feel a buzz and I'm getting dab sweats but I will say I haven't really smoked all day all I smoked was like 1 bowl so I might just have low tolerance right now Oh either way I'm gonna take one last hit to see if I get like a full-blown high and then I'm gonna check back in tomorrow to give you guys a full rundown of the card so one last time before tomorrow Cheers it takes really good y'all like I'll hit it through a dab cap tomorrow to show you guys how the cloud production is on this card but I'm still not even seeing an air bubble but I'm getting some really nice hits from it so positive opinions of this dr. zodiac card so far and I'll check back in tomorrow see ya all right I'm back what's up so I've spent a whole day night with this cart now and I definitely have some good opinions of it but first off let's take a hit Cheers so first off the biggest thing I'm realizing with this card is that it hits harsh as hell like usually when it comes to some cards when it they're fakes I can still hit them and like still feel sort of smooth hit um let's talk about those TKOs that I just got or even some of the dank vapes they're not as harsh as like this cart is and well sometimes I would think that makes it a real cart because maybe the wax is just hitting me harder the fact that this atomizer is fake it's not a C cell it's a Jupiter which is owned by C cell but it's still not the same kind of atomizer is that dis OD acts use paired with like how much this cart just tastes like flavoring versus actual wheat really really leads me to believe it's a fake which makes sense because like I said homie was really trying to talk me out of getting this cart um the hints are very very harsh my throat kills after taking one and I would say it takes around three to four hits to get high like not even a buzz a full high two hits for a buzz um but that being said the highs on this cart are kind of like weird where you feel sort of creative and talkative and you like I don't know I really just wanted to like play some minecraft or like talk to my sister talk to friends um but I didn't really like feel energized enough to actually like do anything so definitely a perfect night stream but I would not suggest this for a daytime use at all um if you hit the cart a bit too much it will put you right to sleep uh um actually the reason this video is a bit late was because when I was testing this cart this morning it knocked me out for like five hours even though I set my alarm to be able to wake up and film this video on time so I'm sorry about that but yeah overall I would give this car a 7 out of 10 I would say a 7 out of 10 because of how harsh this cart hits and because when compared to other carts that I've had it doesn't feel like it's knocking any of them out the park it just feels a bit above average all on all the biggest unfortunate thing about this car is that it's either average or slightly above average than most of the other carts I've hit and it's below average when it comes to the smoothness when I suggest a fake doctor zodiacs cart I honestly can't really suggest these in good conscience because I don't know if it's hitting harsh because of chemicals that it's cut with or if it's the bad atomizer but either way I don't really trust bad atomizers because I know that sometimes if they use metal coils they can leak chemicals into your wax and then you're just harming yourself each time you take a hit so I wouldn't suggest one of these because of how harsh it is and because I can't personally figure out where that harshness is coming from let's go ahead and sesh I'm gonna be using my broken temper piece I don't remember if I told you all the story but um I had this on one of my cabinets and CJ jumped on top and knocked a plate onto the piece so it broke the stem off and I had to hot glue it back I'm scared to clean this piece so I'm only using it with like carts and abs um because I don't want to mess up the hot glue that I put on it but yeah we're just gonna be using this broken classic piece and Cheers my part was dead or my battery turned off so now Cheers [Music] [Music] cheers again all right let me get my lungs a little second during cover then we'll take another to both side of that hamper pineapple I'm going to take this last cart or dab kappa rip through the paint can i got from daily high club so cheers [Music] I'm gonna give this card a little bit of time to reset and then I'll take a blinker and that'll be the end of the video before I take the blinker though I just want to say thank you for watching if you made it this far please like and subscribe leave a comment if you think that this is a fake or a real card because honestly I'm having a lot of trouble trying to figure it out for sure I think it's a fake because of how thick the chimney is the harshness of it and the flavoring but unfortunately I haven't had first experience with one of these so if you're watching this and you have please let me know if your experience sums along the lines of mine or if you've had a different one either way I'm master blinky thank you for watching this video I appreciate it and I'll catch y'all later [Music] [Music]", "-jOkdKPS1xE": "[Music] marijuana I got some weed it's a cart it's called Rove I'll not have you heard of cart before it looks like full blue you see 89% looks like it's gonna take me two hands open this up so let me put my magic touch to this and I'll get right back to you she's even got the name on it glue so came with this [ __ ] that's pretty cool came with his rubber [ __ ] here that's pretty cool all right try this [ __ ] unless looks root dude definitely pull on money in this cart this is very very nice having it haven't tasted it yet yeah your face fantastic can't get no air there's something wrong it takes a lot to hit it I don't know it's because my battery is so weak I mean once I finally get a taste it's really supreme this is this is definitely cartel level these are really good this is supreme you might be a stronger battery you might need stronger battery serious oil this I'm a it works it's just it just tastes so much more to hit this grade my cartel that's good I think my camera died no no didn't I well like I said it's really good I would get this absolutely absolutely we get this yes it tastes delicious like I said you might have to get a stronger battery I have to get a pretty strong battery to use this but is mmm oil yes yes go to that test you know that bubble don't move mm-hmm all right that's it that's it for me guys just take it easy [Music]", "GIXatapwuKc": "it's going on Gus Reaper bees then coming to you today with a kind of a different type of video what I'm going to be doing is I got a fake TKO extract cards I guess as you can see by the title now my original plan was to make this video solely on how to spot the differences and real and fakes two issues with that though when there isn't really not that meaning things to look for it's from me research and like I kind of thought I was gonna be like ningke's a little bit where I could show you four or five different things that you know look forward to help you out but it's TKO it's pretty straightforward to the point I will leave a link to what Realty care cart looks like I am getting a real TKO card he's gonna take about seven days maybe ten to get here Lou tell me five but I will soon so the main thing you want to do is it needs to come in a box and will come in this box with the disposable battery I have a black tip but then like I said this isn't real I'm just saying it will have a black tip and if you're not getting that it the odds of it being real is very very very very slim because they started doing that I believe in May and I'm sure that your ear plugs telling you that he's got a hookup at the source and it's just this continued packaging but they're they're good I'm sure that's what he's telling you if you call him out on it but this is the issue that arises with this I'm trying to keep it pretty simple and not make this video over over complicated or over long but I believe these plugs believe they're plugs you know what I'm saying I believe the people that you your neighborhood plug you're getting these from their plugs by telling them hey I'm under straight from the source in Cali Colorado I know people straight from the company trust me these are hooked up bro they're legit and they probably believe it and it just gets to a point where it's like so many people is convoluted this card game bro it is crazy and it's fairly simple to even I mean I don't know man it's it's crazy out there guys but when it comes to this the price point to something you need to look for if you're getting a car for 20 bucks a pop if you get 10 or 30 bucks a pop if you get however many you get or hell even 40 and you can go to a website and say that those cards are $40 for like a half gram and 60 bucks for a gram 35 for a half gram 64 gram you think you're doing has that much of a connection that he can get you a gram of that same cart for Wax cart for 20 bucks right that's pretty crazy but people believe it and it's like so that's the two main things to look at for these TK is I'm going on a little tangent here but things that come in a box with the disposable pen battery and if you're not paying what it says on a website or a dispensary close to it it's not going to be real I mean but here's the thing this is fake but this is a good fake now there's fake real fakes and black markets this would be fake what I mean by fake is this is what people can buy these packaging online for cents or dollars depending on what brand they get they can fill it with their own oil and they will sell it to you and that's what I mean by fake I'm not counting these people that's putting fake things and to make you think you're getting THC when I say fake I mean I'm counting everything - guys I'm counting the dude that's out here in his garage mixing a half a gram of wax with some liquidiser and selling you some liquidy [ __ ] that's turning round and 15 hits in or it's burning out in 15 hits I'm counting that dude all the way up to these people with dispensaries that's making their own [ __ ] but no man in carts I'm counting from the very bottom of the totem pole up to the very top of the totem totem pole and that's what I mean by fake and that's what's so dangerous about these because you do not know what you're getting until you actually get them now you can do the oil check the oil under the old and then there's ways to trick you and deceive you but so for example this is the card I've been smoking it I have some good things to say about this car don't get me wrong I just want to talk about the fake aspects of everything and what you need to watch out for it so when it gets to the point that you're getting fake cards right you have to and again fake means that it's in a fake companies it's not really from the company someone bought the packaging I don't mean the product inside is fake um the oil is what you have to check for and like I said they can they can mess with that even a little bit to try to deceive you but this one even I've been smoking on this one constantly for 24 over 24 hours and I have smoked other cards so I'm not saying I just only smoke this one got smoke this one pretty heavily and it's hauling down that much now normally if it was not a real legit dispensary card I would be well on half my now so even though this is fake I didn't want to shut the dude out who made it even though I don't know him for saying this dude has some quality all I thought it was gonna be diluted I really did I thought it was gonna be diluted and I was a little upset about that but the chairs by the way no mutt the pool is not amazing it's good but it's not amazing it's like it gets clogged up a little bit I don't I'm not a fan of that but the taste on this guy's whoever tarp this up tarps it up good because I mean the wedding cake flavor is incredible the Sour Diesel is amazing too and but this that just because this one is good and I'm going to tell you guys I don't want to get too far into this and like I said I'm not promoting this I'm just giving you examples of what to look for if you're not 18 21 whatever it is please leave the channel but shares we'll talk about this a little bit because I'm going to tangent now this is like seven minutes and this is Tim long already I don't like the pull of it but the flavor is great the hog is great I mean [ __ ] like I say dumb dang exciting about five six it's these three whoever made these men I don't know who you are you'll never see this but I have to out of good consciousness say props to you bro if everybody that made that made their own all and put them in these carts did it the way you did it my friend we would have no issues but give me a second I'll be right back I want to show you something else boys now I never had an example really before of what those pesticide carts where boys I had them before in the past about thrown away and this was months ago my friend did recently give me an exotic that was all it was black element just showed on the channel but I don't even remember what the [ __ ] I did with it honestly I think I'll [ __ ] I don't know I don't know where it's at so I went out and got another one no I didn't pay for this this is one that my friend gave me he actually made this himself so this is the ones boys that you want to be careful of no and it's not that he really even did a horrible job in making this it's just that he didn't make her up you see how liquidy that is and you see how it's already changing colors and you use liquid wax liquid out there and this is that hot dog water boys it's not going to show up as bad as it actually is on cam I don't think I'm not even going to hit that but and as long as you keep in the card it's not gonna be harmful but now this is what I'm telling you about this is the [ __ ] so if everybody made made the card selected TKOs like I was showing you guys then it really wouldn't be a problem like that you know I'm saying but people make them like this - and it's I need to hit it to get that bubble going to really show you guys I'm not gonna hit it like I said that's just so I don't even know what I did with my decal court now so let's hit this one this is a this is a dank something voice so cheers someone in this video um I'm sorry it was all over the place I wanted to make it is kind of educational as possible on the on the TKO courts but like I said two main factors is and it's coming a box disposable battery and the pricing on it obviously and aside from that I'm we'll be back with some brass knuckles I can show you two guys how to spot brass knuckles I went on that real TKO court to show you guys I also got some other different brands of cards so I really want that familiar with that are coming in that's some reviews on those as well but also hey congrats to mr. and bling see for 1000 subs this one's for you buddy", "MljAks08IKk": "so today i'm going to be doing two it's really one review of one product but two separate strains of the product it is going to be quality control thc and these are drops they're tinctures it says on here terps i don't know why they're calling them terps [Music] but this one is i got maui wowie and i have golden pineapple now the golden pineapple is a hybrid the maui is a sativa and the maui wowie i prefer the maui over the golden pineapple this is something the maui the sativa is something you're going to want to take during pretty much during the day later on in the evening and this is something that you probably would take later in the evening closer to not i'm not really a fan of i'm not a fan of anticas or indica dominant strains i like the uplifting and relaxing feeling not the stoned out of your mind feeling um this the maui is amazing i was taking these i got to get another bottle i ran out of the maui but i was taking one about a little drop i'll show you how much you should take you want to take it about i took it sorry taking about an hour after i woke up and then after that son of a [ __ ] it shows you the recommended dose on here i can't even get this [ __ ] open with one hand the recommended dose is like a fourth of the dropper that's pretty much what i stuck with it takes about 30 minutes to kick in and with the maui you will notice a calming uplifting feeling now the golden pineapple i think it's more of a anthic dominant it feels that way anyway so you take it and about again about 30 minutes you feel it but it it it's more of a couch like type of feeling for me and i do not like that they have grape ape i was gonna get grape eight but it's a pure indica and i can't i'm not even gonna [ __ ] with it but 100 would highly recommend this because i'm going to tell you some of the the great benefits of it for me is i noticed that people that normally got on my nerves didn't get on my nerves as much whenever i was whenever i had that in my system so i was able to be around people where i was not in my head as much meaning i wasn't like over analyzing every little thing that was happening or that did happen or that could happen and i was just able to i guess step back and enjoy things more now uh another pleasant side effect of this is it does not this is going to sound odd to say but it it kind of it kind of decreases your appetite i have noticed like it doesn't give you much use it doesn't it even makes you not spill hungry and another bro amazing side effect for me for me was it i'll take kratom i have kratom reviews coming up and i was taking too much credit my thought i still think i was because i was taking like an ounce to an ounce and a half a day and now once i started taking this i was able to get a three ounce bag to last me like five six days so we cut my kratom usage in half so i'm definitely going to pick up the um i'm definitely going to grab more of the maui wowie definitely going to grab more than maui now the golden pineapple i still have [ __ ] i still have about three fourths of a bottle left with this so i am going to use that before i get more maui and i do want to say these retailed for 29.99 30 even at my local dispensary or botanical shop i have noticed uh with a lot of these products that you can order them offline for cheaper as opposed to going into your local dispensary or botanical shop the only issue with that is by the time you wait for it and you cover shipping you're paying about the same price unless you get a large quantity so just ordering one of these offline if you don't have them in your area go ahead and order them offline because you'll pay the same price as you if you walked into your local dispensary slash botanical shop but if you get a high quality of things definitely definitely order online or look around your area to try to find better deals because uh i have something that i'm going to going to get today that i'm going to review and talk about how i ended up switching dispensaries botanical shops then i had to drive an extra 20 minutes but the price the quality the uh just the friendliness i guess you could say of this place drew me there i still [ __ ] with a shout out to advanced botanicals still [ __ ] with those guys uh but this new shot man uh hook i mean they hook you up they're super chill super nice they give you samples they uh will mix [ __ ] up for you they will make i mean it's just amazing so today i'm going to get a kilo of white elephant white endo and white hulu mixed and then i'm getting some delta 10 thc which i'm going to review on here probably in the upcoming days i'm planning on getting the delta 10 cart and then i'm getting the cookies cart delta 8 cart it's it's a knockoff cookies it looks slack to me it's called cake i think or something like that i have to do a little bit more research on that but i've tried it from a friend and it was amazing so my my last um final say on this is it is wonderful definitely get it definitely check it out it's kind of like for micro dosing something to help you micro dose so you're not taking huge uh so let's just say you've got an edible and you want a micro dose and edible it's hard to it's hard to get an exact dosage unless you get ones that are you know like 25 or 15 milligrams per cube or per gummy and even then um you might take it and wait 45 minutes and not feel anything then you take a half of one and then they kick in together and you're you're you're you're done for the day or maybe the next two days edibles are hard to micro dose

today's tuesday man and we're moving up on this ship man shipband's coming up march 27th um and like i said we're still not 100 sure other than the fact that we know that the end consumer is going to have an issue getting uh stuff shipped to them through usps fedex or the postal service however we do know that the one way to get around uh this shipman is to be a business have a business license and get wholesale accounts now for you folks out there that don't know you can easily apply for an ein with the irs which is totally free and get a business license or you know if you've got these convenience stores or these vape shops around your area and you'd like you know go ahead and combat this uh vape band from the get-go because really the vape band was designed to it was not designed to touch delphi really what it was designed to do was to touch these e-cigs and it was designed to put the onus on store owners to check um the ids of these guys coming in and getting these uh vape products but with way the way they wrote the law of and they stuck this in the pork of the stimulus bill the first year um but the way they wrote the law it actually extends out and touches everything bait and so as of march 27th um i've heard march 27th april first april 26th but on this channel we're going to talk about march 27th is the closest day uh you know uh you know prepare for the worst and hope for the best um but the the but the deal is that uh you guys can get those get those people to get wholesale accounts contact me at 334-830-8151.com let them get a wholesale account uh if they've never had deltae products in their store before they will not have created any bad habits by starting you know to get stuff that we've reviewed on this channel uh but if they have delta e products in their store um we'll send them out free samples man and they'll find out that what we're talking about on this channel is the real deal and they'll also find out that the prices are much better than what they're getting from those distributors off the truck you take that m a smoke shop or any of these uh just you know these local convenience stores around here they're all dealing with the same distributor and they all have basically the same stuff in their shop and that distributor doesn't know anything about delta a doesn't know anything about cbd he's just looking for a mass-produced product and that comes at a price of low quality and and you take uh you know her down there at the mma smoke shop she's got everything that she ever got off those watered-down delta a carts off that distributor truck for 35.99 and you got and she's got delta farms and blue moon in there for 34.99 personally it wouldn't matter to me if it was 45.99 because like i said before the purpose of this channel is to find the best lda products we can and um obviously you know my goal is to hope you know is the hope that you guys don't make the same mistakes i can if you see a you know you see me do a review on here it's a crappy product hopefully you guys will gravitate towards something that's a little bit better so moving on from that um uh talking about just letting you guys know i got a letter from a guy today or uh talking on youtube and he's over in the uk and we're talking back and forth and he's trying to get some stuff shipped over to him and he asked about this notice to law enforcement now there's a lot of companies out there that are putting this notice to law enforcement in their um in their packages when they send out usually it's a piece of paper as you can see blue moon is a little bit of cardboard box but basically this is just a letter to the law enforcement man letting them know uh that this is a hemp product that is you know it's totally legal totally illegal to buy over the counter to any at any business in the united states i think there's a couple states that actually do regulate it like three or four five i believe but either way uh the majority of the states this is this is legal all the way around and i think those states that that don't have it in theirs because they haven't figured out how to regulate it yet but the fact of the matter is the 2018 farm bill makes delta eight a hemp derived product totally 100 federally legal okay and that's what this card is and for you folks out there that are riding around and i'm guilty of this too i've been preaching this for quite a while you should have one of these in each one of your vehicles just throw in the glove box um you can throw in your centerpiece or whatever the case is uh the ones that are pieces of paper like i said you go to my my site which is whatever guy shop.com and you can go down into the blog and you can find notice law enforcement and download that okay and just keep a copy of that in your wallet man you know if you're walking around hanging out and then it's let's be honest man if i was to roll up on you and you were smoking you know you were vaping this or you were hitting on any of this stuff here i know for a fact you know i at least in my mind i think that you were smoking pot so let's be honest man in a cool way now and again this might not save you you know i understand this is a market employee but you know but why not try it you know what i mean it may save you some trouble at least at least add a little bit of uh uh you know genuine uh what you're telling is the truth when they pull you over and they get this we had a guy out in north carolina got pulled over for and i haven't still heard the end of this yet by the way but i got a message from a guy over north carolina he gets pulled over and because his delta farm stuff smelled like him and they thought it was uh and they thought it was weed they took it from him and they were going to test it for uh i guess stealth and i thc i'm assuming that he's okay because it obviously doesn't have any delta knight toc in it um but the fact of the matter is it smells like it it looks like it and you and it does the same effect some of the same effects as delta intc so why wouldn't it be that you know so if you're a cop you know i get it but if you're if you're the end consumer man it's just cool man to keep one of these in your car man unless you just be safe all the way around okay so as you guys know i'm in my location down here in pine hill alabama and we've been remodeling this place for a while uh running up on a deadline for myself you know basically and like i told you guys before i've been doing a lot of handyman work i've run hand-in-hand business and i had gotten away from that recently uh more or less you know doing stuff online but as i need the money to remodel this store here i've been doing um some handyman work and so the lady missed carol smith over in sweetwater alabama that i've been working for the last couple weeks and i've got some other work scattered around but she's she's my main focus of work i've been looking for some kitchen cabinets for a couple weeks and um i had went to meridian and bought some kitchen cabinets and they just weren't the right ones uh you know i ended up keeping them from my store but the fact that matters i ended up running over montgomery alabama um uh yesterday to pick up uh a drawer set and another kitchen cabinet for her and was at home depot over on east boulevard in montgomery alabama now when i left when i went in there i had a certain amount of money that i was going to spend and i ended up getting the drawer cabinet for like half off because it had this little damage on it that i could easily fix and so i was you know when i walked out i was kind of stoked i actually had extra money in my pocket the first thing i did was got on and started looking for vape shops so the first place i went to i ended up stopping at the only place i ended up stopping at because i got what i needed right there at haiti's apes uh this place is a heavy base in montgomery alabama so 505026 vaughan road uh the phone number is 334-398-8691 i went in there yesterday and i walked in and immediately somebody said hey welcome to heady vapes and so i got in there and i got to talking around and there was two guys in there one was a big round one was a skinnier guy i could tell that the bigger guy was really not happy with me asking questions that i was asking i was probably asking some questions uh that were probably more designed for the owner i just felt like you know with them being working in the store that they might have a little bit more knowledge on it i think the one question i asked him was if he had because they actually have their own brand of delta eight in that place and i was really interested in that because as i said before we're talking about this talking about this vape man and all that coming up you know i wanted to go in and see if they had some flowers and vapes and stuff like that and i actually ran across some good stuff um so i was asking you know what i asked you was i said if you had one product to put forward and you know you know for your brand what would it be and of course the guy was a little bit edgy about it now the other guy he was extremely knowledgeable um both of them were knowledgeable but one guy i think was a little bit uh you know and i recognize it because i get it myself had a little bit of anxiety about me asking me questions and stuff like that i get it man because i'm in the same boat that's why i do the uh delta eight in the first place and i apologize for that um but the other guy uh actually the first guy that i talked about that i thought maybe was getting a little anxious to be asking questions he introduced me uh to their flower they have they have their own flower at uh heady vapes in montgomery alabama uh this one is the kush and then one is the diesel they don't have it's not og kush it's just kush and diesel what i did was they had one gram uh cups like this for ten dollars a piece and i was able to pick each of those out because that's what he recommended and then the other guy apparently he might be the vapor out of the group he was the one that recommended this earthy now uh vape card lemon skunk vape card that i got so uh this is their brand and heady vapes now i don't know if they have any um wholesale accounts i don't know if they're doing any mail order i know they don't have a website um i i go into these stores and i wonder you know what they're thinking about you know it's almost like they're trying to hide a secret but the fact you know how you know secrets bro i mean here's the deal if you had the secret to cancer why would you hide it i mean my but i you know everybody thinks i got like corn on the market you know you could fill these up in your own backyard if that's what you wanted to do folks so you're not cornering a mark or anything like that um he's got this guy here man this earthy now is a really good product um there's a couple issues about it that i don't know i can tell obviously that he's not trying to ship these out he's probably not trying to get any further than what he's got going on that little corner market he's got going on um i i you know i think that's a a mistake you know by not branching out that's just my opinion um i'm gonna try to contact this guy later on and find out if he's got wholesale accounts any type of affiliate things going on like that because uh really what i found was between these two flowers um these are really good flowers that they've got infused with delta a okay and this car is a really good car before i even made it to the interstate i knew i had a good car uh as you can see it doesn't have any coas on it okay but um i'll read the back of it here and it says this is earthy now and it contains less than point three percent delta intc uh for ages 21 and over do not operate machine or vehicle while under the influence of this product consult a healthcare professional before using effects of hemp products may be delayed after two hours do not consume more than once every 12 hours this product may cause you to fail a drug test that's true all right and if you look on the side it's uh says lemon skunk and then the other side is from cannabinoid rich organic hemp but again we don't have any uh any milligrams of delta atc we don't have any coas on or anything like that um there's uh really nothing else on here it's just uh in a sense i mean other than the fact that this is a really [ __ ] good car this almost looks like a garbage like a like a gas station car like if i had walked into a gas station and saw this i wouldn't buy this at all um so the packaging is a little innocuous um i think that they could probably do something better with the packaging but that doesn't take away from what's inside this car man this is a really really good card the only down draw the cart that i saw um that i as you can see i've used i'll put my hand up behind it it's got a nice gold tint you can see there's quite a bit out of it because i've been vaping on it um you know all day yesterday or at least half a day yesterday and you know and some this morning um and i've baked on it pretty good uh it's a really viscous liquid as you can hold it over i'll hold it over where you guys can see um and obviously it's not moving hand behind it again this is a white ceramic tip with a metal core uh these look like viton seals um and this and let me tell you something the little skunk's got like a like a earthy lemon um almost like like a pine tree set next to a lemon tree like like if you could combine those smells that you know that that taste um that aftertaste that's what you get with this lemon scum but the effects man the effects are like way way up there um these are this is right up there with delta farms right after a blue moon um as a matter of fact um i would i would suggest to say that this is probably a little bit you know as far as like delta farms goes you know they got that totally they kind of lend towards more the the earthy flavors and then you got blue moon that kind of lends towards more the the discrete buyer this one sits slam in the middle because you got the earthy and the in the in the like fruity added together in in one cart and um this the effects are extremely good the only down draw that i saw this card is like after a while when i vape on it it did the tube in the middle did get a little bit restricted but it never got stopped up so and i'm going to continue to vape this and obviously when we do the weekly app on saturday maybe i'll have a little bit more information if i get down towards the end of the car that's had any issues or anything like that that's kind of what the weekly rap is designed for this is a really good car like i said you guys can contact teddy vapes over at 5026 vaughn road in montgomery alabama the phone number is 334-398-8691 you guys give him a call see what he's about and have that and tell that dude that you saw his uh reviews on the whatever channel on the whatever guy and that you want a code of whatever to get some percentage off when you walk in that store down there or possibly um get to the point like i said i've got this uh cush in this diesel and i will tell you this the kush is a really good because i've already had some of my pipe i'll do a review on it either tomorrow the next day these are really good delta eight infused uh hip flower i told you before um i this i probably rank this right up there with the moon rocks of uh hometown heroes so we'll talk about that later on i didn't open up the um the diesel yet but uh because i wanted to wait for the end but i couldn't wait to do the kush um so i'll talk to you guys about that probably tomorrow hey folks it's tuesday it's whatever guys signing off i told you guys to stick around the end i'll tell you how you can win yourself a brand new bottle of these nasa softgels from over at leafystock.com don't forget you can go to leafystock.com use code whatever to get these soft drills all day long for 20 off but borrowing that on cinco de mayo uh we're going to be giving away one of these nasa delta eight soft gels 15 milligram there's 50 in a bottle beginners ray on may 5th hey folks whatever got signed off because whatever me i hope everybody's having a great week see ya", "xQexZcgxxYM": "alright guys so basically fake carts are pretty bad for you okay [ __ ] but we've been knew that okay yeah but they're also harmful for your lungs though okay yeah and I've been knew that too alright [ __ ] did you know that they're actually killing people now well no more did you know that 60 to 70 percent of black market carts are contaminated with a chemical that no one should actually be inhaling I mean nah I didn't know that either but like or that as of September 11 2019 450 cases of pulmonary disease have been attributed to the use of black market carts yeah I bet you didn't know that I bet you also didn't know that there are now six deaths that are reported as a result of these carts so just go ahead sit down and watch this video because I'm gonna be talking about some important [ __ ] in it so yeah roll the [ __ ] intro alright fine so why is blinks he's sitting in his hot ass room a 90 degree weather yelling about why you guys shouldn't use fake cards well first off I do want to say that I personally have stopped really using them I don't hit them unless I like have to do a review of them and then I'll either throw them out or give them away with the warning that I don't want to use this myself I hope you don't use it but you know some people just don't care anyway I know that fake hearts have been affecting me I can feel it oh now that I've stopped really using them and I really just smoked lead and abs at this point I've gotten so much better being able to take hits of weed before quitting cards I couldn't even hit weed you all have seen it on this channel it's been held for me oh and I always thought that it was just weed itself that was messing with me so I thought oh maybe hearts are better oh but after quitting them or at least not using them as heavenly as I used to I have noticed such improvement with my own lungs oh it's great honestly once I gave Princess crying so anyway first off I do want to talk about all the vitamin E acetate stuff that has been going around the internet lately I went through a lot of websites did a lot of research took a lot of notes so I'm just gonna try to get my best to explain to you guys in terms I was able to understand I'm not gonna be talking down to y'all because I know you are intelligent and I just want to be honest with you guys from my own experience because that's what this whole channel is based off is my experiences with things and my opinion though so anyway let's actually get into this so first off what is vitamin E acetate vitamin E acetate is a diluting agent that's usually used for very heavy oils such as THC wax but the thing about vitamin E II acetate is that it started out and was mainly used for cosmetic purposes for like soaps and topical ointments and [ __ ] ever since 2000 actually people have been saying that they've been inhaling it and getting sick from it people put topicals around their nose and after inhaling all the fumes they were getting what is called the BOE pneumonia that's what's showing up again with the people who are smoking these fake cards 5 people in North Carolina were actually found to have lippy white pneumonia which is when fat from oils gets into your lungs and gets stuck there the way that's happening is the fact that vitamin E acetate is an oil that is never supposed to be inhaled but why do we as donors have to worry about vitamin E acetate the reason we have to wear is because the people who supply cards to our black market they're really just trying to make the most money they can obviously it's a business it's a very booming business so people are gonna be trying to make money any way they can it's sort of throwing our health away because they don't care we're just dollar signs to them your plug might may or may not care about you but half the time your plug isn't even making the cart see selling you you know when you're buying these carts that have this vitamin e acetate in them and you are inhaling them you're inhaling stuff that you're not supposed to inhale you're inhaling oils that are not supposed to be in your lungs if people got sick from inhaling it through their nose imagine us who are actually just taking the [ __ ] to our lungs and exhaling it again it's terrible for you what's very very unfortunate is that three of the biggest manufacturers of diluting agent sport arts have been found to have high amounts of despite of mini acetate stuff in there diluting agents and it's even said from them that around sixty to seventy percent or fifty million carts on the black market probably have this chemical in them that we're not inhale that's a big reason why everyone you see on YouTube on Instagram like even in legal states is telling you do not buy cars from black market only buy them from license dispensaries the reason they do that is because license manufacturers can only sell to license dispensaries and delivery services if you're buying on black market you have no idea what you're actually getting and it could really be anything [Music] all right that there we go brand-new hey you hey you you prepubescent teenage boy you wanna buy some drugs oh yeah yeah you you you want to buy a clerk yeah buy a car what's in it what strain oh it's so asparagus oh gee you is that good shoes from Cali merica I get my ship [ __ ] I get my [ __ ] ship from Cali bro all straight all straight good [ __ ] good quality Cali cards all [ __ ] like like people be saying like yo yo yo [ __ ] fake but I'll be like nah sorry [ __ ] from Cali like I'm telling you man it's called good I won't hit it myself believe you want to hit it go for it oh that sounds dope how much yeah so because that car is a high quality in from Cali I'm gonna be charging you around like 80 bucks for it that's just how much it is like that's a good price I promise is from Kathy okay $50 I have that I saved up like three weeks oh dang alright here's your cut whoa a cart [Music] oh [ __ ] where's a little okay I guess so the fact that we're buying these cards because we either have no choice which is my still own problem like I still cannot get legit carts anywhere so I have to still buy black-market I know it's that way with a lot of you guys if you're watching this video and even if it's not and you live in a legal state I would implore you to actually start trying to go to dispensaries and buying hurts it your health is worth the extra markup um and you at that point have an opportunity that a lot of us do not so just take advantage of it you know so a big thing I'm seeing in the news is that in New York Governor Andrew Cuomo just grouped ecigs and THC vapes into one a nice trying to ban flavor vapes for everyone I think that is probably one of the dumbest decisions ever and just pretty much shows how out of touch politicians can be when it comes to black market cannabis or just cannabis in general faint juice itself is not something that you really have to worry about so it upsets me that they're grouping ecigs and eliquid with THC vape and THC concentrates because we're not getting the help that we need when it comes to regulation that way they're just trying to ban a bunch of stuff under a big umbrella instead of looking at the actual problem and trying to fix it but the biggest problem is is that cannabis isn't legal for everyone so it cannot be regulated it's hard to [ __ ] regulate the cannabis market because there are no government standards for it legal states have created their own standards and they're trying their best but for the rest of the country who wants to partake in this medicine it's hard for us to try to figure out what's safe what's not safe what's convenient what's not convenient what's legal and illegal it's a lot to have to worry about so it's a big reason I understand why carts are as popular as they are they're convenient they don't smell they're easy to hide there's so many benefits to them it's a real shame honestly that the whole market is getting flooded with this terrible [ __ ] as I said in my intro as of September 11th when I wrote all of my notes and the day before I'm recording this 450 cases of pulmonary disease which is lung disease tied to these black-market carts and six deaths I'm seeing a lot of memes about like people are getting all up in arms about lay six deaths from vaping but I don't really think they understand the severity of it where it's not just six people died from vaping it's six people dying from a market that is flooded with poison at this point a lot of reason why people including me are now saying don't smoke fake hearts it's just because we want you guys to be safe that's all as a youtuber I feel like it is my job to give you guys what is an educated opinion and to steer you guys in the right direction I do my best to do that and I don't want any of you guys to get hurt because I care about every one of you who are watching this video even if I don't know you personally I still care about you as a fellow as a fellow stoner or just a fellow enthusiast for cannabis you know so the three companies that are the biggest perpetrators in this whole situation are Hunnicutt uber thick and pure diluting I tried to look up all of these companies to find any information on them Hunnicutt seems like it's been used because I can't find anything on it except for on eBay here and I Luton as well I can't really find a lot of stuff on these are all used in our black market carts and they're all very bad for you and as I said 60 to 70 percent of all of our carts have this [ __ ] in them all of these companies have been offered have been served subpoenas which means they're all under investigation right now and of all of the cards that the CDC has been testing now um I think they have of around a thousand samples but 10 out of the first 18 that they tested have come back with this vitamin e acetate in them I've personally really stopped using fake cards I'm about to show you why but I'll explain it real quick I tried doing that 100 hits challenge for my 2,000 subscribers special it was gonna be something I was really excited about I got around 90 hits in I'm not even gonna front oh I ended up losing like 20 hits of footage but I scrapped the video and have all of the footage on my computer still a big reason why I stopped hearts after that challenge was because I threw up nine times oh I smoked three different cards and I smoked weed during that challenge out of those three cards I Green nine times of those nine times two times were from a doctor zodiac spake part and seven times I green because I was smoking on a damn list card it was a strawberry Devils curry and even in the video I went back and watched my review of it and wondered why I gave it a 7 out of 10 I am kicking myself for that review I almost want to delete it because I do not suggest that buzz anymore I don't [ __ ] with them I do not take them oh I have a review coming out of them next Monday where I even say I don't like them anymore oh but i'ma show you guys the footage of this because for me I think cannabis should make you feel happy it should make you feel comfortable it should just make you feel good and at one point during that challenge I literally was sitting down and just thought I feel disgusting I do not want to continue this and I hate the fact that cannabis made me feel that way and I don't want anyone else to have to feel that way because of cannabis because I think it is so important oh I think Andrew Cuomo is a [ __ ] jackass for grouping eliquid and a THC liquid together because this is a very real problem and trying to attack joules and [ __ ] again is not gonna save any of us Oh so if you guys are okay with seeing a bit of gross Ness I'm going to show you guys probably the worst parts of that challenge so you guys can know why I'm telling you to please stop smoking cards but if you're still not convinced after that I can't really change your opinion you know but either way let's get into that alright so Loki another reason I want to do this challenge is because I really don't know if hitting fake hearts this often is very very harmful I'm gonna find out um before you all are in my comments saying blink see why the [ __ ] are you smoking fake cards do you not care about yourself honestly no but hear me out I smoked around probably 20 hits every time I'm just like recording a video um I know I don't show all of the hits but like while I'm recording that's a lot of hits or if I'm like making gameplay videos I'll hit this thing around 20 times anyway so I'm used to smoking this much it's not really gonna like kill me or anything I don't think but um this is sort of like a live excites experiment for real we're gonna find out if fake arts are terrible for you I think this one is bad I really don't like hitting this car I might actually not hit it much more depending on how it makes me feel so I will have to waste a lot of that live card but for now we're just gonna soldier on with this [Music] [Music] I have a fake card I have a bunch of fake hearts what do I do with them um I mean I can show you what I would do with the cards right now actually let's go do that alright so the gag took a bit longer than I really expected it to but uh basically I'm about to just run over all these fake cards so yeah let me go ahead and do that I just I feel like it'd look cool [Music] can I just say I ran over these [ __ ] around three four times and this one is still okay I think this one is yeah [ __ ] dab what is still okay and this other dank babes still okay so uh I think I'm gonna end up running over these ones again but uh yeah these ones broke so that that made the guy work a little bit let's try and see if I can get these ones to break - [ __ ] these carts alright so now we're doing it take two of running over these carts again [ __ ] fake cards and let's do it alright it's a fun story my family came outside to ask me why I was just backing up and then going for you get in our driveway I explained to them that I was saying [ __ ] fake carts and I don't really think they understood me so that's awkward but anyway let's get back inside alright you guys so after everything in this video what do I want you guys to take away from it basically if you live in a legal state please start buying your carts only from dispensaries or licensed delivery services weed Maps is a sort of good source because it'll at least give you the names of dispensaries in your area and then you can use your judgement or there are a few signs to look for when it comes to looking at legit dispensaries I'll go over that in a future video but if you live in a legal state please start buying your carts from dispensaries not black-market oh I don't really care about whatever else you buy from the black market but for carts especially do not buy them from black market anymore if you have if you live in an illegal state and you have to buy from black market then there are still some carts that will probably be safer for you than others but my best advice to you would be if you can switch from carts to something else do that because it's really not the risk carts will probably just eventually start being okay again but as of right now they are definitely not safe for you um if you're still gonna be smoking cards either way of course I'm still gonna be making reviews on carts oh I don't really suggest carts right now especially like i said 'dad woods I really really have a vendetta against them though um but I don't really suggest carts anymore but I am still going to be trying to do some sort of reviews of them because I do know that there still is gonna be a big amount of my audience that doesn't live in legal states and has to get these oh but I am gonna personally start switching more to just wheat and dads and I would implore you guys to do the same some things I did want to go over a quick that I sort of forgot to earlier um one is that vitamin E acetate is actually illegal to be used in substances that are to be inhaled in some states but in all of the West Coast states for some reason it's still not regulated um that's probably gonna be a law that they passed soon but it is definitely something that I wish was passed sooner because a lot of what is flooding the black markets are coming from west coast since West Coast is so huge in cannabis in general oh I also do want to say that one death was from someone who bought vapes from a dispensary which is why I'm saying only go to licensed dispensaries there are a license and unlicensed dispensaries and pretty much every legal state um and you can really really tell which ones are like more which ones are licenses which ones are a bit more shady um stay away from the shady ones only because I don't want you guys to get hurt Oh so yeah moving forward I think those are the things that are gonna be able to keep us the most safe um I hope you enjoyed this video if you did watch it and you at least got something out of it because I did work pretty hard on it either way I'm Esther bling see I hope that if you guys like this video you will subscribe to my channel and check all of my links in the description um I try to upload a week content every

subscribe if you're not already and please leave in the comments anything that you want to say about the whole topic because I am curious about what you guys's thoughts are on it I had a lot of people asking me what cards I think are safe and which ones aren't um I'll just give you a quick list right now as far as cards that I personally think might be a bit safer I would say the black tip TKOs I've been having really good experience with those lately on live East Coast I've had also good experiences with elite meds I had a good experiences with unfortunately that's pretty much it so even still I wouldn't really go out of your way to go buy black market carts but if you are living in black market States or if you aren't living in black market states where you don't have a medical card oh then those would be the brands that I haven't found any effects of my on myself I'll catch you guys on I'll catch you guys tomorrow actually with some scary games I hope you guys will come through that but either way thank you guys for watching and I'll see you all later peace [Music]", "1E00BZ6j97M": "yo what's up guys what the [ __ ] is up your boyfriend back up in this [ __ ] with another

not gonna [ __ ] lie to you if they update the boxes they shouldn't because the [ __ ] boxes like fires [ __ ] themselves like this [ __ ] i don't know what the [ __ ] they have this [ __ ] for but it looks alright i guess but i like the way it opens the cart it opens about the box and it says want to smoke here and the cart's in there and then i show you this they said it's live bro like it's outer space the stars at night this [ __ ] this [ __ ] glows like the [ __ ] little stars glow it box legit bro better than the big chief box and i think these are better than [ __ ] this is my card big chief like for no cap big cheap is like your average distillate cart it's not like that the hardest of all cards this otherwise is saying something else i'm feeling some i'm feeling some high energy energized effects on my head well not energizing but um so my [ __ ] high ass mind high right now my my my mind is high as [ __ ] right now and my body just wants to relax like that's the that's the equivalent of the equivalent for this that's how the [ __ ] uh hybrids are they hit you from the head and the body and it could just hit you down like and it could just just hits your head down and your body down all relaxed but when you hit hybrid it's like you're energized and you're sleepy at the same time bro like no [ __ ] cap i don't that's why i [ __ ] with hybrids more but indica indica is just my favorite i don't know why i just [ __ ] with indica i like smoking at night so this [ __ ] is too fire i'm not gonna say i say this in every video this [ __ ] is gas got that citrusy taste ah it hits me hard in the throat i got that citrusy taste with that orange the cuties taste [ __ ] uh bud flavor too but like it's like 20 30 percent i taste 30 percent of the bug i taste yeah i taste something but in there but i say the tarts are like 70 so so far so good with these mad labs guys i'm not complaining at all i always get [ __ ] stoned when i smoke this [ __ ] these are a cop bro these are definitely a cup this is supposed to look like all the way and if it says void right here that means they have the little batch code in the [ __ ] expiration date so y'all good y'all gucci so if y'all want to smoke so you want to smoke some real [ __ ] like it all depends on the plug though it all depends on your plug not sending you some scamming ass [ __ ] you

is the real one and why first we're gonna go by the packaging you see this is the ak-47 box it will come with the AK tank vapes official account on this side and it'll also come with the Holograms of the gun on the box you cannot judge your tank off this box this is nothing the this you can order the exact the same one off of ebay you can order these tanks off eBay too and you can order them with the official CC cell CC cell stamped on the bottom of these tanks so I have in front of me a skittles an ak-47 and then a real ak-47 this is the real one when I got it it was a very light color honey that's what you want is a light colored honey color or light amber color the consistency is very very thick as you can see how slow that consistency moves very very slow very slow you can barely even see it go down I'm gonna tell you bees let's just pick this one up first yeah look how fast that goes that has been diluted that has been really deleted and the same goes with this one same goes with that one this one blank on the bottom this is complete 100% fake this is fake this is here do have the CC cell on them and I'm gonna try to get get it lined up here okay the K on the right hand side is more defined and actually looks like a K the K on the left hand side is not defined as well as the one on the right they are different they are different because this one is fake you want your K on the bottom of your tank to look like this one does you see how that one looks versus the way that that one looks this one's more scrunched up looking I'm then the actual K on this one they are not the same also the tips date vapes are pulled on they pop on with forbidden pressure on they do not screw in you can tell and this one has been screwed in right there and also it's probably been glued so that way you can get it off you can tell that this one has the line on the inside right there this one does not it looks legit it really does look legit they did they did a good job on the official date rapes you are not able to remove the top and take the oil out and put it into another car Treach you cannot do that but like I said these just come screwable you know unscrew and fill them up with God knows what and then glue it and screw it back on so that way it looks completely legit if you choose to buy these and smoke them that's on you do know that you don't know what you're smoking anybody can put anything in there you could be smoking poison for all you know but this is what you want you want a light honey or light amber color with a very thick consistency you do want to check the bottom you cannot go by the CC cell stamp you have to go by that K the way that that K looks because like I said they did a damn good job in recreating date babes they really did I hope that this video helps you and helps clear up some of the questions that you have on fake versus real and thank you very much for taking the time to watch my video", "g4tHSckLfGk": "[Music] [Music] only thing i

like i paid for this with my own money uh and i gotta say it's definitely uh blowing my expectations away i would say that i'm pretty picky when it comes to like uh delta you know cards and edibles and disposables uh and this one definitely um almost i would say that it's just like a regular delta nine card because it gets me pretty [ __ ] baked so speaking of that let's go ahead take a hit off this this is what it looks like man very sleek like you know they really did a good job with the packaging the brand the way it looks they tried to go for the cookies look i kind of see so i respect it but they'll never hold up to cookies in my opinion but i definitely wish them the best obviously but cheers boys we're going to take off this i have to be careful not to hit this too much too big because um delta really makes me cough i don't know if that happens to you guys but it makes me cough my [ __ ] head off um do let me know what you guys are dabbing on eating on smoking on whether it's delta a delta nine uh definitely smoke along with me man i don't wanna smoke by myself and i just wanna go ahead and get this out of the way make sure to like comment subscribe all the good

good hit okay okay so it's lemon cush it's an indica 940 milligrams so it's not fully a grain technically um anyway so it's um my phone's blowing up total thc is says zero percent total cbd can total total connect total cannabinoids is 93 um it has the legal amount of technically thc in it 0.3 um has delta a and flavored terpenes like i said the box is very nice you can scan here to see like all the [ __ ] that you need to know like i said i really love the packaging i love what they did here like i just think they did a really good job and it like i said it's lemon kush it definitely tastes like lemon man and with just a little bit of like kush terps honestly men they definitely got that flavor down to a science uh and you can see on the side it uh shows how much juice you have left which i really appreciate um because you never know when it's actually done until you start like tasting a burger hand but you're at least gonna know we're um they have obviously a bunch of other flavors i just picked this one because i was pretty much put on the spot with it and rush and anytime i'm usually put on this whenever i like buy something if they're like you want this one i'm like sure um but i would almost be willing to try another flavor man um if this video you know let's try to get 40 likes man if this video gets 40 likes i'll that'll let me know that you guys still want to see more delta videos more delta reviews um yeah i'm already getting kind of high off this man it's not like obviously like a delta 900 it's not like super psychoactive uh but it is very calming and very relaxing and my body feels really like just chill my eyes feel really good it is an indica so i mean but let's go ahead and keep taking some hits man let's get [ __ ] high [ __ ] on this okay [Music] and let me know in the comments man um me and my girlfriend do a lot of hikes and stuff during um the summer let me know if you guys want to see any like delta nature sessions you know just

or that maybe you'd want to see me try maybe i could pick it up with somebody or you know we'll see but uh let's just keep it in this man [Music] so seriously though i mean this disposable actually does get me high compared to where the other one i had was not really that good and i'm a big fan i'm a sucker for disposable stuff like i said um so i definitely would say this is the best disposable delta a pod or delta pen that i've had disposable um love the packaging love everything about it love the taste my girlfriend really likes this she even has been spoken on this a lot and says it really gets her to the you know that right high that she wants so yeah i mean i'm not sponsored i'm not telling you to buy it i'm just telling you that this is a good brand if you are looking for disposable pots it has a light down here to let you know like uh that you're hitting it i don't know if you could take a blinker on it i tried it when i first got it in the other video and i literally coughed for 10 minutes so i'm not really trying to do that again it also has a k right here i don't really know what that means but [Music] i mean it still looks really cool uh yeah man i mean i don't really have much else to say about this this gets the job done you will get high smokiness um well i can't fully say that you will i do and i feel like it would definitely get most people high because i spent a lot of time tonight um it's a heavy hitter tastes great great packaging i think you can buy them for like 30 bucks maybe 30 bucks online i'm not really sure i picked 35 at a gas station though but that's what you get right man let's take one good last hit on this let's go ahead and bow man um if you guys did enjoy the review let me know in the comments make sure to like comment

be doing fish mango Kish I don't know I set him back again well I'm back again today cuz I already made a video so the mango cush marijuana strain tastes similar to the actual mango fruit what a distinctive flavor and hints of pine on the exhale its buds are covered with orange distil and are described as very dense the plant has an average growth height of 4 to 5 feet flowering and 9 to 11 weeks and it's a favorite with both indoor and outdoor growers the buds have thick shiny trichomes which are evident when the bud is broken apart see 92.5 9 always [Music] there is a bubble yep as the real bank should be free-flowing baby let's get a dry hit Oh now that tastes like a [ __ ] frozen mango but fresh not frozen I save frozen pizza I can only recall having frozen mango so that tastes better than like frozen mango but um Wow I'm not I was surprised interestingly enough it kind of tastes like a better mango yeah I don't know maybe not apparent mango but light mango kinda like a mixed mango smoothie but with pine yeah not sure if this is someone I want to keep as I keep ripping it's alright I will give it a um five and a half is definitely not as good as even the key lime pie I am starting to get high all this oil goes give me a pie but taste wise I have nothing bad to say about yeah I have nothing bad to say about the flavor well nothing bad to say about like the hi I'm sorry the outer ippity Canyon I'm probably gonna find out maybe this is a video short it's alright thanks for watching guys like subscribe if you want thanks for watching I appreciate every view there
