{"WsI2zwisEH4": "hi I'm Caitlin Garvey and I'm with Delta separation now today I met watch that distraction here at Salt Lake City and right now what I'm going to talk to you about is the ethanol extraction process and I want to go over as much detail as possible as I can cover so I'm gonna start very first with kind of an overview of the process and I'm gonna compartmentalizes so you can look at the entire process basically in three large steps so the first being extraction this is achieved by our cup 15 or cup 30 systems the second being evaporation of the solvent and this is achieved by alcohol until systems or rotary evaporator as well and finally you have a distillation step and that is performed at our roll-film system which is behind me or a similar distillation setup now those are the three big primary steps to compartmentalize that a little bit further before I go into detail on these steps I want you to understand that there's to tertiary steps in between these three lines so between extractions our cup system and the falling film or evaporation what we need to do is we need to filter that solution so we're going to be removing out of particulates and in some cases even lipids in fact the second tertiary process happens between the falling film we evaporation and prior to distillation on the real film system here and that's decarboxylation which is the process of converting the acidic cannabinoids that the plant produces THC a CBD a into the ones that are useful for us as consumers and manufacturers is THC and CBD so that is the decarboxylation step and then usually the final step is a distillation as I said that produces a distillate so to go into detail here a little bit the first thing that happens is your biomass or your cannabis or Hamptons in put it into your lab what's very important is that you make sure this is milled and homogenized you don't want or batches to be inconsistent because this is harder to track data while process so most large-scale facilities the first thing they do is mill or grind and homogenize their batches so the first thing then once we've milled and homogenized is on our cup system we're gonna pack that biomass into a mesh bag then these bags are about 80 micron forest size and what happens in that biomass is packed into the bag and then frozen at this point I do want to make a distinction that ethanol processing overall can be done with one room temperature or warm solvent or ethanol but for most people in most labs it's most advantageous to do this cold so you need to chill your solvent most often to something around negative 40 degrees Celsius prior to extraction and this cold processing is also the reason we pre freeze our biomass prior to extraction so once we've had our bag packed we've got that biomass pre frozen and we're gonna perform my extraction so we've got our ethanol cold at that point in the cup system we put our bags in and we fill it with ethanol and we do an agitation this is the formal abstraction where the ethanol is gonna grab the THC the sea Dee Dee and the terpene compounds and this is very largely depend on the solvent temperature once that extraction or agitation is done the centrifugal process of the cup is then initiated and this spins that bag very quickly and uses that centrifugal force to remove the residual amounts of solvent from the biomass now once we've done that we have a solution here of ethanol and our cannabinoids are compounds we want our CBD and THC a actually in that example and at that point that solution needs to be filtered and another point that should be made here is that solution isn't fully saturated meaning it can hold more THC and CBD and because the evaporation process down the line is very energy intensive we want to make sure ethanol is it as saturated as possible so in most labs after that initial extraction what they'll do is they will really saturate that ethanol or they will use that same volume of ethanol to wash or extract multiple bags on a cup system for example so once that ethanol is fully saturated as I alluded to at the beginning here it needs to be filtered prior to evaporation and this is to remove particulate more than anything little bits of plant matter that were left behind from the extraction process so once we've filtered it through a nuclear funnel or lenticular filter of some sort at that point then we're good to move that on to the evaporation process which is going to occur in usually a rotary evaporator or Delta's equipment we have a fall in the film evaporator so this evaporation procedure essentially involves applying heat and vacuum to the system to get the ethanol to boil off the key concept here is that the ethanol is going to boil off but our cannabinoids are target compounds the things we want our CBD a THC a are not going to boil off at this point and we can collect them and REE collect our ethanol now as I alluded to at the beginning there that crude extract prior once we've collected it from evaporation prior to distillation we need to decarboxylate and what this is is it really boils down to just applying heat to that crude extract and this is most often done on a hot plate or in a large glass or steel reactor at scale what happens there is again the plant produces the acidic compounds thca and CBD a and what we want especially for consumers but prior to distillation as well as we want the non acidic form so this is THC and CBD the more recognizable cannabinoids so the decarboxylation process just applies just involves applying heat for a certain amount of time to get these acidic compounds to convert to their non acidic forms and then at this point we have a decarboxylated crude extract and this crude extract generally speaking is the Queen 60 and 70% potent or 60 or 70 percent by weight cannabinoids are CVD or THC and the final step in him is distillation and that's performed again on a machine like this one behind me this is the rolls mill distillation unit of deltas and what we're going to be doing here is very similar to the following film we apply even more heat and even more vacuum to boil off and separate certain compounds and at the end of this process we're left with what is very recognizable now in the industry and what we call distillate this distillate depending on if we started with CBD or THC biomass is approximately 90 percent or 90 percent in CBD or THC respectively in that distillate and then that cements the process some manufacturers will take that distillate and will isolate the cannabinoid compounds as well but primarily we have from biomass extraction filtration of the solution evaporation of the solvent decarboxylation of that crude extract and then a final distillation of the crude extract to end or result in a very potent cannabinoid distant", "O4kLNvDjIi4": "right and you can do 100 if of ways then you can know the best gets a top 10 and you're just going to have to throw a dart so this is Vincent corporation we're running a time test on the cp6 press with 8 to 1 ratio ethanol to hemp these guys here using art press as a quasi extractor so they're running the first pass through here as you can see they're getting a very heavy flow of ethanol really not too much plant material in there that's a point zero zero six slot which screams so that's actually zero zero six thousandths of an inch here's their material still pretty wet all right we're going to increase the pressure now it's running fine so I'm taking it up to 40 psi now squeeze on it right [Music] in fact it's working well so I'm going to go ahead and go up to a good 50 psi [Music] well this is the most flow I've ever seen but that's because there's only four people we know that are using the press in this manner a lot of people just give us your waste material where's your doing your first pass through here yes got it yep and so that heavy flow is good because those first buckets are probably some of the highest CBD content I think major you might want to run it by us first but outside of habits break it we're not gonna not gonna charge you for it we might not give you another one how's that cake is I'm a little bit dryer yeah it is I'm gonna actually turn this up I've turned it up to sixty how much press can we get out of it what kind of pressure you have coming in here 100 okay this is about 80 running 80 now okay you're not gonna break anything you shouldn't and you'll get more dewatering you know what I mean see if that makes a difference is the last bucket in yeah oh this is an 80 psi you want look at that that actually looks a lot drier [Music] let me go guys [Music] are you gonna wash this through a second time yes the plan yeah good did you get a lot more out and what I would do is we're at 80 started 80 maybe go up to 100 and and just yeah and then check just check temperature if the temperature feels you", "rIMxtPzP1XY": "[Music] hi i'm dr john thompson president and founder of extract lab today i'm going to be talking about top 10 reasons ethanol extraction is better than co2 get ready for this one let's get started so here are the top 10 arguments against co2 extraction number 10 low solvent power number nine long cycle times number eight low throughput number seven it's not safe because co2 processes a high pressure number six co2 is not scalable number five co2 equipment is not reliable number four co2 needs ethanol for winterization number three solvent residuals are no big deal number two co2 equipment is too costly number one co2 is too costly all right so what we're going to be doing in the next 10 slides is we're going to be going through each one of these arguments and busting them so we'll start with number 10 co2 has low solvent power ah this one may have some credibility listen ethanol has the solvent power there's no question about that if anybody's ever drunk a scotch okay it will dissolve your tongue the great thing about ethanol is it will dissolve everything basically it'll dissolve pesticides it dissolves undesirable plant materials waxes polyaromatic hydrocarbons as you roll it over your carbon it'll dissolve terpenes and any other millions of organic substances so ethanol does have the solvent power and it's much more stronger than co2 no question about it ethanol is not the perfect key however for the cannabinoid lock okay it's more like the universal key for every organic lock okay so that the whole key analogy is more of a selectivity thing than it is a solvent power thing that's why you need to talk to you know separation scientists like myself because we know about selectivity okay so co2 has the selectivity and the way you really talk about selectivity is you talk about it in terms of pressure and temperature so solvent strength for co2 is highly dependent upon the pressure that's what's so awesome about it the solvent power and the co2 goes away as the pressure is released leaving nothing but pure oil co2 has adequate solvent power at elevated pressures 5000 psi at 50 degrees to extract 90 cannabinoids in about an hour so who cares if it has a greater solvent power if you're getting the job done i think it's kind of a red herring actually a low pressure and low temperature co2 has less solvent power compared to high pressure and it's used selectively to extract terpenes in terpene-rich mixtures so actually you can use that selectivity to really make like terpene soup sauces and things like that so actually that's pretty cool you can't do that with ethanol and temperature pressure and co-solvent are tuned in practice to make co2 more selective so that's what we do so co2 really has that selectivity and ethanol has that solvent power sometimes you can combine the two ever since we started making our equipment in 2015 we've always had a like a solvent pump on our system for you know like coal solvent so if you want to add a little bit of solvent in there to get it to you know go faster or to improve the situation you can add a small amount in and it makes a huge difference i think this one is plausible co2 absolutely does have low lower solvent power compared to ethanol but i also think that selectivity trumps solvent power and when you talk about separations selectivity is the name of the game let's move to number nine co2 has long run times this argument is really predicated on their previous argument that since co2 has low solvent power it has long run times now historically co2 has been run at low pressures and in those conditions yeah it's really it's pretty slow you know typically run times of four to six hours for example depending on your pressure and your temperature and sometimes actually those methods are quite desirable so under certain circumstances you want to have a like a terpene soup or you want to selectively get the terpenes out that's a really great way to do it you can't really do that with ethanol by the way so it's not true however when pressure and temperatures are elevated so you can really shorten up the run times also if you run a d-carb material it's also a lot faster so if you decarb your biomass like we do we decarb it and get out all of the beautiful terpenes out ahead of time so they're not being degraded during extraction you can basically go even faster so it's actually dependent upon what material you're extracting and also it's also dependent on what the temperature and pressure is just to give a blanket statement that it has long run times isn't really fair so you really need to think about that because ethanol has a very high solvent you know power it is pretty fast too so i don't i don't deny that and it makes sense that it is fast um you know the issue with ethanol is your recovery of that ethanol and then the cost associated with the recoveries and then you know the ethanol loss and really driving up the costs and do a comparison between the ethanol and co2 on the extraction cost but it is misleading to compare the solvent power for two solvents for a given solute without specifying the pressure the temperature and the composition at which the comparison is made yeah it's just not fair you're saying oh well one is uh much faster than the other well you have to specify the conditions otherwise it's just not fair so number nine i think is busted number eight co2 extraction is low throughput again this argument goes back to low solvent power and at long run times therefore it has a low throughput you know we just don't see this bore out in real life i mean we three of our 180 machines can process one ton of biomass per day and they're very small space they're like 26 square feet per machine so 75 square feet probably under right around 240 amps three phase you know it's for low power low space very very inexpensive to run the co2 is basically nothing you know four cents a pound so one thing is that you can say that it's low throughput but you know we're running a five ton a day facility in less than four thousand square feet that's our basically our extraction area actually it's a lot less than that so i don't really sure if it is low throughput i mean we're running of course higher pressure higher temperature methods i don't think anybody in the hemp or cannabis industry would say five tons a day is well throughput just just saying so throughput is important but throughput per what is important like for example through put per unit cost or throughput per unit operating cost or throughput per unit space or throughput per unit facility cost i mean you really need to put throughput in context so throughput is important but you throughput per is actually much more important i put this as busted because you can go look at one of our other youtube videos where we have a tour of a five ton per day facility and we don't we're running in an f2 uh facility which is an f2 occupancy you don't really have all those problems associated with ethanol and large amounts of solvent around it's really nice so let's go on co2 at high pressure is not safe oh my gosh co2 is going to blow up right this is what some of the ethanol and actually butane propane people are saying which is kind of actually ridiculous it's kind of almost dumb i don't know of any catastrophic event that's happened with co2 extraction equipment i don't i don't think it's ever been reported there may be um you know injuries of people getting their fingers hurt or like a fitting going off or something like that but i don't know of any physical you know where someone catastrophically like they died or a plant like blew up or a fire burned something down that just doesn't happen with co2 so and it's not only our company but there are a lot of other co2 companies and it's used industrially so you know certainly there's lots and lots and lots of people who have used co2 and uh you know the equipment itself is quite safe there has been issues of uh asphyxiation with people who have left the co2 run and then they suffocated that has happened uh but not in our industry it's happened in other people's industries so you can go to osha and you can look at all those things and there have been some instances of those yeah you have to make sure that your co2 is safe so you know you can use alarms you can put them on and we have alarms on all of our equipment you know if if you get a leak or something like that and you don't know the leak is happening your machine will basically shut off so that's one thing and you know our co2 cages which are basically our co2 you know conditioning equipment those things have a vent right on them with a contact closure if something happens if the if the co2 goes up above uh you know like 5000 ppm you know the fan turns on invents it so that's pretty nice but anyway um butane propane ethanol you know even ethanol has caused fires in this industry and they're pretty well known you don't have to go very far in the literature to see issues with butane and propane as well so um i think that there are safe ways obviously to do all these techniques um and so really we're talking about the exception versus the rule but it's kind of ridiculous to say that it's not safe to have co2 at high pressure that's ridiculous i have a pressure washer at home and it is 5000 psi pressure washer and my kids use it it's it's not a problem just the fact that you have 5000 psi does not make it unsafe it's that's ridiculous so i say it's busted okay let's move on to number six co2 is not scalable this is absolutely not the case i mean i can show you pictures of a 5 ton per day facility there are many large industrial co2 extraction facilities all over the place large scale co2 extraction is very old it's very well known it's safe in terms of scalability when you think about that in terms of a facility you want to make sure your facility is scalable so that you know basically you can start off at a low volume and then increase uh your production capability without having a tremendous uh upfront cost so that's what scalability is i consider that to be more of a a facilities characteristic in our case you know we have we made our system so they're modular you know like you need if you want to do like a half a ton a day you can use one of our 180s approximately a little less than half a ton a day or you know 500 pounds something like that if you want to do a ton a day you can you know take and add another couple of those units actually as you increase your biomass you're increasing your output you're getting more profit you can afford more equipment so you know the way we typically design facilities is so that you can scale it up over time and so that's a really great way to think about scalability but co2 is absolutely scalable you don't need to have huge huge huge vessels to scale up i mean we're using you know 40 and 80 liter vessels those are not huge vessels um in um or vessel volume rather and yeah they're just not huge so actually they're um they're all at uh you know chest level like this and you can uh you know put in the biomass in there it's really not it you don't need huge vessels so i don't know where that came from um tour our five ton today facility you can tell me whether or not it's scalable or not that's what i recommend but i have to put this one as busted it is co2 is definitely one of the more scalable techniques that's on the market number five co2 equipment is not reliable well i have to say that you know in the last say three years i think that all the manufacturers have really upped their game on reliability i'd say maybe four or five years ago you know a lot of the manufacturers were using like haskell pumps and you know they weren't really made for you know the cycle duty that they were applying them to so a lot of people had to have like extra pumps sitting on the shelf i don't think that that's the case anymore a lot of the pumps are pretty reliable and the pump that we have is extremely reliable i mean we have been running you know 24 hours a day for many many many years on single pumps and they're pretty reliable pumps i i really enjoy them they're basically they're piston pumps um they're actually diaphragm pumps excuse me and you have a diaphragm it's a ptfe diaphragm the fluid comes in through a check valve and then exits through a check valve they're really really reliable the other items that you could say are not reliable uh maybe of the seals you need to change out the seals and those if those are done on a maintenance schedule you know like once every three months you shouldn't have a problem so i wouldn't say that co2 equipment is not reliable there are some people who start with cylinders just single cylinders of co2 and then they try to run an operation and they're always running out of co2 and that's not the way to run a co2 extraction operation okay so that also is one of the ideas that might make you think that it's unreliable because you're always running out of solvent like you're always running out of co2 small the cylinders we have a product called the co2 cage and we recommend that you use the co2 cage because you can get a fill for example from a beverage truck or a large bulk source it conditions all the fluid delivers it to your extractor and it's quite nice because it's always going to keep it at the right pressure always at the right temperature and yeah it's just a preconditioning a piece of equipment so we've taken co2 tech to the next level and i think the whole industry has basically kind of kind of stepped up the plate on that i don't really have any fingers to point at any of our co2 competitors really we've really dialed in reliability i think that that's the case i also think that the like the pumps that are being used the low pressure pumps with ethanol i mean those are pretty unreliable too they have issues we've used a lot of those like centrifugal pumps or metering pumps they got problems and so i don't think it's a really a universal thing like oh hey co2 equipment is not reliable and ethanol equipment is reliable i think that mechanical systems have problems period so that's something to think about so i would have to say this one's positive co2 extraction needs ethanol oh my gosh yeah well this one's plausible it's absolutely true if you're going to do some co2 extraction at a large scale you're probably going to be one running some sort of winterization process now with an ethanol extraction process they they kind of run winterization within the process so you're running the winterization no matter what but with co2 you have it's almost like a separate process you get the oil out and then you winterize it okay now the deal here is that co2 does this winterization process but the ethanol usage is way way way less way less i mean it's not even close so it's really not on the same level so you don't don't really need to worry about for example having to lower your costs of solvent loss or solvent reuse or anything or even the power you don't have to worry about those those costs really because you're using so little of it food grade ethanol you can use that even though it's more expensive and it's not going to be really you know contributing a large portion of your cost and ethanol reuse is still subject to the fda gmp practice for change out foundation specification requirements so um the bottom line is i have no problem with ethanol uh or food grade or organic it's just we use it for winterization i just don't like denatured ethanol i think that's a really bad idea so i have to say that this particular one is plausible yeah co2 does need extraction yep co2 does need ethanol to make it work what i'm really sure is a big cell what i mean co2 uses a lot less ethanol like a lot so it's not the same even in the same category as ethanol extraction in terms of its ethanol usage so it's a big so what all right let's talk about number three solvent residuals are no big deal i totally disagree and everybody knows that i disagree the butane and propane people had been talking about this they say if you have a properly purged solvent properly purged oil shouldn't be a big deal the issue is that a lot of people didn't quite get that process down and so there were widespread knowledge of residuals in a lot of the you know for example shatter i don't think butane and actually propane is that big of a deal to eat pretty non-non-toxic but when you start talking about denaturants that are added into ethanol that i really have a big problem with that because you know we see samples that pass like tests the solvent test the four or six nine usp test for example and you know they still have heptane or they still have acetone or they still have you know different denaturants in them there are no long-term toxicity or carcinogenity studies on many of those solvents in the class three which is ones i just mentioned and so they know that they're less toxic but they're only know that from the short term like for example if you look up heptane this is a good example people are adding heptane to ethanol to denaturize it okay there's a 5000 ppm limit on heptane but the fda has basically said that they don't have the data for long-term toxicity or carcinogenity or heptane that's a problem and they cited one single study and they said okay it's okay at 5000 ppm well i just don't like that so residual chemical solvent impurities are entirely avoidable using co2 production methods that's absolutely true so why take the risk with solvent residuals they kind of are a big deal because there's a lot of unknown potential consequences from them and a lot of it hasn't been studied cognitive function effects on cognitive function effects on endocrine disruption in the endocrine system there are a list of all these areas of science that we have basically uncovered and know a lot about since 1981 and we have a pretty antiquated limit on heptane for example basically on the basis of our known amount that's in there so i have to put this one at busted solvent residuals are a big deal and you know you can entirely avoid them just using co2 production methods so i say busted let's go to number two co2 equipment costs too much well i have to say you get what you pay for co2 equipment is definitely more expensive but trade-off for that is that co2 equipment also has the lowest operating cost period co2 operations will generate cash faster thereby paying the needed increase in equipment cost and driving value for business for years so one thing if you really look at the numbers and you look at the operating costs and not just the initial equipment costs you're going to come up to a very different conclusion when it comes to the added cost up front for co2 we offer extreme value in use in other words as you use our product and the way we use it with co2 and the co2 cost itself is so extremely low if you look at that in that sense our products are ridiculously inexpensive just do the numbers and you'll know what i'm talking about so i'd have to say that this is busted and now for the number one argument that ethanol is better co2 extraction cost more than ethanol that's just absolutely not true take a look at these facts number one co2 uses four to six times less power than ethanol extraction we don't have to take and you know evaporate huge amounts of ethanol that's a big power cost so co2 wins liquid co2 is 4 cents a pound as compared to ethanol which is 4.71 cents a pound that's 117 x less cost that really drives a huge impact on if you have ethanol losses that's going to cost you a lot if you're going to try to do organic you have got to buy organic ethanol and that's going to cost you even more so loss of co2 per day is about 211 bucks for one ton a day compared to ethanol which anywhere is from 4 000 to 7 800 a day easy depending on what kind of ethanol you buy co2 is the liquid startup cost it's about 211 whereas the ethanol startup cost is anywhere from 7 000 to 15 000. so it's less co2 if you're going to build a building say 5 000 square feet co2 is housed in an f2 versus an h2 occupancy those costs are published by third party all over the world 68 bucks a square foot typically average cost versus two over 200 square foot for h2 occupancy buildings so extraction facilities are less costly and co2 extraction facilities have low cost insurance compared to ethanol absolutely true my advice to you is don't mortgage your company's future value by operating a high cost operation you need those profits to grow so the number one argument i think is busted hey thanks for watching we have many resources available for you to get your hemp operation up and running calculators advanced extraction guides distillation guides cbd jam sessions we have just lots of content links to which are in the description below as well as the cards up above uh i'd like to hear from you what was your favorite part of the video if you would let me know in the comments below i'd be really appreciative of it also don't forget to subscribe to our channel for more content like this this has been dr john with extract lab thank you and have a great day", "pW66iiVNJtY": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I wanted to talk to you guys about the fundamentals between co2 and solvent based extraction what we want to talk about is the fundamentals of the solvent we're gonna start with co2 so co2 typically in the atmosphere as you guys probably well know is a gas right it's all surrounding us everywhere but in order to make it a solvent it needs to go into what's called subcritical or supercritical phase right and what happens with a supercritical phase is you're compressing and you're heating that gas in order to make it into a fluid form right so typically called supercritical fluid extraction or and if it's at the lower end of that range sub critical fluid extraction now this technology has been around for years right it's been used in coffee it's been used in vanilla types of artisanal extracts it's really really good for decaffeination they use it in dry cleaning right so the technology has been around and about 10 years ago when cannabis really started getting large and people started looking towards cannabis extracts they said hey why don't we try this supercritical co2 so the history of the solvent is that it's been used very widely and people look to repurposing it into the cannabis industry right which they started to do maybe you know eight nine years ago and it started to really get big about six or seven years ago right so all these supercritical co2 applications popped up for cannabis specifically and when you look at the fundamentals of the solvent right the the difference between co2 and a different solvent like hydro carbon or ethanol is co2 doesn't do a great job at actually extracting the cannabinoids right so you've got your your cannabinoid structure that's contained within your trichome right and your trichome is a a mushroom like shape on the outside of the leaf of the plant right and that's what contains all your goodies that you you know your turf beans your your CBD your THC your cbn your CBG all those things are contained within that mushroom trichome structure right so what we want to do with the solvent of any kind is dissolve that structure right and isolate those molecules now supercritical co2 can do this right but it's a very weak solid so if you think of a solvent and you think of a molecule like like a Lac on one side and a key on the other you want to find the perfect key that goes into the lock and you're kind of sliding it in there you're turning that turning that lock and that that that door is opening right away right now with supercritical co2 it's kind of similar to trying to jam a screwdriver into the lock right it's going to work right but it takes a lot of a lot of power a lot of pressure right which is why you see these systems that operate between 1,500 to 5000 psi and because of the nature of the solvent right the solvent has to be repeatedly passed over that trichome structure right so we're continuously passing this this solvent that doesn't have great solubility with cannabinoids and with that trichome structure of the plant over this plant in order to get our goodies out so to speak right so that's why co2 units have a long cycle time typically what you're gonna see is anywhere between on the very low end to hours which will diminish your yield and diminish your your returns on your actual processing and you're also going to see longer cycle times the more material that you put in there generally right so these can be manipulated in a number of different factors a lot of the co2 companies have drastically improved upon the old days you know the old days it was eight hours per run right they've improved that by running things like subcritical running things like a higher pressure sometimes up to 5,000 psi but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the solvent right the solvent is is is not the best key for our lock in order to get those cannabinoids and those those chemicals out of the plant that were that we're desiring right so that is a fundamental overview of why co2 technologies aren't as applicable now when you look at the equipment side of co2 right obviously it stands to common sense that if you got to have something that's going up to you know 1,500 2,000 5,000 psi right you can imagine at scale it's simply not economical or feasible in order to have those technologies at scale right because if you think about a gigantic vessel that needs to go to 5,000 psi right think about the amount of engineering that to go in there the shell thickness the the valve the safety precautions right obviously when you're working at those types of pressures there's a fundamental safety concern now if it's properly engineered equipment of course the machines operate safely there's not a thorough history of accidents or things like that but that it takes more dollars right which is why dollars two dollars when you're looking at co2 equipment the equipment is actually quite a bit more expensive than solvent based right so what really happens with with with all this total scenario right as you start weighing out all these variables between co2 and solvent based against the equipment against how how you're going to scale what's right for your business how you're going to apply these technologies to your end products right and that's a lot of what we do here at precision is we we look at our client's needs we understand what it takes for an end-to-end process to integrate and that's part of what differentiates our company is that you know we our end-to-end process integrators not just somebody that's gonna sell you a piece of equipment and walk away right so so what I'd like to do is really is compare that with you know the the fundamentals of solvent based extraction now right and when we talk about solvents we'll talk about the three most popular which would be butane propane and ethanol there's a lot of other solvents out there that work there's a lot of other solvents that that may come into play in the future but we're gonna focus around the primary three that are that are used today in the cannabis and hemp industry and we'll talk about how those apply more readily to large scale especially in CBD production and hemp production so on the other side of this coin I want to talk about solvent based extraction right I want to talk about how it compares with co2 specifically so let's go back to our lock and key analogy right our lock and key analogy is we want to find the the perfect key to go into the lock right and on this side is our molecule that we're trying to extract and on this side is our key our key is our solvent right and we've not found generally a better key in the history of extraction over the last decade or so then butane and propane right so butane and propane are nonpolar solvents with light boiling point right and what that's going to yield is it's going to it's going to go in there it's gonna bind to all of your cannabinoids or terpenes and the desirable aspects of the plant right so if you ever look at our teas '''l type of products most of them are made with butane and propane right you get that really beautiful light color that terpene rich smell right which is very very applicable to artisanal cannabis markets and it's also very very applicable to moderate scale right different types of manufacturing and making different products right now we start to make a little bit of a paradigm shift right because butane and propane as most of you probably well know are flammable solvents right so and they also contain a little bit of pressure which means it costs a little bit more money to engineer the equipment right the shell thicknesses on the equipment have to be a little bit thicker but not like co2 right at co2 we're talking about 5000 psi butane and propane we're talking about anywhere from 50 to 150 psi so much much lower pressure is much safer working environment over all right but we want to keep these vapors contained so they're not ignitable right and you want to stay in a class one division one room and take all these proper safety precautions now our company has done thousands of installations of hydrocarbon equipment across the entire world at this point and we can we can honestly say that I think we're experts in hydrocarbon extraction and we understand that hydrocarbon actually does pull the best terpene profile the best cannabinoid profile out of the cannabis plant however at large scale you can start to see where the actual hurdles come in so to speak right so now how do i process you know 2,000 pounds a day with hydrocarbon on a large scale it starts to get very costly and very engineering heavy let's call it right because you have to have all of these different vessels everything has to be under pressure everything has to be class 1 division 1 rated right so it's not really feasible for for large-scale CBD extraction or large-scale hemp extraction and what we like to usually say is is you know if you're an artisanal brand that means you're processing about a thousand pounds of input biomass per day or less right once you start crossing over that threshold the cost of engineering the equipment the cost of the redundancy and the batch equipment and and the cost of the hydrocarbon equipment becomes prohibitive right and it's why you see a large trend towards ethanol so let's talk about ethanol from a from a chemical standpoint for a minute right so going back to our lock and key method ethanol is also a very good key for our lock right but the problem with ethanol is because the polarity of the solvent it's an extremely polar solvent right so the extremely polar solvent yes it will bind to our cannabinoids and our terpenes the problem is is that it's also going to bind to chlorophylls and to other water-soluble or undesirable compounds within the plant now traditionally what everyone has done to combat both those water soluble molecules are those chlorophylls is they've chilled their ethanol down so those of you that are watching this video that are experienced you may very well know if you run your ethanol at negative 40 or below generally you're you're able to bypass a lot of the chlorophylls you're able to bypass a lot of the a lot of lipids and the phosphide profiles right things that are going to gum up your process downstream right but the problem is is that how do you chill now all this ethanol on a massive scale so we're in a different a different era now so to speak right how do we use ethanol a scale for CBD that we're doing 10,000 pounds a day well it comes down to properly engineered equipment right it comes down to proper mass balance it comes down to proper post processing procedures where you need an end to end in engineered solution which is what we've done with our KP D Series right so it's not just pouring ethanol over plant matter right there's refinement of the product there's variabilities in the biomass there's there's all sorts of things that are coming down the pipeline right that affect your yield they affect your your distillate quality they affect your crystallization right all these different variables that you need to have a thorough understanding of right so processing at scale it can be done you just need to have an understanding and a strong team that understands all these variables and how to combat but from a from a fundamental standpoint of scaled extraction ethanol is fantastic because you don't have the pressures there's absolutely zero vapor pressure which means none of your vessels are under pressure you're not operating under pressure it has significantly less flammability than then hydrocarbon and it's significantly safer than co2 and the fact that it's not pressurized right and people like ethanol because they know most of us go out to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and drink it right we ingest it it is a relatively safe solvent generally recognized as safe from the FDA so let's let's talk about an overview of the common misconceptions that come with solvent based extraction right people tell you all you extract with a solvent you extract with butane or propane you're gonna have residual butane and propane in your product that's absolutely not true so what happens is once the product is extracted there may be trace amounts of butane and propane but it goes through a heating and purging process right typically that's done either in vacuum drying ovens or in decarboxylation or in distillation right that's going to remove that solvent and there'll be zero parts per million of any sort of residual solvent right same thing with ethanol ethanol is a little bit harder to take off because it has a higher boiling point right it's not as volatile doesn't make Verizon's easy but the same thing right it's going to be pulled off and decarboxylation or in in distillation and it's ironic because a lot of the people that that preach anti solvent extraction right there in the CBD market and they realized once they get to crystallization that they're forced to use pentane H pentane is a group D hydrocarbon and you know needs to be purged needs to be dealt with in the class one division one room needs to have all these parameters so again understanding your process and and working with really I could say educated people not believing a lot of the marketing hype that's out there because everybody wants to sell you equipment but in the end of the day do they know how to integrate your process and and do they really understand the science of what's happening behind the process and have they done it before did they have a long operational history so these are things that I would definitely you know ask the people that here that you're potentially doing business with a lot of what we do here with our R&D team is that we test these processes we test new parameters we're working on ways to optimize the extraction process you know our company while we're an equipment manufacturer where a process integrator but we always focus as an innovative technology company right so we're always looking at disruptive disruptive technologies what's going to change in the future market trends what's going to happen to these markets how do we get the scale for lower cost and we look at all these variables and that all starts on the bench right which you guys can see the lab behind me we work with our team very closely and we're always working to find a more efficient more effective process right while still being able to integrate the existing processes and making them work really well right so I thank you guys for listening today you know you can shoot some comments below or shoot us an email give us a call if you have questions we're happy to help and we've got a large staff that can that can help you guys out and thanks for watching the video appreciate it [Music]", "CzMHusSAZs8": "we've uh removed most of the sticks that you've got in here um a couple more sticks to come out you don't need to grind this you don't want to grind this you want to basically break the flowers up that gives more access to the cannabinoids that are on the trichomes in those flowers it's going to basically break that up get rid of the stick okay so here we have our raw material that is prepared this will not be decarb uh when you're extracting with alcohol you do not need to decarb so this is now ready to go into the jar and into the freezer now we're going to put this jar and this everclear uh in the freezer to get it very very very cold we're looking to start this entire process with the biomass and the alcohol in this case ethanol somewhere between 20 and 30 below celsius some people want it to be much colder than that the colder it is the less green that it will pull the less chlorophyll that it will pull but the problem with making it super cold is it negatively affects the solubility of the cannabinoids as well and that means you generally have to have a little bit longer soak time but in any case that's subject to experimentation by you the objective of this of course is to pull as much cannabinoids while at the same time pulling the least amount of green from the chlorophyll here are the two bottles of 190 proof everclear and the raw material in a freezer we're going to get this really really cold i suspect that we'll be running down around -25 by the time that this is cooled off this will take overnight this particular type of freezer has a dial type gauge on it as opposed to a digital gauge this allows me to run the temperature down to far lower temperatures than i would get with a digital gauge we're now at minus 27.9 centigrade and our raw materials and our alcohol are now cold enough to begin the extraction portion of the process so now pour the cold ethanol into the biomass i'm using about 1500 milliliters of ethanol into that biomass and you can see it is essentially uh submerged in there and i'm going to shake that up just a little bit and put it back in the freezer for five minutes here we have our first wash now what we're going to do is put it back into the freezer get it really really cold again and then we're going to run it through a winterizing process in the essential in order to remove some of the fats and lipids here we have the winterization filtering going on you can see the flow and this is the uh moisturization jar it's almost empty now you've pulled most of the fluid through the little vacuum pump is good enough for doing this but if you want to accelerate it you would connect a third-party vacuum pump and make it much much faster you can see that the filter has got quite a bit of sediment or some kind of debris on it and this could be waxes lipids or bio-particles this is a 2 micron filter and it's quite dark now we can see the waxes and bio particles that are accumulated here we can see the waxes and lipids that are on there this is the clarity and the color of the first wash we can simply put the multi-purpose lid on and begin our concentration and after boiling off we now have uh this concentrate there is still a bit of ethanol in here but this will be left to evaporate and then we will have our final extract", "HwM3GbyaO5I": "hello everyone and welcome to med extractor's introduction of its essential oil extractor we have here's the boiler this is a one gallon capacity it has an automatic temperature control it also has an automatic shut off built right into it so you can do walk away operation uh we have this custom machined top on uh associated with it we have a viewport down in here inside here is a 2 micron watman type filter 185 millimeter wide diameter so there's high throughput even though it's a fine filter this is the vacuum assisted condenser there's a micro vacuum pump inside as well as a heat exchanger we have two very large capacity recovery jars 64 ounces each you can use smaller jars if you wish and the stand is adjustable to move height up and down over here we have a third-party vacuum port if you want to accelerate your uh winterization filtration rate if you want to bring down the ethanol boiling point even further than what our micro pump will do you can hook up a standard uh third-party vacuum pump to that port right there there is a backflow preventer in that circuit and this will prevent oil from the vacuum pump from being sucked back into the system so that is the complete system right there we've this we believe this to be probably the leading edge product of its type for the craft extractor what we have here are the various parts that when combined together we'll uh comprise a buckner type filter this is our multi-purpose lid that we use on the boiler when we're going to be doing alcohol recovery but when we're doing a buckner type filter for clarifying winterizing the extract we'll be running it through this filter base we have a stainless steel support structure underneath here we on the base of this we have this and we have the hole the drain hole here and a seal for the top of the boiler here so this is a custom machined piece of material specifically designed to accommodate 185 millimeter buckner type filter papers uh with such a wide diameter we have quite a high flow rate even though it's a very fine filter this is a 2.5 micron filter so it sits on top of the support platform we take the gasket put it inside here like this take the top and we can see that there's a viewport through here so we can watch the filtering actually going on as it's doing that uh we'll put this on like this again there's multiple different ways that you can attach this you can rotate it in different directions but essentially what's going to happen here is we're going to take our vacuum hose which is this right here as you can see okay and it's going to go on here like this and this end of the hose here will go into the 2b filtered fluid the vacuum port is on this side right here this will hook up to the condenser and the vacuum inside there will pull the fluid through this through the buckner type filter and it will drop into the boiler below and have it ready for uh collection and reclaiming so we put it on like this the whole thing is under vacuum we don't really need to put anything on to hold it in place but we do it in order to provide ourselves with a with a very secure uh seal that way there can't be any way that any of the fluid can get around the paper filter many of the bucket type filters that are available on the market do not do this and as a result of that you can have flow by uh past the actual filter itself so we tighten that down close up the vacuum port and this bucket type filter is now ready to be sat on top of the boiler and ready for the winterized filtration to begin okay so what we're going to do here is we're going to apply vacuum here it's going to pull the fluid through here it's going to pull it through the the filter and the filtered fluid will then accumulate inside the boiler and be ready for the next step which is recovery this is a concoction of isopropyl alcohol a bunch of fractionated coconut oil and some olive oil it's just really meant to simulate a heavy wax load so we can see what happens during the filtration i'm going to be running a third-party vacuum that's hooked up to our system it's going to run through this system i don't have to turn anything on in the system at all but i want to keep the system in the circuit because this allows for a vapor trap in here and it also has a backflow prevention valve in to keep oil from coming back from the pump into the solution and it will continue running through here we can see the filters we can see the wax building up on the filter this is actually a 20 micron filter because i put a lot of wax in here and i'm just going to filter out the do a relatively fast filter here first now we're going to take the top off and take a look and see what we've got inside okay do this do this and there's a very large amount of wax in here i'll show that to you in just a moment let me take this off okay put this down here lift this off and you can see there there's a very large amount of wax in there and i overloaded that wax on purpose so you can see exactly what i can is done uh now what will happen is we can take i didn't do the whole jar of this because that is full and it needs to be replaced in order to finish off the jar but i want to show you the color of the uh what's what's coming through here just on that first filter and you can see here that this is quite clear you can hear the vacuum pump running we're running at full boil our temperature of 62 degrees and our recovery is occurring right now in our primary collector jar you can see here that the primary recovery jar is full and the system is now pushing the recovered alcohol into the secondary recovery jar these two 64-ounce jars allow for up to just under one gallon of recovery here we have the uh recovered oil uh this was olive oil going in and this is olive oil coming out uh there's still a little bit of residual alcohol in there uh we're gonna evaporate this off to atmosphere for a little little bit and then we're going to run it through the purge function now we have our oil right here that we've recovered after we've removed all of the alcohol from the mixture so this is going to now be purged this is our silicone purging tray i've allowed the evaporation of some residual alcohol for a little while and now we're going to pour this into the tray put the tray in the boiler and put it under vacuum for a long period of time in this case we will do it for 48 hours and this will allow the removal of any residual ethanol and a lot of the thickening of the extract into the purge tray and put the purge tray inside the divider put the top back on up the condenser because we're going to be pulling the back vacuum through here okay so we're now basically ready to go with this now we're going to set the timers one of the timers is going to control the heat pulsation that goes into the boiler that will create the temperature environment the other timer will control the vacuum and it will top up the vacuum over time in certain time increments so let us set the timers now this is going to be the boiler timer we're going to set this at certain intervals so that the heat is pulsed into the boiler over the purge period ultimately we're going to set the purge period at 48 hours so this is how we're going to set the boiler heat for that 48 hours okay so basically what's going to happen is we're going to hit that press and hold this timing circulate button until the top line starts to blink when that happens we're going to set this for one two three four five five seconds of heat hit this again go to the second line we're gonna set it for nine minutes off and then we're going to move it to and we're going to run this up to 48 hours this timer is now set to run this boiler five seconds of heat followed by nine minutes of uh off that sequence will run for 48 hours as soon as i start this confirm button here now we're going to set the second timer it will top up the vacuum over time during the 48 hour purge period because we're going to be using the internal pump we will set the the vacuum at 10 minutes on 15 minutes off the way that we do that is we hit the switch button hit the timing circulate button we see a one blinking up here we're going to move that up by putting the minute button to 10 so it's going to be on for 10 minutes okay gonna move this up to 15 it's going to be off well went past 16 is okay so we're going to do that so it would be 10 minutes on 16 minutes off and we're going to repeat that cycle once again our button over here and we'll hold that down until we get to there it is so this timer is now ready to go both of these functions will begin as soon as i hit the confirm buttons this confirm button and the confirm button on the boiler heat and then we can start our purge control we're going to run the vacuum up that way we can be ready to maintain vacuum rather than having to wait to establish vacuum make sure that your vacuum pump is turned on here if you're using the internal pump uh the fans are turned off as you can see there's no light here the fans are not required during purging operation now we can see here that our little mini vacuum pump will pull somewhere around 20 inches of mercury if we wanted to be higher than that we would hook up a third-party vacuum pump which i'm going to do now and show you the difference here we have the third-party vacuum pump connected to the condenser and we're pulling just under 25 inches of mercury at this point we now have vacuum running on the purge uh this vacuum is going to be running at 10 minutes on 15 minutes off that will keep the vacuum level topped up during the 48 hour purge period the other timer is controlling the boiler heat which is off right now and you can hear the pump just went off so we're now waiting for the boiler heat to come on and it will come on at its uh allocated time when it when it begins the vacuum gauge is holding vacuum at present time the vacuum pump is turned off because it's sitting in a weight state it will turn itself back on again in about 10 minutes from now and that on off cycle and the heating on off cycle will repeat for 48 hours where after the machine will shut off and the purge will be complete you", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "wmAOe_klMKY": "[Music] hello looks like Alistair is making a transaction here of some kind I don't know what you think you're gonna get out of there hey sweetie are you cold hey Connor all right yeah it's no one all right okay so we're up in Lake Tahoe area is that for cove on the Nevada side so we came up here originally to my sister Eden because we're not certain on all the Utah laws regarding CBD oil now it doesn't mean that you can't take it in Utah they do sell it I think some people say like hey you need a card from a doctor it really just depends because we were uncertain about the laws we decided to come out to Nevada so anyway yeah because we were uncertain we just came out to Nevada my sister lives out here in Reno so we came up the mountain to Tahoe she's gonna meet up with us here and give you guys a little bit more information I also want to stay in fatica Lee we are not legal counsel you are responsible you do your own research find out what it is you need to know and your local laws hi my name is Ian Wakefield and I am a full-time cannabis consultant and I also run a cannabis coaching business on the side yeah and why are you here what are you doing well I'm Robbie's oldest sister and I'm here to help with Ian's issues that he faces with his autism with some CBD oil okay and what kind of this can you pull it back to your face love it yes this is the harmonious brand CBD it's a full spectrum that's different from a distillate in that this contains all of the compounds of the hemp plant versus distillate which would only contain the CBD itself so this is better than what I just said find over the shelf at like my local mall or like that absolutely also because you may find full spectrums here and there in that way but you won't always have somebody who has put their lab testing next to the product online there is always going to be current lab tests for every batch with the bottle okay and in full disclosure we are using this for free thanks to the generosity of Ian sprint Eden's friend at harmonious I'm Eden Eden Ian we screw it up sometimes so there they're gonna offer this this to us for free so we could try it out yeah so that's nice yeah very nice of them yeah anything else you want to say about it or huh you know I stand by a hundred percent i I tell everybody about it that I can and especially people who are afraid to try THC or you know any of the heavier products this is a really really great alternative well and that's another thing too so THD THC versus CBD why don't you tell us maybe just very briefly the legality involved but also you know how THC is a neurological inhibitor or that kind of thing yeah THC has many medicinal benefits that are we're still exploring in science and the legalities kind of put a damper on that because federally it's not legal to actually perform lab testing on actual cannabis in the United States this is from the hemp plant cannabis is cousin and it has all the other medicinal medicinal compounds that you're going to want but yeah as far as something that has higher THC in it that's going to be where you're going to need to be in a legal state and and deal with it on your own make your own decisions accordingly mileage may vary no this is fine this is this is over-the-counter type stuff yeah yeah you can order this this is this is legally able to be shipped throughout the United States without problem including Utah including Utah yeah so we just found out about this recently and sorry if my voice is a little bit muffled behind the mic but we just found out the laws change so rapidly that Utah has legalized CBD oil over the counter I think it's okay to give it to minors in Utah we were unsure so we came out here to Nevada because I knew my sister would know better than most in accordance with local laws and customs and things like that yeah this is completely legal to give your kids the FDA is trying to step in and stop CBD from being able to be given to pets and kids and things like that and we're working on fighting that because CBD isn't regulated though that's why I prefer to go to this brand because he does things through state regulations so even though it can be shipped Internet you know anywhere you wanted to go it's still above board for a product that you know is going to be regulated you know that this is going to be factual okay awesome yeah was anything else you wanted to say I'm just really grateful to Brandon and Anthony and the guys over at Harmonia CBD for being so generous is to offer us this opportunity to see how we can help Ian with CBD oil okay how long I'm gonna do another Tong three drops one two three that's it hmm three jobs three jobs to start yep sweet drops looks perfect oh good it's better than a half one because a half one makes my likes crazy I just like your spirit on does how was it taste I taste a low flame a little fight yeah what would you say to people who just say you're judging your kid you're just making them passive and zombie like that would you have to say about that well at first I'd say that's not true that's not what happens I mean Ian's as talkative and has as much of his personality as ever he's he's a bit calmer and I'd argue that this medicine isn't really for us the parents it's honestly more for the kid they're less anxious they're able to sleep better they're able to concentrate better on the tasks they have at school and the tours they have at home and whatever choose for their mind - I think it's highly beneficial yeah and that's been for a spiritum so we think so far of the oil well I'd say the biggest difference I've noticed between risperidone and the CBD oil is that risperidone immediately makes in sleepy and he is actually more tired and more lethargic on her Sparrow dome than he is on CBD oil although the CBD oil has a more calming effect yarr that may not be true for so much my understandings of you in facts so I'm trying to get through this it affects people differently based on their um their body chemistry and their neurological I'm not sure why that is so it's really nice to see and reacting well to it it's still too early to tell if this will be a permanent replacement does it risperidone but again whether it's perd\u00f3n it's just there's too many side effects that long-term we think what could be detrimental especially how it makes him a little bit sleepy to begin with and then that is kind of like pacifying him not that we want him to behave that way it's just how he responded to it and so as many people have mentioned online with medications there's a kind of a cocktail that people go through where they try risperidone and that doesn't work so they try a belif and vilify abilify and they just kind of go down the list of different medications until that wears off then they go on to the next thing and we want to try something that's made available more natural a little bit more long-term the Ian can take and not have any major side effects so far the only side effect we can see that I guess you could say was major was that he woke us up at 4:00 a.m. and he goes daddy I'm hungry so he he had the munchies for a lack of a better term so one of the things we did want to mention is we're starting out small and we're working our way up so we started a very small dosage and we monitor Ian's heart rate and things like that so I put my hand on his wrist I did a stopwatch and he was about 75 beats per minute so he did well in the middle of the night I checked his pupils made sure that they weren't dilated or anything like that and they reacted just fine another thing that is nice is the cost it's about half as much as risperidone how did you feel I feel I feel good I feel good what was the word you said fantastic you felt fantastic a little bit fantastic well that's good yeah do you still feel fantastic yeah cuz I've done a lot of I was playing with my freak imaginary friends they're right they're directors it's crowded there are there's a lot of them there's a lot of your imaginary friends yeah they're all come to a party with me and us nice dear hey everybody we're back in Utah right out here walking with Ian you can probably hear him say hey hey guys yes you are so I just want to do a quick little recap here kind of a summary of the week in Nevada where basically ending Ian's dosage on the CBD oil I'd love to continue it actually I had some pretty good results it doesn't last as long as his or spare at all but I like that it doesn't have as many side effects especially the drowsiness that comes with her spear at all hopefully it doesn't get too loud we're heading into a construction area I would have done it inside the house but the kids have been super noisy so I come out here and there's construction everywhere what do you do so anyway um basically the the Utah laws are such that we can't continue the CBD oil to the best of my understanding you guys can correct me in the comments section if you want let me know more but as I checked the last bill that was passed in 2018 was like 200 pages long I don't have time to read it most people don't and it basically covered things like epilepsy in terms of getting a medical card and autism wasn't even on that list so yeah you basically need permission from a doctor or a medical card saying that you know your child needs CBD oil I forgot to mention too if any of you are new to the channel it's been well documented that ian has autism you can see his paperwork there just because we get that question a lot because he is more or less high-functioning now and you can talk a lot of people are like is even autistic should you be giving him medication yes he is but anyway aside from all that we would have loved to continue using CBD oil and you know many people do no matter what the laws are I don't think anyone's going to come after those people we want to be careful because we're putting on YouTube and inevitably you get one or two zealous parents who are like that's it I'm gonna call Child Protective Services on you you're torturing your kid you're a terrible parent blah blah blah long story short you know they're they're calling people and just making your life miserable because they've got nothing better to do we're trying to do the best we can for our son that's the honest to goodness truth we really want Ian to be happy and healthy and when it comes to more severe autism and he's not very severe but the further you go down the spectrum the more difficult life becomes just doing basic things just feeling like you can go outside without being overwhelmed and he has a difficult time with that kind of stuff he gets overwhelmed so it helps him yes it helps us to that's an added benefit but the the first priority is to help him out so he can go to school you can go to church you can go to public places and not be overwhelmed and just make it through the day without tons of problems so we appreciate my sister and her friends for letting us have the oil for free I'm very nice of them it doesn't reflect anything on our review we just tell the truth you know how it is it's not a magic bullet it's it's been great though so far I would recommend it to those who want to try it of course your mileage may vary just depends on the person everybody's chemistry is different so yeah I hope that was helpful and if you guys of course have any comments questions let us know appreciate all of our supporters and we will see you next time", "0a12CpJ2cnM": "all right everybody I'm going to be doing this small vid on the mini extractor from best value backs as you can see it's tiny and you really don't need that much dry ice I've got the dry ice sitting you know I got that sitting in there and then I've got more in here which I'm going to bury the collection tank into here we can get it super super cold before before I pull a vac on you know on it and before I actually fill it with the solvent so like I said go ahead and get her super super cold because the colder you get the better the vacuum and you know the UM the salt go in there a lot easier and I'll get back with you as soon as it's cold enough and I put the vacuum on it and then we'll fill it all right it's okay you in a second all right just a quick tip while you're letting your tank um get cold get really really cold sub-zero before you pull vacuum in and fill it you're going to be you're going to want to pack your little tube you know on the mini or or even on the other one you're going to want to pack the tube so go ahead and save the caps that they send with it so you can fill it you know you can fill it down to the cap and then you don't have to worry about material falling out you know at either end when you feel it's just a little tip I know it sounds ridiculous you know but people get so excited when they open up everything they end up throwing these away so like I said it's just another tip and I'll be back with you after I'm done back in this alright back again I know it was really quick especially with this vid but anyways now I've got this under dry ice got my line hooked up to the vacuum pump I'm going to go ahead and pull this to full vac it probably won't take much time at all because I mean it's tiny so let's go ahead and see what it does as you can hear that change really fast I'm going to let it sit for a few more seconds but you can hear the Machine change really quick because there's just nothing in there you know the poll of back nine you're polling atmosphere out and there's not much value for that mr. Italy of course you guys understand sand but uh oh and for all you needs there's my sock is gone now I've got the carbon filter up there ha ha thank you no but anyways uh huh now you hear it come and go you know it's at fullback otherwise to me you know the pump would be making a lot more noise now that you hear the noise change go ahead closer off oh sure go ahead and close it and then you can go ahead and turn off the machine and get ready to fill it and then you'll be putting your other part of your mini back in the dry ice while this is you know after you're done filling this you're going to let this you know warm up the room temp um I mean you could cool it a little bit faster but isn't it's not necessary go ahead and let that warm back up and then like I said while you're letting that one back up you go ahead and have put your other one in here get it really cold for full backing and I'll show you that in just a second now see this little red cap in here this is how I fill um without the can tap it just works better for me you guys can use the can tap or this but like I said this is what I use I just find the right nozzle as you can see it's already sub-zero temps I'm going to take it outside and go ahead and fill it up and then I will be back sorry about the pause and start I wish I had a you know a little hesitation in between but I don't feel like editing all that so but anyways I'll be right back alright back again now I have two lines um when you guys go ahead and order your your your units I know they usually come with one line I would go ahead and spend the extra and get yourself another one and the reason for it is just for this fact okay you want to pull a vacuum on your tank on your column but you also want to pull a vacuum and pull all the atmosphere out of this line learn that from the kid old Bret maverick himself which makes a lot of sense you know pull all the back I mean if there's not much of anything in there but since this unit is so small you want to make sure all the atmosphere is gone just so it runs better and that's the same with the bigger units so I've got this open running to that and that is closed that's going to stay closed you know it's just going to but I want all the atmosphere out of this line out I've got my other line up DUP to the tank so when I pull into the pump and to the vacuum pump so when I pull the vacuum it's going to pull everything out of here out of the tank everything out of the column you know it's packed it's a packed column but it's still going to pull all the atmosphere out of tank ah the column and out of the line that you know you're working line all right so I'm going to go ahead and start the pump here how it sounds now just listen and then the change in the pump you've also got your gauge you know on something's on the older units they didn't have the gauges but on this one you got your gauge and it's already dropping really fast because like I said this is a small small unit there's just nothing there to really pull out the atmosphere yeah I mean there's not really much atmosphere in there to pull out now I'm going to go ahead and pull this vacuum then I'm going to go ahead and let it then close my vows I'm gonna let it sit for about 10-15 minutes and then I'm going to pull the back in one more time just um really really make sure that I mean you can hear this thing is so small it goes so fast I'm gonna be amazed that you know I'm just coming to be curious and on a lot of things on how much I get back because I mean I'm only running trim and I mean this is a 45 gram tube so I mean I can't expect much and I'm only using one and of you teen in this room so like I said I can't expect much but I'm still curious to see what kind of outcome you know we're going to get four small personal runs hopefully I think this one is going to work out excellent please but I got a quick rambling and yeah I'm going to go ahead and turn off this valve all my vows were really tight all right now you know there's should be of a key in this line going to the solvent hand now it's still pulling vacuum through here and in the tank so I'm going to go ahead and turn off my other valve now you heard the change in the machine all right I'll be right back all right now I've got the the unit disconnected from the vacuum pump as you can see right there Rep full vacuum and I did find out um that one of my gaskets was kinked so it wasn't holding pressure so I had just had to change the gasket out there was nothing it was my you know user error I probably kinked it when I put it on there uh but and I've also got it all that mystery or out of the line and you know got the tank over here now since it's so small I don't have to throw it up on the ladder Tech I don't know all that stuff you know for those of you who seen my other videos I can pry it you can probably wait for it to warm up just a little bit more and you probably just hold it and turn it upside down I you know don't have somebody else to help me so I'm going to have to go ahead and you know cut it and then turn it and go ahead and start my extraction and then I'll you know get right back from you but this is you know this is pretty pretty decent everything's going really fast and the extraction process is probably going to go really fast too but I'll be right back oh and um right now like I said you're just you got this column packed full of material you've got your tank under vacuum this under vacuum this under vacuum that is all full of a solvent ready to go like I said you can turn this upside down help it out a little bit or you could even you know do the long process just put that in a warm water bath and have it chase you know chase it but like I said it's so simple you guys can you know figure out if you want to turn it upside down or what you know is it small enough you guys can do all that but all right I'll be back with you once I've go ahead and run all this through later all right as you can see I just propped it up on the corner table just for safety not really safety but just I just push that up against it it sits there fine but the can it emptied like in probably four or five minutes if that but I'm going to go ahead and let it you know let it do its thing from at the most ten minutes you're probably done but uh alright I'll be right back alright as you can see uh this thing is you know really light fits in the palm of your hand I mean this is a mini um I'm gonna get ready for the extraction process probably took you know before I start recovery mmm maybe at the most ten minutes if that um so if you had one of these you had a whole bunch of them tubes now I won't even get into all that but anyways I mean that was really quick I'm not you know why again you're not running much I'm only running trim so I'm not expecting much but you never know but uh this emptied really quick so I'm going to go ahead and take this whole thing outside disconnect my lines and then reconnect the line back to UM over on that side on that port for recovery alright everybody and while you can um while you got this out go ahead and take your empty or dry ice back into your cooler and then get once this is empty and everything and you know with all the pressure and the little leftover of gas um then go ahead and you know put this back on dry ice in vacuum so you can go ahead and do your recovery all right I'll be back with you and I get the warm water bath and all that you know ready but yeah it's so far so good alright alright I'm back again um everything you know I got everything hooked up for recovery as you can see it's off of the column on the tank lid line going into your recovery tank which is at full vac on dry ice this is in a warm water bath and it's it's really good I should say a lukewarm water bath because it's only about 80 degrees but uh it'll be it's just going to be a little bit slower but at least it's warmer than what it was when I was all full of frost but I'm going to go ahead and open my recovery tank then I'm going to go ahead and open the work tank and you can hear it already filling into this one and remember the your solvent is going to run from the heat and chase the cold again it's going to run from the heat in the warm water bath go through here and then chase the cold and then it's going to turn back into liquid blah blah blah okay sorry about all that but it's just like I said a lot of people you know and it's just a really basic you know the warmth chases the cold and like I said we'll see what we got I mean there's just a little bit of trim in there I'm not expecting much but I'm gonna give her hmm say 20 minutes go ahead and check you know did check and see where I'm at uh and maybe change the water I don't have to wait that long but I'm gonna do it in a little bit of colder temps because like I said I'll it'll take me a few tries to really see what you know the times and the water temps and stuff like that cuz that's so small I don't want to get warmed up too quick and then have most you know have a actual muffin starting in inside my tank you know I just um but like I said who knows I might even get this little itty-bitty thin layer oils like across the bottom of the can that's barely scraping because there's just not that much material in there I don't know yet but you know we'll see you know I bet you there's going to be enough not for a pore so everyone don't expect me to you know crank out a nice little pore with this can I mean come on now you're not you're you just don't have enough material to run through it that with n enough but anyways um but yeah I'll get back to you guys and girls um here in a bit and uh I don't know you guys can stop here take a siesta whatever you know whatever you can do but uh I'll be back in probably ten to twenty minutes all right everybody all right everyone I'm back and as you can see there we go that's the product all right I can try to pour but it's probably going to make more of a mess here we go all right everybody I'll talk at you later all right everybody um I just thought I'd come back and show you guys you know um I got this left in the can I could probably scrape a little bit more but that's just I'm gonna go ahead and clean it with some Everclear and uh I just keep a a clean thing of you know a jar of Everclear full of what I clean out of the can and later on you know I can I make some winterized stuff for like that there's quite a bit down there still uh but and there's what we got in there you know it's for trim and a little anyone can of ute that you get back I mean yeah um I'm kind of impressed of course it's not deep waxed and anything but I mean if if these little things actually took off you know that could be something you know that we could look into is getting a little uh a little dewaxing spool you know to go on the inline filter you know if that's what you know somebody want to do but they got to remember you know you're already got such a small yield as it is when you go ahead and ink all your lipids and waxes out you're gonna get even smaller but like I said I am I'm pretty impressed uh this little mini is just yeah well like I said I'm gonna go ahead and clean that with some every Claire and I would just put the Everclear right back in the bottle um and then like I said later on down the road you know after whenever I feel like it basically you know then I put it through the distiller and you know go ahead and knock it all down and collect the winterized oil but uh yeah all right all that stuff is gonna eat on the round on these edges are gonna I could probably warm it up then get the rest of that out but I don't know we'll see alright sorry for the rambling", "vu1RKWQtN-M": "[Music] what's up guys welcome back today I have a very exciting video that's been highly requested and I'm sorry it was taking so long I'm going to be showing you guys how I make my extra strong green dragon picture this photo has one cup of liquid and 10 grams of wheat and then I reduced it to 1/3 of a cup meaning that now there is 5 tablespoons in 1/3 of a cup so every tablespoon is 2 grams of wheat you're gonna need the carbs wheat for this recipe and I'll post a link of how to do that below here's what you're gonna need alcohol that is 95% alcohol or higher some coffee filters or cheesecloth a funnel some mason jars and 10 grams of the carb to read the first step is to freeze your Dakkar bleed for at least 24 hours I have already done that and now that it's been over 24 hours I'm going to pour in 2/3 of a cup of vodka that has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours the instructions for this can still be followed even if you're not using the same amount of wheat that I am which is 10 grams all you have to do is pour enough vodka to fill just to the top of the weed now you're going to shake it aggressively for 5 minutes then you'll put it in the freezer for at least 2 hours I ended up leaving mine in the freezer for about 20 hours there's no need to leave it for long within 2 hours I did that simply because I ran at a time now I'm placing a funnel into my mason jar and I'm going to poke some holes into my coffee filter so that it flows through a little bit quicker if you don't have any coffee filters you can also use cheesecloth then place that into the funnel now you can take your weed and vodka mixture out of the freezer and shake it aggressively for another 5 minutes pour your mixture into the filter and try to avoid spilling it over the edge like I do here then wait for it to filter through this can take a while sometimes even up to a half an hour you can see how slowly it comes out of the bottom and then once almost all of the liquid has gone through I'll move the weed around to try and facilitate more of the liquid to be filtered through I put some gloves on because if your fingers are touching the weed and vodka it can absorb some of the THC and we obviously don't want that because that would be a waste now that all the vodka has gone through the filter I'm going to scoop back the weed into the jar you can see how much weed is left in the funnel because I spilled it when I poured it in so again try to avoid doing that if you can [Music] now I'm going to pour in 1/3 of a cup of vodka that again has been in the freezer for at least 24 hours and then I'm going to pour it into my jar weed that I had already filtered once now again if you're using different proportions just use enough to just cover the weed you can just pour it straight into the jar I'm just using the funnel so I can try and get some of that weed that's stuck to it the first time now once again I'm going to shake that jar aggressively for five minutes now using that same jar and same filter that I'd use the first time I am going to pour in the mixture that we had just shaken into the jar that we first used [Music] now this step is optional but I'm going to pour in a little bit of that very cold flash-frozen vodka to get the remnants out of my jar again you don't have to do this but I don't want to waste anything so every little scrap I can get I'm gonna take now once again we're going to let that filter through and it is going to take a long time just like the first round did [Music] once that's all dripped through we're going to place a clean funnel into a clean measuring cup or mason jar as well as a new clean coffee filter and we are not going to poke any holes now we're going to pour it in and we're going to wait for this to drip through this step is not necessary but I like mine very clear so I like to filter out any imperfections if you like you can do this step twice but it does take a long time so I only do it once and I find that the one time is sufficient to get it very pure and clean I'm also going to take the filter with the weed that has been filtered already and press it out as much as I can of course make sure you're wearing a rubber glove so that your skin is not absorbing at all yeah and just try and squish oh as much as you can and then that little bit of leftover that is on the parchment paper there I mean if you're just using this for yourself you could just lick it up I don't know if you don't want to waste it anything works yeah so just squeeze out as much as you possibly can it's been about a half an hour and almost everything has filtered through and we have a total of about a little bit under a cup of liquid because some of that vodka is lost in the extraction process [Music] now we need to reduce our tincture to a smaller amount and we're going to use that by using a double boiler thing which I don't have so I'm making my own version and I'm just using my instant pot so that I can do it in the living room where I have better lighting so I am wrapping some tinfoil around it so I can contain the heat as much as possible and I'm just going to put my measuring cup on to the side of it and then wrap the tinfoil kind of around it that way not too much water and heat is evaporating all you want to make sure is that your bottom of your mason jar or your measuring cup like I'm using is not touching the water so same concept as a double boiler so I both to put it in there but I just have to show off how beautiful it looks it's so clear so golden absolutely beautiful I hope you guys appreciate how wonderful it looks because a lot of my friends and family don't really feel the same way as I do so I just love being able to share this stuff with you guys online please make sure you do this any well-ventilated area so I have all windows and doors in my house opened as well as if your dreams on the stove have your hood fan on there is no smell at all so unfortunately my instant pot broke part way through I don't know what happened so I moved it to the kitchen and I made this sort of contraption thing because I could not put the measuring cup on the edge of the pot because I don't have anything deep enough where the bottom of the measuring cup wouldn't touch the water so I just put a metal strainer on top and then created some insulation with the tin foil kind of like how I did it the instant pot so while you're watching it when it's bubbling a lot like this that's a little bit too much so turn your heat down a little bit you do want a little bit of movement but not that aggressively now I reduced it down to one third of a cup and that took me about an hour and a half I believe you can reduce it more or reduce it less it just depends on how strong you want it to be now it's ready to pour into a jar to save you can use this with a dropper or you can put into your gummies or into your drinks there's so many different ways to use it hopefully you guys will check out some of my gummy videos and try it out in one of those recipes and here's the finished product which is absolutely beautiful thank you so much for watching with the measuring cup I didn't want to waste any possible tincture so I heard some iced coffee into there and now I'm drinking that so that's a good way to make sure you're not wasting anything if you guys enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up leave a comment and subscribe and please let me know if there's any videos you would like to see me record because I would be happy to do that thank you guys so much for watching have a great day [Music]", "O6-wdJagsYk": "just want to say this upfront this is not a sponsored video so there's not going to be any discount codes or anything of that nature throughout this video however the company that I will be talking about did send me some product to try out for free but I'm not letting that influence what I'm about to say you see a lot of these CBD videos that get put out there and people are paid so they're more influenced to say certain things to make the product seem a little bit more promising than what it may be so just want to make you guys aware of that now let's start the video well so now guys welcome to a brand new video thank you for stopping by I really do appreciate it as always so the topic at hand CBD oil you've seen a ton of this on social media I'm sure of it everybody proclaiming that it is the number one care to literally everything under the Sun from anxiety to inflammation joint pain migraines anything can be cured with a few drops of CBD oil but is this actually the truth a company called herb strong and I'm sure you've heard of them before they contacted me about four or five weeks ago asking me if I'd like to try out one of their products for free and me being the curious person that I am I just wanted to see what the hype was all about and I did my research on it so that I wouldn't get tested positive in a drug test which I will touch on later so they decided to send me their $65 bottle of 1000 milligram full-spectrum hemp oil and if you want to see how I reacted to it what my thoughts are on it then you can just go to this time stamp right here but first I think we have to talk about what CBD actually is CBD otherwise known as cannabidiol is actually one of over 100 different chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are exclusive to the cannabis plant now the really cool thing about the human body is that we actually have a couple of receptors known as cb1 and cb2 that are cannabinoid receptors now the cb1 receptors are responsible for psychoactive effects so when you consume something that has a strong affinity for this receptor and makes it active such as delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol otherwise known as THC you're going to experience things that come with being high impaired movement impaired vision you might forget a few things anything comes up being high it's because of the cb1 receptors being active now the cv 2 receptors are actually found in the immune system and these are meant to actually help the human body which is why you see these CBD oil companies proclaiming that they're going to help things like anxiety migraines inflammation joint pain that's because CBD actually has a strong affinity for the cb2 receptors and when active they're supposedly supposed to help with all these things now is this stuff legal to purchase yes and no it really does all depend because boom people hear the word cannabis they instantly freak out it is 100% legal I'm going to stay away from it with a 50-foot pole however it really all depends from a technical standpoint as long as somebody contains 0.3% or less THC then it is perfectly legal to purchase however anything over that threshold is obviously illegal that's why you see things such as hemp powder being sold in grocery stores because it really doesn't contain any THC now this does not mean that it's not going to show up on a drug test like I did say before 0.3% or less if it contains 0.2% if there's a chance that it's going to show up on a drug test so just make sure you are doing a research before purchasing anything CBD related now the company herb strong they did send me some product and I like I said before I did my research before even saying yes to the free products just to make sure that it didn't contain any THC and I took a look at their lab report and I took a look at the left hand bottom of the report and it said that it did not contain any detectable amounts of THC so as I said before if you plan on purchasing something just make sure that you do some research on whatever company it is and make sure that there's no detectable THC in their products because this is a powered looking Channel and I do compete in the USA PL which is an IPF affiliate let's talk about wada for a second or the world anti-doping agency let me take a look at their banned substances list and you're going to see that cannabinoids are actually on their banned list however they do make an exception for cannabidiol which as I did mention before is CBD but as I did mention if your product that you are consuming does contain traceable amounts of THC then you are going to test positive for drugs in your system so as I keep harping on make sure you do your research on any of these products that are CBD related now that we have all that sciency stuff out of the way let's talk about my experience with CBD oil now again I do compete and tested Federation didn't want to take anything that would end up biting me in the ass for lack of better terms which is why I gave the okay to Armstrong to send me out some of their stuff because from what they said it doesn't contain any traceable amounts of THC now I don't suffer from anxiety or migraines multiple sclerosis anything of that nature all I really do suffer from is some joint pains and some inflammation maybe my sleep quality could have improved a little bit but really nothing on the mental health side of things more so just actual physical pains that I do suffer from so I was hoping by taking this product it would help out with those pains a little bit so I followed the instructions for about a week five drops underneath the tongue both in the morning and at night so it's ten drops a day on an empty stomach and after the first week really didn't experience anything at all took a little bit the email one more time and said to give it a couple of weeks so I gave it another seven days same thing five drops in the morning and at night ten drops a day 140 drops over a span of two weeks and the only really noticeable thing that happened was that my sleep quality did improve a little bit my joint pains were still there inflammation was still there nothing had really gone away now I was giving it one more week but I actually increased the dosage this time to eight drops in the morning and at night so it's sixteen drops a day for another week and again no inflammation or joint pains ended up going away which what I was a little bit disheartened by because you see all these posts on social media and they claim that it is the magic elixir that's going to help out with all of your pains and this isn't something that I did experience so I am a little bit disappointed with that so this really isn't a product that I'm going to be using in the future I actually ended up giving the remaining of the remainder of the bottle to someone at work that does suffer from anxiety and hopefully it does help them out a little bit more than I did help me but I just want I just wanted to put out this video to spread a little bit of truth when it does come to the use of these products just make sure that you are doing your research on all this stuff because you really don't want to be wasting $6,500 on something that's potentially not going to work now going back to the whole sleep quality thing can I take this to improve my sleep quality sure am I going to know because I think there's better ways to improve overall sleep quality such as getting some blackout curtains to make sure that it's pitch-black in your room regulating your room temperature so you're always sleeping in the same temperature every single night and just getting more hours of sleep if you like you could improve your sleep quality for a set price of maybe like fifty bucks instead of always spending sixty five dollars a month which can really add up over time and end up being a waste of money if you could do it in a much cheaper fashion so yeah that was pretty much my experience with CBD maybe it just didn't work out for me I'm not sure but I really don't see myself using this product in the future and just be weary of other people that are saying that it's curing everything that is wrong with them because I for one didn't experiences I did a post on Reddit and other people were saying that they experienced pretty much the same thing that I did with CBD oil where their inflammation and joint pain really didn't go away there were some people that did say that it did help out with our migraines but again I don't suffer from those so I can't really speak on those so to say so yeah that's my experience with CBD oil hope you don't hate me for it if you did enjoy the video or you just feel it does deserve one please be sure to drop in to thumbs up because it helped does help to channel out a lot more than you do think if you want to see any more of my videos and please be sure to sub to the channel and hopefully I'll see you with that next one [Music]", "SC-yPds8gWg": "[Music] you hey guys welcome to the no-holds-barred ethanol vs. co2 were going round to here love

John you did a great job last time oh thanks yeah I was fun I I think I did a great job last nobody's saying it we're we're actually all I do is facilitate questions so you guys are the ones who are doing a great job and the questions have been coming in all week yeah very exciting yeah holy cow this is going to be a kind of a ready Rumble moment I think I think so I see the questions already coming in and floating we got a whole bunch of pre questions and then I think we've had like record so we had over like 200 people register for this so pretty amazing we had our little conference here exactly and pretty cool I love it and you know we're gonna go so we want to make this education we want to keep it you know succinct we don't want to really belabor everything so we're gonna try to keep this you know under an hour for sure you know 30 to 45 minutes is where we want to hit and will carry over questions to the next week or you know if we still have this demand we're gonna do it again next week so yeah very cool I know this week is ethanol versus co2 right so what I'd like to do is dr. John if you can just kind of give us a little overview of and set the stage sure and then we'll all start working on the questions that are coming all right all right that sounds good go so a lot of different ways to extract botanicals okay in inevitably you're going to need some sort of solvent that will dissolve the resins that are in the botanical and in order to in order to do that you have to choose your solvent and when you do that you have a lot of different choices you know historically people have used you know organic some people have used in organic some people use gases some sometimes people will use like hydrocarbons for exam in in throughout history of chemical processing it has been basically it's there's been very number of different solvent so huge number of different solvents okay so one thing that we started in 2013 started to look at the different kinds of solvents we just wanted to make sure that we had a very pure solvent we wanted to make sure that we didn't have residuals in there we didn't want to have to deal with contamination risk and so that's one of the reasons why we have why we chose co2 as our as our solvent to really be our muse basically be the object of our affection and so on and so forth it doesn't mean that other solvents won't work like for example you know 2013 I was doing ethanol extractions that really low you know low mmm low temperatures and just there'd a lot of different trade-offs that you need to think of when you choose which solvent system you're going to use so so really the trade-offs are the following kind of into basically a couple different categories the first category would be costs and you know how much does it take how much variable cost is the ethanol extraction or the co2 extraction really adding to your overall cost per kilogram to produce so that's a that's a key issue the second thing would be just residuals in the risk of residuals and you know that is something that you need to think about first for sure because it's going to answer your revalidation cost it's going to add to your you know your testing costs and all of those things so there's there's a there's a bunch of different things that you need to think about with with that and then the third thing is you know availability like nowadays you know there's been a real issue with availability of ethanol itself so we're trying to get f'n all for basically hand sanitizer and hand cleaning and that that's that's a really big issue because we can't even get a 55-gallon drum of ethanol in here or IPA in here to really truly get us so to really get us going on hand sanitizer so how do people who need to command you know hundreds and even thousands of gallons actually operate the answers that they're having a hard time doing that so anyway so there we are that's how I set it up Randall and you know so you got costs you got residual at health and safety and then you have availability and those are the main categories there are some subcategories we'll get into those I'm sure absolutely and the questions are pouring in so we're gonna get to those I there are a lot of questions that are carryovers from last week and some through the week but I want to focus right now on ethanol versus co2 if you guys are okay with that if there's something pressing let me know if you got to jump bail let me know so that we can squeeze that in but okay so question we're talking about the safety issue yeah all right and the cost issue and the availability issue all right but but safety first what talk a little bit about the differences of ethanol again we talked to touched on it last time but touch again on what you what you can use what you can't use why you should use it why most people are using what they probably shouldn't be using right okay so yeah I can talk a little bit about that basically not all ethanol is equal you know there's pure food grade ethanol and that has a very specific you know recipe basically it can't have residual solvents in it you can you can't drink it in large quantities obviously otherwise you know you'll get hurt but you know certainly food grade ethanol is fit for human consumption and then what it happened was people wanted to basically come up with recipes so they think it use ethanol for other different reasons without incurring excise tax and so there's this ttv board it's what it's called and they have different recipes and there's a whole bunch of different recipes you can go in there it's administered by the be ATF and you know some of them are approved for food use and and whatnot and so what happens is the chemical companies take pure ethanol or take a grade of pure ethanol and then they pour in basically denatured soar chemical contaminants and it's meant so that you know the idea there is that it's meant so that people can't consume that ethanol okay so that's where the residuals really come from and so it's actually a additive it's a non natural additive that's added to the ethanol and so you have basically two different categories of ethanol when you have a food grade and the other you have denatured ethanol and the denatured ethanol of course is the issue because the denature ins themselves there's really hard to completely remove those in fact you can see them in a lot of the extracts that you're coming out of ethanol so okay so the key is I mean taking that down to my level yeah don't drink your vanilla extract well don't drink your vanilla extract yeah but you know also don't use ethanol that is you could you could run you in your car for example right to extract a food that you now are going to consume that would be kind of on the denatured side yeah what you're pumping in your car you're not gonna go take a drink of the hose at the gas station right okay right so so don't do that right all right so that's that's the key and you know that's my level right okay so other areas of question are you also seeing an issue with availability from methanol as well as ethanol oh good question I don't know we didn't really look at that we don't buy methanol if someone's gonna use methanol as an extractant or someone as an extraction solvent it would work but I don't think so it probably doesn't have the same issues because it's not used methanol is not used as a taproot hand sanitizer got it that should tell you something by the way oh yeah yeah exactly okay another question about costs so we we use co2 predominantly in our processes nice what we do we write we like that and from a cost perspective can you give us a benchmark of cost for co2 versus a denatured in today's market yeah versus if you could get it all right is food grade okay so the cost for denatured versus food grade yeah it's why I don't know actually I I'd have to I'd have to look at the prices I don't have those numbers but I think it's at least 10x less costly okay and it has a lot to do with denatured versus denatured would be 10x less costly than yeah at least that and I don't have the exact numbers but yeah but you know if you're going to use ethanol as an extracted you should you should use food grade ethanol absolutely yeah which is going to be you know 10x higher right and denatured ethanol right and is there a cost variable what's the cost variable from co2 yeah solvents Oh first right well then that's really where co2 starts to shine essentially because you know first of all you have a lot of different factors that are contributing to your variable costs okay so if you think about what what is it that that costs you know what is it that's contributing to the cost you have the loss of the ethanol you have the actual ethanol itself you have to change over the ethanol because you can't use it indefinitely because it's going to continuously get you know contaminated okay and you can't continuously do that even if you try to reprove it you have costs to revalidate it if you're in a GMP environment right yeah then you have the costs associated with you know the actual mmm say the the actual raffinate is what they call it they spent material that has a bunch of ethanol in it okay and so if that when that has a bunch of ethanol in it in some jurisdictions it's considered hazardous waste so that's adding to your variable cost and then you have to cool all that down so that's also adding the variable cost that somebody had asked about electricity yes and variable cost typically you know for like one ton a day for like if you're just looking at the extraction component you're looking at maybe seventy seven bucks per day to run like a you know co2 extractors as opposed to like four hundred and eighty to five hundred dollars a day to run ethanol extractors and that's mostly due to the what they call the heat of vaporization issues Wow with ethanol it just puts a lot of energy to get it into the vapor phase on top of that we haven't even covered the fact of insurance and explosion-proof rooms and facilities issues and all of those hidden costs that are part of that process right that's right yeah that's more like infrastructure issues so you have you have to two different things you have your variable cost and then you have your obviously your infrastructure costs and those those things are really you know both of those together really make ethanol as a solution very costly prepared to co2 I mean just one other thing on that we got you know four cents five cents a pound for co2 yeah I mean it's ridiculously inexpensive that's so that's a good deal yeah that's a good deal and a good memory on the kilowatt per hour consumption I think Bowden you asked that question and that is a you know $77 a day running co2 versus $500 a day roughly just under for an ethanol whoo that's crazy are there any white papers on co2 to maintain the integrity of the terpene profile okay so you know that that's one of the things so when you when you use ethanol to extract all the terpenes are coming out into that extract okay and then then you're basically your decarboxylate in it and then you are and then you're probably going into some sort of distillation process after that so during that post-processing after you get the extract out you usually lose all those terpenes okay so one of the things that is is very cool about co2 is that you're able to do a couple different things first of all you're able to run in subcritical mode which is a very common technique and done for years to get out some of the more volatile compounds into a pre fraction that's a very soupy pre fraction of terpenes essentially the other thing that you can do wick we do we do pre-processing and we we gather all of our terpenes out ahead of time so like for example this is this is a jar of basically pure terpenes well so they're they're coming out so they're done before extraction it's great about that is they're not degrading so it's got a lot of the you know a lot of that small terpenes that are you know have a contribute a lot to the flavor and aroma so you want to try to maintain that so that that's really what you know processing techniques really allow you to do great and and you know with ethanol they're kind of all stuck in there there's really no way to get them out once they're in there unless you do a whole nother distillation process and things like that so so that's the issue is that so in the process part of your methods where you remove the terpenes where you can do that that's when you can capture the most yeah of the terpenes yeah that's that's excellent yeah okay that way they're not degrading yeah you know which is really great so can can co2 be used for processing other bio botanicals absolutely I mean co2 is used right now in dust really you know I think that at the end of the day you're talking even for example decaffeination of coffee is a really well known means of you know extraction what do people use that instead of say ethanol well the ethanol would over extract it doesn't have the selectivity and then could you imagine what it would cost them an energy and all that to really get that ethanol out it'd be really really difficult to do so you know that that's that's the that's the main thing there's also other applications we've done you know lavender we've done wheatgrass sapa meadow there's a bunch of different you know options there for you know different ginseng do you know and goes peppers just in case and hops oh it was pet person hops I can only imagine ghost pepper extract yeah sounds like an outtake yeah I think so we're gonna we're gonna get some of that so no not so so excellent so what we're exiting questions excellent questions excellent answers love the overview of the of some of these things one of them that came it's a carryover from last week somebody have really good memory what's your favorite scotch oh my favorite Scott yeah oh I like the Baldini in that's my favorites it's a Highland and so yeah that I really like that's good I love it and I've tasted it and it's very good yeah I John's a scotch guy I'm a bourbon guy so and I get along I'm a rye bourbon guy and I mean we do have competitions yeah we do he wins so we're good okay back to ethanol versus co2 one of the questions that came up is are we just using co2 because that's our business and then building all of these questions and models to justify that all right or is this real actual validated stuff yeah I can see that yeah like a guy with a hammer every problem is a nail type of question okay yeah I get that no I mean look I'm an a I'm a trained analytical chemist I'm an expert in separations that basically have been trained as a separation scientist chemical engineer so for the last 20 years I've been practicing in that field in you know I had practiced about 11 12 years from both an engineering standpoint and from materia standpoint and from a you know scientific standpoint when I went in I didn't have a piece of equipment that I was gonna build I didn't so I chose my medium sure and you know so I chose it for purposes of basically cleanliness quality the ability to reach clinical grade you know materials not having to worry about residuals mostly health aspects because I didn't want to deal with the risk of residuals and I also didn't want to you know I up and I know as a chemist I can always measure those residuals hey I get there if you used them I can see them in there is that very very low levels and I can see them in there in fact you know we we do we have a laboratory that runs okay a lot of you know like samples for people so the ethanol ethanol people that turn in samples they have residuals in their acetone propanol they have hexane heptane in their there at the low low levels but you can see them in there so essentially you know you could get a past test on the you can get a past test with the analytical results but you could still have a lot of that stuff in there and to me that is a big problem because you know you can you can really kind of it's really not good I mean I'll give you an example here I made up I made up a tincture here this is a tincture it hey this would pass the test of the u.s. peace for 64 67 which is the the testing so it would pass it but it has in there it has a CD acid has butanol has all these different chemical Pantanal are pentane it has in there it has ethanol as ethyl ether in there formic acid heptane ice so if I sent this sample in at you know and I sent it to a laboratory they they would send it back to me and they say it passes all the tests because it's underneath the level here why don't you take a smell of that and you open it up there right oh my gosh that's my point right there that's a that's a completely legal tincture in its it's basically made up almost a hundred percent of solvents that are illegally okay to have in your product it smells kind of like your plain glue it's you could probably use it as it's it's something so anyway that that's those are the main reasons so as an analytical chemist I'm not just we're not just making up data to to really provide a foundation for our the why we do things you know butane was used in was used a lot when I first started this and you know we looked at butane we actually ran butane we ran all the residuals they're all in there no way okay i we were doing like ethanol extractions that was at minus 40 degrees with you know back in 2014-2015 okay I mean we yeah we did it yeah and it was it was all there and sure enough I mean you know the only way we could make it really work from a financial standpoint is if we use denatured ethanol well as soon as the denatured ethanol came in then it was like okay well we're never gonna get out those residuals and of course you can get them below the level of what the FDA says is safe but then they're in there right and that's what that but then you got that in literally if you if you had a safe level of heptane for example in your tincture okay which the the fda says is 5000 ppm and you took three dropper falls per day you would be consuming about 470 milliliters worth of heptane per year the issue with that is that the FDA has said okay 5000 ppm is okay to have in your teacher because we do not have the data to show that it's unsafe okay just opposite of what they said about CBD for example Wow well we don't have the data to show that it's safe so that you can't have it at all whatever you know I mean so it's it's kind of an interesting thing and it's an interesting history but they cited one paper written in 1981 - just to say that hey look it doesn't look like it's gonna act in your neuro neuro system but you know we know a lot things about biochemistry since 1981 like for example you know all the effects of solvents and cognitive effects and forty years ago yeah that's a long time it's time for another paper I think it's time yeah and yeah so anyway or they need to update their dossier but they didn't do it yet so they're still you could still have a lot okay so yeah I'm gonna shift gears just a little bit more because there's a lot of questions coming in thing you know well are there benefits of using ethanol in your process and and you know can you do that and and I think what you said is that yeah if you're using food grade or medical grade ethanol go for it that's good but your costs are really high right now especially now and even later there's another question that came in about costs and to to operate and it's a lot less costly because of using co2 versus ethanol and it's a lot less costly because of power so power consumption doctor John said a moment ago is like seventy seven dollars US per day to run a co2 processing and it is five hundred dollars day up to five hundred dollars a day using running ethanol for power so I mean that's a giant that's a seven times more expensive process yeah right okay so that's number one number two we use ethanol in our plan right we do use ethanol in various places so III think it's important to say we we don't think ethanol as a whole is evil it's just not probably the best business practice because of costs because of testing because of availability because of a lot of different things that you talked about because of the residuals yeah especially denatured ethanol yeah and if you move into food grade or medical grade or organic grade yeah ethanol that's not a problem but now other places that we you ethanol in this especially as we are right go well yo yeah we do yeah we use in different places and we use food grade ethanol we use it for winterization process for example yeah not a problem I mean we we don't have to worry about the residuals because we pay we pay the extra amount for the you know for the food grade ethanol but that food grade ethanol we also don't have to worry about the residuals either then yeah as we got that so you know I did I did a quick just kind of a bullet point list and it's up on the board here if you want to focus up on that so this is the variable cost you have the cost of solvent changeover you have the cost of solvent loss you have the cost of revalidation of the solvent you have labor you have the cost of solvent removal you have the cost of startup consumables in other words you know reusing or how much is going to take you for you to actually start up your operation your cost of utilities that's the power and all that loss of product to carbon a lot of people use carbon a lot you know basically to clean up their their extracts loss of product to raffinate in other words not getting all the product out the availability of the solvent the biomass being hazardous waste and also when you get rid of all of the ethanol from that biomass you're creating a lot of the Yossi and HAP which is you know those those things are you have to have permits for that so it's different than co2 so you know basically if you if you add up all of those costs those as from a variable perspective and you compare it with co2 it's not even in the same ballpark you know in terms of the amount of money would cost you to create you know a kilogram of of you know CBD oil co2 is way less it's half about so it's it's a it's a big deal so you know a lot of people also talk well the ethanol equipment is a lot less costly in that that's true the ethanol equipment is a lot less costly in fact you will pay almost yeah maybe anywheres from two-thirds to you know like double basically the cost you know more worth more foresee Atrocitus right exact versus ethanol so it'll take about when you add up you know basically the operating costs and you you basically you're at the same point in about two months worth of operation for analyst two months two months pay back on that much equal right okay right so that's where the crossover takes place and then the co2 from an operating standpoint just starts to kill ethanol completely yeah well because then you've taken that cost differential out right okay so now it's pure operating cost right okay one of the questions that comes in a couple of times here is what about throughput okay give us an example of a co2 process throughput versus an ethanol process throughput okay well I mean we're sitting in a five tonne per day facility and we did a tour on that you can go see air cooler oh yeah and that's at extract lab calm right /live - tour yeah so yeah you can go see that and essentially so you know typically there's ethanol and you may have one tonne solution then they have even larger solutions or so they're both scalable I don't I don't say that they're not both scalable they definitely are both scalable so um what what is an issue of scalability really has to do with occupancy in your building mmm okay so if I'm gonna scale ethanol at some point in time in very very soon I'm gonna my my the same occupancy like there's F occupancy and H occupancy okay okay H occupancy is where you have like a lots of solvent in the building okay and so your occupancy is gonna change oh yeah versus and so and then your insurance is gonna change on top of that and so you have a whole bunch of other barriers there that you really need to be thinking about like you know how much infrastructure do I need or what are my C 1 D 2 rooms or C 1 D 1 rooms I'm gonna need what you know you know how much it's gonna cost me now for insurance now that when my insurance company comes through sure even if it's outside there you know it's still on site so and then what about the building occupancy itself you have to change they'll change that over so there's a lot of different because you need to scale up you've got to accommodate all of that ethanol yeah you do that you need to use okay so from a co2 process footprint and maybe I know we can answer the question if we're doing a ton of day mm-hmm how big of a space do you need to do that yeah so with co2 basically four hundred square feet four hundred square feet yeah so that would be three of our 180 units essentially and you know in eight hundred square feet you'd have enough to put an elephant in the room - that's a fun today yeah yeah yeah - like 800 square feet would be 2 tons a day oh my gosh yeah so it's it's really really small it's really not you don't need to have a lot of space for that now there's there's that's just for the equipment itself and then you have you know you do have like you have to have a co2 place to put on your co2 usually that's a bulk tank that sits outside or you can even have like a cylinder tanks that's it inside with our co2 cage for example will be a good example that yeah ok so so on a comparative level do you have an idea on how much floor space it might take for an ethanol facility I think they're for eternity yeah they're pretty comparable ok I mean they're pretty comparable I I think you can fit it all in to a very small space so you know so I don't think that there's really that much of a difference between say how much space is it takes you to do ethanol versus how much space it takes you for a ton of day same day same thing and the same thing for 5 tonnes a day I mean they're pretty compact okay um I would say that you know the full full facility you know you can you can do five tons a day you know probably less than less than 15,000 square feet well it's not including all the storage and you know all your inventory and everything you know that's both bulky biomass that you have to store and sure if like that so at the actual extraction process right that's what you need right yeah yeah I mean yeah that's everything that it's like packaging oh wow that's everything okay so that's that's you don't need a lot of space no and I mean you want to if you want to pull it out if you want to like corridors in there and things like that you know for GMP purposes they'll get you in some more space okay you know a lot of people want to have everything together really close when they're doing GMP though so that it so that everything's you know they have different corridors and things like that okay good that's excellent can you talk okay so we talked a little bit about ethanol being used elsewhere in our process sticking with ethanol versus co2 and you said we use ethanol food-grade or organic grade depending on what we're running right at the time right so that's for winterization right right and then we also use ethanol for some of our clean in place yeah we do yeah so CIP systems are called clean in place systems are really important for maintaining you know maintaining the cleanliness of your system so if you are using ethanol the clean out your extractor or you're using ethanol to clean out your your your distillation systems and things like that those are typically low volume and we use ethanol specifically for that purpose and it works great ethanol is a good solvent along those lines you know a lot of that kind of just as a sidebar Randy you know a lot of people say that co2 is not a good solvent well that kind of is true it's not a very good solvent and that that's actually that's actually the benefit that's actually what we see is a benefit because you use it and then you just increase or decrease the pressure or you know and it goes away so that's that's wonderful look at last week it's just bubbles right as opposed to you have to cook you basically have to evaporate ethanol that takes a lot of energy to do that so that the fact that it's not a good solvent is actually a huge benefit okay so excellent okay thank you can you use the co2 as a way to remediate THC or how do you what is that okay that's for that well I don't think yeah the co2 is not really selective in that way so there really is no option for someone who says okay I want to use co2 too to remove THC now if you have a chromatography process which is pure 99 which is one of our products you can use as co2 in conjunction with another solvent to do that separation of THC and CBD so that that's that's what that is all about yeah okay so is that a place where we will selectively use ethanol on a case to remove th state yes yes yes food grade organic okay so so again our primary process from a cost perspective is co2 right and that's that is the benefit in the beauty but you know we're making decisions based on on business okay yeah and it's our job to help you make money to grow revenue especially in this market right so how do we help you grow revenue reduce costs do that and so we want to have these very open conversations and we're not afraid of the tough questions these are crucial conversations for all of us and it's you know we're not in the this divisive you know red vs. blue conversations although sometimes it seems like it gets better that's crazy it goes there really quickly I don't know why really yeah it's it's important to say all right we know that there's a huge embedded base of ethanol out there the question is how do you how do you take the step to stay in business to stay relevant to stay active when you can't get effin all anymore right what do you do that's an issue so we've got you know my small footprints that you know we can put in for you there's but you know you should consider a small footprint of co2 anyway I mean that's just another thing I'm throwing that out there I'm not I'm not trying to pitch I'm just saying it's just a good business model for these kind of occurrences right when product when supply chain is it sucks yeah I mean you know I think that anybody who needs help understanding what the what the comparison looks like from a business perspective happy to go through that yeah you know the other thing is I'd say also I have personally put in millions into manufacturing facilities and so I I I do that knowing what the end result is going to be well and so when you think about it from that standpoint I'm talking to you not only as a someone who is a scientist who is an extraction scientist I don't have a lab coat on I guess that MIT doesn't make me a scientist but you know I also I put a lot of money of my own money into you know basically into extraction facilities and yeah I mean Millions and that's that was my choice because I knew after doing all the calculations and everything that I would spend X amount of dollars in infrastructure I could actually get insurance and I would be able to produce at you know half the cost so that makes a huge huge difference it's just it's just good it was your choice your business practice and and you had the wherewithal and you had the intelligence to really research all of it and look at it from a very pure scientific perspective and boy when he makes decisions and I need a decision from him we we explore all hypotheses yes it's true it's true and you know we we need to make sure it's or that we're doing that I'd say it's good business to make sure that there's no that that your analytical chemist can't can't measure residuals in your stuff yeah that's good business yeah and the reason it's good business is because it backs up your brand promise yeah which is purity and consistency and potency and all that stuff if we get in we get in some stuff I tell you as an analytical chemist we can see everything everything daunted you know parts per trillion if we want to we can see it and the deal there is you just don't want to in a yes accepts from your analytical laboratory that says okay yeah this stuff is great is not good enough in my opinion I'm giving the I'm giving stuff that we make to our friends and family and to our customers and and so we have a brand promise I care deeply about not eating solvents yes that's an analytical chemist I mean yeah I mean it's just something I don't like I mean I've had yeah I've been exposed to solvents you know in my entire career and you know we have what's called PPE and you know everybody knows about that no masks and everything and we do things in hoods and we don't even want to breathe this stuff and yet it's okay to have 5000 ppm and you're in your tincture give me a break not for ridiculous no would you get that to your kids no way no I wouldn't do it but but the laboratory will tell you it's all okay we have searched for it and said it's all okay and for most of us so we don't lose our pets huh would we give it to our pets no we would give it to our pet that's more important okay questions yes this is a follow-up question and so I want to revisit it yeah the question from Iran is can your system be used 100% ethanol free or do you always need it for winterization oh yeah you can yeah you can run it winter you can you can skip winterization with using subcritical and supercritical methods so you can do that you just you're limited on the products that you can get out of it you know you can you know you can also use like in distillation methods you can distill like you know like crude and stuff like that yeah so there's methods to do that the reason it when you get up into tonnage yeah that's really when it makes sense to have the ethanol and you know so you know because it's a lot faster when you're using super subcritical methods it's just a lot slower and and if you're using food grade at those levels you're using far less ethanol in those processes and it's food grade right so you're less worried about all of this yes Nicky stuff exactly okay good icky technical very technical rumor from over here okay these questions are awesome keep bringing them in this is great I ate all of your input through the day we're gonna stick here with a couple more questions but I wanted to but before for those of you who have to bounce I want to make sure that you know what we're doing we're doing this again next week we've got too many questions to even cover today I hope you've enjoyed it as much as we have you know talking and and sharing our information love all of the love all of the information that you are putting in the chat love that and would love to continue to ask these questions I'm not sure what our next topic next week but based on these questions I think it's pretty gonna be pretty good so look for your emails and bringing the questions let us know what you really want to hear here about a job before we get to these final few questions is there anything else that you want to say that I wasn't able to ask we didn't bring up that you really want to cover on this ethanol versus co2 debate I think that from standpoint of purity and purity it's a big deal and then from the standpoint of residuals it's it's a big deal so you know I would I would invite you to when you do your own purchases that that's something I'm really serious about when you do your own purchases kind of look for the co2 label it makes a difference because there's no risk of residuals in that in that so I would I would just recommend that as a something for you and your children and for your family all right thank you very much umm also as as we go through we do have you know our team is you know ready to answer questions and you know after this there's a link somewhere right guys - you can click on that we call them CBD jam sessions they're 20 minutes max and it's we're there to answer questions to walk through where you're stuck where you have problems where you're dissatisfied where you're having difficulties you know bring bring those to us sign up for CBD jam session it's nothing it'll take you right to a place where you can schedule a 20-minute calendar linked with one of our guys and they're just there to answer your questions so you know go ahead and do that the the other one sattva just sent another question here Safa is making tinctures oh yeah so with teachers the question is which method of extraction is best for that and you know we've talked a lot at a beer deep line right so this is just bringing it right to reality right I mean if you're gonna make a product you should be using either well I would use full-spectrum distillate or I'd use full spectrum like winterized oils for your teachers and then I would take that nice terpene mix and you know add add flavor so you have the essence of the plant in there that's what I would do and it works great I mean it tastes good and yeah a lot of people make their teachers up with either MCT oil which is MCT oil or they'll use olive oil or something like that and it should be pretty easy to to make up excellent so you said what you're saying is you can dial in your own formulation absolutely and own concentration and yeah and dial it and write some of these you know with the high terpene levels and the the pulling those out early we the smell is very lots of chlorophyll it's yeah it's a really nice smell yeah and you'll like that so there's going to be no question from your customers as you're building your brand if those terpenes are in there the big thing that people want to know is is there really CBD inside yeah and that's right and when you can smell it yeah I'm like oh yeah yeah must have this is good it has a yeah it adds to the brand authenticity obviously and yeah you want to you know you don't want to also I would also recommend that you stay away from like synthetic you know synthetic you know what terpenes okay you know you can buy like you know pure grade synthetics I wouldn't do that because obviously contaminants in there I would say you know go ahead use the plant this there's there's literally thousands of compounds in in something like this you know and it's all natural it comes from the plant you don't use a lot you know use a lot so you just put a little bit in for flavor and aroma right yeah okay good okay couple deep dive questions now to and end this Q&A session Amuro asks is there any difference between the extraction of THC and CBD it move down the page sorry co2 and and what are the boiling points is the question Oh at the boiling points okay so let me let me talk first about the extraction of CBE sources THC and you know there are some differences it has to do with solubility of the cannabinoid you know we we typically tend to get a better extraction efficiency with THC as compared to CBD so you know we're basically averaging right around 90 90 to say 85 to 95 percent extraction efficiency with CBD with average right around ninety percent that's what co2 when you are looking at you know extraction of THC it's it's more like ninety to a hundred percent with an average of 95 to 96 percent you know recovery so those are some of the things you need to think about the THC just comes out easier it's more soluble I think that they're negligible differences in solubility between THC and CBD for ethanol ethanol will dissolve everything including your tongue if you take some of that every clear on there or or or if you have lots of Scotch of course you can you cast drink scotch of course will dissolve your tongue it's well known yes so yes straight this yes cats drink this topics your eyes water is so good that it's so good yeah okay couple couple more questions circling back to terpenes is are there additional benefits I guess we can't really say benefits what are their advantages potential advantages of terpenes over flavor and aroma are there if their therapeutic the question comes in are there parrot their pubic effect effects etc yeah yeah there are and I think that a lot of people have now tried to correlate the the entourage effect okay and they've tried to show that hey look if you have this particular terpene in combination with this particular can cannabinoid ratio that it's going to be metabolized better in your body because you have these particular markers or these particular proteins or these particular enzymes so it actually the science everyday is getting better and better and there's just published all kinds of published papers on this and it's a very exciting time because people are starting to use that information now to make therapeutic claims now part of the issue with therapeutic claims is that there are therapeutic claims you know so I think that I think in general that look you have a plant you wanna you want to try to maintain the naturalness of the plant sure so you get a full spectrum you get a full spectrum terpene like what we're what we're painting and you put that in so you get full spectrum and it just matches the plant and so that I think that's the best situation for for most people you know I think also there's a lot of brain science I'm friends in the neurology areas and stuff and they talk about aroma as being a significant advantage in all essential oils that's one of the key benefits if you're smelling lavender that's why they when you go and buy it at the health food store it says calm right right or if you want some energy you're doing eucalyptus or whatever and they have those euphemistic names attached to those essential oils right and it's the similar thing with the terpene because it's got that rich chlorophyll right Roma right something happens in your brain and when you when okay so guys do this all the time right this is horrible smell this okay right right same thing you're like okay you're already predisposed to know you're gonna hate it right right pretty much yeah it's what you do and this what unfortunately is what we do to each other yeah but that that's on the inverse side it's so there is there are those advantages in benefit right sorry so but those are a lot of studies you can google that kind of brain science so those advantages are there holy cow lots more questions coming in one question that has come up is the current market and where it's going because there have been some issues and I I don't like to make the whole issue about you know current I'd like we like to have an evergreen effect on these but this is there's a timely question for all of us on how to maintain cause how to grow how to how do we lock arms together and and protect the market out there because there's some processors that are doing splits or premise extraction and different things that are right kind of killing the market a little bit right can you speak to that and where this market is headed and is this just kind of a short blip right what are your thoughts well I you know look there's the studies that hair out there the market studies you you really should use those as your guiding light to the market so people use those for investment and you know what they did was they if you talk to the analysts who wrote these reports they and I I used to do this basically building up a market model from the base and then and then adding on the revenue year-over-year and you think it's going to grow and you come up with a model and then and then you continuously improve that model so there are many different analysts that are out there that are basically saying okay we're at a 1 to 5 billion dollar market now and some people are saying 5.8 billion dollar market that's supposed to grow up to you know 20 plus billion in the next several years like five or six years so I think all of the people who are involved in this market from the standpoint of operation or a brand or our extraction or even growing you know there's going to be these ups and downs that we're experiencing but or that can experience a temporary lapses in the market but we're still on this overall trajectory okay you know all boats will rise with the tide and we're with the basically the tide is coming in so you know make sure that your boat doesn't have any holes and it is not all boats but but you know if you have a hole in your boat don't you know you're gonna have a hard time floating just get in the market you know ride the market up and you know there's going to be lots of opportunities there's gonna be roll ups that are occurring there's going to be you know businesses that are purchased maybe maybe yours is the great brand that consumers really connect with you know you have the opportunity to do that it's kind of a white space so I would encourage you to take heart and you know go for it absolutely and that's what we need to do is really go for it so what I'd like to do is make sure that you know we answer your business questions as well you know John talked about his background my background is 30 plus years in roll ups acquisitions businesses I've written a book called the intelligent small business I even got a Congressional Medal of Honor for helping manage that and $7 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks who knows who knows anyway we're here and those are the kind of questions we're looking for to help you with even when you do the CBD jam sessions we don't need to just talk about your processes and things we're happy to talk about your your cash flow how do you do revenue how are you defining your brand how are you defining your your your market avatar what are you doing how are you generating revenue how can we come alongside you and help generate more profitable revenue for yourself I had a business long ago one of my first businesses that I started in the late these early 80s that's hold I am and I was getting all this revenue in revenue revenue revenue it's great what I didn't realize at the time was that I was like losing 10 cents for every dollar I brought in so the more revenue that was coming in the faster I was losing money and we don't those are the kind of stupid-ass things that we do yeah and you know that we have tripped over that we can bring to you and answer questions for so that's part of this Q&A session each week that we want to bring to you is is the manufacturing the processing for this industry the business side what we can do from a revenue generation perspective what can we do to help you that's why we're here yeah and basically yeah so so test us let's go and I don't we're not trying to you know anchor ourselves on one side of the desk we want to lock arms with all of you and say how do we get better you know we all need to be in that mindset where we can actually with more information we change our mind and you know we're of that same ilk let's let's talk let's have good productive dialogue so that we all can ride this wave up to you know the twenty twenty six billion is the number I heard but who knows where that is but you know that's just in the next three years so that's giant let's lock arms and let's go there together I appreciate you being here John amazing they go today too this is good we're gonna be back next week watch for you or emails scribe we do have a really good extraction advanced extraction guide you can download schedule your CBD jam session there's a link at the backside of this or you'll get that and we're happy to have those conversations with you Tim and Barbara and Lucas will be happy to you know talk to you and if we need to get involved happy to do that as well watch the live tour that John mentioned earlier he did a great job going through that it's it's really cool seeing this five ton of date facility in action it's insane so so that's good like us on YouTube if you would like us Instagram Facebook whatever you can that would be really cool and it helps us know you can throw your questions anywhere in any of those mediums they'll kind of funnel to us yeah good any parting words John no I just thanks for attending and yes subscribe on YouTube and we'll be catching you next week alright guys thank you for being here you guys are awesome questions are amazing sorry we couldn't get to all of your questions but we are here and I look forward to seeing you next week I know you", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "hf5coIth3Wk": "alright guys so in this video we're gonna be talking about the best way to take ashwagandha in order to maximize results so let's dive right in hey guys my name is Zack Allison and welcome to nutrition library or trusted resource for an evidence-based approach to supplementation if you haven't already or you are new to the channel I would definitely recommend hitting that red subscribe button that's below this video so that you can stay up to date with all of our future content thank you so much so we're gonna break this video down into four primary parts the first being when to take ashwagandha the second being how long to take it the third thing we're going to talk about is other compounds that you can actually take with ashwagandha and while you're cycling off of it and then the fourth thing that we're gonna get into is how to maximize absorption so again the first thing we're going to talk about in this video is when to take ashwagandha and the truth is there really isn't a best time to take off lagonda it really just depends on your own personal biochemistry and unfortunately we just don't have a ton of research that's available at the moment on when the best time to take it might be and because it has so many active ingredients in the active ingredients that are in ashwagandha do several different things some of them are stimulating some of them are more sedating and relaxing and so it kind of presents a tad bit of an issue when it comes to trying to pin down and nail down a perfect time to take it now the two primary ways of taking ashwagandha are either one in a split dose throughout the day or two in a single dose throughout the day now ashwagandha has a relatively short half-life of around two to four hours now because it has a half-life of roughly two to four hours this essentially means that after about 12 hours that 95% of the active ingredients of ashwagandha are typically out of your system by then now with the understanding that ashwagandha is half-life is around 2 to 4 hours and is excreted 95% of it is skree today after 12 hours the optimal dosing period is gonna be taking it every 12 hours now for most people this means taking a dose in the morning and then also taking another dose in the evening time and essentially splitting the daily amount that you're aiming for across those two doses now by doing this you are gonna get the most consistent intake of ashwagandha and reap the most benefits from it however the downside to this is obviously that you're having to keep up with making sure whether or not you actually took your morning dose and your evening dose so for those of you that are very very simple and like to take all of your supplements or whatever it might be in one single dose this may not be the best route for you but for those of you that are trying to maximize the effects of ashwagandha this is definitely going to be the route that you want to take so now the alternative to taking a split dose in the morning and in the evening time is obviously going to be just simply taking it once per day and now I actually kind of veer from some of the conventional wisdom when it comes down to one particular time of day to take ashwagandha a lot of people will actually tell you to either one take it right when you wake up in the morning because that's when cortisol is naturally highest and one of the things that ashwagandha is primarily used for is to reduce cortisol and then the other way that people typically recommend that you take it is by simply taking it in the evening time before you go to sleep in order to aid in sleep quality I actually don't like either of those options because ashwagandha again does have stimulating and relaxing properties to it and so by taking it in the evening time you do run the risk of it keeping you up and kind of disrupting your sleep patterns to some degree and by taking it in the morning you can actually kind of cause to much relaxation if you're taking your entire dose in the morning time and because of this I'm a huge fan of taking your single dose in the afternoon with lunch and this essentially ensures that you're not going to disrupt your sleep patterns or cause too much relaxation in the morning time and kind of finds a happy medium between those two in order to reap the full benefits while also minimizing the side effects now one of the huge questions that I get almost on a weekly basis is how long it can I take ashwagandha and this is a very legitimate question because ashwagandha is like a lot of compounds and that it actually loses its effectiveness at a specific dose if you continue to take it indefinitely which is why it's traditionally recommended that you cycle your ashwagandha intake and what is traditionally recommended is what I would call a macro cycle and that's simply just a fancy term that I like to personally use in order to delineate between the two types of cycles that you can do and so again the first way that you can cycle your ashwagandha intake is through a macro cycle which would simply just be a two to three month period where you take it every single day followed by a period of roughly one to two months after that where you completely abstain from taking it now the benefit to this is obviously that while you're in that three month on period you're able to pretty much take it every single day without having to wake up and wonder and think about and keep up with well did I take it yesterday do I need to take it today and so it makes it a whole lot easier especially for individuals that are just getting into or supplementation and don't want to think about these things but the downside however is obviously that after that three-month period that you do need to go through a one to two month period where you're not consuming it in order to prevent your body from developing a tolerance to the compounds that are in ashwagandha and this is why I'm actually a bigger fan of doing what I call micro cycles which is where you take ashwagandha for one - five days followed by a period where you do abstain from taking it that is right around half - equal the amount of time that you were taking it so for instance if you want to do an on cycle of about three days that would mean that she would take it for three days wouldn't that be in the morning and in the evening time or just in one dose in the afternoon and so you would take it for about three days followed by a period of one to three days where you don't take it and I am a huge fan of this for two primary reasons one is that it prevents your body from developing a tolerance to the compounds that are in ashwagandha and the second reason is that it actually allows you to take it indefinitely because of that and this is essentially what tolerance is at the end of the day so tolerance is essentially when your body begins to adapt to the intake of specific compounds in such a way that those compounds then become less and severely less effective at doing what you were consuming them to do now there are three primary ways that your body does this one is by simply up regulating the enzymes that your body uses in order to break down the compounds that you're ingesting so there are very specific enzymes that your body uses in order to break ashwagandha down and this actually goes across the board for almost any compound that you're consuming and really any pharmaceutical for that matter as well and so your body up regulates the enzymes that are required to break that compound down which means that your body's actually able to excrete it at a higher rate now the second way that your body adapts to the consistent intake of specific compounds is that it actually withdraws the receptors that are on cells that respond to those compounds it withdraws those into the cell in order to make the cells less responsive and less sensitive to that compound and it makes sense if you think about it because your body is always trying to get to a state of homeostasis so if you are throwing something into your body that is drastically increasing neurotransmitter output or directly binding to the receptors on specific cells your body essentially doesn't want that to happen on a consistent basis and so in order to remain at a state of homeostasis it will actually begin to pull those receptors into the cell so that it's not as responsive to those compounds now the third way that your body develops tolerance is actually downstream of that so once those receptors that are on cells withdrawal into the cell after a prolonged period of doing that what they will actually begin to lose their protein content and once they lose their protein content they actually essentially die and so you lose receptor density to specific hormones and neurotransmitters now the third thing we want to talk about when it comes to how best to take ashwagandha is that we want to talk about other compounds that we can actually cycle with ashwagandha while we're on an off period so for instance if you are taking ashwagandha for stress and maybe even anxiety to some degree and you're choosing for instance to do a five-day cycle on with a three-day cycle off there are other compounds which you can actually use while you're on your off period to reap the benefits of ashwagandha while you're taking it but then also to treat that level of stress that you're trying to treat with other compounds when you're not taking the ashwagandha so a great example of this would be something like l-theanine now if you guys haven't seen my video on l-theanine yet i'll link it at the end of this video but suffice it to say that l-theanine is also very effective at treating stress and so if you're taking ashwagandha primarily to treat the symptoms of stress during that five-day on period you can take something like theanine on the off period in order to reap the benefits of both compounds while also not developing a tolerance to either of them now another great example of this would be if you are taking ashwagandha in order to increase testosterone levels ashwagandha does have a slight effect and slight increasing effect on testosterone and so if you're taking it for those purposes but you also want to reap the benefits of increased testosterone while you're on your off period compounds like forskolin and you kuna pruriens and even things like tongkat Ali are great options to take while you're on your off period in order to reap the benefits of all of those compounds without again developing a tolerance to any of them alright so the last thing we want to talk about before we close out this video is how to maximise absorption now the first thing you want to think about when you're trying to maximize the absorption of ashwagandha is that most of the compounds and most of the active compounds that are in ashwagandha are fat soluble and this is why it's typically recommended that ashwagandha is consumed in a traditional format with milk and honey and that's because milk is a fairly good source of fat and so when you mix the ashwagandha with the milk and then the honey for taste if one provides a tasty treat to some degree but it also provides a chaperone for that ashwagandha to be absorbed through the gut lining now I will say that it's important to note here that if you're consuming an extract like KSM 66 or since grill it really doesn't matter if you're taking it with a fat source because those extracts have already used an ethanol extraction process in order to get the active ingredients and kind of activate them so to speak already so when you consume an extract it's really easy for your body to absorb those through the gut lining and so again you really don't have to worry about taking it with of that source now if you are consuming the root powder you do need to consume it with a fat source because the root powder has not gone through the extraction process which means that you need something that those compounds can dissolve into like that fat in order to be absorbed through the gut lining but other than that guys that's all I have for you today I hope this was helpful and I hope you guys can implement this in your life not just with ashwagandha but also other compounds that you're consuming on a regular basis in order to maximize their effectiveness across the board so if you guys have any questions or any comments about anything that was stated in this video as always simply leave a comment down below and I will get back to you as soon as possible but if not I will see you next time thank you so much", "mJhCAN9ttOw": "[Music] first day first you pull your cup off the apex machine your extract in it get your large beaker here to put that extract down in the beaker then going to mix that extract a high proof ethanol right there we have to to prove ethanol I would get this I pour it in here in a spoon I'd stir up my extract with the ethanol when I cover this we have our ethanol in our extract all in solution we're going to take this and put it into our labs reserve here's our freezer we're down at negative 47 see I've got some extract right here so this is what I was just talking about this is extract that's been mixed with ethanol and now it's been sitting in this freezer for about 24 hours over here Buchner funnel vacuum flask a vacuum pump down here connected filter papers ready shut it down in here we're poor it up here they're going to flip our vacuum pump on and then going down through the bottom is our nice clean ethanol with the oil and no waxes but up here you can see all the waxes that did not make it in the filter paper you see their lunch plant locks it's not quite done with less severe than a minute or so then we'll call it - now our resume expects offerings they will business - not much on ops and nothing but white box level a favor and put up a vacuum hope to remove or vulgar paper as you can see just a bunch of plant wax this is not dabbing wax this isn't what people smoke this is just plain old plant wax this is a rotary evaporator a little mini distillation setup but take this here put it in the bowl now we'll take this will connect it so our hot water in here is going to heat up our solution by the vacuum so the ethanol boils off really easily yes it all boiled up comes over here condenses on the cold coils and fall down into here now it's just a waiting game low turn here we have a hot water bath set at 30 17 we have our vacuum turned on since it wait okay so here we are about 30 minutes in as you can see come a little closer we've got you-know-who ethanol is condensing on those cold coils like we talked about stripping down so here's all the ethanol we've recovered so far great ethanol will be using lead in here we are at the end of articulation come over here you can see all we have less in this flask is oil no more dripping over here on our coils which means the ethanol is done distilling over so what we're going to do turn off our vacuum pump stop the rotation up turn off our hot water bath sometimes take it off now we want to get it all put it into the air I'm going to turn this upside down let it sit tighten this up so here our oil is dripping out of the flask I went ahead and took a small sample so you can see in the plastic looks kind of dark still pretty transparent I can see all the way through it it's hard to see on the camera but here and the small syringe you can see the quality of that vape pen oil it's not cut with anything that's just deal acts toil so it's a raw extract from the apex machine we remove the waxes and here you go something like this would look great in a vape pen and it's not cut with anything it doesn't need to be as mentioned this in quick demonstration was not intended as a full instructional video this is just a quick demonstration to show people how easy it is to remove plant waxes from your material and get to a high quality bait in oil something like this is what we can guarantee with an apex system and we teach all the classes on how to get to right here you [Music]", "zKoMhGJSuyY": "[Music] [Music]

great", "syymNA-Xgao": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and today we're trying out our all-new L-SEP, instantaneous winterization process. So\nwe're not only going to tell you a little bit about the process but we're\nalso going to walk you through it and show you around the lab a little bit and\nactually show you the experiment real time. So if you look over here, we've got\nour bead warmer. We've got some crude sitting here. It's about 60C, we do\nthat just to keep it liquid. It's about 200 grams of crude or so, and what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to winterize this in real time so you guys can\nactually see what's going on. So we've got our solvent that we've manipulated a\nlittle bit here under the fume hood and what I'm going to do is I'm just going\nto take this solvent and dump it right in I'm sorry going to take the crude and\ndump it right into the solvent in order to show you how quickly this process\nworks so ultimately this is going to have to get taken into solution a little\nbit meaning it's going to have to dissolve within that solvent and once\nthat happens we're going to slow down the stir bar and we're gonna watch the\nlipids almost instantaneously crystallize and separate from your crude oil. So this is normal crude oil out of a hydrocarbon extract similar to any\nother crude oil that you would see coming out of a hydrocarbon application. Let's go ahead and dump her in and we're gonna have a little bit of\ntransfer loss here in this round bottom but we're gonna get just get it as good\nas we can and then we'll leave it alone from there... alright good enough. Let's go ahead and\nturn this stir bar up a little bit just so we can get it moving. So what we can see here is the lipids are\nactually crystallizing similar to how you would winterize in ethanol and as\nyou cool the ethanol you see the lipids start to precipitate - that's what's\nalready happening here instantaneously. And you can see that in most\ncircumstances the lipids are actually heavier than the miscella. Miscella for those of you that don't know is the mixture of the crude oil\nwith the solvent but with the lipids being more dense and heavier they're\ngonna fall to the bottom, so you're starting to see already the separatory\nlayer. And what I'm going to do now - I'm just going to turn off this so it stops\nstirring and we're going to watch that separation. So I'm going to go ahead and lift this\nup just so you guys can maybe see a little bit better. So all of that crude\noil is now in solution and you can see these lipids just absolutely, totally\ncrystallized within this solution. You can see try to get some different angles\nhere for you guys pretty cool though, so now that's ready to be filtered. That's\nthat's an instantaneous crystallization of the lipids. This can then be poured\nthrough any sort of filtration system whether you're doing a small batch, like\nthis like we do in the lab just on lab scale and throw it through a Buechner, or\nyou have a larger filter press whatever the circumstance it very drastically\ncrystallizes the lipids within solution and it's ready to be filtered very, very\nquickly. So if you're using a room-temperature process like this you\ncan generally speed up what took normally with ethanol say 24 hours at\nthe lowest say for four to six hours this just took four to six minutes to do.\nSo massive efficiency increase and we're very proud of the process that we've\nhelped to perfect in the lab here, so we hope you enjoyed it today.", "YHOMkOwF94Y": "hi I'm Karl Foust I'm with the linked equipment and we're here today to show you a little bit of what we do in our yard we build shipping containers into laboratories mainly in the marijuana industry but we build buildings all over the country we go from a 20-foot container you see right here - looking down 40-foot containers on the side we've got two 40-foot containers we're actually putting together for a double lab down there building out some roll-up doors and these over here but today the big thing that we're looking at is this 53 foot container which is really the premier of what we've got to offer our clients we're gonna do a walk through show you what how it works show you how the lab works so come on in join me here is where we have the electric room basically we're looking at a 200 amp I said this is a 400 amp until we've gotten this one we've got more equipment in it it's got an automatic transfer switch so that it powers out the automatic switch over to generator power it's got some your emergency panels in the back which I'll show you how the emergency system works you can see up here we've got the fire suppression system in it but basically the actual electric room is enclosed in the back of the container so we can shut this off lock it nobody gets inside when I take you around the side so you can see how the actual fire suppression system set up this is actual water heater we got water electric come out [Music] the dry chemical fire suppression system on it so that it basically if there was a fire inside he would kick off typing from the outside we're gonna actually be plumbing in the chores and pools and things of that nature we gotta have some plugs on the outside come around to the back aerial see sorry got the noise here but that's the way it works mr. Phan system will feel we're inside inside so let's come take a walk inside the container and see how it's all set up this particular one just so you can see has double doors to make sure we've got some larger equipment that's going to go in here so we have double doors on it to be able to get the equipment in right now the air conditioner units not in here yet it's actually on its way so I haven't put it in but there's a an explosion-proof a/c unit sits up at the top 36,000 BTU which will cool the whole container because when we turn around welcome it is here we've got our fan system so basically what happens in the case of this is an ethanol class 1 div 2 laboratory in the case that ethanol has been sent in the in the container it triggers a shunt system which will shut everything down the fans will kick on we have an evolving operational fans always on the actual emergency fan kicks on and it sucks everything from the container all the way through so there's everything in here the exposure protocol spark resisted this war static free flooring if you look at these things here these are all explosion proof boxes we've got seal offs and everything this rigid piping so all of the electric sits inside rigid piping making sure that they comply all the fire codes you look down with maintained all these lights are class one dip two lights so their explosion proof lights you can see where the black bear is where the as we take a little walk down we get the seeds up all outlets these are 241 pounds here this section is a is a a breaker for a 60 amp three-phase machine is coming right in here so it's gotta have a filling breakfast and breaker on this versus piping is coming in down here you take a look this is our system for basically sensing any kind of alcohol that might be escaping store or something I got spill so basically that's what's going to trigger the whole system to turn the fans evacuate the building send every out you'll have the waters you'll see you know it'll tell you you want to get out of here it's what it basically does we've got two sensors in this with these are some emergency shutdown buttons so by chance something spilled and you knew it you just want to get out of here you just hit the button in the whole building shuts down fans come on everything happens that way you look up here these are the where the air pulls in from so the fans the operational being is pulling here from here and you've got a constant airflow to basically keep the nice part about 453 is if you can see they're much taller I've got a much I've got about a nine and a half almost seven foot ceiling where I only have maybe three great for inside of a for you because the actual floors up a little bit higher and I've got extra width so these actually make some very very nice labs you can put a lot of good equipment in this is Olli a 53-foot subtraction container of length equipment I'm glad that I could show everybody what's going on thank you [Music] you", "DHO2XgDBoLM": "hey i'm tom steckbeck i've been the series extraction manager for close to two years now i've been with the company close to four today i'm gonna walk you through our extraction process you can get a better idea about what goes on here this is our cub 15 from delta separations this is will be used to perform our extractions we'll put our canvas material if it's flour or trim into here we then pump cold ethanol that we keep stored at minus 80 degrees celsius into the basket that then spins at a higher velocity to extract all the cannabis essential oils and return it to this keg so after it's an extract we then begin the distillation process um we will pull the extract from this peg through a series of strength filters to remove sediment we're going to end up with this carboy you'll then pump the extract into a rotovap where we will use a heated water bag and vacuum to evaporate the ethanol will recondense on these columns this is the spray bath it's another distillation setup instead of a roto bat that uses a heated water bath and rotating of the boiling glass this uses thin film distillation the extract will come out of this nozzle up here be sprayed down this column which has got a heated water jacket which increases the surface area and allows for a more even quicker evaporation process is our deep freezer uh after the first distillation we can put our cannabis oil and ethanol solution into here uh we leave it typically for a period of time that allows the waxes and lipids to drop out once it's done once it's set in here for a period of time we'll run it through our buchner filtration system again and that allows us to remove the waxed lipids from the canvas oil leaving a more pure substance once we've completed the second distillation and the oil has reached a consistency that indicates most of the ethanol has been removed we'll then pour it onto these vacuum oven trays and put into our vacuum ovens this allows us to purge the remaining ethanol from the oil and get us below the state's ppm limits so once we've completed purging the ethanol in the vacuum ovens we end up with a pure cannabis oil like this shatter over here we can turn it into a variety of different products including oil that we put into our cartridges or edibles along with wax and as i just showed shatter benefit of our extractions process and at the end we ended the full spectrum concentrate what happens is in a full spectrum concentrate all the different cannabinoids that were in the cannabis flower are retained which is beneficial because they all work in concert and entourage effect will produce a more therapeutic and effective hive", "D3W4T9gyBKs": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] i'm right hey guys welcome we're in the r d lab we are cool yeah we're here we're here and we're we're completely out you look at this make sure everything everybody bought them i buttoned all the way up to the top they even made us put the masks and the gloves i now have a medium and a large i used to have a large and a small it was uncomfortable it was a little odd okay welcome thank you for being here thank you thank you thank you oh yes i'm looking at different cameras sorry okay we're in the r d lab dr john randall here we are thank you for being here thank you thank you thank you we're going to talk about how to make the best tincture ever ever

it's good i have been working on this t-shirt thing since six o'clock this morning been blowing it up it's gonna be good we got uh hey can you guys pant all this wonderful stuff we got here look at that look at this we got it all set up it is so cool we got isolate we got distillate we got flavors we got existing tinctures here i'm terrified i'm going to break something i don't know it's going to happen i'm going to break it up right it's all right i'm totally going to break something okay all right so i'm going to let you go oh but wait wait wait wait icbc virtual event adam young in colorado springs congratulations you are this week's winner uh jarrod will reach out to you do we know what he won what did he win oh he wanted a grab bag i think you put it in this large glove hey put some gloves in there will ya we'll put some ppe and some gloves in there adam young colorado springs congratulations at the icbc virtual event we're good okay don't forget lots of resources live tour cbd jam sessions you guys are lighting it up you're asking us a lot of really cool questions on those jam sessions and things uh advanced extraction guide distillate guide calculator library is live you guys it's live oh my god they've been burning it up burning it hundreds of people on there so it's been it's been great and we're we're adding the and uh mini courses to come so good all right all right so uh yeah so let's uh let's get into this this is probably uh one of those uh one of those sessions where we're we're it's kind of more loosey we see uh so i only like no i only have the others work i only have like three slides and a couple tables oh awesome yeah okay they didn't see you i know okay i was i was showing you my eyes glazed overlook how do i get how do i get my wonderful presentation up here because people are going to be excited about these calculators if they're at all making tinctures and then we're going to get into some tasting and then we're going to make our own you're going to make me taste the bad stuff i'm going to make you taste it no i'm going to make you taste the good stuff okay i got cuts i got cow leaf i got holist stuff here remember last week you said ooh this is horrible taste this okay okay that's that's what i'm expecting okay uh number one number one guys uh if you're gonna make your own tinctures you gotta make sure your biomass or your cbd oil has been decarboxylated first okay otherwise it's it's not going to be able to be absorbed into your body um just to let you know that so what that means i didn't know that yeah what that means is that you you need to bring it through a process of decarboxylation so um you know whether if if you have a distillate it's it's very likely already decarboxylated almost all of distillate is decarboxylated for sure okay um if you have just like for example some uh some some biomass you're going to want to kind of warm it up you're going to want to cook it at 150 degrees for about an hour that'll decarboxylate it um or if you have some crude that you've taken from like an ethanol tincture or something like that you're gonna have to remove the ethanol and cook the living daylights out of the oil okay so that that and that that will basically decarboxylate it okay so first step in making a tincture obviously is decarboxylating either your biomass or your cbd oil just so you guys know that it's very important otherwise they're not going to be there's going to be what they call mal absorption oh yeah not going to be very good okay if you're using cbd oil you can follow a recipe that you create using our kick calculators kit calculators kick calculators yeah they're really great uh if you are using cbd biomass you need to extract it so we're gonna go over some of those calculators and then once you have this wonderful uh oil of some kind and we'll go over different ways to make that of course you guys there's different ways to do that um then then you can calculate your dosage using our dosing calculator okay so this is going to be a lot of fun and then step four obviously is enjoy it awesome so that that's pretty great that's that's my favorite part there's a small list okay so a lot of people ask us in the past you know what uh what cbd should we use in tinctures should we use isolate should we use distillate should we use winter eyes should we use broad spectrum ethanol all of them are perfectly fine to use in a tincture it's just you might get some uh different uh different things uh happening with that so like for example with isolate isolate is the most straightforward one to use within a tincture okay and um um what's nice about it is that potency is pretty high but it doesn't have any terpenes so you'll have to add some of your terpenes that you gather up in in a different process uh and you need to add those in i'll give you an example what that looks like here here you can see these are pure uh pure terpenes uh they come they come from a decarboxylation process which is essentially uh vacuum distillation and so they don't they don't have any thc or cbd in them but they are they are straight from the hand plant they have all of the a full spectrum of uh of terpenes there so you can add those into your isolate to make uh like dabs you can add them into your isolate to make no smell great they smell crazy good crazy good um yeah so terpenes um there are some you know sometimes with isolate depending on what isolate you are uh you know extracting from typically you will always have some miners in there like if it's 99 pure uh cbd you'll probably maybe have one percent miners or you know and when i say minor cannabinoids i mean cbn cb cbc cvg you know some of the miners will also be in there but they're very very trace they're very low low level they're just because the way isolate is processed you do have a residual risk so i'll be very careful about that i am a total anti-anti-residual type of person um so the way that it's processed with nonpolar solvents and stuff like that i i don't i don't like it so i don't prefer an isolated tincture i prefer something more natural but a lot of people use it because um you know like if you use a crude or winterized or bots broad spectrum you're really talking about the natural flavors of the plant in there so you know um you know a lot of people want to mask that and overpower it with like a strawberry flavor or a chocolate flavor or something like that people also use distillate and when you use distillate and you're in manufacturing you just have to correct for you have to know how much cbd is in your distillate right otherwise you wouldn't know how to dose it and i'll show you in a calculator that we put together for manufacturing and what that really means it's just suffice it to say it does have some of those minor cannabinoids it does have some of the longer chain longer longer isoprene the larger um the larger terpenes in there so yes it does have some terpenes in it but it doesn't have the more volatile ones which are the diatribes uh things like that um and then a residual risk if if you there's always a residual risk with distillate we've we've done a pretty large study on uh you know um distillates and and you do see some of those residuals making it all the way through the distillate even if they are volatile organic solvents so um but it's uh it really varies about 25 of the manufacturers that we survey their distillate had some sort of contaminant in there so when you buy distillate you just want to make sure that you are basically contaminant and solvent free um and then winterized decarboxylated oil um 50 to 70 percent of course terpenes yes you got lots of terpenes in there it may also have some miners in there um you're not going to have a residual risk if you if you are using co2 oils and you're using food grade oils that don't have residuals in them you might have a ethanol digital though so you want to make sure that that's all taken out of there um broad spectrum is basically a thc free distillate typically you would take the distillate and you take the thc out of it you do that with either chromatography or solvent techniques one of the two you have to decide which one you want to use you know we use chromatography here because it's more clean than using a solvent so we try to stay away from acetone heptane hexane or anything else that's going to get into your body with unknown consequences to the to the endocrine system or to anything else you know you're trying to get to the point where um where where we're not taking and eating chemicals we're trying to do that that's a good thing better living through chemicals only applies if you live in the laboratory um and then uh ethanol extract yes you can do we're gonna show you how to make a t-shirt like uh with an ethanol extract the definition of a tincture is uh essentially an ethanol extract okay it's it's or it's a uh if it's it's an active with uh in in ethanol okay and most people don't like to have tinctures like real tinctures because they burn you know oh yeah yeah yeah they really burn they don't taste very good because they're overwhelmed by the burn so sure a lot of people don't um you know for example you know make tinctures but they are medically used all over all over the world sure so and uh in the pharmaceutical world so all right so that's the type of cbd used in the tincture which one is best um i think that they all you can see that they're all um they all have different different things to bring to the table like the ice lit would be used if you want to have overpowering like berry flavors and things like that and you don't want to have any plant flavor in there if you want to have some plant flavor in there you know you're going to have to either hit the distillate the winterized oil of the broad spectrum if you're not going to want to have any thc in there you're going to want to use broad spectrum winterize is probably the best or crude oil could also be used and that's the the closest to the plant obviously so you can take winterized oil directly out of or i'm sorry um co2 oils directly out of crude directly out of a co2 extractor that has been pre-decabox lid and you can use that right in your tincture in my view that's the cleanest possible but you're also getting a lot of uh plant uh plant flavors there's a good flavor but it's a lower potency yeah it's a lower potency also but you can make it you can make the potency however you want because you're diluting obviously with uh with oil so got it that's what that is and so basically what's awesome about this is that if you have you know 50 flavors you have uh different types of isolate you have uh you know different types of terpenes really there's a lot of different combinations this is where cbd formulation gets a lot of fun because you're able to test and try you're able to come up with something unique there's uh you know any they're 100 factorial different you know different combinations so your combination can actually be unique and you know if you like it people like it they'll taste it like wow this is really great so yeah we've we went out we we bought a whole bunch of tinctures we tasted them some of them were like you know own natural yeah and they were a little bit tough uh from the standpoint just didn't taste very good right so we i always kind of like okay i like to i like the stuff that tastes really good and i do like the natural hemp flavor too so that's just my bias um so what's a does an extraction method for cbd uh why does it make a difference well uh just to just uh just to summarize it for you have purity is important unknown and known residual solvent should be avoided so this this is where um if you're on the market you're buying for example crude oil you're buying distillate um and they give you a report that says hey this is this is really great i i would i would test that um because i i don't trust residuals your laboratory will not test for unknown residuals that's a big deal and if it's not on their list they'll say it's pure it's clean it passes and that's a problem i i think it's a huge problem it is a problem it most definitely is a problem okay because you know there's just an infinite number of things what if i used something that wasn't a list you know like methylene blood or dimethyl bat [ __ ] oh oh dimethylpatch it do you have that okay or and organic is better organic is better it is just this because um you know it it's it's made with agricultural practices that that don't use pesticides or insecticides and so you're really reducing or eliminating that risk so hey anything you can do to make your cbd tincture the most healthy tincture possible is the best way absolutely period absolutely and the residual thing i mean i i agree with you the residual thing is is bad and we've talked about this in ad nauseam in previous episodes but if you're taking multiple doses a day of cbd or a tincture or taking that over time oh my gosh you're you're ingesting way over the limit that they want right over time right and that's just bad stuff right right exactly well yeah and they don't have any basis for the limits in the first place yeah so there's there's you know there's no studies and so their their modus operandi is interestingly enough oh we don't have any data on it so 5000 ppm is okay you know that that's you guys have heard me rant about that a lot and you know whatever you know does it actually happen in practice though the answer is yeah it does all the time yeah it does we we've got a whole bunch of extracts we got a whole bunch of you know distillates and stuff yeah we see the stuff in there you can see it yeah look we we analytical chemists we can see everything yeah okay there's no hiding yeah and we've got by the way we've got chemists from europe we've got chemists from ohio congratulations nicholas and edgaris hopefully i said that correctly and we've got barney here i mean we've got questions coming all over the place so thank you for being here it's awesome right thank you so anyway so that's that i think um let me see here so people always want to know how much to take okay so it's based on body weight it's based on delivery method and it's based on that condition that's being addressed okay so um you know like for example with some forms of epilepsy i know that uh you know the dosage is quite high like really high wow so um what's cool about the cannabinoids is that you're not going to die from it okay nobody has ever died for example from uh from a cannabinoid overdosage that i know of i don't think that there is if someone knows please put it in the notes that would be interesting but you know people have died from alcohol people have died from other things but they haven't done that you could you could be you could be you know you could be uh taking so much of it that it you know you you would have an adverse reaction that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying dying from it that would be a male reaction yes yes so that would be a male reaction okay so let's get to some calculators and then we'll get into the fun stuff which is basically uh sampling and mixing crazy awesome so let me see here it's on the website technical we're we're we're moving it and and this is awesome by the way um uh also as as we're going you know one there's a couple of questions that we're coming in as we're moving to the calculators and that is can you process just with pressure or do you need to process with a solvent um i wonder what that means uh it's it's tough to understand what that means if i mean okay we talked about methods last week okay and methods are basically you have your technique plus your temperature and your pressure conditions right and that's put putting those together with a piece of equipment that has been calibrated and has operating procedures and trained personnel that's a method okay so um if you are going to talk about different ways to um change you know like for example i could i could increase the pressure or i could decrease the pressure i could change my solvent i could use a different solvent sure um yeah there's there's lots of different options for me so yeah you look there's the sky's the limit when it comes to uh when it comes to making your different methods sure all right and we can talk about that um and and for barney if you want to watch the last episode we did on processes and things that would be awesome it's in our blog and you can connect there or on our youtube channel that would be good and then we're talking about i think we addressed some of these where you get all of the cannabinoids and flavonoids in the processes and where they are and what they would need yeah yeah um yeah so okay so yeah we can we can talk about that i'll talk about that as we're tasting and perfect stuff like that all right all right good good thanks for the questions by the way all right so um look here uh here's our calculators page you can go to our website uh calculators are at the top and then uh scroll down um scroll scroll down how do i scroll down here buddies that's just a pointer i know i'm looking to scroll here you got the whirling circle of i do have the army [Laughter] let me see here do you want to try it that's fun okay uh also again um it's really good to see you guys from europe from all over the country this is this is good stuff and um we are going to announce our topic later in the show but if you have any topics you want us to cover let us know for future episodes um and you know maybe there is a prize in it if you that's what we're gonna do next week because yeah i'm i'm held i'm been bound i can't speak right till later on the show right so we're good i still am terrified i'm gonna break something oh that's all right hey you know what we can do the calculators later look i can just look it's it's there's some technical difficulties that we're having which uh it does happen actually this is the first time that that's happened over all of our bodies oh my gosh i have technical difficulties in my brain all the time okay all right well let's let's i will narrate them and then we'll then we'll take it from there how about that guys so hey uh so what i'd like you guys to do it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot of fun i'd like you to go to the calculators page and if you scroll down to the bottom there's two calculators one is a dosing calculator and the other is how to manufacture a tin shirt calculator okay and i'll go through the dosing calculator first let's just kind of you guys open that up yeah i mean i'm gonna wait i'm gonna do it from memory extract lab.com e-x-t-r-a-k-t-l-a-b dot com forward slash calculators right right right right okay let's do it uh okay so uh let me see the dosing calculator let's talk about that one first your the dose that you would have is really dependent upon the weight of your of the weight of your body okay so um if you put in that your pounds how many pounds you are uh you have to convert it if you're in europe to kilograms um i think it's just divided by our time 2.2 i think so um and that'll give you your kilograms weight uh you need to put in your weight in pounds so that's uh let me see it's a so if you're 200 pounds or 100 pounds you put that in there and then you all then you decide uh what what uh dosage your um tincture is so if if there's a usually the tinctures are about 30 milliliters okay and um and they have usually they're about 33 milligrams per milliliter or 33 milligrams per serving and a one serving is typically right around one milliliter okay um yeah so uh you have to put that in there and then um you push the calculate button you got to put in some stuff and it'll tell you how you know basically what the maximum amount you have um it'll tell you what your dosage is for high medium and low dosage it'll tell you uh for example um what is your um you know how many milligrams you would take per day it's got a whole bunch of figures in there for a high medium and low dosage so how we doing james and and we're we're close one of the things that are is our technical difficulty is we are in the r d lab yeah i think that's uh that is we switched it at the last minute oh man yeah and so we've got usually in the other studio we've got you know plug-ins and everything and now we're going kind of wi-fi yeah okay so all right i know that that's part of the issue all right so and quick quick question yeah okay so when we're talking about body weight um my weight is about 165 right when you add my ego it's about 300 rounds okay it's like all right three clicks hey the calculator that's up is the wrong calculator did you know that oh you didn't know that okay he doesn't know true what are we doing when i when i mention those kinds of things you know i'll know whether he's paying attention to me he didn't hear a word i said no i didn't i didn't uh that's when i get away with so much [ __ ] i can't even tell you man why didn't i ask a really good question i don't know hey i've got a really good client who needs a discount okay sure he hears that i hear that okay all right let's just skip this because it's not working so all right we're gonna skip it sorry guys i all that all the calculator mango that i did this morning it's uh it's all there for your enjoyment so go ahead take and explore it and uh and we'll we're just gonna start trying out some things okay so what this means is this is rather than the calculator it's just trial and error and i'm the guinea pig am i the test you're the test oh you're the test thanks so okay just so all of you guys know in the room here thanks okay all right so let's let's do some tasting first okay um so this right here here there's some different pictures here that's that's a holistic tree right there this is a holistic tincture yeah what does it say it says key lime key lime we got strawberry okay i'm gonna try a strawberry 16.5 milligram serving of key lime this is look there's a brand spanking new okay this is kind of interesting if you can take a look at this so uh you can see this is almost clear it's got a slight color to it um let's see here if you can see that and then um yeah it's it's see it's strawberry so let's see if i can taste it all right this is typically what you do is you hold it under your tongue for like 30 to 40 seconds i hold it for two minutes it's it's better two minutes yeah two minutes i can hold my breath for two minutes i won't do that now actually it's kind of funny watching people take pictures i thought i'd just go oh key lime you know what that needs what little mango you know what if we we are going to be so relaxed in like an hour if we if we sample all these i don't think no way no way challenge challenge accepted okay then try the mint then try them in try them try them oh this is okay that other one was 16. this is 33. okay so this this is which one is 16 oh this is 16. yeah yeah 16. oh that's that's sweet so this is this is nothing so this one is a og kush so this one right here is cuts um this one is made up with uh terpenes like natural terpenes so um yeah let's try it all right oh yeah you can see the difference i mean it's definitely got definitely got a lot also it's got a nice little graduated cylinder oh same here look at this see that that's pretty sweet look at that okay i'm not going to take much i'm going to take a quarter a quarter quarter yeah yeah just a quarter is it quarter two bits you know what that's definitely got some oh it tastes great what do you got mint try that one okay try that one oh that's got flavor that's terpini does it really oh yeah it's got mint and terpenes mint terpini full spectrum hemp flour oil okay here let's check that out and it's uh heavy duty oh this is it's got 2 000 milligrams in this bottle yep i told you didn't i tell you yeah it's good it's good oh it's got that mint with a little bit of oh yeah but there's a good aftertaste yeah it kind of blends on the tongue and just kind of grows right under the tongue and just kind of comes and gives your tongue a hug right with terpenes so okay so so there's a couple different things you can swallow these tinctures and it'll go into your gut basically um and you know it'll it'll kind of it won't be metabolized as fast right it'll go it gets metabolized through the liver if you take them sublingually basically it gets absorbed um you know under the tongue and so you have to have a carrier for that and that's why typically alcohol is used because it's a good carrier directly into your bloodstream and there's some arterial a blood that goes right under the tongue and and it has a more direct way of getting into your bloodstream so um yeah oh that's good yeah oh that's good yeah oh and look certified pesticide free no reason here's a great vape too this is a great babe this is a pretty good one great babe yeah great babe that that's a do you know that ages me because i remember grape grape that was a great thing great bush you see this has got this has got more like a real cannabis flavor with no um you know with no um let me see no no like berry flavor or bean flavor it's just straight up you know og kush yeah it's great well the other thing would be the 2000 the other thing with this one is it it's got a thicker viscosity almost on it a little more oil base i like that oh mango sorbet oh my totally gonna try that one [Music] you're on a mango kick i i like i like berry flavors what can i say harry berry all right here we go i'm gonna try it grape ape i wonder if i'm gonna get any work done this afternoon boy we got we do have work don't we randy wow i i taste it definitely has the mango it's very smooth but it definitely ha it definitely still has that cannabis background in it what oh this one again it just kind of there's this little grapey flavor just slight it's not like drinking it's not like you know drinking a shot of welch's right but but then it's just slight and then all of a sudden the terpenes just kind of kick you yeah bam pretty good bam okay i think we've had enough we're gonna fall asleep i think we've had enough oh we're good all right well thanks we got that we got some conditioning are you kidding me yeah yeah okay so all right i'm i'm looking at uh questions here good uh maxum thanks good guys good uh barney cool thanks and look for that uh the blog will have a lot of that on there barney so just make sure you look right um matthew uh good to see you richard good to see you uh let's see questions um [Music] i think there's a great opportunity yeah there's one of the things that we have been noticing on our sites just because of this dude here um we have a lot of phds and chemists on staff and we speak chemists oh yeah oh my gosh yeah we kind of do yeah for us you know business and sales geeks yeah it gets old it never gets old i'm sorry did i say that out loud did i have too much cbd um i'm relaxed i don't care anymore oh good see now this is awesome but i think we need to do some uh very like this one was very good for chemists and i think the only thing that we didn't get to were the calculators but go your chemist you explore right do r d go to extract lab.com calculators and find those calculators because they're awesome yeah and in the blog we have several posts how many white papers have you written on distillate and that would be very chemist specific boy um how many white papers well we do blog posts we did guide our blog posts and then there must be at least we wrote uh we have at least 40 pages of faqs yes which are you know are very digestible because they're just adding okay and just so you know the faqs are not like a one or two sentence answer okay i mean they're exhausted it's a white paper okay yeah we make we make a white super faq i think i've seen citations on some of those yeah our guys go can we just make this into a blog article instead of an faq oh yeah sure whatever yeah whatever but leave it as an faq because people want to know this answer yeah all right exactly all right now one a couple of things that i wanted to show here just because it's cool um you know we got bigger beaker beaker all over the place okay okay that's fine no yeah bigger bigger bigger okay so there's some really cool stuff so why would you use this yeah or these little those are cool those are volumetric flasks yes these are volumetric flasks okay i apologize to all the chemists out there but those who are not chemists don't know this stuff so yeah let's let's make some stuff here so let's let's do some stuff let's let's make it all right so what do we need to do well okay i was going to start off with just uh just kind of an ethanol extraction of some of some uh bombings okay okay because a lot of people who want to do diy stuff at home yeah they might have some biomass and they take some water no no no that's fine oh okay so uh first thing you do is you start off with some everclear just take a shot and then start yeah so you buy it and you take your pork up this is the reason you start off with everclear is that uh it's a food grade uh alcohol it doesn't have a lot of water in it and uh you know you're not you're not dealing with residuals except for like a lot of alcohol okay and it is going to extract the um you know the biomass okay um a lot of times what people do is they'll they'll take some biomass they'll put it into a jar like like this okay and then they'll pour the everclear in there and they'll let it sit for you know a week and they'll they'll stir it and they won't really get it's not very efficient technique so you're not going to get out a lot of the cbd or so you might just continue to put some more everclear in it usually you want to start off with something a lot smaller you can also by the way this is from our own farms that worked out pretty good this right here shout out to nevada crest farms uh these guys are in nevada obviously um they had some pretty good blend that they sent our way oh nevada crest hey try to try that out shout out to nevada yeah yeah it smells great cool that smells really good yeah yeah and nevada crest they're looking at expanding their yeah facility yeah eli just talking to them oh really yeah cool sweet yeah all right so we're gonna take some of their stuff and we're gonna we're gonna take and do a little bit of an extraction so we're going to put a little bit in here first of all you see this is called a buckner funnel or a buchner funnel um and it has a paper in there you can see that that is a filter filter paper you put that in there and then you have like a little apparatus which is a this is called the sidearm vacuum flask you can buy these on ebay you can buy them on amazon or uh you can just not buy them at all and use like a coffee filter or something like that yeah that would be fine as well um and so you put a little bit of usually you want to wet the paper a little bit so i'm gonna take this is not normally how we would do stuff but we're gonna we're gonna do this diy here today so we're just gonna pour a little bit of that on there kind of wet that paper smell that yeah okay you all remember ever clear in the wapatooli college put a little bit of that in there [Music] all right we're gonna put a little bit of that in there all right this is great for like pre-rolls and things like that um and or you can just extract it straight out so usually what you would do is you would know for example the potency of that and then you would measure out the amount of alcohol you'd be extracting it with it's you still wouldn't really know what the end extraction would be but you can make some assumptions say if you have like 50 recovery or 40 recovery then you can kind of calculate okay i have i have uh calculate how much is in there so here we're just going to add it in and you can see now this is this is a really great illustration as well the issue with uh with with ethanol extraction and that's because now all that biomass is sucking up all of our alcohol okay so you need a lot of it in there and now we're just gonna kind of roll it around there and you can see down here there's uh we're getting a tincture out yeah now a lot of people want to just soak it that's fine too this we're just kind of doing this in the short term and then we're going to try i'll let you try it you're awesome yeah thank you it'll be great we're gonna get all those terpenes out of there and stuff like that so while that is cooking okay i'm gonna put this over here that's that's what you would do and you can put it into a jar and then you can decant it and filter it off and this would be considered to be a tincture a kind of an all-natural tincture okay oh yeah so you can see it's coming down so now when you do this approximately you know if we do this if this is you know what potency typically would that flower be so that would be either you know anywhere from five to fifteen percent and most likely right around ten percent okay yeah so if you're doing it this way yeah how much cbd will come down yeah not a lot not very much i mean it you so you maybe get most of it is stuck in that in the matrix there you know so that's why a lot of people soak it for a long time okay um you know so again diy uh do it yourself at home get a bottle of everclear but you can see there's it's definitely pulling some out yeah it's very green it's yeah cool yeah i can't wait to taste it yeah we're gonna we're gonna taste it and we're gonna taste it like real soon as soon as we get this all right so and then um let's kind of go over some of the flavors i was going to kind of show you guys some flavors here that yeah um you guys can pick up um any kind of flavor you want now these these okay let me just talk a little bit about terpenes and what makes a difference with turkeys okay not all terpenes are equal some terpenes are are synthetic some of them are say fruit derived um and some of them are steam distilled some of them are solvent distilled um and some of them are like i said purely synthetic and some of them are also derived specifically from say hemp these ones come straight from the ham plant they're they're they're not uh they're not cut they're not uh they're they're just natural okay so this is kind of what you want to have if you want to have uh you want to maintain that hemp flavor and that m taste and stuff in fact these terpenes right here are some of the terpenes that you that you um that you tasted in this oji kush okay okay so those are the og turkeys right there okay so that's one way to so when you say that it's right that's the flavor you're you use that stuff to flavor your tincture is this is this like when you say it's right from the plant that's pre it's pre-processing pre-processing processing all together yeah so you would use a a terpene trap yeah and uh and with that that terpene trap would allow you just to just to basically take the terpenes directly from here and and get them into there got it okay that's the chirping trap we have a product that that does that for because a lot of people do that and capture these post extraction yeah but they're not good they're not as good horrible yeah yeah yeah so these we call angels tears right yeah they definitely are angels tears and it's good stuff so you want it right from the plant yeah if you do it afterward uh in other words gather those uh these terpenes up afterward they just taste they're horrible they don't they don't smell good they don't taste good mostly because you have to really cook it in order to get it out right so and it's been processed like three times already by the time it gets out and so they're degrading and all that stuff so you want to make sure that you have some good uh you know nice terpenes um we also uh so that's one one particular flavor i would consider if you're going to make a tincture for um you know that's based on hemp you'd want to have a little bit of like terpenes in there so we taste you know something like the hemp plan um some of your clientele however is just going to like something like the holeless products like um there i mean i couldn't taste any like the key lime or the strawberry or the mint i mean was there any hemp in those at all terpenes that was a flavor was there a little bit yeah maybe i didn't taste it wasn't as strong as it was in the and some of them they were they were stronger in some than others yeah so the strawberry one i couldn't taste that at all so maybe that's just like almost free um so yeah um and then uh let me see then you can use different flavors you can go to amaretti um or you can go to you know different sources like here for example is uh we have usd organic these are organic tinctures that we have by the way so you want to make sure that you have the organic label um which means that this peppermint oil was grown organically extracted according to the organic principles and then to us in this beautiful package here that then we could put into an organic product to show hey look we're 100 organic i love that yeah it's good it's great and so this is very very concentrated peppermint oils you can also get non-organic and those would be like in fruity flavors and things like that um like for example uh here's here's lemon oil terpene less lemon oil here's some cassio oil for example that's more like cinnamon cinnamony chocolate cream look at here's sassafras oh yes that's the fresh fruit and then we've been doing a lot with like um you know like hot flavors like i think i really think that um you know like fusion you know like you know you know the fusion cooking yeah i think that that is really a great way you know to have that in like tinctures and things so i mean if you can you can mix and match like hot and yes the four essences you know uh sweet sour um earth air fire water i mean you know i mean something along those lines so you can have that in there and where it would you know develop over time so yeah uh the taste and all the flavor okay and by the way samantha loves our geek okay your geek not my geek your geek okay all right let me see here we got uh isolate here okay this is some of our raw products so here's some isolate so that's what that looks like it looks beautiful white and it's uh and then we have it's kind of fun when they dry it and they just there's some here's some distillate okay so that's some distillate so we would we would make that up and uh here's some winterized oil so again all of these are decarboxylated here you can see how they're kind of flowing there um then this is yeah and then that's crude crude you know smell smell this cream oh i just love the smell of co2 crude is so smells so wonderful it just does it it just really smells good yeah look how thick that is oh my gosh i i just like okay it looks weird for me just sitting there smelling it but if i can oh yeah you know what if you move it around you can really see yeah crude smells so good oh and then you know the winter eyes again it just kind of you lose a little bit of that beautiful um so if i was to make a tincture um you know making like making it with like food is actually a really great great idea so hey we got we got ourselves are we making it yeah we got ourselves a little bit of alcohol here you can see that little tiny bit of alcohol tincture here that we're making okay you don't have to use uh only alcohol in fact let me talk to you a little bit about what the difference is between an alcohol tincture in what is known in the marketplace as a as a tincture usually um people don't use alcohol because it's their shipping issues and all that stuff and so what they use is other excipients like coconut oils like mct oils or sweet almond oil or they'll use glycerin or something along those lines okay usually you want to stick with an oil we can use hemp oil too we have a whole bunch of hand boiled danny kemp oil here um that's a really great way to do it too usually the hemp oil is green and you know it comes out green that's the organic stuff but most people i mean if you look at the labels and you read the labels most people are using an mct which is a medium chain triglyceride and you know it has its own actually mct oil has its own health benefits you can go up on on the web and look those up so a lot of people are using those um it doesn't always have to be alcohol it it solves a lot of problems if you don't have to you know store a lot of everclear or food grade up ethanol so um okay so uh so how are we making this well i i don't know i think what we're going to do first of all we're going to just taste it okay and then and i'm going to use one of these a little bit yeah we're going to take yeah so here it is here's the so let me take a look at this if you can real quick so this is the extracted material and you would it's not fully extracted for sure but you can see that all of that ethanol there is still stuck in there yeah in in the matrix there it's really hard to get out so you'd have to centrifuge it or something to get it out of there i can't wait to go to the matrix matrix here we go oh well um i didn't smell that like a chemist you want to know how the chemist is supposed to smell stuff here i'll show you yeah there you go you got it you got it that's how it goes yeah so okay here you get a little beaker and i get a little beaker i want half of it and you can have it and then we're gonna use that as our base to try out some stuff here okay i'm having fun i don't know about everybody here i i know i see there's a lot of people on on the show sorry but i'm having a lot of fun i hope i hope you guys are okay okay well bottoms up man yasu okay a little tiny bit under the tongue maybe i i think i'm gonna do this instead what yeah i'm gonna try this i'm not gonna try that what no way i'm gonna try a little bit on my tongue if you want a dropper there's a drop over there really okay here we go oh my gosh that warm oh it's very hot can you reserve the cot for me wow that's a that's what they call extreme burn excuse me sorry wow look at something else okay so are we wimpy or i mean we don't drink everclear we drink whiskey but not every clear wow i mean okay i that has great flavor though i mean other than the everclear burn but i you can really taste the flour you know what i think that is i think what that is is that the oils that were on our tongue i think that they're now desorbing and redissolving into our mouth or that's just my tongue i think you're dissolving your tongue all together that's from all right okay so okay okay this is not oh man this is killing it oh no he's gonna do it okay you got it done okay you could do that okay now what we're gonna do here i did it it's you did it what do you wanna you wanna pin or something high five okay okay you know what we don't have is something to clear our palette in between or like i did actually i had some water earlier oh really yeah i'm going to try this before i tried this i cleansed my palate it's totally unsuitable it must just be the dissolving of my tongue in the everclear but you know after this no one no one's going to join our show again all right are you kidding me everybody's going to be on all right here we go now we're going to do some mct stuff um i think i think i could do here if we lift something i could go you just pull that up pull this out yeah pull it pull it out no no pull this up right here yeah there you go pull this up yeah just pull it up i'm trying yeah okay pull it all the way up okay go there and i'll push it down how much just give me a little bit i don't need a lot there you go yeah okay there it is i need some of that okay then i'm gonna make a i'm gonna it's just kind of like a uh it's kind of like a buffet so you can just go ahead and make i'm gonna i'll tell you what i'm gonna i'm gonna put a little crude in there and uh oh my gosh now this crude is probably right around 60 percent so you know whatever i probably i probably have about a quarter mil in there so it's not a lot let's don't put that in there okay and then i put a little bit of i'll put a little bit of terpenes in there [Music] i love it when he opens this jar wow how would you like to have gallons of stuff just give us a call pick up the receiver we'll make it i tell you what our terp trap kills i mean and you can do that and that is money money money okay you don't need a lot no you don't want to overpower it right no i mean you should smell this i mean cross contaminated how many kinds are there so you can see it's not dissolving i don't know okay so it's a little bit we can we can do one or two things well obviously uh you can heat it or you can do it you can chew it you can also do a little bit of this yeah oh look at that okay i know exactly what to do we'll put this in a little centrifuge too oh okay we're going to mix it all together and we're going to make it into one homogenous solution i feel like a homogeneous solution oh yeah look at that do a little mixing it is not dissolving that's it i might i might have to add some ethanol to it to dissolve it possible oh you can see it is dissolving it is dissolving a little just need some more time and some heat probably it'd probably be some heat maybe you just pour some of this in that's plenty of pour some of this in go ahead make your own go ahead and make your own i'm going to blow something up here this is some sweet almond oil i like the sweet almond oil jared's there yeah blow something up blow something up you can make a isolated one i'm gonna make a crude one go ahead okay all right here here's this oh yeah put some sweet almond oil in there okay i'm gonna totally put a little bit of peppermint in there and then uh what do you say and then maybe put a little bit of peppermint in there what do you say whatever you want whatever well i don't mind but i mean am i am i like that's kind of fun okay that's that's enough of that i i we don't have heat but that's how you would how would you dissolve that uh first of all if you were using like vegetable glycerin you have a very hard time getting it in you'd have to heat it up and it's not it's not really it's not really soluble very because it's not very soluble in vegetable glycerin okay so um you would need to do something with it within mct oil though you can see it's it's dissolving but it's slow it's going to take a little bit of time to do that um i'm going to i'm going to actually take it out and then and then fortify it with some isolate okay all of these really cool tools i have no idea yeah i'm gonna smell it first well that smells great okay now i'm going to um there's my slight i'm going to fortify this with some isolate i think it's boiling and there's no heat oh man what occasional listen what are you doing don't blow up the r d lab yeah they they will not let us in here anymore they kicked me out a long time ago i remember when we were doing our vape formulations we're sitting here all weekend long this whole place if you just you couldn't see anything you're like boy i'm really relaxed we go outside we take a nap come back in okay i do think at one point down the road we need to take you out really good and maybe next week we'll make popcorn in the gemco oh yeah we can do that alvin we have to pre pre-pre-look at that all right so in this i have the peppermint i put a little bit of our uh flour tea from nature's crest by the way and then i put a little bit of distillate in here and i know distillate is so see what happens yeah now normally you would be taking notes you'd be measuring everything out like like a good chemist would do so that you would know what i am not a good camera we'll see this has got a lemon terpene uh mct with it should be very terpene i'm going to try it it's all for fortified did i did i tell you that you don't need a lot of peppermint that's a lot of peppermint okay i won't have to brush my teeth for like a week i think you'll be you'll be burping uh peppermint peppermint yeah here we go i'm gonna try this one now what'd you get i made it in the right proportions dude did you yeah well this is good is it yeah um will it cut the peppermint a little bit no it's got well it's got let me see here what it's got it's got uh lemon oil terpeneless lemon oil it's got a little bit of these terpenes you know uh one thing about terpenes is is that they do have a burning characteristic yeah so you always have to limit them this is especially when you're doing your vapors uh you want to make sure you limit your terpenes otherwise you're going to have a lot of burn that's that's that's very lemony it's very limiting can i try yeah sure maybe that's quite the dropper did i make it that's kind of flails that's good lemon this definitely has it's got a little bit of that lemon rind it takes to it because i can taste in the back like you know like a lemonade okay okay that's not lemon rind it's zest for those of you who cook it's called zest okay all right yes that's what you make oh that's good yeah it definitely that was good it definitely is way better than mine way way better this is this is basically a isolate fortified um crude oil um mct with a lemon no yeah lemon zest it definitely has um it has limonene in it for sure and it's got a little little in it little which is kind of a little which is a terpene it definitely has it say that five times okay all right and i put some of this in there too i know but see that is sweet thank you for being here and thank you for enjoying our tincture creation mad scientist r d lab here so this is awesome let's do a recap okay okay first uh first we had a uh a wonderful uh presentation that i put together yes yes it was really four slides you said three what was it it's kind of a bait and switch and then get the calculators go go on the calculators give us some feedback on them uh things like that please do that um and then we tried you know we did a an extraction basically an ethanol extraction using everclear and some stuff uh and some of this uh some of this blend here you can see it's still it's still in there you might want to extract it again and again but yeah you can do that with really good tea your friend does um golden water turtle tea and you can you can fuse that like seven times so that's probably the same thing you can do here you can just keep pouring and running and go yeah and you can use um in terms of uh so that's one way to do it if you're doing an ethanol extraction you can use distillate you can use crude you can use isolate um and then you know the and you can totally get this stuff online just yeah like amaretto has all the flavors i would okay there's some couple different things when you buy amaretti flavors be careful you want to buy the oil soluble flavors you don't want to buy the water-soluble flavors because they they are not very miscible in other words they won't really go into the cooking and you so you might like oh i like that flavor i like that flavor and then you have a whole bunch of them and they're like water-soluble so don't buy those i'm just say i just saved everybody a hundred dollars oh there you go don't buy the watershed oh hey barney has another quick question um he didn't know terpenes burn oh he did oh yeah yeah why would they burn well they're well because they're organic just like any anything else organic will burn like mct oil will burn um you know if you light you can light distillate on fire obviously so so he's not talking about like every clear burn that burns when you taste oh yeah yeah okay he's talking about you can light it on fire oh yeah you can do that too you can do that too so it's a good thing we don't have anything hey hey you know okay so i don't think i was involved in the formulation of these um well let me see here some is that about to change but the strawberry one is actually quite good and i still have a lot of lemons so if i if i took this would i have lemon strawberry yes of course i'll have peppermint strawberry i'm gonna have peppermint spaghetti for dinner tonight probably strawberry fields forever straw oh i still want to sing oh that should be next week's episode no sing along karaoke okay all right okay so then um an optimum thinner for people looking oh okay thinner to vape oils be very careful with thinners okay that you do you guys remember the um the vape crisis yes okay yeah um like for example um a lot some of the compounds used in the thinners that were used uh which which are terpene thin thinners essentially uh we're but the vitamin e acetate which was a problem so be careful about what you're using look at the ingredients and a lot of times people will say oh they'll say okay here's a terpene thinner for you they won't tell you what it is you can't use that because you don't know what it is and someone might actually uh for vape you know sure might get in trouble so don't use anything that you don't have like you know what everything what it is sure so yeah just just and there's a just because it's healthy to ingest doesn't mean it's healthy to vape that's correct that's correct and the other thing there is that if yeah i mean people died because they took that vitamin e acetate which is an oil yeah you know and they were vaping it so yeah so be very careful with the thinners because they're proprietary and people don't want to tell you what's in the thinner you should never use that so don't do that okay thank you for the 100 samantha awesome and uh chris has a quick question about nano emulsification still use oil based not water based um okay so using water-based you can use uh like a water base with a nano emulsion that's great i would do that um we have some water-based you know like one shots or something like that we can do that this time but we we could have and basically sounds like a future episode yeah yeah you can get all kinds of fruity flavors in there um so um those are typically uh used in like uh like water formulations like uh you know like sodas and uh seltzer waters and and like shots like energy shots and things like that i know people also sell them as quote-unquote tinctures uh you know why not you can put it in the tees and things like that so that also works um and there's a lot of different ways to nano emulsify okay a lot of it involves like equipment basically you need a high pressure homogenizer or medium pressure or a low pressure homogenizer and you can get with a low pressure homogenizer you can get down to the micron level your um your water is going to be a little cloudy and you're always going to taste it a little bit on the back of your tongue um but yeah it works sure yeah and then as you go down into the nano size and the nano emulsions that are occurring sometimes people use a combination of of emulsifiers which are chemicals which i'm not a big fan of but you know they're used in foods and things like that um and uh what else there and also high shear homogenization sure so that's like equipment plus chemicals is what you need there and it'll work it works just fine um we have done formulations that way we have some great formulations along those lines we could probably try try some of those okay yeah so i love it okay um so one of the other questions and by the way chris said they are using water sweet good good chris okay so next week we need to announce what our topic is for next week yeah i'm getting late and here's what are you thinking i don't know okay one of the things that i've thought of i mean these are things that we need to do we can we've been in the r d lab here now um what about going outside we could what about shucking and bucking we could do that yeah i mean that's an option yeah i mean you know most of the crops are in now right yeah but that where that would probably be uh like a harvest thing right so that would probably be what they need to be thinking about yeah we could do that yeah what what they need what the tools are that are coming up whether you're indoor or outdoor because now they have to start budgeting and thinking and what they're doing and you know you want i'm a planner yeah okay that's fine i mean that that's something we could do we could do that um the other things that we can do is talk about you know um protocols between the rooms yep i mean there's a lot of things we can talk about venting we can talk we could even go into you know some of the condensing potentially i don't think anybody you know are our super technical topics yep those are those are those tend to you know there's uh we could do some of those but i think we just want to do like demonstrations and things like that so what do you think yeah yeah okay so what what do you what do you what what is your music any thoughts out there we'd love to hear from you yeah okay so otherwise it'll be a surprise we will be announcing it in a couple of days what we're doing right and it's one of these three topics right so let's go all right well done great show thank you for being here look at all our resources calculators mini

I'm going to be showing some modifications we made to a regular pot still to make it into a vacuum stove the reason we wanted to vacuum still is we wanted to create CBD oils at a much lower temperature and it's possible under atmospheric pressure so we created this still we can go down to about an 80% vacuum which means that we can boil off the ethanol at 505 degrees Fahrenheit the advantage of that being then we don't cook off any of the flavors the terpenes or if we're making a whiskey or a bourbon or something like that where we're distilling it at a much lower temperature so we get much more flavor so a couple of things we had to do to create this still we took a regular three inch diameter pot still and first thing we needed to do was to connect it to a vacuum chamber this is a vacuum chamber pretty easily found on Amazon and the way we connected it and I know a lot of Steel purists will have a problem with this but we used a teflon tube advantage of teflon it's perfectly impervious to ethanol it's pretty it's you're not going to dissolve the Teflon into the ethanol so that's a PTFE hose and we created a little fitting here which we soldered onto the side of a hole that we drilled into the vacuum chamber and then use teflon tape to seal that so that's the receiver the receiver chamber that's where alcohol is going to end up after it it goes through the still so what's going to happen then we're using a propane turkey heater we need a lot of BTUs because even though we're evaporating the alcohol off at a much lower temperature we still do need a lot of heat to get that over the hump and into a vapor from a liquid so regardless of what pressure we're just filling at we still need a lot of energy to even a hundred five degrees to convert that liquid into a vapor which then is going to go up through the pot still we're using a Liebig type condenser connected to a garden hose and then into the the PTFE tube and then on the vacuum side we're just using a really cheap single stage Harbor Freight vacuum pump we don't need a two-stage pump and the reason being is because we only need to get about eighty percent eighty percent of a vacuum so we don't need a lot of overkill on the vacuum pump and this is just over a hundred dollars for that that's set up so we have that connected into the fitting here on the vacuum chamber and then on the other side I actually created a little bit of a vacuum relief that's adjustable so I can adjust the vacuum to a specific vacuum level if I want I didn't need to do that and the reason is I do have some small leaks in the system so the most vacuum I can pull on this is eighty percent which is exactly what I want so what I'm going to do is we will open up the valve starting the chamber turning on the vacuum pump [Laughter] I can see that it is the vacuum is increasing it's gonna get to about 80% vacuum now a lot of people are also might be a little afraid of the still collapsing I'm an engineer actually a structural engineer and I did find a formula or stainless steel that as long as your wall thickness is at least 1% of your diameter of your vessel you should be safe from any kind of a collapse caused by buckling I do believe that this is about a three millimeter wall thickness and about 300 millimeters so it does meet their hundred-to-one criteria and I have found with a couple evacuation that it does evacuate to 80% without any kind of deformation or anything on the side of the still so because we do have a little bit of a weak the vacuum pump does start smoking a little bit and that's because it is actually sucking air out constantly that's just something I have to deal with because I can't get it to be a complete seal with a set up that I've got I do you know where the I do know where the leak is happening the leak is happening on this connection between the head of the still and the boiler itself I can actually hear it with a really high-pitched squeal there but luckily none of the other fittings have leaks the temperature port doesn't have a leak none of the this disconnection does not have a leak and that connection does not have a leak so I look now at the at the vacuum gauge I can't see that I am just about at the 0.8 value which is where we want to be in order to do that like to ethanol and five degrees Fahrenheit okay pretty straightforward next video I post will actually be distilling off the ethanol from a ethanol CBD mix and we'll see what kind of production rates we can have with just a simple 3-inch pasto so from Luna Pierre Michigan this is greg sorter thank you", "oXAkqxU6NVs": "I folks placed out on receipt of stone industry I want to introduce our CX 250 extraction system this is a fully peer reviewed and certified model its industrial skin and attack comes a phenom extraction system modular system each process has its own skin they can control my c1 d1 touchscreen tablet works in conjunction with Amiga 4x controller located in disable this is to begin to 140 gallon methanol Chile tanks the jelly mechanism was impaired enough to qualify from the inside they will flow the negative 50 Fahrenheit glycol to chill the ethanol these tanks are fully Inslee out of the second stage the senate fuge this is C at 70 pounds per batch every 20 minutes the operator will load the file back into the basket clamp the lid down and flood with ethanol press GO the start will do a wash cycle finish with a 1500 rpm final spin which will create a 90 percent ethanol recovery what's a sweat centrifuge has completed cycling they'll be pumped into the filtration skin for stage filtration consists of a clean un-backed filter to 12-inch lenticular specs for both one um wanna cellulose and the fourth stage is a cartridge filter operator could go through all four stages or choose from one or more stages selectively final stage of ethanol recovery just probably fill the bathroom separate your solution from the ethanol this system consists of the following film separator and a two-stage condenser in this particular unit can process 250 liters to 300 liters per hour which matches a cex extraction system you'd like to find out more information about what you see here visit our website [Applause]", "952guUQcPAc": "hey everybody it's a me for girly here and today we're back with another best value of ex demo this time we'll be testing out the 2-liter rotary evaporator or rotovap from best value of ex the purpose of a roll of app is to recover the ethanol from your winterize cannabis or organic material extract while a series of heat fans or vacuum ovens can achieve this simply evaporating your ethanol can become costly very quick and a rotovap can recover nearly all of the ethanol left over in your dissolved extraction there are eight basic components to a rotovap the control unit the rotary drive the lift jack the hot water bath the condenser the receiving flask the vacuum valve and as you see here the evaporation flask the control unit allows you to adjust the temperature of the water bath and speed of the rotation of the evaporation flask best value of x recommends you set the heat bath to 113 degrees Fahrenheit or 40 degrees Celsius and the RPM of your evaporation flash should be right around 100 the rotary drive is a system that controls the physical rotation of your evaporation flask the lift jack raises and lowers your evaporation flask in and out of the hot water bath the hot water bath keeps your flask and extract at the desired temperature the condenser recondense is your evaporated solvent into a liquid the receiving flask collects all of the recondense solve it for you to reuse the vacuum valve allows you to manually adjust the vacuum level in the system although you could purchase a vacuum regulator to do this automatically and the evaporation flask which will contain your finished and unfinished extract in addition to this basic rotovap setup you will need a way to chill the liquid inside of your condensing tubes as well as a safe way to pull a vacuum special pumps are made for situations like this but the most inexpensive way i've found to efficiently run on rotovap without a chiller and the expensive pump is a simple water aspirator this water aspirator not only pulls a small vacuum but it also recirculates cold water through the condenser one thing I should note about the aspirator how is that after a half-hour or so of use the water will begin to heat up so you can either swap the warm water with cold water or occasionally add ice cubes to the water either will work fine and keep you well within your budget if you do have the budget however a Welch diaphragm pump and a poly science cello would be the way to go you should also include a cold trap if you want to be safe and save your pump and assemble glass one should do the trick if you have dry ice handy check out my Buchner funnel winterization video for more information on that now that you know what the parts of the world of EV are and what other items you might need let's take a look at my process first and foremost always make sure you clean your unit in between runs just as you should with any extraction equipment if you do not sterilize your equipment you could potentially pull over contaminants from previous runs including unseen chemicals like pesticides or molds once you have a clean system fill your hot water bath an aspirator or chiller with water I prefer to use reverse osmosis in both make sure your water is as cold as possible in the aspirator or set your chiller to 32 degrees Fahrenheit turn on your hot water bath to your desired temperature and it should be just about ready by the time you are ready to turn on the rotator make sure all of your connections are tight and in the right place your condensers should be filled from the top down so push water from your aspirator or chiller outlet to the top of the condenser and the bottom of the condenser to the inlet line lastly connect the vacuum hose to your vacuum port and ensure you have the vacuum valve installed and closed some vacuum ports have elongated tubes that allow you to add more material directly to your evaporating flask while still using the Machine pretty nice if you have too much material or too small of a rotovap ensure your receiving flask is connected properly using the provided clamp then fill up your evaporation flask with the winterize material keep in mind that you should only fill your flask to half of its capacity for example with this 2 liter rotovap setup i should only be running about 1 liter of material at a time this is a good time to have a funnel handy and best value of X makes a 120 milliliter glass funnel that fits perfectly just don't pour your extract too fast or it will bubble up all over the place and cause quite the sticky mess carefully connect your evaporation flash the receiving end of the rotary drive and carefully secure it with the provided double check and make sure your clip is securely attached before lowering or turning on the motor to ensure you do not break your flask and ruin your material once you are certain everything is securely in place turn on your water aspirator or chiller and pump and begin to recirculate the cold water through the condenser and pull a slight vacuum most vacuum pumps will be overkill for a rotovap so make sure you either pay attention and manually adjust your vacuum or purchase a vacuum regulator you should never pull a full back and most will keep their vac below 15 hg now that the cold water is recirculating and your vacuum has been pulled you're now ready to lower the evaporation flask into the hot water bath and slowly turn the motor dial as previously mentioned you want it to run at around 100 rpms but it does not have to be precise the best way to learn is to try different specs out so see what suits your process best after a few minutes you will notice drops of ethanol begin to collect on your condensing coils and drop into your receiving flask not only is this a sign that you have begun your solvent evaporation and collection but its inverse is the sign that you are done once your coils have stopped dripping you'll be near completion this process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours depending on your setup but I have been recovering over a liter of solvent in under an hour with this setup once you're confident in the vast majority of solvent has been recovered from your extract turn off the rotary drive and raise your evaporation flask out of the hot water bath carefully remove the clip and gently remove your evaporation flask remember that you have pulled a vacuum on the system and this will cause the glass to momentarily hold together you can use vacuum grease to help with this problem but it is vital that you clean all of the grease off before pouring your extract to avoid contamination once the glass has been cleaned carefully tilt your flask upside down with the collection vessel under it to begin collecting your extract it will pour much slower now that most of the ethanol has been removed and its viscosity significantly reduced and it would be wise to invest in a tripod stand and three finger clamp to do this for you otherwise you'll be sitting there holding it for quite some time once all the extract has been removed from the evaporation flask your ethanol recovery is complete from here you will want to purge the extract in your vacuum oven for a short period of time to remove the last of the solvent left in your extra as there will still be thousands of PPM's contained within the alternative is to decarboxylate the extract which will ultimately vaporize the rest of the remaining solvent convert the THC a into THC and unfortunately destroy many of the terpenes however this is the next step in the extracting your extract series one that is required for the short path distillation of cannabis and that's what we'll get into in the next video in this series I'm excited to bring you the next level of cannabis extraction and purification

"nGS6VedZVrE": "hi I'm Casey McGarvey and I'm from Delta separations today I'm a talking about next racks here in Utah I'm gonna talk to you a little bit in detail about the two most common and popular forms of cannabis and hemp extracts those two being distillate here and isolate so distillate is perhaps the most common or has been recently and is approximately 90% potent or has 90% cannabinoids by weight now that 90% is usually a mixture of cannabinoids with a whole bunch of minor ones like th CV and CBN but predominantly one like CBD or THC now isolate in contrast as the name suggests is much more potent usually 99% or more and is a single isolated a ploy and in this case I have CBD ice road", "GdywPcDbU5w": "how does cbd go from a compound in a plant to cbd product simply put extraction the purpose of extraction is to make a concentrated form of cbd that is effective for human consumption there are numerous ways to extract cannabinoids from the plant they all involve separating the cannabinoids from the plant and isolating the cbd or cannabinoids by removing the solvent or gas there are pros and cons to each extraction method and most processes when executed well can produce a safe high quality and potent cbd oil hydrocarbon extraction typically refers to using butane or propane as a solvent the solvent is passed through the plant matter then heated up to evaporate off the liquid leaving behind the cannabinoids ethanol extraction is performed by soaking cannabinoids in ethanol the alcohol pulls the plant's components into the solvent the liquid is then filtered and the alcohol removed to produce the extract co2 extraction uses pressurized carbon dioxide to pull cbd from the plant although it is laborious and expensive it is regarded as the best way to extract cbd due to its gentle action and high yield the co2 easily penetrates the plant cells and dissolves its phytonutrients which remain unharmed and unaltered during the process the co2 is then evaporated leaving an extract that is free of harsh chemicals contaminants and toxins in all of these methods the cbd extract is then used to produce various types of products it can be mixed into a carrier oil to create cbd oil put into a liquid to make vape liquid put into food to make cbd edibles or blended with topicals to create a balm at octagon bio labs our products are made using co2 extraction this process preserves the full spectrum of cannabinoids and ensures all the components of hemp remain potent completely undenatured and fully active on-site chromatography reviews and independent lab tests are performed on each batch of product to maintain high standards of purity and potency furthermore a unique and proprietary nano-emulsion system enables us to boost the speed and degree of absorption over competing products the industry standard for sublingual delivery creates liquid droplets of 100 to 5000 nanometers in size octagon biolab cbd hemp oil droplets are emulsified to 25 nanometers the miniaturized droplets means our extracts yield higher absorption higher bioavailability and ultimately higher effectiveness for more information visit octagon bio labs", "YXpfchNKqm0": "hi I was doing some plant extractions so I thought I would share my process here you can see the ground up plant in question normally a chemist will do setup like this this is footage stolen from nurdrage if you don't know him go check him out anyway the key feature here is the soxhlet extractor it is a device that you can load up with stuff and it will automatically cycle the fresh solvents through it it is basically automatic self siphoning device if you like me don't have such logic structure or any glassware basically you can use method that I am using here so this is just basic filter paper that I modified to allow vapor to pass through it of course it has to be compatible with your solvent on top of that you can place random container that you will fill with cold water ideally this should be glass container but in the past I have used even polypropylene plastic cups also here is some kindergarten science in case you wonder how you can make effectively holes in this filter paper you can see that I intentionally offset the first hole from the bottom this offset basically depends on how much material you have now let's put in just a little bit of a solvent I'm using 50 milliliters of ethanol put your stuff that you want to extract into this filter paper do this outside your extraction container because you can contaminate liquid then a few your cooling container with water and be sure to keep outside dry now you can turn on your heat source and just wait actually you should periodically check the temperature of your cooling water one little problem this setup have is that the filter paper likes to suck in the solvent and carry stuff with it this is not a big deal unless you work with extremely small quantities in which case you shouldn't use this setup anyway you should continue with extraction until you see that the solvent that comes out of the filter paper is basically clear I guess depending what solvent and what you are extracting here you can see plant material after extraction and you can see that is quite off-colored and at this point I tested the extracted plant material and I can confirm that the chemical was not there and here's the extract it should be pale yellow oily resin material but you can see that it has quite greenish tint to it this is due to presence of chlorophyll in this part I will try to extract the chlorophyll from the extract itself unfortunately only way I can destroy chlorophyll presence is by UV fluorescence which would not be so terrible but unfortunately my only resource is this PCB exposure unit I built sometime ago this is about 120 watt light source and the radiation from this Fink is overwhelming when you turn this thing gone basically whole world looks like it's dead and I will have to make some adjustments to the scene so you can see what I can see and now we are cooking there may be much better solutions to separate chlorophyll but I know only about one solvents that can do this and that is propane or butane or mixture of two now this will be a little bit crazy but actually propane mixed with ethanol is not quite that volatile but it's still pretty much flammable so be aware of that at least I mean it should be unless you are five years old anyway so you can see that there is quite clear separation of two fractions since that chlorophyll content is not that different though also in the visible light this is really nice but the question is how do we separate this seriously what did you think if you have one you can use separatory funnel just never never plug it up even though it should handle this pressure there wouldn't be much much higher than one atmosphere of pressure I mean do you see any problem here I repeated this extraction about six or eight times now on the left side you can see the butane fraction and on the right side you can see the ethanol fraction the ethanol one is quite muddy it seems like it has some water content in it to be fair I also fill tributon fraction through some filter paper so but still it wasn't muddy it seemed to be contaminated by some solid pieces now both fractions are right and you can see quite clearly the color difference now let's look at this under UV light [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you can see this reddish fluorescence that is quite specific to chlorophyll this is the beauty infraction even though you can see some orange a green fluorescent blobs there on the other hand in the ethanol fraction you can see that the whole material is this orange green fluorescent pink although even here you can see some quite a reddish spots that could indicate some presence of chlorophyll so the separation is quite good but not 100%", "JPx1gFN9oM8": "[Music] my name is Jean chief development officer here at captain systems and I'm the inventor of the ethos systems ethos systems are laboratory-scale extraction paralysis that allow you to go from plant material to extremely pure extract relatively quick we use a solvent that is ethanol the beauty of the ethos systems is it allows us to manipulate the temperature and maintain a certain temperature during the extraction process which in turn lets the ethanol behave less polar so we are not drawing unnecessary constituents out of the plant material we're only isolating and selectively picking up th c-minor cannabinoids terpenes and basically everything that you want and leaving behind anything that you don't we watch the plant material over and over and over by recirculating the solution so ethanol goes into the extraction vessel from that it will be pulled into a collection vessel inside the machine preserving its temperature and then we recycle it over several times it's very gentle process and that gives us the best result it's anywhere between negative 75 degrees Celsius and negative 50 degrees Celsius so very cold I wouldn't touch anything inside once the machine is on it will burn yeah we have three main solvents currently on the market hydrocarbons butane propane co2 and then ethanol we knew that butane is not gonna be something that we wanted to play with co2 it's not very selective so it picks up everything in that plan primarily fats and waxes it's like 30% fats and then maybe 50% in a Benoist now if we want to take that up to a VOD of 80% you have to remove those waxes we would still then have to wash that extract in ethanol and therefore we could no longer claim that this is a co2 extract I mean in good faith we put a lot of companies out there do that they put co2 extract on the box none of the consumers know that that's already been refined with ethanol so to us it was a no-brainer why ethanol the end product that comes out of the ether is actually a solution so it's a combination of the ethanol and the oils that have been washed off the plant material past the ethos there's what's called the reduction case - where we reduce the solution to a concentrate form so that oil you can go ahead and smoke that would be your shatter that could be your wax that's not your go-to product then it goes to distillation you collect just the THC and from there on you can make endless varieties of products [Music] the amount of material that the throughput that the system offered with the amount of power that it consumes it was just it was mind-blowing - a lot of the customers it feels great you know for any inventor to get good feedback it is very humbling", "Jw0bMDN7viM": "hi i'm jen with dreaming field farm and i'm here to talk to you today about the endocannabinoid system i'm sure you've heard of the muscular system the skeletal system the immune system but it is true you do have an endocannabinoid system or ecs for short the main function of the endocannabinoid system is to keep your body in balance to regulate so basically if you're hot the endocannabinoid system kicks in and tells your body to sweat to cool you down the same goes for pain and inflammation because the endocannabinoid system is integrated with your nervous system when there is pain and inflammation say in the knee the endocannabinoid system is stimulated to release endocannabinoids to reduce the pain and inflammation and bring the body back to normal cbd and thc were only first extracted from the cannabis plant and researched in the 1940s and it wasn't until 1992 that the endocannabinoid system was discovered researchers also discovered receptors located all throughout the body since the endocannabinoid receptors have such a close relationship with the nervous system there's a wide range of functions that can be affected there are three components to this system receptors endocannabinoids which are molecules made by your own body that are very similar in structure to the cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant and enzymes which help break down the endocannabinoids once they are done being utilized like any other system the endocannabinoid system can become deficient whether that's by not producing enough endocannabinoids not having enough receptors having too many enzymes that break down the endocannabinoids before they are allowed to fully function of course there's the outside factors too like stress environment medications and unhealthy diet what we do know is that phytocannabinoids or plant-based cannabinoids like cbd oil and cbd products have been shown to stimulate and support your endocannabinoid system when you use a cbd product you are activating your endocannabinoid system to target that specific area and reduce the pain and inflammation thanks for joining me and for more information please visit dreamingfieldfarm.com", "sfDKCHrUA4k": "hello everyone and welcome to today's live broadcast controlling terpenes and

Rogan I will now turn the presentation over to him so I welcome everyone to this talk thank you for joining in on my quick or hopefully enlightening presentation of the research we have been doing at Elko about how we control terpenes and cannabinoids in our flour and extract so to give you background on extraction we just were thinking what actually is an extract and what should an acts trying to do so as I mentioned this the controlling cannabinoids and turkeys in flower and extracts that means I want to be able to give to the customer or the patient the right cannabinoids they need but also when I extract I want to represent the flower so often we see products that claim to be an OG Kush or or gg but they might not be what you would expect so with that we have to consider a few things but let me give you an idea of what this talk will be about we will talk about the backgrounds we will talk about how we optimize our extraction and we will compare and contrast a little and I try to bring in a few other anecdotes and information sniffles we found in our studies so what is an extract so an extract is when a solvent removes something from a matrix so butane extraction co2 extraction ethanol extraction would be an extra when people talk about a rosin extract or an ice-water hasha extract that is actually incorrect because from a chemical side for extraction you need a solvent rosin is just a mechanical separation through pressure and temperature and water ice water extract is actually about the same the water and ice cubes agitate the material and you collect the Triclops so again it's a separation but I just wanted to bring out these few inconsistencies or incorrectness in distributing in pointing terms in the cannabis industry and I just like to point out small mistakes but what is an extract and for that what actually is in the cannabis plant in the first place so we all know about THC and CBD we have heard about them often enough and some people prefer the THC for the buzz others now claim that CBD has all the health benefits but there's more than just two cabins we also might have heard of CVG the precursor to all cannabinoids or other cannabinoids and then CBN which is actually not a naturally-occurring cannabinoid both often used for sleep or relaxation so but there if you are actually there over 140 contaminoids at the last count so just focusing as I said early on THC and CBD might not be the right method to offer the right product to the customer but not only 140 cannabinoids they're already over 200 terpenes identified in the cannabis plant and terpene is what makes up the smell and the flavor plant but terpenes are not just present cannabis they are present in basically everything that smells limonene is called limonene because it was first found in laminates better kara finally in the home you lean also known in other plants but a care of filing is actually would ask this peppery taste and but then they're so many more care terpenes of interest and while it might be interesting or it might be a good business thought of not using the terpenes derived from the cannabis plant but using them from other sources like lemons the problem there is that we can identify the first 10 or 50 most dominant terpenes but as there are over 200 that in their combination make up the complex player flavor complex flavor profile of the cannabis plant trying to recreate it is very very difficult so it might not be the root best method to do this but again we're not yet done they're also flavonoids that add to the complexity of the plant and while flavonoids are right now not tested for in the cannabis industry they do hold very interesting biological effects and should be considered when planning your raw process your drying process and your extraction method but we're still not done we have further compounds that of biological activity and interest alcohol actions aldehydes and it quickly becomes very complex so we have so many molecules of interest maybe we have a method to present those to the patient and customer so extract might be a great way because just having flower limits you are consumption method and might go against the idea of a healthy patient when we then smokes a joint so extract might be the way forward so extra X come in all shapes and forms and they come from different processing methods different application methods consumption methods or just interests of the patient so what are those act rights used for we use some strainer as a concentrate to inhale through heating's or dabbing or other forms of smoking but they can also be used as a base to make further products like a sublingual tincture evade cartridge a cream so many possibilities and they have to be considered depending on what the patient needs what illness is he other the patient have or outcomes the client targets so when I think about making extracts I have to consider many different factors and it was actually one of my first bosses when I entered the cannabis industry taught me to make the best abstract and I run into the problem that I don't really know what a best extract is because of all the problems I just mentioned we have too many things to consider so what might be the best for one patient or method application method might not be the best for another patient so but there are still a few underlying principles that we all have to consider and so if we think what is the best method is maybe the method that produces the most but if I just think about weight as my benchmark for success then if I juice some families I get 60 percent yield it's all water but it's the high number on the yield side so that might not be the best benchmark so if I consider a production cost a PVC pipe a lighter and a cheesecloth should be really cheap and my production costs a low but I think open blasting like this in your backyard or blowing up your shed might not be the best method after all so I think we should consider the extraction quality that we represent the cannabis plant in our extracts we don't want to make a nice alert we don't want to extract things that the patient is not in need of but we also want to give a carbon copy of the plant if possible so a large last aspect to consider is the legal part different municipalities different cities have different rules and different states or two we all know what Jeff Sessions stand on cannabis is but what does your local government think of it so we are an outcall are based in the County of San Diego and while the city of San Diego was one of the first California cities to allow the manufacturing and sale of recreational cannabis the County of San Diego decided to forbid this so with further restrictions while we are licensed for medical marijuana we are only licensed to produce with co2 we are not allowed to use ethanol extraction or beauty so therefore in my case I stick with co2 extraction and that's where I can present the data on so how do i optimize I have to consider a few factors what I am actually looking for and I could look for yield per run but again yield might not be the best method and firaon is a bad process so if I have limited amount of material that might be the right way I want to get out as much as possible but if I have unlimited material or I have more than I might be able to process I want to consider how much how can I produce the most per week so that's a time factor here and I'm looking for maybe high turnover and it is slightly different to yield per run I can also consider cannabinoid concentrations so how do I make a very nice pure extract or high-end cannabinoids so that I don't have to make too many post-processing steps also I can think about the Turcan concentration or the content because Tara penis what gives flavors what might be also a large influence on the enter our chef act so if I have a very flavorful noter can concentrate it might not be what the customer needs and then my favorite number is actually recovery that considers of how much THC for example was in the plant to begin with and how much do I recovered at the end because if I make a 60% extract but all of it is water or fats and chlorophyll that doesn't help me but if my plant that I put into the extractor has a 15% can average content and if we have a 10 pound 10-pound extractor loading we therefore should get one and a half pound of extract out of pure THC out so if I now only hit a pound of THC then I know I wasn't very good in my recovery and I know that I can't get more than one and a half pounds so I cannot mathematically go over 15% yield if we align THC recovery and yields here so recovery is a very good number to check your process okay so how can I influence my extraction I can in this co2 case I can change the temperature I can change pressure I also can consider run time a flow rate of the pump is a very important often overlooked factor but also particle size anecdotally we know that candied sugar does not dissolve as fast in your coffee yes powdered sugar would be and so the same should hold true for cannabis when extracting so as an example let's look at recovery in time how old as time conference my recovery if I look at it the longer I run the machine the better my recovery is but when I look at the graph a bit closer there is actually a slight change in behavior initially we have a straight line so basically the longer I run the more I get out and just run along and I do better and that is when the extraction is in its mass transfer fades it just it can't go faster but it also doesn't slow down all the time but eventually it will we see a diffusion phase later on in the extraction process and at that point we are entering diminishing returns so when I run longer I don't get out more or as much as I would expect so if I would be on a recovery per run base I would run longer because I want to get artis more edge master possible but if I want to heal or I can recovery per week I should have stopped now because I'm going to diminish my returns and also this diffusion based is on a chemical side not only lower yield but also the extract Constitution changes when in the mass transfer my extract at point and at the five hour mark might be the same as the extra coming out at the 15 hour mark when I enter the fusion phase we see a change in composition so there is less THC to extract so it slowly still trickles out but the co2 starts to pick up other things so chlorophylls fast are now coming out so I'm really putting myself in a bind if I we're trying to push further and this point of switch over from mass transfer to diffusion is about 80% recovery so I'm already hinting you should really understand a lot of what is in your plant and what is your extract target so lots of testing really helps here your local analytical app will be very thankful but depending on your operation size you might also consider using your own equipment so with the right staff in your company if we'll pay all the llama okay so this was our time example but we can also look at particle size for our recovery and as I already mentioned and I don't we think there should be an effect but actually looks at a let's look at the data so when we use the same starting material the same amount of extract the loading the same conditions on temperature pressure and time so therefore they're not important in this example and the only thing we change is particle size we see that we get higher recoveries with smaller particle size and it's a it's an obvious trend here there might be the fear that when the particle becomes too small my extraction policy might go down because now chlorophyll can leach out quicker but under operation condition we have not seen that drop academically yes that is true it can happen but then you're talking about very small sample matter preparation volumes in an experimental setting but if we're thinking of high-throughput large volume extraction operations our case we have a ten-pound loading her run we we won't be able to grind that fine with a machine that would produce the grind in a timely fashion we don't want to spend five days making a very fine powder to then x-factor for a day we need to be able to do this in an hour or two and so those machines don't grind us fine and therefore we don't run into problems so how does our extra our fine particles actually look here on the left side we see some of our rhyming experiment particle sizes and on the right yeah that's how hard actually looks when a council of the mill and that's my colleague once told me we are definitely not in Kansas anymore and I don't think Ken's a in the last cannabis so it's good the work that we are in San Diego but as I just showed to you if we change particle size we extract more so assumingly faster but if I also did my study on time then I run into the problem that I change one factor and then the other factor is not valid anymore in my data so I would have to rerun my time experiment after I run my particle experiment and then basically BEC and forth and I try a third factor and I keep on redoing everything every time and I think we can do that more efficient and to do that more efficient we're leaving something that's called design of experiment for that we're looking at multiple factors at the same time we can test the whole space of possibilities and we can even see second-order effects that you will not see if you only change one factor at a time and I like fast and efficient and German so that's what I went for so how do we execute a design of experiment and I go directly now to our execution and results because while I really enjoy the underlying math and statistics behind it when I have discussed that in a conference setting before I had people leaving I counted that Lester win for myself but to get now to the more interesting actually results I will spare you this if you have any further questions about the underlying math please feel free to ask me afterwards and I will provide you with all the necessary information but let's talk about the execution so we are looking in this example at pressure and time and here I give you the upper and lower limits of the temperature and pressure and please be aware that I show you the temperatures in Celsius because as the European I still don't understand the Fahrenheit idea even if it was invented by a German but I think that's just cruelty that we Germans like and just push that onto you and deal you have to deal with it I like I like Celsius and then psi for the pressure which is actually now an imperial unit and on a metric anymore but my extractor was built in the u.s. only gives me psi and it also gives you an idea here changing between metrics and imperial units how messed up the cannabis industry still is I we are trying to be better and become a real industry but we're still stuck in in the past in some areas and in our own ways and I just take that as an example here okay so when I want to look at temperature and pressure I can think of a space and I donate that here's our square and I can just do five experiments donated by the points on this space to look at the possible possibilities because the math but I spared you will then compute a surface that spans all possible combinations of temperature and pressure now on the right side I give you a table of all the experiments I run we double the middle point the C experiment tools to get refugee ability and the standard error because if I happy to represent don't have any option or possibility of optimizing anything if I can't trust my own experiment so therefore we had to do this DC experiment twice but I can also do this same method for the subcritical spatial liquid co2 because I've heard so often over and over again that subcritical is better some critical extraction is so much better and again I don't really know what the best is but I know how to look for it so this were these are the experimental conditions for our subcritical space and to just give you a better idea of what I was testing or where I was testing in the space I give you the phase diagram here in the middle and co2 gas phase is the nature this grey the solid is red and then the liquid and the supercritical space just stay in the middle and the squares with a point in the middle is basically the experimental conditions we tested there might be a little bit of a slip but the we didn't test gas face your to just it was in that border region okay so what our results as I promised you after you did these five experiments and you used a little bit of math and a bit of programming you see these surfaces and surface gives you in this case the THC recovery in the supercritical space and I also show you the formula that actually donates this surface and when you look at it that the factor for temperature so XT it has a 15 in front of it about fourteen point nine but Russia has a factor of 123 so we can already get an idea that pressure is far more influential on our recovery than temperatures but both are positively aligned with recovery so therefore more pressure on more temperature we get more year or more recovery and we can easily see that on the surface we can also look sane recovery surface for this subcritical condition and here the surface becomes a little bit more interesting but the earlier ideas that pressure have the largest influence on meal and sports are positively correlated still holds true it's now at 126 or slightly change temperatures actually negatively correlated now with yield or recovery but the the second-order effect of pressure temperature together is positive still and therefore leads to this very interesting surface shape but again high pressure high temperature in the socrata gives us the best field recoveries so hotel pain concentration that is something different now first off I'm not showing just the raw recovery I'm talking about the the concentration so wanting a really light terpene rich and in our case cannabinoid depleted extract like I show on the Left what's the goal of this optimization and the formula we are now getting really good at this math reading is that and both temperature and pressure are negatively correlated to the Turcan concentration so therefore in the supercritical space if we have just above the critical point that might be the best condition for our turf extract we can also look at this on the subcritical space and the surface not time but if you think back about the face diagram actually it's pointing a bar at the same point in space on that face diagram it's pointing towards the super the critical point so it seems that the critical point is what is critical for good terpenes so with all this we we've now quickly with a total of twelve experiments so it's about a month work in the lab and then a few long weekends on the computer for the math programming we finished our optimization but this is right now it's all theoretical it's math it's chemistry is what I like but obviously my boss it's asking me is it the best extract so let's look at it because that's how you normally present it your extract in the first place and these were some of the extracts we found and I think they look somewhat similar to what most of you might have seen coming out of the co2 extractor I personally make them nicknamed them diarrhea but I think we can do better and one of the very interesting acts facts that we found is these in the middle they are actually 80 percent THC acid straight out of the extractor you have these dry rocks or powder that are just really high in THC acid and this THC acid that's what'll actually in the plan not THC th C's decarboxylated after you smoke or when he smoked it or he did in other forms THC acid this waters in the plant so if you want to give the right representation of the flower the acid forms what you have to go for but it won't matter make you high it's not psychoactive but it doesn't have healing properties and I use healing properties here loosely not a medical doctors so it's not mine to claim those but we're working with doctors and nurses and the parents we have formulated THC acid as the startling world tincture for a to yield epileptic patient because we really didn't want to make that child her children her a child high but we wanted to offer the potential healing properties of the cannabis plant and smoking was not an option either so having these THC acid Ridge rocks whether way forward because we had already found in earlier twice that pure CBD wasn't working and THC acid isolate is very expensive and again it it's an individual molecule and as I showed you earlier it's the combination of multiple cannabinoids that make it interesting so therefore our whole plant THC a rich extract or rocks was the solution and it worked the kid has seen a significant reduction in seizures and the mother reports very happily on the progress of the child but for most of us most of our customers THC rich extracts it's what what everyone wants we hear so often clarity comes they cartridges flow better with the THC extract not these rocks obviously so how can we make those and with our optimized conditions this is how our extract looks this is how it looks straight out of the extractor we did not winterize we did not distill that's how it comes out I also think winterization is definitely not the solution anyway what technically it is a solution but process orientated I don't see the point why you have to winterize something and also a smaller winterization chemically it's a precipitation but I'm not I'm not a fan sorry okay going on now that we did the study of subcritical and supercritical I can now compare and contrast because earlier I said people said south critical is better so is it what if we look at recovery TFC recovery in the same time frame because it's yield or recovery per week that we are after we see a a 20% point higher recovery in supercritical condition also our terpene fraction actually become of better quality when we use supercritical we have about 10 percent point higher concentration of terpenes at a Margy higher yield and we can also look at other effects so when we now have the whole dataset we can start digging into effects and behaviors on a on a molecular level and it turns out that THC is more soluble in co2 than THC acid and I show you that both in a super in the subcritical space here our starting material has the decarboxylation rate of 8 or 14 percent respectively and when we extract on use short period of time we raise this decarboxylation rate so that is the strong indicator that THC extracted first the THC acid stayed behind therefore we improved our THC to THC acid ratio but when we run longer to completion then we come back to our starting material ratio showing that we didn't see any further decarboxylation in the process and just kept the starting material ratios and we can use that to actually affect the THC to THC acid ratio so if someone would want harshly decarboxylated material we can offer that thanks to our data sets also we can look at CBD to THC behavior because CBD while it is an isomer of THC so it has the same amount of molecules same amount of atoms in the molecule it does behave different in co2 it actually extracts faster so it's more soluble and again I look at our ratios and starting material after a short time and after a long time and you see that it the ratio increases to the favor of CBD and then eventually comes back to the starting material ratio so again we can use this to adjust the ratio so if a patient would need a a 3 to 1 CVD to THC ratio but in the flower you either get all th co CVD or one-to-one genetically there isn't anything that does three to one you could either mix different strains or we could actually take a 1 to 1 strain adjust our extraction conditions and then get the 3 to 1 ratio so coming back to the title of the talk we can control that cannabinoids a terpenes in the extract thanks to all the math that I had to slide through earlier and as a bonus point decarboxylation of THC of THC acid actually faster than CVD acid we have seen that trying to become oxalate the flower in Arvin trying to decarboxylate the oil and an oven or other experimental setups I'm still not sure why I think it's a very interesting chemical problem and I guess with some further kinetic studies or computational studies this could be figured out but for the producer that's just something to consider if you have your standard methods to decarboxylate THC rich oil and you now have the CBD rich oil those methods will work you need longer or higher temperature so please keep that in mind you can't just take your SOPs and take them from one process to the next there are some stepping stones to always consider okay so can we enrich minor cannabinoids and yes we can it's it's an interesting and cool effect if minor cannabinoids is what we are going for CVG in this case or maybe a THC D that is a minor constituent of the plant we can enrich here as well so I've now showed you lots of result examples but like let's just overall think about this again off the consider off the title Wells said controlling turkeys so when we think about terpenes terpenes how s the last studies have shown might actually be the best way of looking at strains it's not the name but the flavor that distinguishes the plant so I'm tokens are the flavor so when we go by a study on the Netherlands by Professor hosaka he found that sativas or what is said to be a sativa are rich in mono Turkey and in the curse of rich incest butter beans so now then for me comes the question as an extractor and I play with it and yes we can we can actually change due to the different solubilities of monoterpene supposed Sasquatch other beings we can change the ratio and so boldly stated I could take a sativa flower and turn it into an indica oil and I thought that was a cool effect I don't think that I can turn a Sour Diesel into a cookie or tangerine flavored strain but at least we can tweak a little and I see this here not so much on the side of being able to customize strains but being able to correct for any small variance in the grow so if your indoor grow or greenhouse growing small variations from from harvest to harvest you can adjust or dampen it with the extraction okay so other extraction methods and see I made the mistake myself it's the separation methods if we think about Rossum and if we look at the recovery and that was the number that really really struck me was we are getting 72% recovery and I told you 80% is what we go for on co2 so this is a really high and efficient problem by inefficient process and again I like my mask so we use the same process of optimization for the rosin and we found some interesting or annoying results that yield and quality are negatively aligned so if you want a lot of yield you get a little quality out if you want good quality you don't get much yield so that might be a reason why it is such a connoisseur product but again we were able to play with temperature and pressure on the rosin or temperature time on our rosin press to optimize this we also looked at ice water harsh and while it looks very nice under the high potency at a concentrate we only got a 25 or so cover II so we have to now think what do you do with the material after the ice water hash separation can you can you use in a second process or can you optimize we have we've tried a little we haven't found much to optimize so we have to think of the secondary process but again think about this for your own flow for your own operation test your process throughout look at what's your starting material what's happening through the extraction what happened what is at the end have you extracted everything or not yes lots of analytics I'm an organic chemist by training I didn't think it was that cool analytics but it really helps your operations yeah with that I'm actually coming to a close and I have to thank the supporting companies in this because apex was very nice to help us with optimising our extractor I call it now Frank an extractor because we had to make quite a few changes to the extractor setup thanks to or not thanks to the optimization process and the math I found that the extremes were the best conditions so we had to be able to run the machine as the tech strains what it was designed for so we had to add a few things to the machine to get that all running and also pop consistent particle size is what really makes your extract good consistent our particle size will give you a consistent fine separated extract with the high throughput and to do that a kitchen grinder a kitchen mill just doesn't cut it you need a professional mill and fridge were so kind to help us with a lot of expertise on their machine and I even visited their production site in Germany they can't play with cannabis there but they grind a lot of hops and that gets you a lot of beer and German beer so it was a good trip let's say it was illiterate but it's not only their manufacturers that helped us with it most important to the whole process is a great team and for that you need your colleagues with expertise to help you in all ways and here on the right you see Blake cause he is my extraction manager he was most instrumental in all the data I presented to you today but met celiac my production manager or Taylor tried formulation they play on all the other aspects of controlling cannabinoids and turkeys in the flour and the extract or ultimately the product and then on the Left I talked about analytics and someone has to handle analytics and someone has to be the annoying person telling you that this is not to standard so you can't give it to your customer and for that you need a strong Quality Assurance person and Chris Katina has been instrumental in this process so with that I'm just at my last slide already I thank you very much for listening in I'm happy to answer all your questions but I properly wasn't able to answer in the short time frame and I wish you a nice day thank you dr. Rogan for that informative presentation we will now start the live Q&A portion of the webinar so if you have a question you'd like to ask please do so now just click on the ask a question drop-down box located on the far left of your presentation window type your question into the box that appears on your screen and click the send button I'll answer as many of your questions as we have time for so let's get started our first question is why is winterization not a good method so as a chemist I'm puzzled by the question or by the process of winterization so you extract something from the plant so you'd say you target egg to extract something so you have now your extract and then you have to remove something from the extract why didn't you extract wrong in the first place so that's why winterization really presents also it's not motorisation is a precipitation and then the third aspect you use this very expensive co2 machine to not introduce any other liquid solvent into your extract but then you're using ethanol as the post-processing material for suppose the same step and then you have ethanol on your product so not a fan what are the limitations of your method and set up so I'm there there we go okay so I'm back on I was muted for a second sorry so the limitations are but I'm we're doing good line analytics so we're using an outside testing laboratory to do the analytics so the limitation there is that I have to bring that over wait for the results so there's a little bit of a lag so that limits my optimization then I'm using a 2000 psi future extractor with a 1 separator setup there are machines that can do for higher pressures which would probably optimize our recovery and yield per week setup also with multiple separators you can further separate your extract after the extraction in the recovery part and then finally we are limited to co2 for law reasons but every solvent has a different behavior on the cannabinoid solubility so with other solvents I should be able to different representations of the plant so I always tried to stay true to the plant but tweaking the ends is dependent on the solvent he views well thank you very much I would like to once again thank dr. Rogan for his presentation I would also like to thank lab roots for making today's educational webcast possible before we go I want to let everyone know that today's webcast will be available for on-demand viewing through June 29 2018 you'll receive an email from lab roots letting you know when this webcast will be available for replay please share that announcement with your colleagues who may have missed today's live event that is all for now thank you for joining us we hope to see you again soon bye", "dY7RgzCmdHM": "hi I'm KC McGarvey and I'm with Delta separations today I'm at Wasatch extraction here in Salt Lake City and right now I'm going to talk to you kind of the about the pros and cons of different solvents and different forms of extraction really so to take it from the top really when it comes to cannabis and him there's two large categories of extraction the first one being mechanical separation and then the second large category being what chemists would call a solid phase extraction now the solid phase extraction is much more common and this includes things like co2 extraction hydrocarbon extraction and ethanol extraction as well as a number of others mechanical separation in contrast involves not a solvent necessarily but usually an immiscible liquid water in the case of ice hash and we use that water to mechanically separate the trichomes rather than to dissolve them and this is what differentiates mechanical separation extraction from solid phase extraction and so today what I'm going to talk about are the pros and cons of the most popular solid phase extraction forms for cannabis and hemp and those are ethanol co2 and hydro carbons now when I say hydrocarbons I refer to any mixture of propane butane and the most popular but people also use hexane in its liquid form as well so some of the pros and cons about a hydrocarbon extraction number one we'll start with the cons for it it is very expensive to build out a compliant lab for hydrocarbon extraction and this is mostly because it's explosive and so it requires much more there's much more stringent restrictions on building a lab that is based around hydrocarbon extraction another downside to it is it's potentially toxic so residual solvents in the extract is important and can be of a concern and lastly one of the cons is it it hydrocarbons generally speaking don't have a high throughput they don't extract a lot they don't extract you they're not as slow as co2 but they don't extract a lot for a batch some of the pros for hydrocarbons now it is very good at extracting terpenes and it's pretty selective meaning it won't grab a lot of the compounds we don't want one compound it will grab sometimes our fats and lipids and we need to remove those in some case what one of the biggest pros for hydrocarbons however is the flexibility of products that you can create with it because you can blend mixtures of butane and propane and you can leave different ratios of lipids with the cannabinoids it can produce a myriad of different products some of the most popular being sauce which is basically terpenes diamonds which is crystallized THC a and all matter of in between products that are popular for dabbing so it creates very versatile products now for co2 will again start with its cons the biggest con for co2 is that it's an expensive equipment cost it's a relatively safe form of extraction but it requires higher pressures and because of this the equipment is relatively expensive now then the other con that co2 has is that it has a very low throughput compared to the other two hydrocarbons and ethanol it is definitely has the lowest through pool or extracts the least amount of biomass per batch and however the pros to co2 are basically high selectivity so like hydrocarbons it's very good at extracting terpenes and it's good at extracting cannabinoids in wet as well but it's most its hallmark really is it selectivity and that means not that you're going to be able to isolate cannabinoids necessarily but you will get a smaller band when you extract of molecules and what that does is it the post-processing steps which are necessary no matter what form of extraction you choose but the post-processing steps for co2 are are generally speaking because you've you've got in this very small band of molecules during the extraction process now as I said another benefit to co2 is that extracts terpenes very well like hydrocarbons and another one is that it's safe so although you're dealing with high pressures you're not dealing with any flammable or explosive gases or liquids in fact co2 is is the opposite it is very not flammable so there's a benefit to there of the safety and build-out cost Wow now finally ethanol so ethanol is cons number one is ethanol is taxed so because it is you know alcohol is drinkable basically there's a tax on it and the solvent is very costly another con to ethanol is that it's Prost it's post-processing or the processes you have to perform after extraction are probably the most intensive there's more of them than with co2 or with hydrocarbon now however the pros in ethanol it is somewhat selective so extracting with cold ethanol for example will allow you to not extract the fats and will allow you to extract a little more proficiently doing with the cold solvent one of the other pros and perhaps ethanol biggest Pro is its throughput so compared to butane and to co2 it has a much higher throughput meaning that it can extract way more biomass per hour or per batch than the other two solvents so for manufacturers generally speaking ethanol is useful for bulk production because it has the highest so just quick overview here again mechanical separation involves separating the trichomes through mechanical means and results in things like kief and ice water hash solid-phase extraction xin clewd ethanol hydro carbon and co2 each of them having their own pros and cons butane and co2 being very good at extracting terpenes and hydrocarbon and excuse me ethanol being very good at extracting cannabinoids and so is much more suited for high laboratories", "-K1ZvZyzJwI": "cedarstone industry presents the rex recirculation extraction system a complete skid mounted biomass ethanol extraction system one of the most versatile and trusted

gotta love it look at that here's just a whole bunch more of the products listed they got everything my friends very very nice and okay here's some frequently asked questions we'll go over one of these our hemp and its derivatives legal yes the farm act of 2018 federally legalized industrial hemp and its derivatives meaning that everything except for delta 9 thc is federally legalized i believe the only thing that's actually illegal in uh in the the cannabis flower is that delta nine uh psychoactive thc so you know everything else is a 100 legal uh like i said except if you are in one of those one of those states listed um where were they you got too many cards over here now yeah unless you're in one of these states you cannot get delta eight but that's it everything else is still 100 legal my friends okay well here we go we are finally down to the bubble wrap let's get this removed and let's see what kind of goodies are underneath big ol thick bubble wrap gotta love it our products are gonna be nice and safe down there what is this oh my lord okay so we have two packages here this one clearly says it is for me we got some terrible light in here today my friends sorry about that we're gonna put this to the side but oh my lord we have a sponsored giveaway package my friends let's get that box out of there that's all that was in here okay let me just double check making sure um yes okay that's all that was in there one second let me just readjust my camera here all right my friends this is awesome this is definitely an unexpected surprise for me um this is super cool that this package is for me gotta love it but as you know on our channel here dill pickle subs we love doing giveaways and look at this my friends we have our first sponsored giveaway from silver owl cbd company very very nice we're going to get to this one in just a second let's open up this one first and see what see what we've got this is so cool gotta love it my friends all right the first thing i got in here is wrapped in bubble wrap with a rubber band we have some silver owl cbd hemp flower look at that my friends we have an eighth of an ounce here double owl i believe is the strain cbd 13 total thc 0.2 percent very cool and look at that it even comes with a little humidity packet in there you know your strain is going to be nice and uh perfect very cool one second my friends i got a cat over here playing in that big old box banksy can you please stop we're trying to film a video i gotta take that away from you my friend i'm sorry okay back to this my friends back to this hemp flower okay we gotta open this up and see what it looks like if i can get through the child proof lock okay we gotta get this out of here definitely from colorado it's got that uh nice dry dryness to it all right my camera kind of sucks we don't have very good lighting in here today but this is some decent looking stuff here the smell is not too bad just smells kind of like you know and cbd kind of has that distinct smell to it and that's what this smells like so not bad you know at least you know you're getting some hemp flour what else do we have in this little goodie bag my friends let's see what we've got i feel a couple more items down here maybe it's just one item oh it's one item but it looks like there's four jars in here oh my goodness let's get this rubber band out of here let's get this unwrapped and what do we have oh my god we've got some concentrates my friends we gotta grab it at delta eight girl scout cookies we got some good old gelato cbg combo oh my goodness we've got 850 milligrams of key lime pie cbd crystals and last but not least 900 milligrams of shittles skittles i don't i'm not that's supposed to be pronounced but we got 900 milligrams of this cbg oh my god people i did not expect this this is amazing okay let's try to get this zoomed in a little bit more maybe maybe our lighting will get a little bit better here um one second my friends one second all right my friends now as you can see here we got a little bit of everything um obviously we already went over our hemp flower so let's move on to jar number one we've got that key lime pie hitter baby those cbd crystals um like i said they have a whole bunch of different products obviously we got the cbd crystals but cbd also comes in the tinctures isolate they have pet stuff topicals let's talk about this bad boy first real quick and let's look at these crystals oh my lanta baby we got some little diamond action going on this is very nice oh my goodness that smells so delicious 850 milligrams of that cbd baby key lime pie oh my goodness we even got a little cat coming over here to see what's going on banksy how you doing buddy we've been hearing you throughout the video it's about time you showed up to uh show your face and then there you go you got his butt and his tail he's camera shy my friends but okay moving along we have uh next on our little list here we have some delta eight now delta eight comes in either carts disposables tinctures or as you can see here we got a nice little gram of those girl scout cookie dabs baby now i'm not sure i don't think this is supposed to be crystal i wonder if this is more like some some shatter banksy my little bucko you want to see what we got here look at this girl scout cookies banksy it's your favorite oh banksy banksy get your whiskers out of here look at this buddy look at this no now these are some diamonds these are some diamonds banksy holy cow that smells so delicious all right banks you got to get your big old noggin out of here these are some diamonds baby those are some delicious smelling and looking diamonds holy cow banksy jesus louises all right let's take a break real quick and let's go over um delta h obviously most people know about what cbd is but not a lot of people know what delta 8 is so like cbd delta 8 is a cannabinoid similar to cbd or delta nine um delta eight is actually an analog of delta nine meaning uh it's very similar but there's some noticeable difference differences um the biggest one is the lower psychoactive potency delta 8 is supposed to be about half as potent as delta 9. i believe that's what makes it actually legal it's not supposed to really get you high but it does for some users produce like a euphoric effect euphoric effect sorry um but some of the very uh similar differences sorry some of the similarities between delta 8 and delta 9 is uh it will still stimulate your appetite stimulate sorry i cannot speak right now it will still stimulate your appetite reduce nausea and soothe your pain but the best part is it will not give you anxiety and there will be no paranoia so it's like the best of both worlds my friends gotta love it let's just take a look at these again i want to compare this we got the little diamonds oh my goodness those terps and then the crystals we'll leave these open banksy promise not to get your cat hair in here look at this this is some top notch high quality stuff here people we got the cbd crystals and the delta eight diamonds damn becky that stuff is beautiful holy cow the smell coming out of this these jars right now it is amazing okay moving along this is something new for me honestly i did not know too much about cbg before i started working with this company um but guess what my friends we are all in this together learning new things every day um obviously we've got 900 milligrams of the cbd crystals the skittles shittles whatever you want to call them um but guess what stop right there we're going to do a little education on cbg real quick first of all silver owl has cbg crystals and tinctures available and the big thing about cbg is it really works well with other cannabinoids most importantly cbd when the two are combined together it creates uh what people refer to as the entourage effect meaning it elevates the response of the endocannabinoid system and the effects of both both cannabinoids are much more noticeable when they're together so when they're all working together uh they're all you know helping each other increasing the potency the effects all that good stuff that's one of the main benefits of like full spectrum cbd is you're getting everything minus you know that delta nine so very nice stuff here but enough talking let's get back to this little jar over here and i'm dying to see this i'm sure you guys are too dying to smell it here we go my friends oh we got some powder powder dang oh my goodness people i wish there was like a smelloscope or something so you guys could just smell the smells coming out of these bad boys oh my goodness this is just too good to be true my friends all right now last but not least on our list here we have some gelato like i was just saying here is a nice little combo of some cbd cbg uh 450 milligrams of each excuse me and like i said they work better when they are paired together which is exactly why this is a little combo pack here let's just see what we got here my friends gelato oh we got some more we got some more oh we got some more goody goody goody goody goody this just leaves me speechless i feel like an idiot i don't even know what to say but oh my god this stuff looks so good jesus louises my friends let's compare the the two these are supposed to both just be isolate they look very similar but definitely still different holy cow people the quality of this stuff is amazing like i cannot believe this like we gotta get a close-up on all these my friends like just look at this we got our crystals oh my god we got some diamonds just look at that stuff just look at it oh we got the isolate this is some top notch stuff my friends gotta love it all right everybody you know what time it is this here is our final haul boy i am truly truly excited about this one today we've got a lot of great stuff and we even got a big surprise that i was not even aware about uh we'll get to that in just a second but as you can see here my friends we've got a little bit of everything uh starting off we've got our hemp flower babe as you can also see we're finally in a little bit better light so let's just open this up and see if we can get a better look at this let's look at some of these nugs here huh truly not bad looking at all if i could grab one of them you know this is some pretty good looking stuff not bad at all my friends um i forgot what the strain was called already but if we look over here it was called uh oh double owl i ripped it but yep it was called double owl got some nice hemp flour if i do recall correctly on their site they only have two strains available right now but you can buy anywhere from a quarter ounce all the way up to a pound so gotta love it my friends that's a lot of that's a lot of flour but okay moving along look at this we have four grams of concentrate here my friends they are all different um starting off with number one here we've got that key lime pie hitter those 850 milligrams cbd crystals let's just get another look at these bad boys huh super nice looking stuff very very very excited for this cannot wait to try that out um same with this the girl scout cookies baby that delta 8 hit hitter we got a whole gram of this and boy if i remember correctly there is just a huge diamond in here just a huge huge if i can get this open diamond look at that thing gotta love it baby oh my god in the smell coming out of this one jeez louise uh moving along we've got those cbg crystals and then this is definitely more of like isolate powder um still some really good looking stuff look at that baby mmm very nice very nice smell to it and like i said the cbg uh pairs very well with the cbd and that's exactly what we got right here my friends that gelato 450 milligrams of each in here and the smell coming out of this one too jesus just some bad mfn stuff very nice my friends very very nice definitely one of the better hauls i've gotten especially for cbd delta eight this is probably the best one i've gotten so far and now guess what my friends if you've been keeping score you're probably like wait there's a whole nother pack that we're missing out on where's the rest of that stuff guess what my friends here it is sponsored give away now um one thing i gotta say right away uh is this video has already been really long so for the giveaway i'm gonna be making another separate video for this um i had no idea this was even gonna be inside my box so i was not prepared for that but definitely expect this giveaway video to be coming out very very soon i cannot wait to open that up and see what's inside i'm guessing it's going to be probably the same stuff that you see here uh just in a nice little giveaway pack for one of you lucky lucky viewers i haven't figured out how i'm gonna host that giveaway yet i don't know if it'll be on the gleam io platform like i usually use or if it'll be a maybe like an instagram giveaway weed tube giveaway i'm not sure yet but definitely stay tuned this giveaway will be coming soon my friends don't you worry i'll do a whole whole new unboxing video for this showing you what's inside giving you details all that good stuff stay tuned for that but all right my friends i think that is about it for this video if you like all this cool stuff and you want to get some for yourself it's super easy all you have to do is head on over to silverowlcbd.com and place your order today um like i said if you want to save some money 50 to be exact use that code glitter hopefully it'll be right there um that code might change by the time this video comes out only if i get my own personal code by then but like i said i don't know what happened with the owner we were talking talking talking obviously he sent me all this great stuff and then communication just fell off so not sure what's going on there if i do get my own discount code it will be dill pickle that's what i requested so try that one if it doesn't work definitely use that code glitter i know for a fact that one works you'll save 50 and you'll be helping out uh to support a nice nice channel that's you know not mine but hey i don't mind helping out a friend all right my friends now if you've made it this far i truly appreciate you you guys are the best like i said i feel like this video was really long today but hopefully it was nice and informative hopefully you learned something like i did and uh hopefully you had a good time now if you had a good time be sure to hit that like button give me a thumbs up leave a comment let me know what you thought of all this stuff which one do you think is the best which one would you like to try you know let me know even just say hi to my

that notification bell you will stay tuned to all of our upcoming videos now until next time my friends like always thanks for watching thanks for your support and have a blaze day [Music] you", "vROtDqAtnC0": "this is Vincent corporation in Colorado I'm at say one of our customers that spot this from us as you can see over there it's running off a dive bottle instead of a air compressor and that actual actuates the cone in the pump creates pressure there's the screen that you're used to seeing now this press has a much longer hopper so this is the hopper right here and this is how they're feeding the press it actually works very well we weren't sure at first but they liked it they had it custom built because it's what they wanted and as you can see it'll just feed all that material down through there I'm something kind of interesting I haven't pointed out before our presses our CP 4 is run off a normal 110 volt wall socket so we've got an explosion-proof motor Vince the corporation CP for extended hopper press and we're about to run 60 pounds of material through it so you can see how it goes so here we are we have about 60 pounds of material they've already done a full watch on this so they these have gone into a vat of ethanol so they pulled out the majority of the free CBD off the surface area of the plant and they're gonna run that through this press so here we have the material it's sorry over you can smell the ethanol I can but if you tilt this Lahoma I'm trying to squeeze anything nothing is coming out so squeeze it as tight as I can get and it's wet but nothing is coming there we go so this is the post press cake so your your flower material as after it comes through we're gonna take out all the available ethanol and any extra CBD on there that we can find and then you're gonna get this through here and as you can see this is just dry plant material and this is what we're getting out of here yes it's going to be some chlorophyll there's gonna be some waxes in there but your downstream processing will be able to get all that out of there yeah they said that the slower you run it just give me another couple seconds you can turn it down well you're good yeah I'm good the slower you learn it the more torque you're gonna have  them what's this - donor then I'm running as soon as where you can track a column with all the same [Music] that's chromatography yeah talk to Tom I'd rather do something like that just settling in the trench huh yeah I do oh we did start getting there yeah what is that let me think a second for three five-gallon buckets full of cake material oh really this thing was full okay I thought that would be two five-gallon buckets okay here we are post screw press processing of the post CBD extraction hemp we've got four gallons of ethanol now that ethanol is gonna have waxes in it chlorophyll in it and it's also going to CBD oil in it once you find it and filter it you'll be able to get CBD oil out of that and this is your spent material we're basically seven gallons to there this is fall this is um seven gallons of cake it's just dry pulverized plant material and four gallons of this ethanol with chlorophyll waxes and CBD oil so with the fins would screw press these are the results you can expect um if your material is the same so this is to pressings they've let it sat out for the alcohol to come off and this is what the polarization that our press will do so it's a sponge that's what that is", "USp47BPZ5zQ": "hey guys this is Jimmy again I have talked about ahem extraction lines on the last episode I'm using the Prussian lines so we can make hemp biomass into coal oil in this episode I'm going to show you the biomass first and then showed you the step by step how to turn the crude oil into good and clear CBD oil so the biomass my current use from this is pretty good as we can see here they have done a good job on separating the biomass out of hemp fiber and hemp seeds all the material remaining in this pack are in high quality they contains a lot of a hemp flour and and leaf which has pretty high CBD contents especially don't want any hemp seeds in your bio mast the hemp seeds contain seed oil which has no CBD in it if you process a bag of biomass that has too much hemp seed in it then you and I was getting a CBD distillates that looks like clear and golden but has very low Sabri concentration in that case that punch that bottle of CBD oil will not be selling an very good price let's take a look at our distillation units so before talking about this relation line we have to talk about how to polish and how to get your CBD crew ready for this relations so right here we are using a rotary evaporator to decarbonize our C bleaker oil so in here we have about 10 litres in this round a flask that we got a foreign extraction line and in here as you can see the liquids beneath the crude oil are yellow so because we were using heat transfer fluids in it instead of a using water by using the heat transfer fluid we can heat up this units 235 degree Celsius which will remove a little bit of ethanol out of it and so decarbonize it nicely so here is our [Music] white film distillation units and our left is crystallizer so we can after we have disciplines we can transform the disciplines into CDP the isolates in in this units so this is not a usual reactor that you see we have a future on the bottom which is the white one yes you can see on the bottom so that one will be filtered out CPD isolates out of the matter liquids the matter its click liquids will be drink from the bottom and CBD isolates will be remain on the future as you can see here here's the drain so once your once you got your CBD isolates by lowing the chlorine temperature you can open a vow and drain the mother liquids out of it okay let's talk about how this were filmed this laser machine work so this machine will help us to transfer our crude oil into good and clear disciplines so we just finished the first runs of of coroico usually we run the crude oil through this machine to time so this is the feeding tank right here so this machine separates different components by using the boiling temperature differences for example your view your terpene and your CBD oil all have different type of boning temperatures also there is some sugar and there's some small particle in or crude oil as well and those things doesn't boil at all so those can be separated by using this machine as well so we just finished our first runs on the floor we have two buckets the buckets on the left is the polished crude oil the buckets on the right is the the terpenes and and also some crow fields so this machine's and everything they have a lot lower boiling temperature will we both will come out and falling into the right buckets all the things that have a higher temperature or four downs to the left pockets so in the first round we set the main body temperature the main distillation body temperature into a temperature that the terpenes and curfew will keep boiling well the CBD will not boil so we have we will also catch all some of the eighth notes in the system so in here we have two Co traps the left cold trap is negative thirty Seco trap the Reiko trap is negative 83 contract and as you can see that the negative eighty contra is we can filling the dry ice or liquid nitrogen in it to treat as well so here we have a vacuum gauge and we have a vacuum pump do stage where come from one floor the first one is turbo pump second one is the normal oil thing reckon pump so the color in the right pocket is look pretty greenish and the viscosity is very high which tells us that there is the terpene for sure and we're going to dump the left pocket back to the fitting tank and do a second runs so in the second runs the we're setting the temperature so that CBD will keep boiling well the others are not well others I mean the particles and the waste will not be boiling so we can collect CBD of the machines so right now we are running this machine further where we're running the crude oil for the second times so because you can see we are feeding the crude oil in its so the mercy is is keep running and we have the the waste coming out of from the left tube and which dripping into the buckets then this halfs and on the right we have dissidents so as we can see in temperature it's not I mean the color for the distillate is not so good because it we just start running the machine we haven't we haven't fine-tuned the machine yet so I'm going to do some fine-tuning to make sure that the color looks much much better after a few changes in temperature setting for this y film distillation units the CBD colors looks looks much much better than previously I just changed temperature setting on the the center coil for this units and also a little bit of vacuum as well make it look much better this units can output about 5 liters of distillate Spri hour and I can improve it a little bit more just changed heating heaters and Childress for this unit to upgrade it into a higher capacity so that this unit can run under be faster even he can even run about a liters per hour if you have the right heaters so that would be all the information now like a share today so we talked about distillation we talked about crystallization and my client is pretty happy about what he got today and here we have the CBD distillates that we have around today this civilities looks looks in a high viscosity but because it is hot after is cooled down to room temperature it should be close to solids so if you liked this video please give us a thumbs up and think about our subscription thank you very much have a good day bye bye", "AaPdMKVVvMw": "hi I'm JD I'm the lead co2 extraction technician extract labs here in Boulder Colorado under certain pressures and temperatures co2 acts as a solvent so we take co2 and dense it down into a liquid it gets pumped through an extraction vessel where the material is kept the co2 holds the essential oils off of the plant material flows into a separation vessel this is where the co2 will turn back into a gas and the essential oil falls to the bottom of the collection vessel the gaseous co2 is then reconvince and pumped back through the system co2 is the best way to extract essential oils because it is more safe cleaner for the environment and is less harsh than some of your hydrocarbon or ethanol solvents co2 is very tunable meaning we can just strip the essential oils off without dissolving the chlorophyll and fats and waxes to come with our department and ethanol extractions on an average week we can process anywhere from two to five hundred pounds of plant material usually on average runs take from anywhere from six to nine hours based on plant material quality the grind and so on what attracted me to him extraction basically the love of the plant I love the whole chemical compound behind it I love doing extractions I've been doing it for a very long time and I just love DVDs and camp in general [Music]", "mPwBQcdKTcw": "okay I want to talk you through a step-by-step process of using ethanol and a Vincent screw press to extract CBD oil so you're going to start with fresh biomass so this is fresh hemp that's been dried it's probably 10% CBD you're gonna run add ethanol probably 33 gallons every hundred pounds and you're gonna run that through our screw press after the screw press you've got two things you've got the cake the spent biomass this is depleted of all the oils and everything else you can be left with the press liquor which has waxes in the bottom so there's that once you go through winterization you're gonna have your your pressed liquor here that's a bit cleaner then you need to reclaim to go through an ethanol reclamation process maybe rotovap or something and this is what you're gonna be left with raw crude this is raw CBD crude oil it's really thick you know this just doesn't move around this right here is probably 50% of that's going to be CBD distillate so you're looking at probably about two and a half kilos of distillate there so today's prices looking at about $23,000 sitting there so in a very fairly effective simplistic conventional and cost-effective process you can take your hemp to crude with the Vincent screw press you okay this is a darker one yeah you know we have them lighter you can see the color of that yeah yeah some viscous this is a 65% interesting here this one some of it so 65 percent by volume are CBDs yeah yeah so that's the oil so you can see so you can tell that it's it's fully d waxed because it's viscous yeah that's right it's beef with so this is the the quality you know the consistency which is really good and really high in terpenes this oil here okay you", "DI9-QYSWuhI": "Hello everyone, Nick Tennant here. I'm very\u00a0\nproud today to present you another Precision\u00a0\u00a0 product - our new CRC color remediation and\u00a0\nchromatography column. It does a lot of different\u00a0\u00a0 features, like variable media, and I want to show\u00a0\nyou some of the key aspects of how we designed\u00a0\u00a0 this particular piece of equipment. So the first\u00a0\nthing that you're going to notice is you've got\u00a0\u00a0 two very big columns in the back here and that's\u00a0\nbecause these are surge tanks. You need to surge\u00a0\u00a0 your solvent off of your material in a very quick,\u00a0\nrapid manner. We don't want to leave our solvent\u00a0\u00a0 soaking on our material for a long period of time,\u00a0\ntypically with a hydrocarbon that can be as short\u00a0\u00a0 as three to seven minutes, and what we need to\u00a0\ndo is get that solvent off of that material so it\u00a0\u00a0 doesn't pick up undesirables. So what we do with\u00a0\nthis column is we put this on the back end of for\u00a0\u00a0 example a hydrocarbon system and we're surging\u00a0\nthat solvent off into the surge tanks - and\u00a0\u00a0 that's exactly what they do. Everything on this\u00a0\napparatus is obviously jacketed, everything\u00a0\u00a0 can be controlled, everything can be metered,\u00a0\nand you see that with the variety of features\u00a0\u00a0 here - but that's one of the first features\u00a0\nthat really is setting apart this particular\u00a0\u00a0 chromatography and color remediation column from\u00a0\nanybody else. So once you surge your solvent\u00a0\u00a0 into these surge tanks, what you're going to do\u00a0\nis you're slowly going to feed it out and you're\u00a0\u00a0 going to do it at a metered rate. That's going to\u00a0\ncome out and it's going to come up through here\u00a0\u00a0 and be fed into your actual chromatography column.\u00a0\nNow this is where you're going to hold your media,\u00a0\u00a0 this unit can hold a variety of different\u00a0\nmedia. And anybody that's ever worked with\u00a0\u00a0 chromatography or has ever worked with any\u00a0\nsort of remediation you know that it's almost\u00a0\u00a0 infinite what you can put in this column in terms\u00a0\nof blends and different medias. And we're going to\u00a0\u00a0 look at some of those later in the video and\u00a0\nI'll explain some of the science behind why\u00a0\u00a0 it works the way it does. But the important part\u00a0\nis you have a nice large volume of media that you\u00a0\u00a0 can put in here, more than adequate for your\u00a0\nsurge tank, you can meter, you can control the\u00a0\u00a0 pressure. This whole unit is rated up to 350 PSI.\u00a0\nSo if you want to experiment with temperatures,\u00a0\u00a0 if you want to experiment with resonance times\u00a0\nthrough your media, if you want to experiment\u00a0\u00a0 with higher pressures or back charging nitrogen\u00a0\n(the units equipped to back charge nitrogen),\u00a0\u00a0 you get that higher pressure that higher\u00a0\npenetration into the media. This unit can\u00a0\u00a0 do all that. Obviously when you look overall at\u00a0\nthe craftsmanship, something we're very proud of\u00a0\u00a0 obviously, you've got the the stand that's been\u00a0\nbeautifully powder coated. You've got everything\u00a0\u00a0 made out of beautiful American stainless\u00a0\nsteel. The unit you can see it has all the\u00a0\u00a0 junctions and fittings are either compression or\u00a0\nthey are sanitary clamp, tri-clamp they call that,\u00a0\u00a0 and all the valves everything is rated as\u00a0\ncleanable - which makes it GMP-ready. Which is\u00a0\u00a0 fantastic for anybody that's in the hemp market,\u00a0\nanybody that's looking towards cGMP compliance,\u00a0\u00a0 anybody that wants a traceable product and all the\u00a0\npaperwork, operating manuals obviously, are all up\u00a0\u00a0 to GMP standards - in terms of the IQ, the OQ, the\u00a0\nmaterial certifications, so that's outstanding.\u00a0\u00a0 Some of the other key features of this unit, you\u00a0\nknow you you can see obviously here the quick\u00a0\u00a0 releases makes it easy to take off your columns,\u00a0\neasy to disassemble, easy to make adjustments,\u00a0\u00a0 easy to clean. Everything is hard piped that\u00a0\nobviously eliminates any issues of contamination,\u00a0\u00a0 it eliminates any issues of the flexible\u00a0\nhosing getting in the way, any issues of\u00a0\u00a0 exterior contamination from any sort of medias,\u00a0\nor any sort of dust or anything in the lab.\u00a0\u00a0 So ultimately you know when you're looking at this\u00a0\nunit it's a ready turn-key GMP ultra-clean unit\u00a0\u00a0 that can refine these contaminants out of your\u00a0\nextract. So let's talk about the science behind\u00a0\u00a0 why this unit works, why it's relevant, and\u00a0\nwhat we're really trying to accomplish with it.\u00a0\u00a0 So when we extract from a cannabis or hemp\u00a0\nplant we're trying to pull out the cannabinoids,\u00a0\u00a0 the terpenoids, or the terpenes, and we want\u00a0\nto extract those in the most purified fashion\u00a0\u00a0 possible. But what happens is sometimes we\u00a0\nget contamination, sometimes we get mold,\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes we get mildew, sometimes we get\u00a0\npesticides, sometimes we get heavy metals,\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes it's just degraded biomass that's\u00a0\nbeen oxidized that we want to remove things\u00a0\u00a0 like Pheophytin and things that are providing\u00a0\ndiscoloration or contributing to discoloration\u00a0\u00a0 or a low quality product. And the way that we\u00a0\ndo that is we do it through selective medias.\u00a0\u00a0 So there's a variety of different medias you can\u00a0\nuse and the universe is like infinite in terms of\u00a0\u00a0 the media's you can use. Some of these medias\u00a0\nthat you may be familiar with, or maybe not,\u00a0\u00a0 they could be things like chinit, could be\u00a0\ndiatomaceous earth, they can be different types of\u00a0\u00a0 sands, different types of silicas, different types\u00a0\nof carbons, they can be blends of any of those.\u00a0\u00a0 They can be different types of preparations of any\u00a0\nof those different densities, different pressures.\u00a0\u00a0 So all of these things kind of come together to\u00a0\ncreate this wide, wide variety of different media\u00a0\u00a0 that you can put into this apparatus to achieve\u00a0\na desired outcome. So maybe I'm somebody that\u00a0\u00a0 is in California and my neighbor sprayed a\u00a0\npesticide that's coming over into my field\u00a0\u00a0 and now my crop is contaminated. Well\u00a0\nwhen you extract that, obviously this\u00a0\u00a0 myclobutanil, or whatever it is, it could be avid,\u00a0\nit could be any of these pesticides - it's coming\u00a0\u00a0 with that extraction. Ultimately, it needs to be\u00a0\nremoved by a device like this. So what we've done\u00a0\u00a0 at Precision is really spend a lot of time in\u00a0\nR&D developing our tech behind this. Developing\u00a0\u00a0 uses of the media that can go in this,\u00a0\nso we've got a great SOP for pesticides,\u00a0\u00a0 we've got a great SOP for color remediation,\u00a0\nwe've got a great SOP for heavy metals,\u00a0\u00a0 and we continue to expand this knowledge in this\u00a0\ndatabase so clients that purchased this product\u00a0\u00a0 were able to get them these new proprietary medias\u00a0\nand proprietary media blends along with the SOP\u00a0\u00a0 to achieve these desired results. Which\u00a0\nis outstanding. It provides a very,\u00a0\u00a0 very streamlined way for our clients to create a\u00a0\nvery desirable end product from almost any kind of\u00a0\u00a0 biomass under the sun, which is outstanding.\u00a0\nSo let's take a look at some of the medias\u00a0\u00a0 generally, so you get an idea of what they look\u00a0\nlike, what we use, how we think about them.\u00a0\u00a0 I'll give you a close-up of some of this stuff,\u00a0\nso let's take a look at some of these medias and\u00a0\u00a0 have a little explanation around them so you\u00a0\nhave a better understanding of really what\u00a0\u00a0 we're doing from a scientific level here.\u00a0\nSo obviously one of the most ubiquitous,\u00a0\u00a0 generally-used adsorbents is activated carbon, and\u00a0\nyou can really just see it's just black. It's like\u00a0\u00a0 a black powdery substance, and the surface\u00a0\narea of what's in this right here - this is\u00a0\u00a0 about 100 milliliters. This is probably about 25\u00a0\nfootball fields of surface area and it's because\u00a0\u00a0 the activated carbon has a very porous surface\u00a0\nright, so you have all these different molecules\u00a0\u00a0 that can be trapped in there all these different\u00a0\nconstituents of that miscella that can be trapped\u00a0\u00a0 in here. And really what happens is all these\u00a0\ndifferent medias that we're going to show you\u00a0\u00a0 have different pore sizes, they have different\u00a0\naffinities for different molecules, and that's\u00a0\u00a0 ultimately the science behind it. So this may\u00a0\ntake out something really, really, really good,\u00a0\u00a0 this may take out something really, really,\u00a0\nreally, good - but they won't do the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0 So let's look at some of these medias even up\u00a0\nclose. So here we have a different type of media\u00a0\u00a0 and this is one of our proprietary blends. This\u00a0\nis a mix of coral sands with some other things\u00a0\u00a0 that are impregnated into it that I can't talk\u00a0\nabout on camera, but this does a really, really,\u00a0\u00a0 amazing job. I'm going to show you some samples\u00a0\nof what we were able to remediate color wise\u00a0\u00a0 and still get a very, very stable cannabinoid\u00a0\nprofile and terpenoid profile. But if we look\u00a0\u00a0 at this - almost looks like sand on the beach and\u00a0\nit effectively kind of is - right? I mean that's\u00a0\u00a0 coral sand to some degree.\u00a0\nSo actually what this is,\u00a0\u00a0 is coral reefs that have washed ashore and\u00a0\nthey've degraded over thousands and thousands\u00a0\u00a0 of years and those coral reefs have a capacity\u00a0\nto adsorb certain components and they may absorb\u00a0\u00a0 certain things out of our miscella that is\u00a0\nundesirable. For example pesticides, for example\u00a0\u00a0 color, things like heavy metals - all these\u00a0\ndifferent things that we want to remove\u00a0\u00a0 we just have to find the right lock and key.\u00a0\nAnd when we talk about extraction, and you've\u00a0\u00a0 watched some of my other videos, we talked about\u00a0\nthe lock and key methodology or the lock and key\u00a0\u00a0 sort of way of thinking about how to isolate\u00a0\nthese molecules, and that's exactly what we're\u00a0\u00a0 doing with these medias. We're just doing it after\u00a0\nextraction. So lock and key with the solvent is to\u00a0\u00a0 get it out of the plant, now how do we get the\u00a0\ndesired molecules from the oil to a purified\u00a0\u00a0 fashion without any adulterants. So I'll show\u00a0\nyou another media here. So this one is actually\u00a0\u00a0 chitin, or some types of the impregnated versions\u00a0\nare called chitosan, and what this is is actually\u00a0\u00a0 from crustaceans. This is from shrimp shells,\u00a0\nlobster shells, crab shells. This is actually\u00a0\u00a0 crushed crab shell and they actually impregnate\u00a0\nit with some other things. Sometimes you'll find\u00a0\u00a0 impregnated medias that are impregnated\u00a0\nwith silica or activated carbon,\u00a0\u00a0 or things like that right. So all these medias,\u00a0\nthey're all throughout the earth they can blend\u00a0\u00a0 something like this with diatomaceous earth,\u00a0\nyou blend it with activated carbon, you can do\u00a0\u00a0 different ratios, you can do impregnations.\u00a0\nAll sorts of different combinations,\u00a0\u00a0 and ultimately you just have to find that right\u00a0\nlock and that right click, that right key,\u00a0\u00a0 and that's what we spent a tremendous amount of\u00a0\ntime doing here so that our clients don't have to.\u00a0\u00a0 We give that magic formulation, that magic recipe,\u00a0\nwe put it in this machine and out comes an amazing\u00a0\u00a0 result. So let's have a look at some of the\u00a0\nresults that we're seeing and showing to our\u00a0\u00a0 clients with these types of technologies. That's\u00a0\na room temperature extraction. Very, very green.\u00a0\u00a0 And we did this intentionally to really take\u00a0\na lot of that chlorophyll out of the cannabis,\u00a0\u00a0 but this was done with just aqueous ethanol and\u00a0\nreally you understand a lot of that chlorophyll\u00a0\u00a0 is coming over. You can some of the stuff\u00a0\nis actually settled at the bottom there. But\u00a0\u00a0 really, really dark color. After using a one stage\u00a0\non one of the medias here, you can see the fallout\u00a0\u00a0 and the combination. It's starting to lighten up\u00a0\nthat color, and you can see kind of in the bottom\u00a0\u00a0 of this where that media has selectively bound to\u00a0\nthose constituents in there that are undesirable,\u00a0\u00a0 that are creating that dark color, and we've\u00a0\ngot a somewhat purified sample. And then when\u00a0\u00a0 we move to a second stage or a second formulation\u00a0\npass - that's what we have. And you've got your\u00a0\u00a0 cannabinoids and your terpenes still retained\u00a0\nin there, but you have I mean you've got a water\u00a0\u00a0 clear extract - so that's fantastic. I really love\u00a0\nyou know the science behind this and and it goes\u00a0\u00a0 pretty deep and pretty wide. You know we're just\u00a0\ntalking about sort of organic medias when we talk\u00a0\u00a0 about some of the things that I mentioned, but it\u00a0\ngoes even deeper than that because you can have\u00a0\u00a0 synthetically or man-made medias. Things like\u00a0\nion anion exchange resins where we're actually\u00a0\u00a0 grabbing these molecules out of there through a\u00a0\ncharge that's just kind of - it's going to suck\u00a0\u00a0 it in. And this is where you can start purifying\u00a0\ncannabinoids and purifying individual molecules.\u00a0\u00a0 Whether you're trying to remove something\u00a0\nor you're trying to isolate something,\u00a0\u00a0 these are all things that can be done. So the\u00a0\nimportant part is that you have a very robust,\u00a0\u00a0 very clean, very universal platform that's\u00a0\ncompliant - that you know is going to be\u00a0\u00a0 around for a long time. Obviously, you can see\u00a0\nthe the quality of construction with our units\u00a0\u00a0 is like everything else that we do - it's the\u00a0\nbest in the industry. So I really appreciate\u00a0\u00a0 you taking the time to watch the video. I think\u00a0\nit was a great time well spent for everyone and\u00a0\u00a0 appreciate your support. Give us a call if\u00a0\nyou have any questions, we're here to help.", "-8kPucbOdT8": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're at our partnered manufacturing facility outside of Dayton Ohio looking at our all new line of KPD series of industrial extractors [Music] precision first conceptualized the KPD series of extractors about two years ago when we saw the shift towards a large scale processing both in cannabis and hemp what we did at the time is we searched for the best most well qualified manufacturing partner that we could build an industrial scale modular extraction platform with we found AMG engineering in Dayton Ohio and they've been a pleasure to work with ever since we've combined our expertise in the cannabis and hemp manufacturing arena with their expertise in the AG reprocessing and Industrial Engineering competency and what that's allowed us to do is build a massive but easy to use modular processing center that can be dropped on the farm can be dropped into a building and it's very easy turnkey ready to operate so a lot of people ask why build a modular self-contained industrial extraction skid and the reasons are numerous the first one is that this whole apparatus that you see here takes four people to operate the second thing is it's extremely simple right it's plug-and-play you drop it and you can drop it onto a slab in a farm you can drop it into an industrial processing building or any number of easy turnkey solutions the flip side of this is people typically have unreasonable expectations when it comes to batch processing batch processing is extremely laborious and if you think about having seven or eight or nine extractors to be able to equal the throughput that something like this does you're talking about running those batch extractors 24 hours a day you're talking about having three shifts of people and you may well employ 40 50 60 employees in order to do the same work that four employees could do with a plant such as this so it's really oughta mating the process its streamlining your efficiencies and it's allowing you to operate a business with an extremely low overhead and as we all know that the price of commodities of THC and CBD eventually are declining it's very important to be able to operate your business with very low operational overhead costs to be able to make margin continually as these large players come in and put competitive pressures on the market so we've designed all this in mind when you look at the design of this extraction plant not only does it have the modularity but we'll talk about some of the efficiencies that this plant does as you can see behind me one of the components we have reflux stills so that your reap roofing your ethanol so you're not having ethanol loss we have a number of different high efficiency methods to take the ethanol back out of the biomass and any a number of these small problems that you run into a batch processing all these losses add up and we've designed this with our processing expertise and AMG's industrial manufacturing expertise to be the most efficient most effective way to extract and that's what you see here today [Applause] so now that you understand a bit about the concept of the KPD series of extractors why we built it how we built it how we conceptualized it let's take a look at some of the more technical components on how it operates and why it's so efficient so the first thing that we're gonna look at is our contacts motor control center and basically what this is it's the brain of the entire operation so what's gonna happen is this skid will be placed on a slab somewhere in a warehouse but your motor control center and your plant control center will be separate the reason that that's designed like that is to keep all the components that could come in contact with any solvent that are flammable it keeps the the risk level down basically so that those flammable vapors aren't coming in contact with any of your motor controls so let's take a look inside the control center so inside what you're going to see is you're going to see all your variable frequency drives you're gonna see all of your motor controls and ultimately this is all linked through one interface right so it's all computer-controlled everything on this entire plant you can see all your temperatures all your motor speeds all your input your output your discharge every single function within that plant is controlled from this brain so you can see on your wall all of your shut offs all of your VFDs all of your control panels all of your power input everything is controlled from this room so remembering our HMI interface and our computer brain interface from our con X you also have a display and a touch screen interface on the actual plant so not only can your controllers see what's going on from your control room your operators can see what's going on in the plant from your HMI interface on your actual machine so the process all starts here and basically what this is is you're gonna have your conveyor feeding in your biomass and this is the first step of the process this is a cooling screw conveyor so what will happen is you take your warm biomass and you cool down your biomass in order for when it hits the solvent it's not warming up the solvent obviously you're putting a massive amount of biomass into this extraction plant you're putting a massive amount of solvent so you can understand that the heat energy if the biomass is not properly cooled is going to raise the temperature of the solvent and therefore that affect the extraction efficiency and the extraction quality so what we do is passing it through here this is jacketed and it's controlled to about negative 40 degrees centigrade in order to cool the biomass and take some of that heat energy away to have a nice efficient consistent extraction so the next step in the process once the biomass is cooled you can see that it drops into this first extraction tank and basically what this is is a counter current ethanol extraction so you've got ethanol coming in from one side you've got your biomass coming in from the other if you have a set retention time they mix the solvent strips that cannabinoids from the plant and ultimately you have your micelle a stream coming out so biomass into your first tank solvent into your third tank and through the entire process they mix through the tanks until they're ultimately separated you will have your cannabinoids and solvent go to one area and you'll have your biomass go to another area so let's follow the stream of the cannabinoids through to the next step once your extraction process is started you're gonna have your micellar stream which we call my salad your cannabinoid and solvent mixture in your micelle a holding tank right here this folding tank is constantly going to be processed through your finds filtration which is going to take out most of your fine particulates that might clog your evaporator any residual waxes and we actually do that with not only the Candela filters and the michela but we use a pre-code as well so this precoat tank will have any number of three coats it could be diatomaceous earth it could be any number of absorbance or things like that that will actually pre coat your filtration and allow for a more pure more efficient extraction so let's take a look at how this all works you have your micellar coming here you have your pre coat tank coming here both of these streams are mixed and they're pushed upwards into our filtration mechanisms which are up here so let's have a look at those so once that micelle a stream is coming up here it's being pushed into our filters and these are three candle filters that basically are filtered with precoat coating the filter membrane and then we have our micellar coming right behind that and basically that's creating a filtration mechanism that's taking out all those impurities highly refining your masala stream ultimately your filters will become caked when they become caked after a number of hours could be a day could be three days could be you know 12 hours it really depends on the consistency of your biomass and how you're extracting what you're going to do is do a blowdown on your filters so these filters are extremely easy to clean as you can see the graded bottoms what you're gonna do is we're just gonna take a bucket or some sort of a bag discharge bag you're gonna wrap it around here and you're gonna do a blowdown to blow down the filter and all your discharge cake is gonna come out again same thing you have redundancy so if you're discharging one filter that the other filter is still in use so that you're never losing your continuous process so that takes us through our filtration step what we're gonna do once we have that micellar filtered and we have it clean we're gonna move on to evaporation and evaporation is the process of actually separating that solvent from the original cannabinoids that we have so it's no longer going to be a micelle a stream at this point we're gonna have crude oil and we're going to have solvent so the next step in our process is evaporation and as we stated evaporation is taking that micellar stream of your cannabinoids and your solvent and separating it so we're gonna take our micelle and separate it into two streams ones are going to become crude oil one's going to become our purified ethanol and that's done with this section of the plant right here what you're seeing is you're seeing two giant distillation towers so you can see they started all the way up here and they go all the way down to the second floor beneath my feet about 20 feet tall and what that's actually doing is applying heat to the solvent in order for the solvent to vaporize once the solvents vaporizing it's coming it's separating from the heavier cannabinoid mixture and as the solvent vaporizes it reconned ences on a separate condenser column behind me which creates a liquefied solvent that's been purified and that leaves us with our micelle a stream that's been purified into the purified solvent of course and then our purified cannabinoids which we refer to as crude oil so let's take a look at the next step in the process which is one that's very crucial and often overlooked so once we have our solvent purified from our micellar stream it's very very important that we do a reflux distillation on that solvent and here's the reason why ethanol is what's called a homogeneous azeotrope with water as you know we're extracting a plant there's a lot of water in the plant when it comes out of the field we dry most of that water out through our drying process but you may have anywhere between 2 to 10 percent water and your residual biomass now what's gonna happen because ethanol is a homogenious azeotrope with water those two molecules are just going to want to stay right together the boiling points are so close that they can't be separated with the traditional evaporation why this is relevant is because over time your solvent becomes diluted and becomes less effective at extracting your cannabinoids so you can imagine that you start with 190-proof pure solvent and over time it's going to be diluted with water once you hit around 170 proof or a little bit lower than that your extraction efficiency becomes greatly compromised which is the reason that we have reflux stills so reflux stills are a different type of evaporation they're used with a very tall tower without with a packing material in them and what that does is it allows that very close boiling point to separate from the water and the solvent so we've integrated this into our plant so it's a turnkey system solvent never needs to be replaced in this plant because the efficiency is so high in terms of not only the reclaim rate from your biomass and your evaporation but also the reap roofing of the solvent it's a completely closed system which makes it extremely efficient and extremely easy to before when we were talking about operating your business on really good margins and maintaining efficiency and how you operate your extraction process this is one of the central key components to do that for for your ROI for your business now that we've walked through the evaporation process and the purification of the solvent we need to follow our crude oil through the other output stream so what happens with the crude oil once it comes out of our evaporator as it moves into these holding tanks and basically what these holding tanks are doing is holding the oil and heating it to perform the decarboxylation process D carb is a very very common process that's used in preparation of your crude oil for not only consumption but for final distillation that's what these tanks do right here and ultimately these tanks can be routed and pumped to a distillation machine or any types of popes post-processing that you would like to use so now that we've followed our micellar stream through the entire plant through refinement all the way to D carb and through re proofing of the solvent the other side of the aspect of the processing of this plant is the actual biomass that's coming out so we have a lot of spent biomass that's coming out of this plant and once it comes out of those extraction tanks that we looked at earlier it's ultimately pumped as a slurry up into these separators so we have these rotary strainer separators and basically what they do is they separate that pulpy sludge of biomass it's the first pass that takes the solvent off and what that's doing is it's taking kind of that like I said pulpy sort of really wet biomass and separating the ethanol from it in order for the biomass to then drop into a heated mechanism which is where you're going to regain the remainder of your solvent out of the biomass so let's take a look at that next the last and one of the most crucial processes in our plant is the reclamation of the final solvent from that biomass so as we saw before we separated the majority of the solvent from the biomass using our strainers but it's still think about you know wringing out a sponge you get most of the of the of the moisture out of the sponge by using that pressure but in order to get the remainder of the moisture out of the sponge or in this case our biomass acting like a sponge we need to heat it and that's precisely what this heated screw does here so you can see it's quite lengthy there's a lot of heat energy that goes into that but the flip side is we're taking a typical 94 93 95 percent efficiency and we're taking that efficiency up above 99 percent in terms of reclamation of your solvent now the reason that's important is because obviously we're on industrial scale here we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds of processing per day you can imagine there's quite a bit of solvent that's being used there so when you're losing 5% of that massive amount of solvent you can imagine what the cost is last we checked Evan all's you know 32 dollars a gallon for for azeotropic ethanol around seven dollars a litre depending on your region if you're losing 5% of everything you're processing with which is the case with typical plants typical batch installations batch installations could be even higher than that you can imagine how that's going to affect your effects and how that's going to affect your ROI especially as you have margin compression on your commodity one of the reasons that we designed this in is exactly that so you may have been wondering what are these giant for tanks on the end of this skid and it's very important because these are our CIP tanks CIP stands for clean in place clean in place is a protocol that's used throughout manufacturing throughout GMP throughout any type of protocol that requires food grade or pharma grade compliance now these CIP tanks are meant to hold an acid wash a base wash and then you have a reuse tank so basically what we're doing is we're imagining any sort of contamination that can get into this system based upon what that contamination is you may need an acid rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you may need a base rinse in order to dissolve that contamination you made into ethanol rinse in order to dissolve that contamination which is basically what we have in this entire plant so again through the HMI interface through the control center you have a completely automated CIP process in order to clean this plant the reason that that's extremely relevant is has more regulations and more restrictions come into the cannabis and hemp space you're going to be subject to testing for pesticides for mold for mildews and you can imagine that if any of that stuff's on your biomass and gets into your plant that you're automatically going to potentially contaminate your plant with a contamination source from the field one of the prime examples that we could use is micro butanol in California it's virtually everywhere and in order to remediate micro butanol audit your processing equipment there's a variety of processes that are needed to do that right now in batch equipment everybody does that manual and it's very laborious and time-consuming but as GMP restrictions and regulations come into play you're going to need to have a set standardized process that can be replicated and duplicated in order to be accurate every single time that's exactly what this CI piece kit does and that's exactly what our control center an automation skid does thanks for watching our overview on our KP d series of industrial extraction plants these plants can be engineered to process anywhere from ten thousand pounds a day up to several hundred thousand over a million if that's what you want our engineering partners as well as ourselves with our engineering expertise and our product expertise know every step of the process we know how to make it the most efficient and that's exactly what we've done here and what we've seen today we look forward to working with you and please give us a call if you have any questions you", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope

for one of the cannabinoids in the cannabis plant honestly as far as medicinal value all of the cannabinoids are medicinal but the association of THC is generally the fact that people use it to get high CBD does not get you high yet is known to relax you nine times out of ten the people that are using CBD really lead CBD medically elite focuses on CBD we do everything from breeding the seeds all the way to the extraction and purification process our products go through the gambit really from things that you could combust to skincare products I personally have been a cultivator since 1996 and so I've had a lifelong passion for the plant guy came from an IT security background ended up running one of the world's largest team of computer hackers and during that time I was still cultivating cannabis but the real birth of the company to where everybody quit their jobs and said this is what we're gonna do professionally was when Colorado legalized in 2014 our laboratory space is approximately 2,000 square feet it's in a former cleanroom environment all right so we start with stripped plant material and then we load that material into a column that crude extraction comes out as an oleoresin it goes from that into a alcohol bath and that basically precipitates all of the waxes fats lipids out of the solution and then we have to remove the alcohol from the oil in a rotary evaporator you're using controlled heat lots of vacuum and a condenser once it is through that process we fractionally distill the oil which removes impurities through a boiling point process and essentially the purified substance crashes out of solution it took us about 50 pounds of raw material to get to this one kilo of purified isolated it's basically organic chemistry 101 you're dealing with rotary evaporators you're dealing with Buechner funnels and vacuum assisted filtrations you're dealing with fractional distillation stills so yeah the labs pretty advanced especially for a cannabis industry the benefits of CBD are still being discovered on a daily basis you know generally speaking it's an anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic it's a neuro protectant people are using it for everything from breast cancer to epilepsy to aching joints and stress relief so we've seen CBD change people's perception of what cannabis is on a significant level I mean barring any unforeseen federal intervention I see the future of CBD as largely limitless right I don't even think CBD necessarily belongs in a dispensary environment I think the future of CBD is in everybody's home food and or medicine cabinets it'll become more and more commonplace as people realize what it is and what it can do for you [Music]", "jbn9-JQgw28": "[Music] what we have here is a sample of what we would get out of a supercritical run pressures of about 1,800 psi you can tell the consistency is a little syrupy kind of thick so harden up a little bit if you've got it in a fridge but what we're going to do now is go through the process of taking the plant waxes and fats out of this and come up with a sample that looks like this and this sample is good enough to pull up into a syringe and load it up into a vape pen we'll start the process here we'll go through the steps and see what it takes so first what I've got here I'm warming up some alcohol this is 200 proof pure alcohol we find it's a little easier to mix these two together when the alcohol is warm got a hot plate you can put it on a hot plate and use that as well just for convenience I have this sitting here so this is what we did I'm dry off the bottom we're going to take this over to the scale we're going to weigh it with this sample and what I found is about a ten to one ratio is what's been working well you know ratios you could use but ten to one seems to work really well for us so what I've got here is about 800 milliliters so that means I'd use about 80 grams of extract here so we'll stare that out zero the scale and we will dump in about 80 grams of this all right close enough and now what you want to do is make sure that you've got this sample stirred together as well as you can there's methods for doing this as well just for our sake right now I'm just going to stir it up it's the same stick here that I've put it in with but you want to get a blend here you want to get this whole thing blend together so you don't see a mix here at all they self they actually sell plates you can stick this on that will warm this up with stir sticks on them as well so that you can sit there and have it automated and stirring a product for you but you definitely want to get a good mix on that so you don't have any any clumps or anything like that I can see clumps on the bottom so make sure you get all that off mix all that together as well as you can okay well after we've gone through that process what we're ready to do is I like to throw a glove over the top of that just to keep any contaminants or anything from getting into that and at that point we're ready to put that into the freezer take a look at the sample that we've had in the freezer now we recommend 24 to 48 hours is a good time for for the separation to happen so let's check the freezer its head to the funnel we've got the funnel in the freezer as well the main reason we do that we don't want to shock the sample with heat or with a vast difference in heat so if we freeze the funnel we get that closer to the temperature we're able to preserve some of the oils that might otherwise get damaged with heat let's grab the funnel and the filter now with this process you're going to need a little rubber stopper here that actually just is like a spacer between here and here which creates a seal because we want to hook up a vacuum line into a vacuum pump I'm going to have that in there with a good tight seal and then I'm going to lay my filter in all right back to that and we've got a little spray nozzle this is a spray nozzle alcohol I will take this and I'll pre soaked this filter just to make sure we get a good seal with the bottom of the funnel you see the bottom of the funnel has holes in it and when we turn on the back you're going to see that suck that paper right down to the bottom of that funnel and that's what we want that way we keep the edges filled so we don't get any of that oil to go past or 100 needs of our filter and back down into our sample once we have our sample ready and we're pre soaked here we've got a seal just start slowly slide that to the top of the filter and you'll start to see it come through first they're poor in the church with his blow pressure then they're taking that out and putting that in the oven and be carving it bring that back in the system is running it at higher pressures you can get everything else flood and then reintroducing it sir boil to the other one so that's for the guys who are hardcore enthusiasts you want the cannabis Terps reintroduce back into you can see what's happening here see the difference here yeah got some liquid here on this side saying salad but here I mean look at all that guys save this and it'll still have a small trace amount of THC in it and they'll take you to make that into lotions or so it's gonna end of my sliced ice cream right looks like though they don't seem what's good left until it's light job scope and with this process and actually refrozen of sample this is you can do this and they save up to three times probably I saw that on your video yeah like two or three times yeah if you wanted to get it receive a lot of very small a lot of times via satellite that rolled and I ran through this yesterday the same process I took this yesterday and I want to see what's going like that it came out real nice and clear see the floating same man so even when it came out real clear looked fantastic and I thought you know there can't be anything left in there sucking in freezer again overnight and there still is so it's really funny I feel like if I ran through that process one more time to go shut down pull the back in and there you can see don't come any to check always what okay so that's what we've separated there with that process okay from there we are going to take it to the rotovap data is really important so you guys are going to do trial and error so the only way you're gonna be able to figure out where you stand is by collecting data yeah right so I'll show you an example of a worksheet that I have that I use of the information that I'm collecting I'm practically and you guys can figure out what works best for you but we found that you know collecting all the data you can just helps give you a baseline and to improve your product and repeatability is such a big thing you want to be able to repeat the same quality of last year this is a two liter flask and it's a standard ground glass joint so you guys wanted fish them last way or anything okay fine tip it down alright and you you want to explain the advantage of this oh sure well we'll see what we're when we're pulling it out depending on the viscosity of the oil when you're finished it can sometimes be very thick yeah and and then it's difficult to get it out of the area what we've done before I'm seeing people do is put the bottle upside down and let it drain we've seen people use a heat gun put it in an oven you know kind of warm up the oil and get it rating that we were doing it the top after we took it off the root of that so it actually flowed out pretty well what this bottle does is it has an adapter piece this isn't f1 it just gives you a wider mount so just easier to get a tool in or anything if you are doing anything nice we'll see getting it out you know these are the standard bottles like I said getting it before out of here if you all becomes very thick this is difficult and you may have to add you know something using the heat gun you don't want to do too much you have a hot spot designing the oil industry yeah so you know you're gentle but at the same time you want the stuff and back into like a hot water bath you could just a warm it up people to get that gentle warming and then put it upside down we just we took it off the rotovap it was still warm and we put it upside down and it was able to flow out okay you know but I'm using it practice it is when you start right yeah yeah it makes it easier use it and really if you're learning from multiple samples of the same things don't worry about getting every last drop out of it it's when you go transferring between different strains something like that yeah you know you're going to have to clean that out even in that case you're not going to necessarily lose at all because you can wash it with alcohol and then have an alcohol flask let's just say let's go between down now that I hear that good so we're going to take this sample though we use a little photo here industries you could use a bigger one if you like I'm singing a Phillies big moment that that whole combo I think Nick was talking about is on the website the combo includes the funnel and this flat for 550 I think Oh to that angle yeah yeah all right the winner will go to the rotovap and this is really easy setup here good thing see how that threads in and out Josh so we're going to bring it out here a little bit got this lip on here it's going to go underneath this clip right here and take it here see it just clipped so what I'll do is I'll start to thread it up a little bit till it gets closer where it won't fall back down just kind of hold it up in place felt like that when we turn the vacuum on the vacuum you don't want to tighten it too much I've too much data and that lip on that is kind of rounded so if you did it was kind of it might have sexy to pop over this know what I mean uh-huh so you just get up there snug like I said when we turn the vacuum on vacuums going to help hold that on there you know so flashings in place now I'll go through this real quick here it's pretty simple easy up and down buttons are up and down up and down for good gonna hit the head ultimatum gotcha okay if I want to say I've got this shows your bottom and solid stop for your bottom basically we're going to come down yeah so it came down and stopped at five point nine okay and you can adjust that just hold this button to set that and then that says here right there kind of like what not good that was probably at the right depth right there to you when you say tool and what I did is I change I changed my zero day the heart stops at zero to say zero yeah yeah so then you can walk around the mic dial dial until the point and if you put it in five point nine then press and hold it then it'll say five nine there that's the new zero well then it will know that and that way you just can't bottom it out you try to hit the bottom of the yes okay so that's up-and-down for that temperature set is right here you have switched up here and now I'm controlling temperature here what yeah I we started it yesterday at sixty see guy Celsius yes and so once we get that set to where we want it and click this button right here that's on and off for the bass there I think Roland just turned it on because I just shut it off so what's happening with this blanking right here to show you that the bat is warming thank you yeah and once it gets to the temperature 60 it stays it okay I said a sample that we came up with her yesterday all those and alcohol says stop condensing then this is a simple and that's when you said you took it and that's about the consistency we're gonna get that okay great and stuff we got with a lot of very hot if that were true sorry this shirt give me that so we started with a message right cool Oh dance hall said yeah that's right there is definitely a nice consistency and quality for putting it so they as realize exactly that's what wind up with this this KNF unit is a fantastic city was great yeah a little bit okay right then I just have one more question for okay just because we're using a different machine you know for ours when you take this and you take this and you hook it up the way that he did on the end of there mm-hm then what would I write there yeah you can have a disconnect at or this is just a hole for us I'll do it I'm just gonna break vacuum on this with this is just the boss I mean so you can disconnect this if you wanted to put you know a key in line if you were going to be doing it on a regular basis you know we didn't want to have to keep pulling this off oh I can say I know a piece of - even though I'm able to - sighs but that's all we've done then I just you know so now there's no vacuum on this you see the get alcohol ooh got yet no nothing so when we do that then we just turn this on 100 I'm hydrated for vacuum for vacuum filtration and the concern is what we're talking about before you don't necessarily want to pull as strong a vacuum as you can because you'll start to pull down you can rip the paper or start to tear those sounds and things down through the paper and then you're gonna have to do it you know another filtration and seventy-five to a hundred it's a little bit of a general you know you don't our machine 75 to 100 okay you don't need to pull all the way down to a you know a descending vacuum for filtration you you just want a vacuum assist just help me counselor how we looking Roland getting down then let me get to either will it stops dripping you know right now pretty much got yeah and that's the question to its you know you're saying it's much thicker so the question is how much alcohol you want to take out do you need to remove all of it well for face you think yes and that's a question what you're doing you know what you're going to do with this afterwards yeah put edibles we'll just take it straight out of the first one take all the wax out right if you don't have to do those steps you know I don't know that's awfully push it is easier to work so Nick this morning that a lot of guys can take our customers have been taking some of this extract straight out of the cup and then just mixing that diluting that and there's solutions out there PPG are probably propylene glycol isn't like that they using e-cigs right but and then this coconut oil a more natural approach right so the guys can take that right out of cup and mix that with that consistency that's good enough to go into a pen right so a lot of guys are doing that just like that the problem becomes you're cutting the concentration of your extract so right you're you got the plants and are the the fats and waxes mixed in with that too which will cause some issues in a bait pen right yeah so you're cutting concentration risks you're not so and then also they introduce terpenes from other plants you know terpenes are common throughout the plant families after you have like say this right here would be fantastic because this is just your straight oil we haven't cut this with anything right - alcohol I see how that is turning the syrup and you can just kind of see the syrup in that normally the one that he gets moved after huh you can do that yeah you just unscrew this one we can I counted this it comes with both oh it does yeah come come both yeah so you'll have at least two flat all right this is Swiss made a mess German to release the back yep so over here about to hi Todd but not yes yeah it's been ticket row yeah okay push and hold that long I push the stop button first I hit I'm in just push and hold Vince out come in this and come back up yep there you go right you transfer it out of this would be a lot easier I like to wear the gloves it gets sticky your stuff is tough to get off your hands right you really only need to get real crazy with cleaning like that when you're going to change strange writing you running different materials and you want to make sure you don't have any cross-contamination then that's when you need a about cleaning right this is one and they've got they've got this too but they got the two liters right that's correct yeah so this is a three litre usually gonna be a bit smaller than this one it will still have to hang tight yes the opening here so you could definitely get in there with a better tool and get that clean down so much is good yeah exactly and again washing that off if you're going to change samples washing that off with alcohol real well and saving that alcohol and a flask that is just for that sample will be the way to do that and this fits right on - right this fits right onto here yeah it is funny so that's it okay same setup the only other thing I didn't really show you on this is a the ability to adjust see what this is doing is tilting the whole thing and so that's so you can figure out how to get the majority of this into the water right so for your flute sitting here you can adjust the angle great exactly just depends on what you've got in there so you got the ability to do that in the end okay I think you guys will have no issue with any of this equipment and this is probably more complicated than that so I don't think you'll have any issues with that you know as far as a cleaning process hey did I really just say that it's first cleanup or anything else on this maintenance wise do we have anything if they have to standard maintenance you know there is a two-week sit if every splashing there's a tube that runs through here and there is a seal in the top here we just take this office here that you know there's a problem with the seal it won't hold vacuum so see how this comes apart I'll do is if you could hold this so that way I don't have to take any of the coots or wives or or even the bottom off okay okay so that that's all together okay this comes off don't think your name to rubber seals holding that in place on inside there's a button underneath I'm sort of doing it okay okay cuz otherwise this your spins can't press the button underneath and then locking blue okay now this is a yo-yo Scotty so this is the part that will wear out over time but we shouldn't be talking about any time in the near future so now you know to me again but we have these available and I think they're about 60 bucks and then it clicks into place so where this could have lights in you I see that oh yeah yeah so that seems easy to take out and clean as well if you have to where you get the bump we're talking about is oil carryover then you can see how this comes before it yeah why would you have that much maintenance if you do it the right way you do it later yeah after cleaning itself yo this girl is actually on first yeah you kind of feel just by rocking that around where that needs to be all right that's it let's just for just four stakes here figure out what the dump the rest is in here and we'll go get an idea on how much of the alcohol we actually uncovered that's about where I started it is amazing when you watch that we just had this nasty concoction of stuff put together with this and we were able to make it look so clean right alright well what's happening is I mean alcohol is a different boiling point then then the other oils too so even water so I mean when you figure out what that temperature is with the vacuum it makes the process extremely you're going to leave that much in there but again gets you a little spray bottle with your alcohol and then just spray it down and then I like to just give it a shake shake everything up try and cook the whole inside of it and then just clean all that up and save all that into another flask lay down label it whatever if if you're not just dump it out reuse it just dump this out and just put any sample in here if you got the same sample there's not much worried to clean it like that well I think that about covers that you guys [Music]", "7YOdRxvgjNE": "this chiller is providing chilled water through

so we use cold ethanol so we take all the plant material in a giant walk-in freezer with barrels of alcohol we take all the plant material put it in giant tea bags and dip it right into the alcohol all the oil dissolves into the alcohol and then we run it through a series of filtration and then we've sucked it into the rotary evaporator this rotary evaporator is very similar to a moonshine still right all the oil and alcohol mixture goes in here the vapor is condensed goes over the coils and then all the alcohol is reclaimed down here at the other side so we're running one liter every five

follow all of our products from their launch to the end and then check up on them while they're in service our latest innovation is our co-solvent module our co-solvent module brings ethanol together with our co2 extractor by injecting anywhere from one percent to five percent ethanol into the system to aid in the extraction doing this allows a 300 percent faster extraction method the co-solvent injection module also aids in cleaning your system thanks to the ethanol being in there you have an easier clean out of your separator cups than you did before it's also easier to winterize you can take the crude oil from a co-solvent run and put it directly into your winterization process and you have less ethanol that you had to mix with it to begin with and it's already mixed in your crude

guys you're famous", "evtSWzJ-Uec": "so you want to make a cannabis alcohol tincture using the cold method you're in the right place welcome to truebuds tv it's simple but take some time grab a very high proof liquor like everclear 120 the higher the proof the better i have a half ounce of some outdoor cali an ounce of trim and shake or cheesecloth and strainer we're also going to do a coffee filter strain as well our jars to put it in and then something to pour or a portion later we're going to use some funnels too or i'll show you a hack there as well we have our baking sheet with our crinkled up parchment this is for decarboxylating our blood to activate that thca i crinkle it up just so it gets a little better surface area and doesn't burn we have this half here we're putting on you don't got to grind it up all the way you could use your hands or whatever and then we're just going to dump the ounce of trim and shake on there and then next let's decarboxylate cover it with foil for one hour at 225 degrees fahrenheit this is crucial now let's go ahead and put that in the jar it's as simple as that we're going to put that half of the outdoor decarb tally in there then we're going to put about a pint of liquor in it a little bit i'm going to break this trim and shake down a little more after being decarb just to experiment my first time doing it so we'll see what happens we're just going to go and add the everclear like i said you could use whatever bacardi 151 you could use a whiskey you know a moonshine just make sure it's a high proof we're going to proceed to go ahead here and put that 16 ounces of this 120 proof everclear in with that half ounce this is going to be a less potent batch my goal with this one is to make a can of sugar experiment with recipes with that i'm also going to take that can of sugar and do a simple syrup with it for our cocktail series so if you haven't caught any of those other simple syrup recipes i recommend checking them out next this is going to be the more potent one here we're going to do about 12 ounces total i think but let's put a cup in the start and see how that's looking so this is that full hat or part of me this is the full ounce of the trim and shake there's a cup in there eight ounces not enough let's add four more so we're doing 12 ounces total to that one ounce of the trim and shake hopefully get something nice and potent here shake it up put it in the freezer you're gonna want to repeat this daily shaking it at least two to three four times however many you want a day i left it in the freezer for two weeks the beauty here is kind of the longer the better can stay in there for however long you like let's strain it through this fine cheesecloth here i recommend wearing gloves to squeeze it out at the end just to keep that alcohol off your hands i do this really no matter what no matter what infusion i'm doing so let's go ahead strain that out and we're about ready for the next step the coffee filter and here's that little hack i was saying you could use a funnel or you can make your own by just cutting a water bottle soda bottle whatever let's put the coffee filter in here to strain it through and i'll show you at the end here why we do this to collect any extra sediment you know that kind of made it through the cheesecloth even though we used a really fine cheesecloth so i got the other water bottle gonna do the same thing to do two runs on each and here's what it's looking like trim and shake very crucial you could see how much was there flower not so much but it was still nice to get out the second run through for both really wasn't necessary to be completely honest so you could save your time do one that does take a little time too so now we're going to go ahead and do the t-check 2 potency testing device let's check the first one here and see what's going on testing the infusion okay 2.4 milligrams per milliliter pretty weak actually so we'll turn that into the sugar like i was saying it'll be interesting to experiment with i'm really wondering what the other one's going to be now so 11.7 let's see what the tablespoon is 35 not bad you know kind of weak so let's do the more potent this is what i'm really curious about because i would even do more next time make it more potent maybe do an ounce of flour instead of the trim and shake to really get it up a notch testing the infusion testing the infusion let's get it let's see what it's coming in at and i'm always ready for this always curious let's see 8.9 milligrams per milliliter that's solid that's a nice amount that's like a good tincture right there let's see i like just doing another one so you guys can see 44 basically per teaspoon tablespoon 131.5 that's gonna hit that's gonna hit good yeah so i'm gonna go ahead put three in here wait about an hour and a half or so to when it should have peaked or be peaking and let you know if i think the uh t check is accurate and my overall thoughts on my first cold methane tincture it's an acquired taste you know just like alcohol but you just gotta let it sit there enjoy the burn i took three milliliters which is approximately 27 milligrams of thc according to the t check 2 and it's about an hour and a half later and i would agree with that reading seems about right that 25 to 30 milligram sweet spot for me you know gets me feeling really good this one has me really calm just hanging but not too much so i would say it's about right and if you think this thing's dope if you think the t-check's cool i'll put a link with a discount below you know i get a little something on the back end but seems pretty accurate for everything i've done so far i need to experience more with the flower for it but this was solid i even used the little syringe they have because it's way more accurate than the dropper so i could be exact with you and now for my favorite part like what can we learn from this experience what can i do better next time i would say next time just make it stronger and maybe even let it sit longer have a couple working at all points because that three milliliters is a lot for me it's not that much but like maybe that at the same time that it's good for you if you have a lower tolerance but i want to make it stronger but at the same time too that is a good way to use your trim and shake that you have just laying around just put in some strong liquor let it sit use it at a later date so more videos coming about this experimenting with it seeing what we can do with it but that's kind of my thoughts what else can we do better sit longer more potent so when i say more potent i'm thinking use more flour that's more potent maybe even do a concentrate you know just keep experimenting because i see the value in this that it can offer especially once you get it down so it's just like oh you know half of this if it was 0.5 milliliters that's smacking that's good but either way the potency was there it was i'm happy with it i'm happy with this recipe and i'm happy to fulfill because people have been asking like dude when can you make this i'm like i'm gonna make it i'm gonna make it but i have been putting it on the back burner i'm not gonna lie because i know it just takes time i'm like but i just should have done it a while ago you just let it sit there and like i said just go shake it up it's about it it's fun always having something infusing it's like inspired me to do other types of infusions too that whatever i'm kind of want to rant right now what else to talk about i guess that's it i guess that sums up video so thank you for hanging out i hope you like this drop a comment below like i said because i will make what you want if i get enough people saying it giving it a thumbs up or whatever so see you later [Music] you", "cGf0XpmzEdU": "hello everyone on this video I'm gonna walk through how to turn your CV flower or hemp into highly concentrated oil this is very common or similar it to the RSO method if you've done any research on that but this has a couple tweaks compared to what you may have seen and I find this to be a pretty effective method and it produces the medicine that works really well for me all right so here are the supplies you will need to make your own CBD oil I use a minimum of one ounce up to two ounces of CBD flour the solvent you'll be needing to extract our oil is alcohol in this case it's 190 proof every clear alcohol we'll be needing a mason jar to collect and shake up the flour and the alcohol together a grinder for the flour a decarboxylate later in the video a double boiler pot a coffee filter with a colander a silicon spatula and some parchment paper now here are the list of actual instructions or the step by steps that we that I will be going through I'm not gonna read them all one by one because we're gonna [ __ ] I'm gonna demonstrate all of them in this video but feel free to pause the video take a screenshot do what you need to but because these really are the at the end of the day the 10 steps to make your own oil all right now we'll go ahead and walk through the process what you see here is two ounces of hemp or rich CBD flour measured out a little under 2.1 ounces we then have the coffee grinder right here look to help grind up the flour and then we have our D carb box our silicon decarboxylase I'm not gonna go ahead and spell mine out just because I think with a little bit of googling you guys can find out which one I'm using just make sure whatever one you settle on does have a weight limit and that you measure and you just make sure that that weight limit matches to the amount of medicine that you want to make all right so now we have ground up our our flower through the graphy grinder again you can use a manual grinder if you have one I just find if you're dealing with quantity you're gonna really want to use an electric grinder or some fine you know certain instructions do say that you should leave it relatively chunky when you do the de Carr process or other ones I've said make it more fine so really you know dealer's choice on how you want to do it I kind of make mine a little bit more fine I just find that make at least in my mind I assume that the alcohol that I'm gonna pour over top of it will get more spread evenly and soaked up by all the medicine if it's a little more thinner so but again dealer's choice on how you want to do that and lastly this is why the parchment paper is really important the flower will stick to the silicone and it will make it a pain to get out of the decarboxylation paper now oven temperature now my oven is particularly inaccurate if you will so it's almost 20 degrees off from the temperature I'm shooting for so again we don't want to exceed 230 so from my case I set my oven to 210 and I'll also walk you through what happens when I hit that temperature because my oven again isn't the most perfect thing in the world so you're gonna want to lower that temperature about halfway through the cooking process alright and now for my D card box the temperature thermometer if you will goes through the top of it it was a little puncture hole that keeps it kind of semi airtight I do find that this box in particular works really well for keeping the temperature within five degrees this is the digital output for the thermometer the bottom temperature is what the alarm will go off at and the top is what the current temperature is set at I'm gonna lower mine to that 230 temperature because again that if we want really want to keep the flower temperature between 220 and 230 that's kind of where the full deep carbonation happens without releasing the benefits of the plant material all right so the the gauge is 8 so you see there to the right is my timer unfortunately the thermometer I have does not have a timer built into it so I have a timer there to keep up with where we are in the cooking process and we're about halfway through at 45 minutes and the alarm went off I know the temperature is lowered there because I already to 205 but the alarm went off saying I had to 30 and so what what that tells me to do is I then go lower my oven temperature from 210 to 205 and then within about five maybe ten minutes at most you'll notice that the temperature in the decarboxylate and I find that that ends up holding the temperature pretty effectively until it's time to remove the flour out of the oven all right so our cooking time is done it's been an hour and a half and I had this sitting for about 20 to 25 minutes so it's mostly cooled off at this point and now we're gonna go ahead and open it up and see what it looks like now as far as the smell goes your house will have no difference you go through this process but and also tells you you're doing it right um but I will say when you open this up it's gonna have a very much almost coffee smell to it like a roasting kind of smell to it it should not be burnt that should not be what you smell so and it should almost look like kind of coffee grounds fresh out of the roaster if you will and then from here we're going to use this parchment paper to almost wrap a like a burrito if you will in order to put it into our glass mason jar alright so we've dumped the flour into our mason jar using the parchment paper and you can kind of see there in that silicone box exactly what I was talking about that some of the flour will inevitably land on the silicone and once it gets on there it just does not really come out very easily it likes to stick to it and so just messing with that and trying to get it in the mason jars it's going to be a real time-consuming process alright and so after you get all the flour out of your box you'll want to dump it in your mason jar and this is this is what it looks like and then once you get it all in here and it's mostly cooled off you don't want it still be hot you're gonna want to use your solvent and in this case I'm using Everclear it's 190 proof and I have to stress that you definitely want to get a hundred and ninety proof I've done this process using a smaller proof because that's all I could find at the time and it does not produce equally quality oils so definitely the higher the alcohol content the higher the proof means that it's more pure and you'll be able to burn it off a lot here I'll go ahead and add the alcohol to our flower now just bear with me because I'm filming and doing the activity at the same time so some of the camber angles might not be the best but really the trick to how much alcohol you add to this is really just adding a little bit letting it settle kind of get an idea of how much that was and then just keep adding some until eventually you just want the top of where the flower sits to be covered almost like just like a little blanket over top of of the flower and then from there as the flower slowly absorbs up that alcohol you're going to see that line or fill line if you will slowly rise so you don't want out of time then a thing to think the thing to remember as you do this is that for every alcohol you add to this solution you're going to have to burn it off so less is I definitely ideal for saving you a lot of time but you want to make sure all of the flower is covered and coated and it's all nice and saturated so you can see here I had just a little bit more that ends up covering just what I want you can kind of see that it's just covering the very bare top of it and you can probably add a little bit more if you want to but this is pretty close to where I kind of want my ideal limit to be and then as you go through the shaking and the sitting process you will see that fill line rise and I'll show to you here in just a minute all right so here is our resting line if you will and you can see then where the flower is settling and where the oil is said and they are almost the exact same point right there pretty much even and that's what we want to get now the next step in the process is to is the shaking now this is you out what you want to do this aggressively there really is no wrong way to shake it if you will but the more shaking you do the more aggressive you are with the shaking I think it's all better because the end of the day this agitation is going to be the only opportunity if you will for the oil I mean sorry for the alcohol and the plant material to mix you know after we filter out the plant material you know there's no longer part of the equation so make sure that this part is something you spend some time at you're really agitated and you're really good all of that benefit out of the plant material into the alcohol all right so what you see here is the is the flower after I've shaking it for about 20-25 minutes and let it sit for 15 to 20 minutes so I shoot for like you know 35 45 minutes somewhere in there for a total time and then after that we will move it to the filtrate we'll go through the filtration process now here I have a brown coffee filter I prefer that over the white bleach ones because I think the brown are just a little bit stronger and they can hold up to the weight and the pressing all I'll be doing to it then we have a mesh screen right over top of my measuring cup now the colander I would definitely make sure you get a wire mesh one because you are going to be pressing on it and you just want something that's relatively strong I also have a reusable coffee filter you see there in the middle I use that when it comes time to start squeezing the filter because eventually this filter emits paper right it's going to rip so having that extra filter or like that reusable coffee filter is a great way to catch any of the plant material so once you dump the material in there you're gonna want to kind of swish it around so you get as much of the plant material to come out with you in the jar but you will probably have to use that rubber spatula to help get out any additional plant material and the timing for this process where you just have it sitting in here I usually do it for almost like 30 minutes to be honest I let gravity do a lot of the work for me and then after that I'll come in and I'll and I'll add some pressure to it through the spatula and then eventually I'll put some rubber gloves on and squeeze it and I'll walk you through that here in just a little bit now here you'll see I I've let gravity do its work for me and I've drained out a good amount I would say that I'll call the vast majority is gonna come out through just letting gravity do the work for you so I ended here with roughly about let's say 1/10 and is what I got so what I'm gonna go ahead and do now is start just squeeze you know collecting the paper together and beginning to squeeze it and then basically once the paper rips what you will I'll go ahead and use that reusable coffee filter and include it in the you know in the process I usually try to work my way from top down just so that there is any liquid left in there it's slowly working its way down and then once that bag rips I basically kind of just Corral it into my hand like a baseball and just try to squeeze it as much as I can and you'll see here that some of there is additional oil still left in there well it may seem relatively minimum in comparison to what you've already collected I also think you know sometimes the most rich oil is probably this stuff you got to squeeze out so I think every little bit helps and any extra drops you can get I think is only gonna make her oil just more potent all right now onto the cooking process what you see here is our measuring cup with our infused alcohol our double boiler pot and a fan the fan is primarily used to help blow the alcohol vapor around that'll be in the air this is more of a problem for someone that has a double debts or it has a gas stove alcohol vapor is heavier than air so it will drop it will fall to the ground and if it's an open flame it will ignite so make sure you have a fan to help load that vapor around finally and that now the cooking process now I want to make sure I highlight what the oil should look like as it's cooking and it's most cases it should look pretty benign if not boring like there shouldn't be much happening you may see some occasional bubbles and things like that but that's when you really just want to kind of stir it around a little bit agitate it with some silicone a little bit of bubbles is okay what you don't want to see is rapid bubbles and I have a video here where I'll show that to you if you happen to see rapid bubbles slightly pick up that upper top of your double boiler let some of that heat xscape and then rest it back down now I keep my oven at a very low temperature the the hot plate very low temperature it is actually Onslow I've also found great success if your oven is just not the best at keeping a low temperature to look into a camping stove because sometimes those can maintain lower temperatures better than your actual stove all right Sanne here is a video or a picture of what you do not want and no bubbles I want to reiterate that over and over and over again you do not want to see this if you see this this means you have your heat is too high your your double boiler is too hot lower your stove temperatures and release the heat that's in your double boiler this typically will result in oil that is not as rich and or as effective now to help speed things up I'm gonna go ahead and show you what the oil looks like over time so here's what it is about 15 minutes into the cooking process you still see it's kind of wet let me still see some alcohol sitting there 30 35 minutes into the process a lot less alcohol still a little runny and a little bit of bubbles like that those bubbles are okay and then finally an hour into the process you can see it's a lot more oil like less out and almost no alcohol and no bubbles at all our last step so what we have here and I forgot to add this to the instruction list is a is a syringe this is a plastic syringe you can get a lot of these online the only advice I would give is make sure that it has a pretty you know good-sized neck you know so you can suck up the oil something that's really fine or really skinny is just gonna make it a lot harder for you and also that has a cap once you collect all this stuff you're gonna want to have a way to make sure it doesn't fall out of the syringe so what the best method do I find to collect it all is just as you can see I've tilted the double boiler at an angle and then just pushed all the oil to a single spot and tried to pull up as much as I could and and then just suck it up it supports pretty well I can get almost all of it in there and then they'll be maybe about half a gram or so that I won't be able to collect that I'll use my spatula to collect and then put it into a capsule usually my yield is around three to three-and-a-half MLS for one ounce one and a half ounces I get closer to four to four and a half MLS and if I do two ounces I get around five MLS and this is what your final product will look like please leave comments and at the bottom of this video this is definitely the first go of it how to show my cooking process I've received a lot of questions from people interested in what I do how I do it and so forth so this is my first pass at trying to at least put the whole process out there so everybody could see it you know but please give me specific questions tell me if you want specific things to be more you know lab rated on or just want some more information what questions you specifically have you know there's really no wrong things to ask I'll try to answer the best I can and we'll just go from there thank you and I hope you guys all enjoyed this", "rgEezZKRToc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] Chris here with prism have this is our thin film white molecular distillation unit you can see we've got great output right now it takes a whole lot to dial this in and get it get it to rain like that but that's pure amber distillate coming out it's about 90% to 92% cannabinoids almost all CBD raining down and then collecting in our vessel here even though it drips a light yellow once it gets into the vessel a little bit of the reddish darkness will come out of it but this is some really magnificent flow Chris here with prism ham what we're doing right now is actually winterizing our crude what we do is we have a large Buechner funnel filtration system the material inside is around negative 50 Fahrenheit or about negative 45 Celsius you can see how cold it is it's actually creating frost on the outside of the class this here is a receiving flask we keep it this cold to help remove the fats and waxes through the top filtration element so when this is all done we will actually have a whole layer of fat wax this is how we separate our oil before we go into the later processing stages and in this case we use a super low solo freezer to help with that winterization Chris here with prism ham were right at the end of March 2009 2019 this is our rotary evaporator our 50 liter you can see this is what the material looks like going in its a bright amber color after heavy-duty filtration this is the column itself we open it up see it's sucks it right in under vacuum and that's CBD oil that will eventually be distillate we're reclaiming our ethanol there and we have our full system in place with our vacuum pump chiller and the whole works", "RGoeJfCsZsA": "we're fixing corporation August 9 2018 we have a CP for screw pressing we're gonna test again with ham today they have I don't know if you can see this very well but it is pretty moist it's a lot more wet than the stuff returned yesterday some of the stuff we didn't yesterday was pretty wet and you would have seen some really good flow rate this is on par with the wettest stuff of yesterday so I'm expecting to see a lot but even even being this wet if you look at this there's nothing coming through nothing now if you go to the other side of my hand no nothing's going through there so this is the problem that people have when they infuse material with the liquid is try how are we gonna get that liquid out you know we'll squeeze with our hands put it in soccer cloth and twist it and you really can't get almost anything out you know you can see my hands are wet but that's as good as it gets now the beauty of our screw press is it'll take out almost all of this moisture or an awful lot of it so let's see how we get on okay we're running at 135 psi we've got juice coming out now a really good flow [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it sure that it's fall the side [Music] [Music] okay this is more for the benefit of video than anything else and the finished processing [Music] and I'm going to do a a weight analysis on this point oh six [Music] okay we finished this test we ran through that one bucket that I showed you just a few minutes ago there's a press liquor it's still kind of draining through obviously you're going to get some sediment so you can see that sediment right there this shows you how much oil we got and then if you go to here it's the idea of the cake and I think you remember how what that was here's an indication of the cake I think you can remember how wet that was my hands our boat this is dry stuff I mean I'll put up I think I'm going to get a paper towel and show you how dry that is okay here we are in sunny Tampa Florida and this is the result of that test we did obviously you saw it in the blue bucket the big one but it was 18 litres of material and afterwards we're left with just Alex about four liters four and a half meters of this the oil and I was about five liters six liters maybe this press cake now this press cake I think you remember how you probably remember how wet it was it was like glistening wet this right here barely gets my hand oily what we'll do real quick is I got some paper towel on here let's put some on paper towel what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna squeeze it in a paper towel or a see if I can please in a paper towel take it off okay there is a little bit of oil there I don't know if that's plant fiber oh there's a little bit of a glisten of some oil in there but that's hardly any so this stuff has come out super dry just like a teacher anyways that is what we're looking at so you get this and this oil right here get this then use our press-on material", "ZhA1b06Yp28": "it's an to get ready distillers going through a new still it's called the weed which anyway so I we're doing an absolute here but we're going to be extracting an algorithm or the world from cannabis and again it just doesn't only removing the oils and plant materials from this certain planet it will do lavender you can take the boys out of lemon rye whatever it may be anything that hot oil this will do we're just going to draw an absolute which is going to go from a concrete absolute using an alcohol extraction or ethyl alcohol again you can use any of the solvents you like again there's solvent to solvent they have to be purged after so and some solvent others anyway so we're using an ethyl alcohol plant the two two we're using your sugar week five and a half ounces we see how much we get in these and then one and a half or maybe 1.7 ounces of a bud here that we're going to break down into two small sizes so it's easy to interact with the ethyl alcohol we're going to be doing a chewing here it's going to be you know in the freezer deep freezer one's going to be plant material and then we're going to plug it pour our ethyl alcohol in here of course you freeze both the unit the plant material and the alcohol first for at least 12 to 24 hours and bring those temperatures right down and then once you've done that then cap it off put your plant with children here because being chewing for 12 to 24 hours put your ethanol alcohol in here again do that fairly quickly cap it make sure there's no leaks so it has your plant that your ethyl alcohol and then you can stick that right back in the freezer and let it sit for as long as you want I don't want to give any advice to anyone out there you just do it by trial and error again once you put your package over here I would say every 5-10 minutes I'd open that freezer give it a quick shake and put it straight back in there and then when do you think it's done you can take it off I'm doing your caps which I'll show you and the time other than that the next one is going to be just the chilled plant material and running ethyl alcohol through the pain control into a catchment which I'll show you and and most of the parts I'll be using here is all coming with the Salomon is still it's called the wheat which through Rainier distillers and let's have some fun so I'll just stop this and I'll get everything done I've got some water frozen and we'll turn this back on and get this done okay again we're going to go through everything here there's going to be about three different distillation processes if you just choose which one is are going to work for you first being using the freezing cheering everything the next one's going to be a Rick Simpson oil so when you've done most of this this working removed most of all the good oils what everything's good then you can do the last extraction through a Rick Simpson process or a heated heated distillation process which we'll go through other than that look upon any of your questions just send them off to our to the you", "RXNzYUV_DvI": "all right welcome back to your next episode of full spectrum living with CVD my name is Meredith and I am your co-host and I have your hosts here today Jessica and Adrian and today we're going to talk about extraction methods how exactly does CBD get removed from hemp and what are the different ways that that's done what's good what's bad pros and cons of those things and so Jessica I think you're gonna talk a little bit today about what is extraction in the first place right yeah yeah sure so in general it's just the way that you remove the content that you're trying to grow and produce for from the plant material so we're talking about your cannabinoids so primarily CBD in our case and the other components of the plant so the more minor cannabinoids like THC CBD and CBC in our plant material and then you're also talking about terpenoids the flavor and scent profile and then there's other things that some extraction methods pull out and some don't and so we'll go into that with breakdown of each type of extraction but primarily it's pretty straightforward the number one type of extraction in hemp currently seems to be co2 extraction which we'll talk about and then there's ethanol extraction and hydrocarbon distillation or extraction so we'll kind of break down each of those but they all kind of have their strengths and weaknesses and we are very partial to one in particular there's a couple myths surrounding and so be busting that but yeah co2 ethanol and hydro carbon would be the top three categories and then there's like more kind of trendy ones like ice baths and bubble hash and crazy stuff that is gaining popularity but they're not really that readily available in the market right now so maybe not this episode got it got it okay so you said it the most popular I don't know if I might be popular but the most widely used method is this co2 method so Adrian how do that how does that even work yeah absolutely so they use co2 in a really high-pressure format to essentially blast all the cannabinoids or the desired cannabinoids off the plant material the pressure is so high that the co2 just simply disappears which it doesn't leave a residual solvent this makes it probably more appealing to a lot of producers out there who are quite possibly maybe worried about the residual solvents which you should be worried about residual solvents but the problem with this one is the fact that is because the pressure is so high it is really harsh on that plant material so the things like Jessica's Jessica was talking about like the terpenoids they're really sensitive and so that high pressure blasts them so from through a co2 extraction it's really hard to get any true terpene profile within the product itself so how does that process even work right so they have the hemp they harvest the hemp and then the co2 like is that done in a in a specific environment like can you break down how like the process itself oh well so I mean I'm not a co2 expert but my understanding is it's a it's a pretty complex system it's highly pressurized that the part per million pressure is insanely high which does make it a little bit of a potential risk you know think with like hydrocarbons which we'll talk about later people talk about well but it's dangerous and odd will dispel that myth but I think it's important to point out here because of the high pressure that's required for co2 extraction there is some risk for if an issue did occur but it's just simply just mechanical force sheer force just kind of hammering the trichome structures off of the plant and then I think you know it has the benefit of being able to set really specific parameters to extract certain kahneman women to kind of take those out of the content and that's where you get a lot of the isolation so see it's you is how you produce like an isolate product which is very common in hemp production right now for CVD and I guess a thing the note there is just kind of it allows for I would say just subpar product to be extracted out because it produces a very homogenous end product so it's all going to be really similar even if you're using high quality or low quality product and so it makes it very appealing to mass production because you can grow subpar plants and produce something that's still gonna be just as good as if you put a lot of effort into the higher grade production so do you think that that's maybe one of the reasons or maybe you can explain the reasons that this particular extraction method is the most popular I think that's absolutely one of the reasons it's one of the most popular so when you think about prior to the legalization here within the United States the hemp was being grown overseas right and so again they're using it or they were largely using it whether it was to remediate the soil to clean out and and cleanse some of the toxins that were found in the soil they were essentially just throwing seed out there growing it in large really compact fields of land so again being able to take that agricultural commodity that was actually used for something else throw it into an extraction machine and still get CBD out of it it's almost the byproduct of what they were essentially really using the hemp for so I do think that that was that's one of the reasons why it's really popular another reason why is because you know back in the day hydrocarbon did get a bad rap like Jessica said what we will talk about that in more detail and I think just like in any industry when something like that happens you're gonna have manufacturers come up with another way to create a product co2 extraction equipment is really expensive it's really expensive and so I think that we still see that push from the manufacturers to keep co2 as one of the quote unquote top ways to extract CBD from the plant material I certainly think there's kind of like it's it's just a trend that seems to be really popular it has the benefit of mass production more easily as well so you can just make a lot more product more quickly so some some people say at least which is a benefit but I think the big things is it's just you can take mediocre hemp and produce whatever kind of product it doesn't really matter and and you can make it really quickly I see okay okay so then when it comes to the alcohol extraction method what tell us a little bit more about that yeah that's essentially soaking the plant material in alcohol or ethanol the issue here is that ethanol is a polar solvent actually yes it's a polar solvent so it wants to bind to the more water-soluble parts of the plant which means that you'll actually pull less cannabinoids and terpenoids and flavonoids because those are fat soluble you'll pull less of those and more of some of the other components of the plant that actually creates a less pure product to be honest you get a lot of chlorophyll content with ethanol as well so it generally has that's probably something we should mention it generally has a darker color and more of like a grassy or hay kind of flavor often with ethanol and then you know with your co2 products you'll generally have a much lighter color and much lighter flavor a lot of times it's tasteless unless they've added additional terpenes back into the product but sometimes you'll get a mild cannabis flavor but it's generally a really mild flavor and appearance versus ethanol which is really dark generally flavor and appearance because you're getting chlorophyll from the the product more so than your terpenes okay okay and then it comes to the kind of the third not not that there are only three ways but the third most common way is this hydrocarbon distillation right and that's what that's what you all use yes yeah and and to be honest with you we know that we're definitely the only company east of the Mississippi that uses this extraction method I'm pretty much 99.9 percent sure that we may be the only hemp company that's using a hydrocarbon distillation for our extracts or for their extracts so you typically see this in the legal states there though use it for marijuana in order to be able to hold the extracts create high quality resins and so forth but essentially a hydrocarbon distillation uses hydrocarbons which is a combination of carbon and hydrogen and it they're naturally formed it's from old plant material in rocks and then being pressed into the ground and the most popular ones are butane propane and hexane those are also known organic solvents and they're recognized safe by the FDA and they've been used in food production for years now so they're they're very safe the issue with butane is that it gets a bad rap because there were some teenagers several years back that had some mishaps right they they blew things up because they were doing it or utilizing it in an unsafe manner so essentially straight piping butane so when you do something unsafe that doesn't necessarily mean the entire process itself is unsafe right again recognized safe by the by the FDA and commonly used so we use a closed loop butane extraction so what that means is our machine will have the butane in liquefied form we will run it over the plant material removing gently removing the cannabinoids and turpentine those turn the trichomes from the plant material and then it actually goes into a reservoir tank where butane boils at 31 32 degrees Fahrenheit so a really low temperature it boils and it's evaporative evaporation rate is around 33 34 degrees so we're getting rid of any potential residual solvent during that time and then really making sure that what they get is as close to the plant as they possibly can get that low temperature is really gentle on the cannabinoids and terpenoids allowing us to really capture the best parts of the plant and I think it should be noted that one of the benefits to butane is that be the type of hard hydrocarbon that it is really binds well to the the facts are humility of the trichomes and so it essentially is more of a direct connection like a lock-and-key type of relationship with the trico material and not the chlorophyll material and definitely the terpene so you've got the kind of in our opinion the optimal arrangement of how you're extracting you're getting all the things that you want you have a very low chance of it extracting out anything else other than your trichomes and so it just leaves you with really clean and pure product that's just your cannabinoid and terpenoid profile the kind of like fat waxy lipid structures that they're houston and and that's it so you get a really beautiful golden gooey like concentrate basis right this looks like warm peanut butter I guess and it in it glisten so we have a great picture on our website but it actually looks gold glisteny because of the machine of it but again a really thick peanut butter goalie kind of color of course then we have to dilute that you know and then we use our MCT oil you're in your manufacturing process so when you when you all first started in this industry right and you said okay well we we think we want to create CBD products that are really high-quality because we so believe in the ability of this to help people for many many many reasons which we've talked about quite a few of those and I think that's what's got people tuning in right is that they're curious they want to know that it's safe they want to know so you guys had a choice you've created your company there were all these different extraction methods how did you go through the decision-making process to say no you know what we're gonna use the hydrocarbon method over the other right so let's be real like hemp cultivation is is new and the legalization of it is new 2014 there are already states though that had medical marijuana laws that already had processes in place whether it's through cultivation best practices or actually through extraction best practices so really doing the research and looking and seeing not only what is the marijuana industry from a medical standpoint doing to create high quality resins and products repeatable products for consumers but what are other industries doing like what is the essential oil business do you know how else would you get natural resins from plant materials safely right and so trying to find the way that we could pull the best parts of the plant leading the other parts that we don't need behind we it was very it was a very easy choice for us very easy choice to go with the butane extraction and I think that definitely deserves like to note that it wasn't just like the extraction method but the way that we process in the kind of material we use for extraction and that really you know following more of the medical marijuana standards and procedures that we had observed led us to actually cure our plants instead of like baling it and having it go moldy led us to actually growing for potency and having a really high resin variety of hemp and to use just the groomed plant bloom material instead of the stock and stem as well so those are all practices that you would find for a higher quality medical marijuana product you don't necessarily find them in hemp and they're getting less rare in the marijuana industry as well as people are looking to process like subpar plants in the concentrates because they can't sell them or whatever but just same trends there of cutting corners for dollars and we were making for Adrienne's son so it was an easy choice like do it the right way use just the bloom actually cure it get the most out of your plant and choose what we feel is the safest most effective extraction method and then but lab tested to ensure that we can show that there's not butane in our product there's never been any part per million of butane in our product we have it tested we've always had it tested since day one and it's just it's a non-issue it doesn't show up in the end product when you do it right and that's why we do it well and so it sounds to me like I don't think you guys are coming right out and saying it so I'll go ahead and say it it sounds to me like as the industry has grown right as we've gone from medical marijuana only to now really kind of more of an open playing field it sounds like there have been people that have been kind of trying to figure out how they could mass-produce product not necessarily at the highest level of quality using whatever extraction method they could that would let them produce in bulk maybe improve their margins although their product may not necessarily be cross tested and it may not be the level of Coetzee or quality of what you all strive to to prove that there and I don't want to be here and think like or anybody listening to think like we're the only company who does it right because I don't don't believe that I do believe that there are fewer companies doing it right then than those that aren't and I will absolutely say that but that's again it's all part of the education and where consumers just really need to take a look at where they're getting their product who's making it what information can I find how are they extracting do they provide lab results so many different things and we've talked about whether it's what's on your label you know how they produce what parts of the plant they use all of this is is part of it and so essentially we definitely just wanted to come out and say hey yes we know that there's different extraction methods this is the reason why we choose this one because I think there is definitely more people out there trying to bash the hydrocarbon and really push co2 but there was an article that was done maybe a year or two ago and it was really really good and I'll link it whenever this episode launches so that people can go back and read it but this reporter actually spoke with scientists that are even in the industry on on the side and they're saying that even though their businesses are doing co2 they're gonna see a complete switch because butane is going to be the where you can get the highest quality product right so more and more companies are gonna come back to butane it's gonna circle back as it gets more and more competitive and companies are trying to differentiate themselves from just the mass amounts of CBD that's on the market today because when you go to you know with co2 it's it's not all bad at all but when you when you produce the co2 it does often just produce a lot of like the same kind of product there's just not as much variation achieved through co2 production in general and so I think you know Adrian definitely right that people look for the more artisanal style of production methods to differentiate their product and and you know potentially the benefits because we know that you know the terpenes are essentially vital in a lot of ways to certain benefits that people get and that maneuvering those are changing those slightly and the ratios can have an impact on how some people benefit from it so I think it'll be another way to produce products that reach different people and have different benefits potential from a consumers perspective if I'm you know standing in a in a you know facility if I'm or not you know a retail establishment and I'm looking to and there's a bunch of different products there in front of me how do I know is it always labeled which extraction method is used or known to the consumer yeah that's where you're gonna have to and I know consumers do it all day every day I know well at least I do if I'm in a store and I see something new and it interests me I'll pull up Google and I'll look at look at it really quickly that's that's the only way that they're gonna be able to know what extraction method is used there's so many other required parts that are needed on the label that you know some companies are doing and some companies aren't anyway but I think when it comes to extraction and how its produced even that with the lab results you're gonna have to go to the website mm-hmm Maurice sure-sure well if someone wanted to find out a little bit more about your products about your company where would where would they go where would they find that absolutely go to our website bluegrass hemp oil calm check us out on Facebook and on Instagram as

stabilization reaction it's our requestoralization filtering reactor thank you so much", "cZjkY2GdW10": "what is the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil we get so many different questions like what is the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil and does hemp oil contains CBD oil these phrases describe different products so if you're asking questions like this make sure you watch this video so that you can learn the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil both CBD oil and hemp oil are unique products that benefit our health but do serve in different ways traditionally they come from many different parts of the cannabis plant and therefore have different uses and benefits with the CBD trend it has become more difficult to identify the true uses of CBD oil and hemp oil as many of these CBD companies have used the term hemp oil to market their products this definitely can complicate the space when it comes to the difference between CBD oil and hemp oil however most companies don't mean to complicate the market but rather companies have chosen to use the term hemp oil as opposed to CBD oil to avoid problems with the FDA as a tip if a company does market their CBD oil as hemp oil look for terms like CBD cannabinoids or hemp extract in other areas on the label this means the products contain CBD [Music] given this confusion we think it's absolutely essential to educate consumers on the differences between CBD and hemp oil the main active ingredient in CBD oil is of course CBD this compound is popular in the holistic wellness community its main role is to regulate our endocannabinoid system which is responsible for maintaining proper internal balance although more research needs to be done there is some professional support for CBDs usefulness in helping to curb stress to provide joint muscular and neurological relief and to support better sleep on the other hand what we historically know as hemp oil now more commonly referred to as hemp seed oil does not contain any cannabinoids like CBD but instead is a rich blend of nutrients including a high concentration of protein polyunsaturated acids and vitamin E it is also one of the few oils to contain both omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids which are recognized as essential to the human diet these desirable but rare fatty acids are found in a ratio that is thought to be optimal according to some nutritionists the high vitamin E content of hemp oil is another beneficial attribute vitamin E is an antioxidant which helps to protect your cells from free radicals its impact on the skin make it a staple in the cosmetic world so how do you saw CBD oil verse hemp oil CBD oil and hemp oil come from different parts of the cannabis plant CBD oil uses the whole plant while hemp oil comes from its seeds more recently because of the growing CBD market hemp oil derived from the seed of the plant is now more commonly referred to as hemp seed oil CBD oil is made from a variety of parts of the mature hemp plant including its stalks and flowers in order to get CBD and other compounds from the plant they must be separated in a process called extraction most reputable producers use ethanol extraction or the co2 extraction process because neither involved the use of any toxic compounds during extraction useful parts of the hemp plant are usually pelletized and then a solvent like ethanol or gases like co2 are used to pull out the CBD and other vital nutrients the result is an oil with a high CBD content after this it is rigorously tested to make sure that there are no unwanted substances and the level of essential compounds is where it needs to be hemp oil on the other hand now refer to as hemp seed oil is made only from the hemp seeds and is created by a process called cold pressing this is similar to the creation of other carrier oils like sunflower seed oil or jojoba oil this method is used to help preserve all the raw nutritious contents of the seeds the hemp seeds which contain up to 50% their weight in oil Eydie shelled chilled and squeezed for their content the product is an unrefined green colored substance one of the main differences between CBD oil and the hemp oil is that hemp seed oil is usually made using the seeds of industrial hemp plants and does not contain any CBD or other cannabinoids like THC [Music] so what are they uses between CBD oil and hemp oil CBD oil is mainly used in the holistic or alternative wellness space to help balance the body's internal systems while hemp oil now considered hemp seed oil is mainly used in food and skincare products hemp derived CBD oil has high CBD content and low THC content below 0.3 percent this makes it great for harnessing potentially therapeutic properties of CBD without any of the high or mind-altering effects of THC many proponents claim that it can be helpful with a number of chronic conditions such as anxiety and epilepsy some athletes also use it to support exercise induced inflammation and recovery CBD oil is also said to be effective as a sleep aid today it can be found already in a variety of forms such as capsules tinctures and topicals as scientists continue to study the impact of CBD we can expect even wider applications in the future hemp oil on the other hand when derived from the seed of the plant has become a hit in the kitchen that is because of its high nutritious value it's been on the shelves of health food stores for quite some time now and is considered a superfood by many you can find it being used in smoothies and even as a nutritious substitute for olive oil additionally hemp oil is used extensively in the cosmetic industry it's a key ingredient in products such as shampoos conditioners lotions soap as it's fatty acid content helps to protect our skin and preserve moisture you can also find hemp oil included in some paints plastics and lubricants as a substitute for petroleum-based oil thanks for watching and if you'd like

[Music]", "L07CrGTzWlU": "hey guys it's Nick from precision here I'm super excited to show you our new a se 100 ethanol evaporator the first thing I'm gonna do is walk you through some of the features and the process flow of how it works so basically what this is is this is a multi solvent evaporator this will work with both ethanol and high boiling point solvents in certain parameters right and we can give you the technical specification on all the solvents that it would work with what we're doing here is we're sucking it into a recirculating circuit so with other designs of other evaporators what you're gonna see on a falling film evaporator for instance the ethanol is going to come in the top and it's going to come down a heat exchanger now the reason that that's not great is because you're getting instantaneous vaporization in most cases of your ethanol and what that leads to is it leads to sugaring in your heat exchangers so you see a lot of these products that are on the market it's a flawed design because when you when you hit it with that instantaneous heat that sugaring causes that heat exchanger to gum up and those are all sorts of compounds in the plants and specifically lipids and phosphides that do that so in order for those units to work very efficiently it's almost essential that you have a D wax and alipin ization minimally before you pass through your evaporator which kind of defeats the purpose now our design is different in the fact that your input is here and on the other end of this hose is the actual input that you would put into your micelle a tank with ethanol in it and would actually be sucked in by a class one division one mag driven pump these are extremely reliable ul listed Baldor drive motors excellent pump is sucked in and it's pushed into a loop here now you can see on this unit it is heated with a electrical heating element now the difference is most units on the market are heated with the steam based element this allows more precise control of the evaporation temperature in the evaporation point as opposed to just blasting steam in to your heat exchanger now the reason that that's relevant is you don't have to have a steam boiler and you don't have to have additional infrastructure this unit as you can see it's actually a single whip that's pulled out of here and it's wired into a single outlet on a electrical connection rather than having all the other infrastructure that you have to integrate to make this machine work so the the ethanol or the solvent is passed through this loop here now you're gonna see a loop that's going to come down here it's going to go past this heater it's going to be recycled and it's gonna go up through here and pass through a centrifugal style separator and this is what this is this is a separator so you're actually creating a vortex in here and your ethanol vapor is coming up and it's being rican densed on this side this is obviously your heat exchanger for your cold side which is going to reconvince that vapor once it travels that path you can monitor your temperature and all your parameters there and eventually you're going to work yourself down to a crude oil that is refined and the refined crude oil that comes out of this has been consistently testing at about 1.4 percent residual ethanol which is fantastic right it's much better than the performance of all the other machines on the market which makes our machine incredibly unique and the design allows for no CIP to have to take place design allows for adjustment and safety parameters and it allows for multi solvent evaporation which is excellent continuing to walk through the process flow what's going to happen is as you're evaporating your ethanol your ethanol is going to collect on this side which you can see that you can monitor your levels you have multiple sight glasses to see the viscosity of your crude oil as well as the amount of ethanol that is collecting your ethanol discharges right here so you can have your clean ethanol going into a collection vessel or a tote to go back into cold storage or wherever you're going to put it your discharge for your my Sela or your crude oil is right here and that completes the system now that we've covered the process flow of how the machine works let's look at some of the unique features on this machine that make it truly a very valuable product to have for your labs so the first thing we like to feature is 100% of this machine is all american-made this is made right here in Detroit with our vendor partners and our manufacturing partners so when you look at even the quality of the steel the quality of the weld emits the Baldor pumps all the fittings the gauges everything is a hundred percent domestic as well as all of our PLC controls obviously you can see this is Allen Bradley PLC very high quality even the housing the box we've really focused on taking a higher step towards integration of a domestic based supply chain with some of our higher-end products the second thing that I'd like to talk about is this apparatus is entirely class 1 division 1 now you can see unlike most units there is a separate PLC control from the actual operation of the unit we're going to talk about that now NFPA 38 has kind of changed the laws when it comes to ethanol and solvent based evaporation and extraction and they're moving quickly towards a class 1 division 1 designation for large cannabis style operations right and this will quickly apply to happen to other jurisdictions so this unit and these pumps and the electrical conduit and all the features thereof are all class 1 division 1 and what happens is this PLC control actually is mounted outside of the room so you can see here that we have a whip and we provide a whip so similar to piping your process heaters and chillers outside of a room as you would with a hydrocarbon or ethanol extractor because they're not classified the same holds true for this so how we control the actual unit is through a class 1 division 1 tablet so if you imagine that I'm an operator I'm able to control the speed of my motors my pumps I'm more able to see all of my statistics I'm able to data log all those statistics those statistics are able to be mirrored to the Allen Bradley PLC and that's also able to be monitored by any third party in terms of logging into a cloud or having that on a computer in a separate room if the lab manager wants to know what's going on with his evaporation skid that can all be Romana turd motely which is a tremendous value in not only safety but being able to data log your optimization of your parameters and evaporation in addition to the abundance of controls that are on this unit and the high quality of manufacture we also have the option for both process water and chiller so the difference with the process water or the chiller is going to be optimally your cost of your water right so different jurisdictions are going to have not only different qualities of water in terms of hardness and things that could potentially calcify inside of your heat exchanger but they're also going to have different fee schedules for the water and it's really an optimization of how much money you're spending on buying a process chiller maybe that can be cheaper than you actually pumping process water through here yes it's a bit more capex upfront but you have to look at the long-term ROI and what's right for your business the great thing about this unit is it can run on both options in the form the performance is in no way affected whether you go with option A or option B thank you guys so much for watching I hope you enjoyed the overview on our ASC 100 multi solvent evaporator if you have any questions please give us a call shoot us an email our technical team is always happy to help you", "rTae4UVA-aU": "there hello gorgeous we are making medicine and the medicine that's been utilized is CBD and that's an agent that has been proven to help treat patients with intractable epilepsy CBD is a non psychoactive compound so by inhaling it or ingesting it or just in taking it into your body you're not going to have that psychoactive response to taking that medicine so our first step is we're gonna take the feedstock material from cultivation you dry it out and then we actually blend it down so it's in a workable form once it's in that state we go through an extraction at which point we're going to receive or capture a crude oil extract from that we go through a series of purification methods in order to concentrate it even further we're creating a tincture or a capsule or any other product you can imagine that it's going to be delighted to treat somebody cannabis is being utilized in a wide variety of applications and there's a lot of data out there that supports the efficacy to its use and so hopefully we see a national kind of revolution for the use in treatment using medical marijuana products", "T2NsFZDLVTo": "[Music] hi I'm Casey McGarvey and I'm from Delta separations and today primarily what I want to talk to you about is the popular and common forms of cannabis extracts so when designing a lab or designing your business it's crucial understand what your end goals and then products are primarily this is important because the different popular forms and extracts so or solvent studies ethanol co2 hydrocarbon water hash these are all have pros and cons to themselves but they produce widely different products better than each other so I'm going to go over a small list is of the most common and popular ones and this is by no way in no way an exhaustive list because there's an enormous amount of products it'll give you some idea the first one off the talked about is what used to be called alright soda and this is a very black thick sticky crude cannabis or ham extract now this for example as I said is a crude extract it's a whole spectrum extract so you want to solve it that's gonna grab a lot of different compounds and it's going to do so quickly at large scale for example and for that product in particular what we usually see are people using ethanol because it does grab your water soluble compounds as well as does is very high throughput it processes you automatically you know even one batch and for that matter I have a couple of examples of some of these products here this is CBD distance and this is CB isolate so THC and CBD distillate are very perhaps even the most common cannabis product out on the market right now and similarly because these are really high potent products meaning they have a high amount of the cannabinoids CBD or THC by weight the primary solvent you want for these is a solvent that is hight ruthless and again this comes back to that so are so crude extracts distillate isolate these are all examples of and the products that are most suitable for asthma and of course I will mention that the other extracts the extraction procedures like hydrocarbon co2 they conclude with these as well but again there's pros and cons to each one and ethanol overwhelmingly seems to be the winner in that apartment so about co2 and hydrocarbons really where co2 and hydrocarbon both shine are the extraction of terpenes so here I have an example of really light molecular wave chirping so what most people would term essential oils co2 100 carbons can extract these terpenes as well but also the more heavy molecular weight terpenes for hydrocarbon really the main benefit and its most common products are terpenes and what in the form of sauce and crystallized or isolated THC a and this comes in the form of diamonds and sometimes those sauce and the Diamonds we mixed together and hydrocarbon is overwhelmingly that best for those products primarily because it's good at extracting terpenes and because with using mixtures and blends of different hydrocarbons you can get different mixtures and blends of different fats and lipids and terpenes and cannabinoids that create all these different types of damnable products like butters and waxes and these type of things co2 that co2 is very good at it's very selective so basically what that means is it is very good at extracting a there certain specific compounds so what we most often see co2 use for is fake pen manufacturing and this is being a high quality vape pen manufacturing this is primarily because the co2 machines can use subcritical co2 to pull off a very nice band of terpenes and can produce and can use supercritical fluid to extract the cannabinoids as well so if you have a co2 system with a national system usually you're producing distillate and that those terpenes are extracted through co2 system then get added into that distillate and that was what is the big thing the big cartridge are manufactured with so again we talked about RSO which is kind of a crude ethanol extract we have distillate isolate and then we talked about the different mixtures of Turkey and cannabinoid extract those that involve full-spectrum pans and these type of things as well as butters and waxes that we see from hydrocarbons so in summary it's it's obviously very important to crucially understand if you would like to produce this or isolate or terpenes and for that matter what market you're looking to target because they each have different markets and depending on what market you're looking to target why and the product you're looking to produce that is really what's going to fundamentally determine what extraction", "R0QvVfe6pNM": "there hello gorgeous we are making medicine and the medicine that's been utilized is CBD and that's an agent that has been proven to help treat patients with intractable epilepsy CBD is a non psychoactive

so hopefully we see a national kind of revolution for the use of treatment using medical marijuana products", "113V95Hf8gw": "ok so now we're going to look at rotary evaporation so we've got this solvent and we've got our compound in solvent and we need to get rid of the solvent so we use a rotary evaporator such as one of these and we're gonna place our sample in this flask flask goes on this end here and it'll be clipped and essentially what we have is a distillation setup so we have the flask here we use the water bath to raise the temperature and then we have the vacuum over here we have a condenser here to call the solvent that's coming off which will then be collected in this trap here over here at this point we have a tap which allows us to bleed air into the system so in order to set it up first thing we're going to do is make sure we switch it on and here we can then set the temperature essentially for most organic solvents we're gonna 140 degrees will do very nicely and then we're going to turn on the cooling water so it doesn't want to be too fast running through system you do want to make sure that the receiver flask is empty should have been emptied by the last person just check that because the last thing you want is to if your comp accidentally bumps and is pulled up over into this flask you don't want to be contaminated with anything anyone else has been using so we're going to pour our compound into the flask and then we're gonna carefully clip the Platts flask in place okay be particularly careful with heavy solvent such DCM because they are very dense and that can cause this to fall down so we're gonna make sure that this tap here is open and then follow the vacuum through round and we're going to turn on the vacuum and now we're going to start to rotate the flask and we're going to turn it till it's about two-thirds of one o'clock position keeping our hand underneath here just to make sure it can very tape gently against that it's not going to fall in and then we start close the tap so we turn that tap so it's closing and keep an eye on that solvent so we can see it's starting to evaporate so this is dichloromethane which has a very low boiling point anyway it's a boiling point four to five because it doesn't take much and now you can see we've got the tap closed this is rotating it's bubbling away nicely and you can see on the glass this condensation starting to form from evaporation once that's going like that we then slowly use this to lower the flats just so what a portion now is in the water bath you don't need the whole flask in the water bath just that better and we see it starting to evaporate we can turn up the speed the reason why we're rotating the flask is to ensure that increases the surface area as the solids rotated and flung out by centripetal force around the sides of the flask and it also means that as its evaporating it also stops it from boiling and bumping and that's when essentially it jumps from this side over to here because the vacuums built up and the solvent explosively evaporates very quickly so we're going to leave that to evaporate nicely there laughs racing away okay so we've got to the end of our evaporation you'll now see that thinks all the solvent is evaporated everything's gone slow that down stop and then we're gonna raise it up out of the bath next thing to do this is to open this tap company selecting vacuum off what tonight games off we then unclip remove and then you'll want to keep the flask or wipe with some b-roll in order you have to dry fast one very important thing to remember is that if you are preparing sample is to weigh the flask before you put anything into it and that means you can weigh the flask in afterwards no wait and you can get the way to the solid that's in your flask final thing to do then is switch off switch off and then take your the reciever flask unscrew remove this and if there's any solvent in here there isn't in this case because DCM it's very low boiling and the house vacuum is very high it's a very good vacuum but it's to make sure you do empty anything that you've collected in the receiver flask negative here this back on tighten the screw and there we go got your compound", "_-Ndkxw6rY4": "okay to give you a representation of the product streams yesterday we ran at 360 pounds an hour through a vincent screw press what comes out of the screw press looks like this this is all the waxes solids fats lipids chlorophyll plus all that ethanol and your cannabinoids when it settles it looks like this you've got about 10 suspended plant material and this is all your ethanol cannabinoids chlorophyll waxes fats just all that other stuff that you want to get out from there we have an inline filtration process where we pull all of that out as well as going into an inline winterization skid we do not winterize in the traditional sense we are winterizing in line through a thin film application high surface area extreme temperature shifts so with that we get this this is a winterized solution from there we go through decoloring which just carbon filter to take out the chlorophyll and we end up with this right here this is about 97 98 ethanol two to three percent cannabinoids there we'll go into our ethanol recovery skid and then decarboxylation to accrued this is a five hour process to go from biomass to a fully dewaxed decarb winterized crude oil you", "dE_0lI-853Y": "all right so we're gonna talk about CBD versus hemp oil there's a lot of confusion around there if you haven't been studying it lately and I'm sure like if you just started looking you're saying hey you're seeing CBD oil for this amount of money and then you're seeing hemp oil for something a lot a lot less I mean the price is astronomically less I mean you know it could be a tenth or twentieth hemp oil could be a tenth or twentieth of what CBD costs for the same amount and why is that you know why why is that so anyway we're going to talk about CBD oil and hemp oils CBD oil comes from the aerial part of the plan it's the stalk the stems stalk the leaves and the flowers and then hemp oil comes from the seeds alright and there are differences you know and so the CBD oil obviously contains CBD but it contains whatever it's extracted it contains all the cannabinoids the Terrapins the flavonoids the fatty acids it just contains everything when it gets extracted and then hemp oil man it contains proteins vitamins it contains omega-3 and sex fatty acids and it contains a lot of vitamin E that's why you'll see like a lot of skin products and stuff like that and so those are the differences of where they come from and what they contain and so we'll talk about how they're processed so at least see it we're talk about how CBD is processed so the plant grows it usually grows for like 120 days or so and it gets a flower on it and then they they just decide they've cut it off as low to the ground as possible and they let it dry in the field for some time and that they they soak the stalks and they kind of loose them up and then they have to mechanically separated the stalks and all the fibers and stuff and then they put in a vat and then it comes to either using co2 action methods or we're going to talk about your other extraction but about ethanol okay and so you can either use co2 or ethanol at least in this conversation and we're going to talk about the differences of those so co2 is a gas and it's a doesn't really react with many many chemicals and stuff but you when you put in a vat and you pressurize it with the with the stocks and the leaves and the flowers and that kind of stuff then the oils come out and the problem with co2 is it doesn't get as many oils it doesn't have that they call it a full profile and it doesn't that doesn't work doesn't also compare to ethanol and doesn't get this full of a profile out and then when you use ethanol it puts it under pressure and that stuff soaks in there and then they take it and then they heat it up and then the ethanol starts to evaporate what you're left is with CBD oil and so it has a fuller profile so it has more of the stuff that's in the hemp plant is extracted and there's also probably some ethanol left in there but ethanol is generally considered safe by the FDA to consume and the problem you know and then co2 is generally more expensive than ethanol is and ethanol cost less for the extraction it's also more dangerous you know when you have such a high you have such a high proof of alcohol you know the the fire catching on fire igniting whatever you want to call it is is a present danger all the time so you have to be more careful in the equipment has to be you know a little different and account for that so then whenever it's all soaked and they drive off the ethanol it's all recycled and they use it again to use for more plants so those are the differences and we use Lazarus Naturals we sell a tzer's Naturals here at the dog Emporium at 118 Main Street in new Eagle it's seven two four two five eight paws at seven two nine seven or you can find us at sit-up doggy calm and that's why we use Lazarus naturals we used the leads to sell somebody else's stuff and they were probably about twice as much they were co2 extracted and the other part is whenever you take a co2 compared to an ethanol extracted one the co2 is a little bit milder whenever you know you taste it if it doesn't have any flavorings and it compared to ethanol and ethanol just gives you that fuller flavor and it you know I used to tell people it's like beer man you got to just develop a taste for it and you'll get used to it you know even though it is a more robust flavor compared to co2 extraction and they're usually in Si and co2 is usually a little bit lighter in color than the ethanol extraction but hey you know color you can't really go by color so if you have to go by what's in it and so that's why third-party testing is a good idea you get to see what's in it you get to see if there's pesticides heavy metals you get the full profile of it of all the cannabinoids that they test for so you know you can always give us a call if you have any questions you can go to sit up doggie comm and email us from there and or be more than glad to help you and answer any questions you have and don't forget shipping is always free for all the CBD products we have including the CBD infused dog treats that we make ourselves so hey have a great day and thanks a lot for listening", "2kFrndQGKWw": "everyone is trolley with AC guys and we are at the final stage of our installation of the ventilation equipment for the CBD extraction booth and before we even get started on moving forward in the video I just want to point out because this won't get much attention for the rest of the video but this is probably the most important piece as far as a safety element that this entire booth will have and so inside of this canister here is the ethanol sensor it's an infrared sensor it is a very precise and very sensitive sensor it detects ethanol or whatever gas we set this sensor to so that it can detect I believe it's down to 20 parts per billion of particulate so this piece right here is temporary this is only gonna be used right now once we get this powered up we will use this to calibrate the sensor we will use a methane mixed with oxygen and nitrogen and the combination of the three is very precise and gives the same properties as if they were ethanol being sensed so but once this is operational this bottom piece will be removed so I'm gonna go ahead and start to play this which is a little different from most of our videos we mostly just kind of scroll through and stop and give some some feedback on what we're doing so I'm gonna go ahead and kind of play some of this you can see the inside here so right now I'm pulling off a display you can see that has its own control board which is and wired in to this next piece and I'm gonna actually stop it here and on this board here this is the relay board this board provides no power however it does allow current to flow through it so these three black boxes here are actually relays and we can set these in a normally open or a normally closed position and if you think about normally open or normally closed if you think about a light switch when the light switch is turned off that would be normally open because it does not allow the electricity to flow through it and when the light switch is on that would be what we call a normally closed position because it closes or connects the connection inside and now electricity to flow through to the light so that's what this is you can see that we've removed two of the sets of wires and plug those will not be used if at a later time the customer wants to add any sort of emergency lighting or whatever it may be doesn't matter we can still use those relays for that purpose so gonna go ahead and forward through this and you'll see the next board and actually I think I'll probably fast forward through this and spare you from having to watch me the wrong way so let's go the other way and you'll see just different here here's still another view of where the ethanol sensor actually sits sits in here in this canister and again is a very delicate and precise instrument so as we keep going through I'm now going to pull off this relay board and if you remember in the previous videos if you watched it that relay board is basically just just like a switch and so now what we're gonna see is the main power board and you can see these three wires the red white and the black coming in here something that's unique to an in general to the to the HVAC industry as we mostly with alternating current or AC current which is similar to like a light socket in your house and on this instrument it's actually powered by DC current which is direct current and it's 24 volts so all this wiring that you see in here right now is temporary it was provided by the factory and actually let's do that again so this here these wires here this was installed at the factory for testing so that they can verify that the unit work before they shipped it out so that will be removed and we'll be installing our own control wiring and relay wiring so I'm gonna go ahead and let this play you get an idea there of how this works and then I'm gonna go ahead and stop this there so as I had mentioned these wires here that came from the factory we will remove and the electrician's have ran us power now for both our DC power DC wiring or DC power and our high voltage wire which will go up and control a contactor that will kick on the 17,000 CFM fan and put that into perspective house the biggest air conditioner you can have for a house provides 2,000 CFM so this fan basically moves the same amount of air as nine household air conditioner so moves a lot of air and we'll get probably into that in just a bit here so I'm gonna go ahead and move forward and I'm actually going to let the video from here kind of play out because this will give you an idea of how our team works and well this is a very serious job which all of them are but this one is a very delicate and [Music] potentially dangerous job as far as the application that it's being used in and so I'm going to hit play unless you guys listen to the auto audio and I'm just going to tell you beforehand the I have a bald spot and Tony who is one of our lead techs likes to give me a hard time for it and so he's taking the video for me right now he's going to move the camera from where it should be to the back of my head and then I'll end up turning around and realizing what he's doing and you'll kind of see the reaction and just get an idea of kind of the you know the teamwork and and the great group that we have here so I'm gonna go ahead and play this and be quiet for a second and let you watch alright so now we're on to the next phase which is actually bringing the control wires in that the electricians have brought to us and getting it actually into our sensor so let's go forward just a little bit and you're gonna see that there are two sets of wires there's one set here and a second set here one will be for the high voltage and then the other will be for the low voltage DC so I'm gonna go ahead and kind of play this for a second let you kind of see what's going into this you can see on the left side here just you know all the different components of the sensor and so Tony's gonna to get that through it's a pain in the butt because this wire is pretty stiff of pretty rigid so it takes a lot of patience to do this so I'm go ahead and bored through this and give you an idea and I may have just gone the wrong way I'm sorry about that I know there's a little dead spot there but I'm going the wrong way I may be smart but nobody's ever accused me of being a video agra fur or editor so Tony's gonna get this through and now you can see that he has it from this junction box right here and through the flex seal and actually into our sensor so I'm gonna go ahead and keep going with this let's put now the second set of wires through and now he's going to tighten it up and now we are essentially ready to wire in or land these wires basically so at this point in the video I've already landed the DC incoming voltage that powers this unit I'm now landing the high voltage to the relay which again is a normally open relay so just to kind of explain that when the incoming so we always have power coming in to this relay right here and then that's gonna pause this real quick so there's always power coming into it but until this sensor detects a specified amount of ethanol in this booth it will not allow the high voltage to go through that relay and go up to a contactor that will turn on our fan so I'm just gonna kind of fast-forward to this and then now you can see I'm putting on the display and then this last part as I'd mentioned before and it's actually the me back up a little bit actually now we'll just go so I'd mentioned before in another video about how fine that the threading is on this and how many turns it takes to get this cap on and again the purpose of that is because this is the explosion proof they want this seal as tight as possible so it's a very very tight airtight connection so I'm just glad let this play you'll also notice when you back up here just a second that you'll see that on the cover of this is glass and the purpose of that glass is so that if there is a spark inside of there or if the display itself were to short out that it would not allow a spark to occur in the booth itself where it could create the explosion hazard again but it would be it would happen inside of this case and therefore would not present any danger to anyone in the building or surrounding areas so gonna watch how many turns it takes all right and now what to that orange seal that I'd mentioned earlier and we're tight and now we've created an explosion-proof condition so I'm gonna forward through this here now and get us to the point so we're done down with the wiring and we're at the point now where we're getting ready to turn the sensor on for the first time which is exciting for us because it means we're at the end and this has been a long process it's been an exciting process and we're we're ready to fire this booth up so and I know our customer is excited because now they can open their doors for business and start generating some income so I'm gonna go ahead and let this play and I'm gonna let you kind of just listen to some commentary that happened on the job site and so we have an electrician working with us right now and obviously our own text and you can kind of hear you'll hear them saying you know 115 volts is on now 230 volts is on now and just to give you kind of a background on that this sensor or the the control for this sensor if you think about like a laptop computer you plug it into your outlet on the wall that's hundred fifteen volts but then it supplies at a different type of power source to your laptop this thing works the same way so when he says he's turned on 115 volts that means that he's basically plugging in the laptop cord to the wall and once he does that you'll see our screen will come on and then because of the way that this is wired and because it is such a sophisticated system one of our concerns was the fan kicking on when it wasn't supposed to so this was a great moment I was an exciting moment for us you won't hear anybody in here screaming or yelling but you can't kind of hear the conversation so I'm go ahead and let this play and in just a second here you will hear the electrician sing these providing power and there's our screen which is a great sign and just real quickly the unseen great sign is that the fan didn't kick on which you're gonna kind of hear here as far as conversation in a second alright so you just heard that so we're gonna move forward and this is now the fan and I just want to point out right away that this is a temporary fitting on this screen we only did this so that we can test the unit the this screen here that looks kind of like a thick chicken wire almost that will be permanent but to hold that up we will have a different a different oh my gosh it's going to be a different setup it'll be a cleaner look you won't see those ripples and it'll be more secure so we're and now at this point we're going to start this fan and something that I want you guys to notice is you'll see at the top of the video here at the top of your screen here where it's all black in there now when this fan starts up and again remember that this fan basically moves the same amount of air as nine household air conditioners so when this thing kicks on its going to open up there called backdraft dampers at the top and it's going to basically pull all the air from inside the booth to outside and let that vapor dissipate so I'm going to go ahead and play that you can watch it in real time and then some thing you'll see daylight okay that's that's daylight coming in from the roof and you saw up here and went from dark to light and it's kind of hard to see in the video but those dampers were because of the volume of air that this emergency purge fan is moving they are shaking quite a bit so now we're at the point of our installation of actually testing the constant volume fan the way that this system is set up is it has a constant volume fan which basically slowly removes ethanol from the air to keep it clean and our to keep the the ethanol levels low and if for some reason there was a spill or some sort of emergency in the booth then that secondary fan that we just watched would kick on so right here is our switch for the constant volume fan anytime the CBD extraction booth is in use this fan would be on and I'm going to go ahead and kind of give you a rundown of the entire process so the fan is on and the fan the constant volume fan which is a 3,000 CFM fan which again is still moving more air than your average well then every household air conditioner that air is being sucked up through there and I want to zoom in and show you that on this fan or in this grill right here there is a carbon filter and the purpose of that carbon filter because this is CBD extraction which comes from a hemp plant the hemp smells very similar to marijuana and so this carbon filter will remove that smell because all of this airs be invented to outside and so to eliminate the possibility of outside of this warehouse smelling you know giving off the aroma of marijuana that filter is put in a place so you can go ahead and play this and again you can see both fans here this is our emergency purge fan and this is going to be the constant volume fan and so what you're going to see next is because these fans are removing air from this room and this room is essentially airtight when the fans turned on we have dampers that will allow outside air to come in to replace the air the air that's being removed so I'm gonna head and play this and you're gonna see and I'm going to go ahead and pause this this is one of the dampers there's also the same size damper on the other side so when the fan turns on and creates a suction inside of the room it pulls that damper open and it allows air from the outside of the room to enter in so you can see right now it's barely open and you can see people on the outside the the noise levels on this are very quiet for for this fan and then I'm gonna go ahead and actually I'm just gonna let this play and I want you to watch so you can see where we got here and I went a little too far I'm actually gonna back up here apologize for this alright so I'm gonna go ahead and let this play from here and alright well I've definitely that part of the video cut off so now this is basically the the final test and this is going to show you how much air that emergency purge fan removes from inside the booth I'm standing outside of the booth right now and when that fan kicks on we're going to show you those dampers from the outside and you'll be able to see exactly how the system will work so I'm going to play this for a second and the fan is gonna kick on and watch right here you see that damper open so that's bringing in fresh air into the booth and it's not only to bring in fresh air so that the employees inside have air to breathe oxygen to breathe but what it does is because ethanol is heavier than oxygen the ethanol will sit lower towards the floor and so in our design of this booth or the ventilation for this booth what we did is is we strategically and purposely placed these dampers at the bottom so that as it sucks air from the outside of the booth it comes across the bottom of the room and then gets sucked up so it's clearing out that vapor almost immediately so I'm gonna go ahead and let this play kind of show you the other side the other damper is open as well and the same thing same effect as the air comes in from the bottom here it's gonna sweep through the bottom of the room remove all of the dangerous explosively potential vapor and it's going to suck it from the top of the fan and now we've set the fan down and you can see as the suction is eliminated that damper OTO closes so I hope you guys enjoyed the video we would be happy to come out for you if you are looking at doing anything with the CBD grow houses and just any of your HVAC and refrigeration needs in general", "PBWiZgrQ48A": "hello my name is Ryan from goalie scientific and today we are gonna be talking about winterization and dewaxing first let's begin with the definition pulled straight from wikipedia winterization of oil is a process of removing the higher melting point parts from oil like waxes or triglycerides by slowly cooling vegetable oils and felling saturated slides from the solvent used primarily for oils and salad dressings mainly applied in bio industry the most common oil that is winterized as a rice bran oil which has a high content of waxes fatty acids and lipids notice that it doesn't specify which solvent will be used it could be assumed that the initial solvent used to perform the extraction could also be used to precipitate out the waxes and higher melting point compounds typically the people that extract with hydrocarbons and supercooled those hydrocarbons to precipitate how the waxes would call that technique technique dewaxing while those that use a different solvent altogether like ethanol to achieve their dewaxing procedure would typically call it a winterization but the two are of the same thing and in fact if you wanted to call it the correct term it would probably be called freeze precipitation but the confusion is somewhat warranted the procedure may incorporate several different techniques but simply do waxing or winterization is simply the process of removing waxes but by removing something you're also purifying something and by removing the waxes you improve the viscosity stability or the shelf life so let's quickly summarize how the process is done first we start by using a solvent to completely dissolve the sample typically we would use ethanol and for the best results that's what that would be my suggestion it is crucially important that you completely dissolve the solvent there are a couple ways to speed up this process one would be to use heat a hotter solvent is going to be a more aggressive solvent the let the next would be to use agitation so hot plate stirrer would be ideal make sure you give enough time heat and agitation to completely dissolve the sample but if you want a visual indicator a quick test is to use a laser pointer to shine through the solution if a beam of light is found in the solution then keep heating and stirring it's not completely dissolved if however you shine the light through the solution and you don't see the beam in the solution at all then the solution is completely dissolved and you can go ahead and move on to the next step now it's time to allow it to cool and settle this is pretty easy just put it into a freezer and allow it to sit for an extended period of time at a low temperature the colder you have it the faster it works but too cold is possible so I would recommend to not allow it to cool below 50 Celsius I'm sorry negative 50 Celsius usually this would take 24 to 48 hours for a complete precipitation after that it's ready to move on to the filtering stage here you would use a filtration setup which typically consists of consists of a beautiful and filtration flask along with some filtration paper I would recommend quantitative a filter paper and the pore size would generally be around 20 for fast filtration and no smaller than 5 micron it's best to keep the whole process as fast as possible or as cold as possible that way you don't allow things to heat up and allow stuff to go back into solution and fall through the filter paper so how does this all work basically hotter solvents are more aggressive and dissolved more and colder solvents are less aggressive so think of the solvent will like a hand when the solvents hot it grabs a big handful as much as it could possibly hold on to but as a solvent cools down its grip loosens and now it's no longer able to hold as much now stuff falls out of the hands this analogy is exactly how it works your solvent at a warmer temperature completely dissolves your sample and then by cooling your solvent the solubility is decreased and the sample is precipitated out or in this case the waxes are precipitated out in general the heavier compounds tend to precipitate first and lighter compounds tend to precipitate last so in the chart over here to the right what you'll notice is the ethanol at roughly room temperature will be able to dissolve all the compounds below it so waxes cannabinoids flavonoids terpenes it could dissolve everything at room temperature however if you notice as the temperature starts to decrease the ethanol is no longer able to hold on as much and one of the first compounds that it tends to precipitate is the waxes but as stated earlier too cold can be detrimental so if you'll notice if you continue to go down like for instance below negative 50 some of your other compounds will tend to precipitate - such as cannabinoids possibly your flavonoids or even your terpenes at a certain point once you get so cold your ethanol will turn into a solid although cooling the solvent allows us to precipitate out most of the waxes we also employ a separation based on polarity to help us precipitate out the waxes even more thoroughly so what is polarity the common phrase in chemistry is like dissolves like so polar solvents want to dissolve polar compounds and likewise nonpolar solvents want to dissolve nonpolar compounds so by using a more polar solvent we could precipitate precipitate out more of the non polar compounds polar molecules are asymmetrical in shape and have a net charge this tends to force them to group together with other polar compound and therefore exclude out the nonpolar compounds it's important to keep in mind that polarity is not a discrete measure it isn't absolute things are not just simply polar or nonpolar there's a lot of gray area for example a compound might be smacked out right in the middle between nonpolar and polar and it might be difficult to classify it another interesting examples in motions and soaps these compounds tend to have a polar end and a nonpolar end and because of this they could essentially dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds this is why soap tends to work so good because the water is polar but the oils and greases on her hands are nonpolar the soap unifies these two compounds and helps wash them away another separation technique is to swing the polarity if there's a range of solvents that could be used to dissolve your sample you first start with the most polar or nonpolar solvent then you do your extraction your solvent recovery etc then you read dissolve your sample in the opposite end so if you started with a non-polar solution that you extracted with you would recover all your solvent and everything use a polar solvent to reduce all your sample in it by using two opposite ends of the polarity spectrum you shake off the compounds on the most extreme ends so for instance if you were to use heptane for your initial extraction you would likely pick up everything dissolve everything cannabinoid acids flavonoids cannabinoids carotenes and waxes then when you swing over to your ethanol you're more polar solution you're gonna drop out your waxes but since you originally used heptane in the beginning you won't have any chlorophylls the same process could be done in Reverse so if you start out with ethanol you're more polar solution you're more likely to have more polar compounds like chlorophyll but when you swing them over to are more nonpolar solvent you're likely to lose the chlorophylls polarity should probably also not be underestimated small differences in polarity could have a Jurassic effect feel free to explore or discuss the eatest topics below you can also comment on this video or send emails any time and I'll try my best to respond to them as quickly as possible so as stated earlier temperature swings will cause precipitation so you could always magnify that effect by swing and an even greater so if you start with a hot solvent and then cool it down very cold you could use a lot less solvent a hot solvent can be anywhere from 10 to a thousand times greater effect same thing for polarity swings you could also have a much greater polarity swing and there have therefore have a more defined separation settling is also important allowing more time and reducing the agitation is crucial by reducing the amount of agitation you not only allow faster coagulation but the coagulation also tends to be bigger and more clumped together and this tends to reduce the filtration time needed another idea that we didn't touch on at all is pH if you alter the pH you will also alter the solubility which is the same effect we use to precipitate out other compounds by altering solubility that is so we've used temperature and polarity to alter solubility but we didn't use the pH at all so it stands that we can have a third hole another tool in our Arsenal to use to precipitate out other compounds even more thoroughly another thing to consider is time if you allow enough time and allow enough or a lack of agitation precipitation will occur even at room temperature so you don't have to actually cool it but it definitely speeds things up it'll probably take at least a week for stuff to precipitate out in any kind of substantial amount and to completely precipitate might take a month or more but it's definitely worth pursuing because significant expenses allocated to the chillers or freezers needed for the winterization process occur at a very low temperature so if you could do that and elevate a temperature you could save yourself a lot of money and a lot of headache okay

is the easiest way of removing our minimising chlorophyll from an extract okay great question for those who don't know chlorophyll is essentially the solar panel of the plant that's what facilitates photosynthesis which is converting light energy into carbohydrates or plant energy so chlorophyll is good for you it's you know the reason it's important to eat your leafy greens if the reason wheatgrass juice is good it's you know there's nothing wrong chlorophyll but if you're making a cannabis extract you're trying to remove all the non medicinal properties really you're focusing on cannabinoids and so typically the chlorophyll is something you want to you want to avoid in the concentrate now the easiest thing to do is not get it in there in the first place and if for instance if you're doing in ethanol extraction the longer you leave the plant material in the ethanol the more chlorophyll is going to be removed the cannabinoids the oils come out quite easily and you know inside of an hour or two you can get virtually all of it out of there but if you leave the if you leave the plant material in there for say a month or two it's gonna turn a deep green and that's what's called junkie now to solvent but it's basically filling the solvent up with plant material that you didn't want so you know the they call it a rough cut to just do a you know a fairly quick dip I know people that just simply dump the plant in ethanol shirred around for a second and pull it out and that gets in most of the cannabinoids that there's ethanol has a very quick permeation rate so you don't need to leave it in there for too long now once you've already jumped out this all that once you've already put more chlorophyll in there than you want there are some tricks for removing it one of them is called watching a solvent or scrubbing the solvent and so if you say if you first done this an ethanol and then you boil off the ethanol so you have this like really deep green oil that's not too much chlorophyll in it you can use one of the solvents that that doesn't mix well with water and hexane is a good example of this so if you then dissolve the oil in hexane and then mix that hexane with water say 50% saturated hexane 50% water and shake that up the chlorophyll wants to mix into the water or whereas the cannabinoids stay in the hexane and then you can use a secretory funnel and just you know drain off all the water with some of the chlorophyll in it and you know you might repeat that several times until you've reached a desired level of clarity but that's that's a neat trick for getting rid of it there's there's a bunch of other tricks though too if you go online you'll find a ton of them there's there's certainly please like bentonite clay that chlorophyll is attracted to if you look at activated bentonite clay under a microscope it's got these little grooves in it that are a perfect fit for chlorophyll molecules and if you just suspend some bentonite clay into your oil the stirred it around the chlorophyll sticks to that and then you can strain it out and that's you know that's another neat trick for removing it and there's other ones too there's a lot of them but yeah in most cases you don't need to remove the chlorophyll it's not going to do any harm there are certain applications like dabbing where people try to get rid of everything that can combust and for those applications you really want to get it as little chlorophyll in there as possible", "JgIbJpZnVdA": "welcome to American cannabis hosted by our sponsor cannabis tech I'm your host endlessness I want to thank everyone for tuning in today today we will be speaking with dr. alexei peshkov ski from industrial sono mechanics about nano emulsification and ultrasonic extraction dr. peshkov ski thank you for tuning in today how are you doing very good thanks for having me so this is a very exciting topic I don't know a whole lot about ultrasonic extraction and nano emulsification so I'm excited to explore this topic today with you in our audience and so I want to give a little bit brief background here on Alexei before we get started Alexei is a co-founder and president of industrial some of makutano mechanics and it really handles the direction and focus of where the company is going he has a BA in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania has a PhD in physical chemistry from Columbia University yes 15 years of experience as a manager investigator and product developer in both applica Demick and industrial sectors nearly focusing on industrial instrumentation design and applications development it has written over 30 scientific papers patents presentations as well as two books so welcome thanks for tuning in today if you could Alexi please give us an overview of industrial sono mechanics as core technology and main applications sure industrial sorry mechanics was organized about twelve years ago by my father Sergei Pavelski and myself to commercialize the invention of what we call the Bardot foreign ultrasonic technology this technology was created by my father who was an ultrasound physicist essentially all his life in the Soviet Union and we patented it and commercialized in 2004 our company for me in 2006 what this technology does is it allows you to take a lab scale ultrasonic experiment which is conducted at a high ultrasonic amplitude the amplitude is the displacement of the tip of the horn that relates directly to the intensity of ultrasound that is produced in the liquid I'll play this video again so what we can do with bottle horn efficient technologies take that increase the size of the horn making it industrial and retain the same high amplitude this is essential for scaling up and this is something that hasn't been possible before this technology was introduced with this one can simply take any lab scale experiment of which there are many published and take it straight to the industrial scale the high amplitude is produced by the horn in the liquid creates what's called acoustic cavitation this is the white cloud you see under the tip of the horn and above the horn this cloud is a very high shear field it it is composed of imploding vacuum bubbles that create micro Jets that hit particles and break them up so what this technology is particularly good for is making nanoparticles we offer ultrasonic processors such as the one which is displayed that are used in a wide variety of applications from pharmaceutical to biofuels to beverages cosmetic we work with petroleum companies for a while so this is a set of industries that we service we try to mainly focus on the pharmaceutical beverage in cosmetic industries what we offer are these types of processors this is a typical bench scale so medium scale ultrasonic processor that we offer and the way that it functions is outlined in the schematic where the liquid goes into this storage tank on the right it could be a large amount of liquid for a large processor it is pumped from the bottom of the tank into the reactor chamber which is this part right in the middle flow cell with the barbell horn that's inserted into it where you create a very high cavitation intensity that's where the process occurs then it's pumped back into the tank and is recirculated continuously until the process is finished the porns the barbell horn is driven by a transducer that's right above it and transducer is driven by the ultrasonic generator which conditions the electrical signal and gives us control over the process yeah so this about the summary how did you how did you realize there's an opportunity for your technology to be used in the cannabis industry um yeah so our equipment is mainly designed for the pharmaceutical industry and this is because it's particularly good at making nanoparticles the pharmaceutical industry suffers from an important issue problem they most of the time to deliver a hydrophobic or water hating substance active pharmaceutical ingredient to a bloodstream the bloodstream being mostly water so it's problematic to deliver an oil type material that doesn't dissolve in water into essentially water um but they used to do this up to about 20 maybe 15 years ago about 15 years ago they used to do it by a process called micro emulsification for that process what you do is you supply an enormous amount of surfactants which are basically types of soap to the water making it very loaded with these soapy molecules which essentially soluble eyes oil-based substances into themselves and in that way kind of make them water compatible water soluble if you will ah then they can be administered into the bloodstream by injection or in some other way and they stay are dispersed through the bloodstream and then we can travel with it and get delivered to the appropriate organs the problem with this approach is that there is a tremendous amount of surface active materials soaps and this is not something you want in your bloodstream but there was just no other way to do it and about 15 years ago the concept of nano emulsions came into play where instead of relying on the chemistry of the surfactants you instead apply mechanical shear so instead of waiting for surfactants chemically to break up the oil into tiny droplets you simply break them off by physical force which means in the end product there's a lot less of any foreign chemicals there still needs to be some surfactant but first of all they can be milder the choice their options for what surfactants you can use for that is incredibly broad much much broader than with my promotions so you can always choose very mild and natural order biocompatible surfactants and their amount is much lower and this is essentially what our equipment is designed for for making nano emulsions in some cases where we have the pharmaceutical ingredient doesn't dissolve in anything and there are situations like that they won't dissolve in any type of solvent or oil in that case we provide equipment to make nano crystals so you just take the material in the crystalline form and break them up into nanoparticles deliver them that way I like 900 molecular got it even yeah sure I like the real quick oh I don't mean interrupt that a question real quick on someone's asking if the tech if it needs if your technology requires surfactants or not but with the way your system is set up and I was a question that just came in yep yes it does but a lot less than micro nullification and as I said the choice of surfactants is much broader so so they can be much milder or very biocompatible generally regarded as safe even natural in many cases but yes there is some amount that's always required in general to make nano emulsions the amount of surfactant will be less than the amount of oil that you're putting in even to make translucent animals we'll get to those in in a few minutes with micro motions you need five to ten times more surfactant than the you're emulsifying so it's a big difference and the choice is limited about the very strong strong ones so uh yeah and I'm going forward feel free to interrupt me anytime with questions say I much prefer to answer questions right away um overcoming it with you I'm sorry go ahead yeah no I was just going to continue but but sure is there another question I've got a well they're coming being flooded so I'd like to see give us in with easy so someone says here that they are working with one of your machines to emulsify cannabinoids how could we encapsulate the finished liquid so it is stable in the capsule so far all attempts have melted the cap I see I think this question is better left for later because some alert will be answered during the talk but I will address it sure um so coming back up so most of the time our equipment was used for making nano emulsions nano crystals is a not as frequent for the pharmaceutical industry ah but then about two years ago the cannabis industry just exploded with the exact same need there's a hydrophobic water incompatible oily substance which is cannabis extract could be THC TVD whatever or CBD isolate it's solid but it's a type of oil anyway it's just solid it's an oil soluble substance so the same need to deliver that substance to the water based bloodstream and it just happened that we're ready with the equipment it was designed for this exact purpose so if two years ago we almost did nothing with again with some history for the past few years and especially for the past year I would say it's about 80 percent maybe more at this point of what we do Wow so that's really really become a major part of your business as I was like yeah we got lucky haha that's pretty exciting I have a question here from a gentleman do you recommend a dual phase systems like lecithin or a cellular soluble up came pronounce that soluble Iser soluble Iser is something that's used in the micro emulsification process it's a term where you use a surfactant and a lot of it and make oils kind of soluble solubilized in the water phase I don't recommend doing that if making a matter motion is an option and that's because amount of surfactant again would be much higher if you soluble eyes with it and the choice is limited to very harsh ones now what was the question possible lipids lecithin yes exact order that fashion yeah that's a lecithin is a good service and this it's natural it's very effective the only issue with it is that less offense used directly will most of the time form ribosomes not matter emulsions and that's a different system ribosomes are not meant to incorporate oils they incorporate water soluble substances in their core they have an oily a dual layer sort of a bilayer of phospholipids for example coming from lecithin and then water also on the outside you could incorporate some oil into there by layer in to the skin of it but the loading factor is much lower so lecithin is great but you just need to be careful about what type of phospholipids have contains and it may need to be combined very different surfactant but it as part of the formulation in soon it's a good it's a non-toxic very effective surfactant okay here's another cool how does the crystallization process work with with this equipment man emulsification you probably mean how to make nano emulsions yes yeah so you know emotions and it's exciting because we just talked about liposomes so but the difference between liposomes and nano emotions I don't have a slide on a liposomes but I can talk about the difference and this is a slide showing very roughly the schematic of nano emotions so how to make nano emotions or how to make cannabinoids water-soluble or water compatible I try not to use the word word soluble because I'm trying to the chemist and so rigorously that wouldn't be correct although it is very close to being correct for most intents and purposes it Nano emulsions especially translucent nano emulsions look like resolution they behave very close to a solution so perhaps water soluble is not entirely wrong but it's if you're going to be very rigorous it's it's a colloidal suspension it's not a solution the ocean would be when something breaks down to individual molecules these are very small droplets but still not individual molecules so a matter amalgam looks like this it has water as a continuous base on the outside it has oil which is easy yellow drops as a dispersed phase and if you look at each droplet it has this surfactant covering its surface now surfactant is type of agent that is hydrophobic on one and hydrophobic is water hating or or loving lipophilic sometimes also called and that's represented by this little tail that's sticking into the yellow interior of the trumpet so this part likes the way when it dissolves in oil the other side of the head of the surfactant is this whole kind of dark blue looking kind of like a little oval that's surrounds the entire surface of the droplet so these are water-loving or hydrophilic and they're in contact with the water so the water the droplet looks like a perfectly welcome entity it has water loving surface to the oil looking at the droplet from the inside it looks like a perfectly oil compatible substance having these tails which are oil rubbing so essentially everybody's happy and this emulsion is suspended in it these droplets can be suspended in the water and if they are correctly made with correct surfactants these droplets will be small enough and if they're made with the right equipment with very high shear equipment these droplets can be made very small and stable meaning they will not combine they will not call that they will not float upwards or downwards they will not cream and that's because if they're small enough a Brownian motion that they undergo just naturally supersedes any kind of systematic vertical motion any kind of separation their buoyancy is very very low when they're very small so any desire to float is reduced and the desire to bounce around budgets Brownian motion is increased so it's kind of like a self stirring system so these can be completely stable in order to make that what you need is an ultrasonic processor this is our page scale processor a schematic of it similar to the schematic I showed before and you need a small amount of well you need some surfactant this is a product that we offer it's called nano stabilizer the sliced also stabilizer package but we changed the name now we call it nano stabilizer and got a trademark on that side which I to get used to the new way saying it so now no stabilizer it contains the entire formulation that is necessary to make nano emulsions specifically carrier oils emulsifiers anti oxidant to protect cannabinoids from oxidation and some basic preservatives to resist fungal fungus and bacteria okay yeah at the bottom then the pentacle a couple of couple of more slides I'm sorry I I feel I was finished go ahead but not so so once the manner motion is made this is how it can be used so this video shows 20 milligrams per milliliter CBD mater emulsion it's translucent if you look at the the dropper bottle it's not transparent but once you dose it into the water it disappears just give it a quick stir and now it looks like a solution so the bottle on the left is pure water bottle with 20 milligrams of CBD on the right has two bills in it they are both equally transparent and this will be stable will not separate ever the only thing that one does need to worry about is light light and this has nothing to do with narrow emulsion sorry that light is just something that degrades most cannabinoids so it's better if this bottle isn't transparent but some dark material UV resistant specifically okay so we wanted to make sure that any type of holding container for it is not translucent so that we can ensure that the cameras are not degraded any way possible to us I'm hearing exactly yeah it's better so this is for demonstration purposes just to show but meaning not a products out there have these clear bottles CBD water with clear bottles that's probably a mistake interesting actually I see it all over and it makes them no one's really paying attention that's interesting in what ways can water-soluble cannabis extracts be administered yeah looking um yeah let me skip forward for that a little bit so I can back up a little bit we can we can touch on some of the bit that's probably it's probably reasonable to mention what the benefits of these nano emulsions are free if we talked about how to make thunder yeah so well obviously convenience is a huge benefit it can just be added to water and dissolves in it so you can infuse it into most beverages and administer them that way just drink them but beyond convenience probably the most important aspect is this so this is a study done with a completely different substances as a pharmaceutical study but it does show the benefit of this type of delivery method of nano emulsions versus regular Moulton's for pretty much any type of active because the benefit belongs to the delivery vehicle more than them to the substance itself so if you look at this graph the bottom is a conventional emulsion so very rough coarse emulsion of an active substance and you can see that the bioavailability is pretty low vertical is the plasma concentration of whatever this practice is once you make a submicron emulsion so we're talking several hundreds of nanometer sized an emulsion the bioavailability goes up and once you go to a nano emulsion this particular one I think had something like a hundred cm the nanometer droplet size which is not by any means the smallest you can go but it does show that you get this shift to earlier onset of action and the bioavailability the plasma concentration increases now this trend is expected to continue if you keep making the droplets smaller we are currently participating in the study on that we don't have any results yet but I hope to have them soon this is what happens to nano emulsions as you make the droplets smaller so on the left is a nano emulsion similar to the one that already showed benefits at the previous in the previous slide but on this slide this is the biggest droplet so it's milky and white that's what matter emulsions look like until droplets until their droplets become smaller than 100 nanometers in diameter they can see that as it goes right as it gets smaller and this is the same exact concentration of oil which is deliberately under processed and then process a bit more and a bit more and a bit more so when you get 231 nanometers it becomes close to transparent nano emulsions made with our nano stabilizers a jar I showed before and our equipment can get down to this situation this is a CBE natural full spectrum extract nano emulsion and you can see that the mean droplet size is about 18 I think it was or it's it's below 20 nanometers so this is very highly translucent completely transparent when added to bulk of water I am is very effective so okay I could mention a little bit about why translucency is important beyond convenience convenience sure okay well so first of all again you can just add it to a beverage in it and disappears so that's that's very convenient but perhaps more importantly as this this trend is expected to continue and so our translucency is just a side effect of making smaller droplets and making smaller droplets is good because the onset of action is expected to become shorter and the by availability is expected to increase then what ways can this water soluble cannabis extracts be administered I think that we can get to that question sure yeah so the easiest is just to drink it I would say if if if that's an option then just making a beverage and it could be pretty much any water-based beverage that that you would like it to be including hot beverages coffee tea whatever or cold iced coffee - Christy so if the easiest is to drink it this is the kind of natural and intended by nature way of breaking nutrients into your body but it could also be a sublingual tincture in that way it will probably act faster not probably it will definitely get faster the issue with that is it's difficult to prescribe a dose because everybody swallows differently and everybody celebrates differently so you think it's under your tongue but really is being washed down and becoming more of a digestive absorption so it's hard if the bioavailability of oral of digestive absorption is low and sublingual is hi such as the case with some alcohol-based tinctures that could be a problem because you don't know how much you swallowed and you change divided variability for that portion therefore you don't really know that those in the end with matter emulsions that's not as big of an issue because the bioavailability is high in both cases so just because you shifted absorption from under your tongue to your small intestine the difference is smaller so it's still prescribed all it could be made into a nasal spray that's very fast very quick way into the bloodstream except again some of it will go through and get swallowed it could even be nebulized to the lungs you can bake nano emulsions you can't waive anything water-based but you could nebulize them to the lungs one thing to do there is to make sure that surfactants any surfactants that you used are compatible with the ones that happened otherwise there could be some irritation and they could be made into topicals and creams or pretty much anything that had a water base to it also edibles for example when you make a brownie there is water participating in the in the process so you could dilute the mat emulsion into that and then use it and the brownie will be baked most of the water will evaporate but probably not all of it and so once it's swallowed most of the animals and can be reconstituted in your gastric fluids and act similarly to to a beverage Alexia's sugar my question no I didn't hear that could this technology allow for intravenous use IVs and this type of stuff to enter the into the bloodstream quicker and faster ah sure yeah as long as the surfactants are biocompatible with the bloodstream which really they should be intravenous injection would be the quickest and the most complete by definition it would be a hundred percent by available and would be very quick and this is exactly what the pharma companies always try to do it's not always the most convenient way for the patient I would prefer to drink it than to be injected with it but for medical situations for emergencies sure yes it could be fed as an IV yeah okay why is there an increase in the bioavailability and why does it act faster yeah so this is a central question to the matter emulsions and because there's some attention if you swallow a capsule with with oil or consume an edible that had oil let's say butter with the cannabis and the brownie that would need was made with that butter or in some other way delivered oil in bulk not as an emulsion not as a nano emulsion into your stomach from your stomach it will be emptied into your small intestine and there it needs to be absorbed into into the intestinal walls through the absorptive cells now in order to get to the absorption site the oil needs to cross what's called unstirred aqueous layer and in order to do that it needs to be made water compatible in some way so the body is natural of doing it is if you look at these large oil droplets on the upper left this is let's say the oil that was consumed in the capsule they cannot get to the absorption site anyone if they could they wouldn't be absorbed they're too large what your body does to it it tries to digest it so if there any triglycerides vegetable oils which there should be for pretty much any formulation this is the function of carrier oil they will get digested and your body will release free fatty acids from them now these free fatty acids in conjunction with bile salts are produced by the gallbladder and some naturally present phospholipids will take any non-digestible oils such as cannabis oils that were contained in the formulation oils that cannot make free fatty acids because they're not triglycerides and it will try to kind of break them off from the bulk chemically very similarly to how it's done in the micro-emulsion situation and encapsulate them sort of cover them by by them by their hydrophobic tails so these are naturally present surfactants including free fatty acids that you just made from triglycerides these are surfactants acting molecules and they will try to make small droplets of the active material oil and make what's called mixed micelles so you can see that first you make this course emulsion from the from the large drops and then from that you make what's called mixed myself mixed micelles are about distribution of mixed muscles it was about is about this it's about 20 nanometers in diameter and the process is very slow it's it's a chemically driven process the only shear is some basic vibration and and there's topics of the small intestine so very slowly mixed micelles are made then they can cross them stored aqueous layer get to the surface of of the absorptive cells get into the cells and then they can go in two directions begin going to the lymph and that happens if chylomicrons are present in the cells which happens if you ate a fatty meal prior to the administration and if you didn't eat a fatty meal then they will actually not not be absorbed at all mostly because you won't have triglycerides to make free fatty acids to make mixed micelles but if you somehow did have may be either need a lot but you had enough to make some mix micelles but not enough to make chylomicrons in the cells then they will be directed after absorption into the bloodstream into the liver so the issue with this is making mixed micelles is a very slow process and anybody who ever consumed an edible with THC knows how it feels in the beginning there's nothing for about an hour there's nothing hour and a half maybe something at two hours it's coming in uh and then it's going to keep coming in for another couple hours and it the maximum is at four and that's because some micelles already got into your bloodstream others are still being made and so it's not a steady state it's not a flat sort of profile which is pretty inconvenient it's constantly changing it's hard to kind of park yourself at a certain level so for medical administration this is a serious problem because everything will depend on triglycerides how much you ate prior to that how much you ate during that what your digestion is like everybody's different and also it's a competition between natural illumination of whatever you ate to be our contestant amount and absorption so the bioavailability is very low and unpredictable so it's hard to really prescribe with those and the doses are very high they have to be high so that you can get at least something in now the reason that nano emulsions are so much quicker acting and more by available and on top of that are flat in their profile is because this distribution I showed the distribution a little bit earlier this is actually a distribution for nano emulsions droplets that are made with with our equipment and nano stabilizer so when the substance arrives in the small intestine it's in the form of something very similar to these mixed micelles you don't have to make them they are prepared to travel through the sturdiest layer right away and get absorbed and now if you have chylomicrons it will go into the lymph if you don't it will go into the bloodstream but it will all more or less go in together so it's not like you're building the concentration very slowly going up and up and up for a long time they will do this faster and much more completely so the bills can be prescribed and the absorption is much more independent of for your environment whatever else you ate and things like that okay I like to before move the next topic of extraction I've got quite a bit of questions here there's no way I'm able to hit all of them someone just select a few here that we can try to hit on just some of these questions for audience that's okay with you sure first question is what is generally the platoon of the barbell horns what is the lifetime of them we recommend operating at about 90 microns peak-to-peak they can go well above 100 our large systems go up to I think a hundred fifteen microns but normally that's a bit too much manner emotions are formed pretty well at between 80 and about 90 95 microns peak-to-peak okay here's another question what is the size of the particles in your emotions and how was this measured DLF or cry tim yeah so this is convenient this is a slide that I have open right now perfect about 20 20 to 40 on nanometers is normally where you end up depending on your raw materials and this is when it's made with our nano stabilizer obviously if you use your own formulation then it could be something else it depends on what you're using and this particular graph was DLS dynamic light scattering static light scattering or laser diffraction is another good method although it gets a little flaky when you go below a hundred nanometers well I shouldn't say a little flaky it's just not um it's not the best technique for very small droplets dynamic light scattering is appropriate for below hundred nanometers so this is how this was measured okay see if I can pull out a few more here for us that here's the one the same they are currently using polysorbate 80 in their emotions and it's one of your machines and it's working great just one good one to use I heard the first part of the question what was the second second half account so the police or median impressions machines and it's working great we're just wondering it's a good one to use for this this polysorbate 80 is a good surfactant but it's a bit harsh it's grass generally regarded as safe you can you can have it in your formulations and they would be food great but it's bitter and it's very synthetic so if if you're ok with that then it's a good surfac it's as far as making small droplets it's very effective yes ok let's do one more here and we will move on our extraction um how is this technology to do a book mask flavors or a bit bitter or for that matter um uh like I heard about a half of the question how is this technology about mask flavors I think the question was yeah either avoid or mask off flavors I see ok yeah that's a that's a very good question very common question this technology is not able to remove flavors that are already there so uh the nano stabilizer that we offer is tasteless you could even taste it directly although there would be a huge dose compared to what it would normally be it's part of nano modem but even then it won't be bitter or practically won't have any taste ah the sonication also doesn't create any taste however if your starting material has a paste it this taste will be enhanced because everything is enhanced it's the bioavailability question the bioavailability is increased because droplets are small the by availability of whatever has the taste will also be increased so if you're starting extract is bitter the nano motion will be there if your starting material is an isolate and you put it on your tongue and you don't taste anything that doesn't mean it doesn't have any page that just means it's not by available your taste buds it doesn't dissolve in water so when you man emulsify it there may be some bitterness to it depending on how clean your starting material occurs for very clean distillers and very clean isolate there's practically no taste we have a few customers that manage to have very long taste but it's difficult to get your starting material that clean there is a way to mask it by introducing competing flavors but this is not something that we are specialists in and they're playing from food scientists that can help you with that but we don't include any masking agents in our formulations in order to give people the ability to essentially choose what they want to do with it okay let's move on to extraction and really discuss you know what is the physical principle of ultrasonic extraction and what is it this is very new to me I have you know I'm very very curious to learn more about this sure so talk about extraction we first have to talk about cavitation a little bit more in depth so this is again the cavitation cloud and it consists of these small vacuum bubbles that are formed grow and at some point turned around and collapse have nothing inside vacuum so they implode into nothing but they do so asymmetrically if there is any kind of disturbance in the liquid so if you have an oil droplet or if you have a cell a plant cell or anything the implosion will not happen symmetrically one wall will pierce the other wall of the droplet and that will create what's called micro jet micro Jets are very potent very small-scale very fast so for extraction foreign an emulsification they simply hit a droplet of oil and break it up in smaller droplets now for extraction the similar thing happens it can hit a cell and break it open and the cell can then release its contents so ultrasonic extraction is a fairly common process and it's used for solvent extraction of different kinds of things in food industry and other industries as well um but in the case of cannabis extraction there are two things that are becoming somewhat popular one is a cryogenic ethanol extraction so ethanol when it's warm is able to extract very quickly and efficiently but that co-op's tracts unwanted things go extract some waxes and chlorophyll and then everything needs to be winter raised so a new thing is to extract with cryogenic ethanol which is essentially already at weatherization conditions and so it leaves the waxes and chlorophyll behind it's a good solvent for extraction but it's slower when it's cold it's not as aggressive so we have some people using our systems to extract with cold ethanol reporting good results preliminary results on another thing you do easily is an equivalent of bubble hash basically break off the Tricon so it's not exactly extraction but it's can be it could be a step in the starting step in the extraction process trichomes could be broken off mechanically but without sound it's more efficient so ice water and the flower material break off trichomes and then filter collect them but all of it is essentially taken forward by ultrasonic cavitation which is basically mechanical shear very high mechanical shear what potential vanish does this offer compared to a subtraction methods yeah so as I mentioned it accelerates the extraction process by introducing very high shear but that's not always necessary there are many solvents that extract quickly there are some instruction systems that are very good they work very well but so accelerating the existing extraction is a minor advantage but there is one potential advantage that is not minor that is eventually very very important and we're working on it right now this is now that we have the man emulsification process all pretty much figured out and offered off-the-shelf we're now directing most of our efforts to this novel extraction map and that's just by using water so water is obviously not a good solvent for cannabis for cannabinoids because they don't dissolve in water so it can't be used as a solvent instead of ethanol or hydrocarbon for example or co2 but as I demonstrated before we are able to make cannabinoids believe that water is a good environment for them so Nano emulsions they're not rigorously speaking solutions but they behave like solutions so by similar principle we seem to be able to and this is preliminary data and the data is looking very good we're able to extract the cannabis oils into water with some amount of surfactants and then the thing that we have to really work out is once you have the emulsion how do you get cannabinoids out so we have an inverse problem the Nano emotions that are made are very stable they're very high quality in an emotion and it's very difficult to break them it's possible to break them by extensive centrifugation but that's improv so what we're working on now is how to essentially separate the oil from the water in separate layers which would happen if we didn't have such a stable manner motion once that works out hopefully the oil will just float to the top and then we'll be able to drain the water and collect the oil this will be a very advantageous method because you would not need any harsh solvents there's nothing flammable there's some surfactant but it could be very biocompatible so potentially if this works out I believe this would be a significant improvement for the industry there's the p8 that that water would need to be at when you do this process it's unclear right now ah to extract it doesn't really matter for the surfactants that we're using we try to stay with non ionic surfactants for now so pH doesn't really affect the process on the other hand we're just starting so we'll explore everything including pH okay so this is you know you mentioned early on that about 80% of your business now is in the cannabis space that's pretty exciting you know what current products do you offer to the cannabis sector and you know where can we see it being used sure so at this point it's basically very simple we offer ultrasonic processors this is a schematic of our medium scale bench scale ultrasonic processor or we call it the DSP 1200 we have a smaller processor for roughly slightly bigger than lab scale we don't offer really small lab scale processors those are available from pretty much any ultrasonic company but we offer everything that's scaled up from there so our smaller processors to LSB 500 and that's good for maybe a leader of nano emulsions at a time broken up into two hundred milliliter batches or it could be used in the flow mode like this and then you can press about a meter but it's not a production system it's a RNG system this BSP 400 system is a production system you can make anywhere from five to ten liters of nano emulsion per hour and just to give you a sense of perspective 10 liters at 20 milligrams per milliliter is 20000 doses that could be made per hour the concentration doesn't have to stop there it's still translucent a very and very effective up to about 50 milligrams per milliliter so 10 liters can become 50000 process it's the I would say it's the upper productivity kilometer for the system and then we have a larger system the ISP 3000 which is about four to five times larger and faster than the BSP and in conjunction with it we offer the Nano stabilizer again this lights ptosis stabilizer package but we now call it another stabilizer and this is the entire formulation that's required for nano emulsification or you could develop your own formulation and then just the ultrasonic system will be all you need from us for the extraction we don't offer in off-the-shelf solution yet for the water extraction we're working on it but when we are finished with it we're hoping to be able to offer the same type of combination would be an ultrasonic system and some substance that helps you extract into water and perhaps if post-processing is necessary then we'll offer whatever is needed for that so as far as the off-the-shelf solution for nano modification its system and nano stabilizer and for extraction justice system at this point in order to run your technology you need to be a chemist to use your products at all or can like myself it does not have a science background be able to be trained on your tinted operating procedures and use your technology sure this is a common question and I have a perfect slide for that speaks for itself I do not have to be you don't have to be crazy scientists do nano emulsify with our with our technology we provide everything that you need for the formulation and for the fish ear equipment and it comes with instructions there as simple as a simple recipe basically take this put it in here stir add to the the main tank recirculate turn off sound watch for solution see when translucency is what it's supposed to be stop filter and collect as simple as that so you do not have to be a scientist you just need some very basic lab space and some basic common sense if you develop your own formulations or use your own formulations then uh you need to be probably a chemist or a similar type of scientist to to be able to develop formulations it doesn't have to be necessarily chemist someone could could just learn how to develop formulations to some extent but a more scientific background is then required the same for extractions at this point until we figure out an off-the-shelf solution that will come with instructions that is coming yeah hopefully it's coming soon I don't know how soon but we're working on it all right okay that's great and so you know what states are you working in working working the products be be seen and are you going to be the knee upcoming trade shows how can the public reach out to you sure so as far as what states were working in the company is located in New York and we're opening another facility in Florida in Miami probably within the next year uh we don't work with cannabis or make nano emulsion to ourselves so we don't have any issues with state borders or or country borders our equipment is sold all over the world the nano stabilizer is also all just food grade materials that can be shipped anywhere so there's absolutely no limitations and we do present at trade shows we recently came back from the world medical conference in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago we are going to be at cannabis World Congress at the Javits Center in New York on May 30th going to June 2nd I will be giving a lecture at marijuana for medical professionals conference in Denver I think it's an October mid October this year beyond that I'm not sure yet but we probably will be on the west coast somewhere later in the year you're right getting it that's great and you're saying we could hope to see some new technology coming out soon from you guys which is even even more exciting it's the you want touch on the day here we've got a few more minutes we're in a wrap up I've got literally a handful of questions if you want to go through them there they're touching on different parts of the of your of your talk today so if you want to take a few minutes to go back and kind of maybe answer a few more these questions let me know and we can kind of extend this today to go over if you're okay with that oh I'm happy and I think we left one question for later I guess now is later but I forgot what the question Oh Lord it's they can go back and find that here's a question that I've a few a few times you know please please discuss my plus tones versus nano emotions if you could sure liposomes are generally meant to encapsulate water-soluble materials they have an aqueous or water-based interior not interior they have a lipid bilayer skin and water on the outside so water is both on the inside and the outside of these so if you want it to encapsulate and deliver let's say vitamin C you could put it in water make liposomes encapsulate that vitamin C inside the lipo song and then deliver it that way and that would control the release of vitamin C it would slow it down so it's in solution but a best solution is inside a controlled particle you could incorporate some oil-based substance into the bilayer into the skin of the liposome but the loading factor would be lower there's just a lot more space inside the liposome than in the thin bilayer narrow margins have oil on the inside and water on the outside so if what you're trying to do is deliver an oil-based substance it's best to put it in on an emulsion of everybody applying the interior and deliver them that way okay perfect here's another question on nano emulsification what are the frequencies used for Emily multiplications uh we our equipment works at 20 kilohertz 32,000 Hertz the Waller Bell frequency the easier it is to make large scale equipment there are many reasons mathematical reasons for that but one story short we try to operate at as low a frequency as possible but it has to stay above human hearing so 20 kilohertz is about the upper edge of human hearing and that's where we operate kameena for the sister link we can get something that are that are important you know it your method better than spray drying unless you're that relevant or not spray drying is not a method of making that emulsion so it's a completely different thing spray drying is used in post-processing sometimes with our nano emulsions it's a way of making dry powders so if someone wanted to make a dry powder they could take a matte emulsion put them in capsule ating matrix into it there would be some sort of a sugar like substance whatever works best sometimes most extremely used although I'm not sure that's the right material for nano emulsions but some sort of a water-soluble I new tricks and then that can be sprayed right there by replacing the water with the let's say sugar so sugar takes place of water now you have an oil droplet encapsulated in solid sugar versus water once that is put back into water sugar dissolves out and reconstituted in an emulsion back to where it was this is something that can happen in a beverage or in the gastric juice if you consume that power directly but spray drying is more of a following step than rather than an alternative okay I think I found the question here that we left a for the in here and it's how to place nano emotion inside a capsule without melting cap that's a that's a good question ah narrow margins are mostly water and capsules are meant to dissolve in your gastric juices in the gastric fluids so they dissolve in water if you have water on the inside it will dissolve the capsule from the inside there are some special capsules that work for certain pH so nano emotions don't really have to have any type of pH they could be neutral what's a pH 7 and if the capsule doesn't dissolve at the pH but does dissolve at pH 3 then ban emulsion won't is over from the inside but once it's swallowed and hits the gastric fluids with low pH it will release the matter motion so that could be one way great answer can you give examples of good antioxidants to use I'm sure vitamin E is a good antioxidant vitamin C although vitamin C is water-soluble so that would just be in bulk vitamin is oil soluble so that could be in the oil phase those are the ones that I normally prefer but there are many out there and many very biocompatible ones and they all roughly work about the same way ok like today we're going to wrap this up there's no way I can sift through all these questions there's just a lot of them that can be touched on quite a bit of DNA or them and so if you get e on the day is there anything you'd like to add to kind of wrap this up - Dave I made this anything too specific well now I appreciate the opportunity to present this this is new technology we're very excited about it we're working to improve it we're especially excited the possibility of making water based extraction possible and I will be happy to update anyone on this we can be contacted through our website it's sauna mechanics calm they'll contact us with any questions my email is Alexi a lax UI at Astana mechanics comm so you could write to me directly and yeah yeah thanks very much for the opportunity I want to thank our audience for tuning in today for this great talk dr. Lexi peshkov ski with industrial sono mechanics with nano emulsification and ultrasonic extraction I'm Ella Smith your host thank you for tuning in to the American cannabis and like to thank our host cannabis tech until next month have a great day preciate your time thank you you", "ZDInc3a0bw8": "hey guys today we are talking about CBD extraction methods so in co2 extraction carbon dioxide is pressurized and middle tanks until it becomes a fluid then the fluid pulls out the desirable compounds from flour the fluid is then separated leaving only the concentrates hydrocarbon extraction typically refers to using butane or propane as a solvent that's passed through the raw cannabis matter to collect the cannabinoids and terpenoids is then heated up to evaporate off the butane and propane leaving behind the extract ethanol extraction is conducted by soaking raw cannabis in ethanol to pull trichomes into the solvent the cannabis is then removed the liquid is filtered and the alcohol purged from the extractive material thanks a lot", "tY6bRcpc1Q4": "[Music] that you can use to extract cannabinoids and terpenoids liquid co2 is one of them there are lots of others that fall into the category of hydrocarbons that includes butane propane heptane lots of other things are also hydrocarbons gasoline for instance but of course we don't want to use those for things that we are going to be taking orally so the difference mainly is in the specificity of the molecules that it will ultimately dissolve out of the plant material and there are our pros and cons to both butane actually gets a fuller terpene profile and it's faster but ultimately you do need to get rid of the solvents at the at the end the nice thing with co2 is all you do is reduce the pressure and it reverts back to a gas and then we re pressurize it and put it back into our recycler so we do use a lot of our co2 more than once and there's no residual solvent there at the end when what once it comes out of the machine the co2 is gone with other types of hydrocarbons those solvents are also relatively easy to remove and they've gotten a lot like a bad reputation in recent history and I think one of the main reasons for that is that butane is really easy to get cheap and dirty and the butane itself is not necessarily harmful it's whatever might come with the butane that once you dissolve or once you concentrate all of that down then the contaminants can also be concentrated and that might be a problem but clean pure medical grade butane is a great solvent for cannabis and butane itself whatever small bits might be left over is essentially harmless when you but so this sort of I don't know what I want to call it demonization or chemo phobia around hydrocarbons is somewhat unnecessary it's very easy to do it safely and correctly and cleanly but people in the past who were on the black market or didn't know what they were doing or doing things in the cheap and dirty way have you know given it a bad reputation so ultimately you know there are small differences on a molecular level of the things that these different solvents will dissolve you can use cold ethanol as well is a pretty good solvent and that that is being used more and more as well so so yeah I think one of the main reasons we like the co2 is for worker safety there's way less risk of accidents happening dangerous accidents happening ultimately co2 is very safe and it's gone by the time the extract comes out of the machine [Music] [Music]", "BqBrpibHe5M": "hi friends this is angela from life of biotech which has been exported cbd products for four years our water soluble cbd content is 10 percent it is off-white to white powder i will show you a quick test about the solubility this is 100 milliliter water and about 1 gram cbd in it stir gently see cbd is soluble in water completely besides water soluble cbd we can also supply cbd isolate and cpd oil just contact level if you want more information", "urBi1xewboE": "i'm craig henderson here at extract labs in boulder colorado i founded this company about 19 months ago originally in my basement in Arvada Colorado and then about three months later we were fortunate enough to go to move here in the boulder the original business model was to just do toll processing for heme farmers and give them back their oil I soon learned that hemp farmers don't want their oil back they just want to grow plant material and sell it so we went from being just a full processing company to a products company we started off just making tinctures and bulk isolate and then from the marijuana side of things I saw that shatter and crumble was a huge industry so I found a way to make CBD shatter and crumble so it wouldn't be limited to any one state it was a shatter crumble that could be sold across the country my background is all co2 processing that's what we primarily do here co2 processing we also do some alcohol and hydrocarbon the co2 is really what separated us from all the other CVD companies we use my Tallis that's what we started with well in my garage I started with you know a small alcohol extraction it just wasn't enough it didn't make very clean oil so once we got connected up Vitalis and got that machine now we've had for a little over a year that's really what took our business to the next level it makes a lot cleaner oil it's a lot simpler to use everything that comes out of it is just liquid gold you know alcohol is still nice for just going I slit if we need a winterized oil or a distillate or somewhere in between something they've put in our own products it's all co2 it's all from the Vitalis today we're doing about 700 pounds a week in put pounds we should be about 1,200 pounds in the next two months our goal is to be at 2,000 pounds per week in put plant material so if we put in 2,000 pounds you know a percentage of that will go to winterized oil you can also take it to distillate ice lit we have flash chromatography they can remove THC so we can make THC free distillate you know there's 120 some cannabinoids out there th C's one of them that everyone's focused on we're gonna focus on the other 119 of them I'd say our shatter and crumble is what most people would probably look at us like we I feel like we were kind of Raiders or founders of CVD shatter the top five biggest CVD companies shatter companies online or all are shatter just white-label for other people but really the body cream and muscle cream is what I feel like I'm personally most proud of it's what I use the most of just tempering the body cream or the muscle cream to get it to the right consistency using the right ingredients trying to keep it very simple if we get our hands on good industrial hemp like the cherry wine strains we have we can pull off really nice terpenes and put those in our products so our cherry wine is something we pull off in-house and then put back into our products and then we just discovered a really cool method for making a really legit water-soluble isolate or full-spectrum water-soluble haven't even released it yet but we should have really nice water soluble products in the very near future you do everything in-house we're not outsourcing really anything that I can think of everything is made here it's processed here it's shipped from here everyone feels like they're kind of part of something you know that's changing the world and I think there's that super-high passion as well as separating us from some of the other companies you know I've had other jobs in the past and they just didn't share the same vision so you're working around a whole bunch of people and they're just not on the same page here I'm working with 25 people that are literally sharing the same vision they wake up excited to the same thing as me every day so I think just the passion and the fact that we do everything in-house we're not reporting to a bunch of guys in suits that you know aren't part of what we do you know it gets scarier the more people you hire the more you start feeling like a large corporation I don't want to lose those small company that that high passion I want to get big but I don't want to lose you know what we have today so it's kind of a balancing act my biggest fear is that Big Pharma will get involved manipulate it over regulate it and change what it is today and make it to where it's impossible for people like me or other small people to get into this and then it just becomes another big pharma problem there's a lot of pharmaceutical products today that I think hopefully get pushed by the wayside they're really not that good for you they're covering up small things are causing bigger problems be nice to see in five years what cannabis can do for people I'm curious to see where that's gonna go you see how big we can get and try to keep it like I said keep that passion alive keep it um just owned by us when I stepped into CBD and him I thought I was taking a step down I thought I wasn't good enough for the marijuana side of things you know and I feel like now the hemp or the CBD side of things is gonna far outdo marijuana I think marijuana in a few years is gonna be a small niche in the realm of the cannabis industry so I feel like I really got lucky you you", "HBhMEAED2ro": "[Music] [Applause] so we hear a lot of terms there's cannabis cbd thc and hemp is it all marijuana or is there a difference our next insider explains what we have to differentiate is between cannabis or marijuana and hemp as well as cbd and thc so those are the the big ones to differentiate so cannabis is actually a plant that has all these different cannabinoids and it produces two of the most prominent thc and cbd hemp on the other hand it comes from the cannabis species but it does also have the cbd molecule which is cannabidiol and so what's legal in the united states in all 50 states would be cbd from a hemp plant and that would mean it would have also 0.3 percent thc or less and so that's really important because the thc is a psychoactive molecule so hemp is legal you can buy it online many people sell it and it contains cbd which has a lot of medicinal properties however cbd from hemp may be similar to the effect you would get from cbd from cannabis however it does have less than 0.3 percent thc so there's no chance of any psychoactivity there so cbd is cannabidiol cbd thc stands for what for tetrahydrocannabinol and what exactly is that again so that's one of the cannabinoids that causes the psychoactive effect and that's because it binds to that cb1 receptor in our brain but it has a lot of medicinal benefits also so people who are going through chemotherapy for example and suffering from nausea and vomiting or need to increase their appetite thc can be very effective it's also great for pain all different types of pain pain from neuropathy or you know the typical sciatic type of pain muscle spasticity patients with ms or a lot of other chronic musculoskeletal issues and uh very beneficial for insomnia as well what is hemp oil and is there any medicinal benefit there too so so hemp oil does contain cbd the problem with hemp oil is that it's not regulated strict enough and now actually i think today trump may sign the farm bill and the farm bill actually would make hemp completely legal so that it's no longer part of that definition where it's part of that schedule one and so you can get cbd from hemp and it would be very exciting if the farm bill does pass and trump signs that because now they'll be able to regulate what happens because the industry similar to supplements there's not a lot of strict enforcement so people are producing hemp oil selling it and it may not have the proper cannabinoid profile it may have things like mold pesticides lead different things that can be taken up from the soil so it has a lot of benefit and it can be bought online or you know in physicians offices however it should be regulated so that we know that the patients are getting accurate amount of what they need and i was hearing in the news that it looked like it was gonna pass but he was going to sign it it seems like it's going to happen today hopefully i think so today exactly uh let's go over cbd hemp oil we have a graphic if you could walk us through this doctor so in order to be considered hemp oil the cbd has to have the the oil has to have less than 0.3 thc which would mean there wouldn't be any chance of any feeling of being high or psychoactivity it should be third party lab tested which means that you can send it to a lab to check the cannabinoid profile and for any other contaminants and then how it's extracted is important there's ethanol extractions there's co2 extractions and the way i look at cbd is it really is more of a wellness type of supplement and i always tell people it's going to be in our multivitamin because we make a molecule in our body that is very similar to that molecule and as we age we make less and so it's really one of the reasons why we get chronic disease because we're not able to regulate and maintain homeostasis so it's something that people should be taking on a daily basis and then if they have specific symptoms like anxiety or pain or insomnia they can take it in specific doses or specific routes of administration and is cpd hemp or illegal in all 50 states it is it is it is legal okay i want to go over some reasons why you would prescribe cbd and thc we have a few examples that we can show our viewers right now and that would be anti-inflammatory i actually will let you take them because there's a few of them so cbd is a great anti-inflammatory so when dealing with joint inflammation or any type of inflammation in our body cbd can be used instead of things like ibuprofen meloxicam different anti-inflammatories it's also great for anxiety so it's a lot of patients are able to get off their xanax their valium their klonopin by using cbd it's helpful for pain and it's a good analgesic as well as an antioxidant to help with the immune system thc on the other hand actually the united states has a patent saying that it can help with apoptosis which is programmed cell death which means that it can help to shrink tumors it can help decrease metastasis so it has this anti-cancer property and also anti-spasmodic patients who are suffering from spasticity or muscle spasms it will help with that as well it's also effective for pain and again it can help with nausea vomiting stimulating people's appetite and if cbd is not sufficient for sleep thc can be used to help patients suffering from insomnia look at that more than i even dreamed of are patients surprised when they see that so they they just come in and go really they are surprised but what happens is a lot of patients actually come to me because i've had success with their friends or their family and so they are understanding the benefits and they're feeling they're seeing people feel better and so they want to know is this an option for me and by the way president trump did sign the farm bill which legalizes hemp you can find

tyler green today i'm going to be discussing a topic that i've been thinking about quite a bit this week and that is hemp flour versus cbd extract so there's been a lot of products that have emerged recently on the market that i believe are to cater for cannabis consumers people like myself who enjoy the consumption experience now have a bit of a choice when it comes to getting our cbd that moves away from the traditional oils bombs and other topicals right i've actually got an example of both here this is hemp flower you can find this online you can find it in several shops in the uk and this is what it looks like and then this is cbd extract the example i've got here is the goods lemon drop cbd shatter which is 99 cannabidiol today i'm going to discuss the pros and cons of cbd flour okay hemp flour and cbd extract aka cbd dabs just to try and figure out which suits who you know like what is going to make this suitable for you or this suitable for you let's discuss that right here so flower pros when it comes to hemp flour you can roll this up and smoke it with your regular weed you can also roll it up in place of your regular weed you can put it into a vaporizer and all of those things make it seem very natural to cannabis consumers so for people that are already smoking weed regularly then adding cbd weed into your diet your your cannabinoid consumption isn't going to present any challenges or really feel any different you'll notice a difference in flavor indeed there are different flavor profiles in the hemp world as well but typically you may notice that it is less flavoursome than your high thc strains um but you will be able to naturally gel with it as a weed product right just looks the same there are different hemp strains with different cannabidiol content so there is actually stuff out there that will suit you as a newer consumer or someone that needs a lot of cbd for their medical conditions so you can get cbd flower up to about 20 cbd i think i've seen and this overall means that it is a really natural feeling product right so really easy to transition or to add it into our existing consumption cbd extract on the other hand really really cool to get the dosage requirements that you can get when it comes to cbd extract so you can literally take your gram and portion it up into 10 or 20 evenly sized portions and then you know exactly how much cannabidiol bearing in mind that this has 990 milligrams of cannabidiol in this pot so that makes it really super easy to uh to deal with dosing much more easily than it is to deal with dosing when it comes to hemp flour right another awesome thing about cbd extracts is the ability to imbue them with these lovely terpene profiles so this one is lemon drop and it just smells like sweet sicilian lemons and you can really play about and get some awesome terpene profiles in the cbd world another benefit to cbd extract which hits less with cbd flour unless you vaporize it is the bio availability of the vaporized compounds that you get when you dab versus the amount of cannabinoids that you get when you smoke so if you smoke something you're actually absorbing sort of 10 to 20 percent of the cannabinoids whereas when you vaporize you're absorbing 80 to 90 percent of the cannabinoids so if you put these in contrast and you smoked this and you vaporize this then you would be getting more cannabidiol from the extract right even if they had the same amount of milligrams consumed you would absorb more into your body with the vaporization so that is a really key positive point for cbd extract it's also a tried and tested method of delivery for cannabis consumption so you can either put it into a vape pen or a dab rig both consumption methods have been used for years and both of them are prized by medical patients for fast and effective cannabinoid delivery and of course it's much healthier to not burn your material if you can help it and that is why vaporizing extract is a healthier consumption method than smoking flour so we've talked about the benefits of both consumption methods but of course there are some drawbacks to both as well so i'm going to discuss that before we make our final verdict the first drawback to hemp flower and one which is always on my mind is that this still sits in a legal gray area so the law never changed to make an exception for cbd flower and people sold it and continued to sell it on the assumption that it contains little to no thc therefore is defined as heaven but the legal gray area does make it quite tricky to operate in the market with some cbd flower sellers being raided by the police in reality this is unlikely to affect you as a consumer so you don't have to worry so much consuming cbd flowers but just know that that distinction doesn't exist in the law another drawback to consuming only hemp flour versus consuming the extract is that you're not going to have an idea of the accurate dosage like you would if you took another consumption method when you smoke flour and particularly when i smoke flour i just grind up a few buds put it into a joint and smoke it it's a really enjoyable experience but i'm not thinking about how many cannabinoids i'm putting into my body that is something to think about for medical patients and why they might opt to consume the cbd extract instead another really key point when it comes to hemp flour is that the cannabidiol content is going to vary from batch to batch just because you smoked it once a long time ago and there was an awesome amount of cbd and doesn't mean that it will have that exact amount again and there are actually some processes where people either spray can abu dial onto the buds or they can remove the other cannabinoids to make it come down to the legal limit as well so there are some practices which you might not be aware of which might put you off when it comes to hemp flour the cannabinoids and terpenes really really nicely so that covers the drawbacks of the hemp flour so let's talk about the extract one of the things that i think is important to mention when it comes to cbd extract is often not always but often you will find that it is made from isolated compounds and broad spectrum terpenes and cannabinoids have been added right so when this is extracted to its pure form this is extracted all the way through to pure cannabidiol from hemp plants grown out in europe so they've taken away the other compounds left the cannabidiol behind and then added in the terpenes and their broad spectrum wax which is 80 cbd also offers additional minor compounds minor cannabinoids making it broad spectrum rather than isolate but it's worth thinking about that this is full spectrum right so a little bit of thc and a lot of balance of all different stuff and then this is an extract so the pure cannabidiol there is a flip side to this obviously from a medicinal perspective you know what you're getting with the cannabidiol and that's a really good thing for patients another drawback to extracts on the cbd side is that you have the potential for low quality because it's a newer industry and growing all the time there are going to be some extracts out there which don't taste as great and particularly when i got started in the world of cbd extracts i wasn't enjoying the flavor so much this year however i've been impressed with the goods flavor profile and i know there are some other awesome companies working on terpene blends and really cool stuff that you can explore so the the high quality extracts are there as well consuming extract also requires another piece of equipment so either a v8 pen or a dab rig as i mentioned with the tried and tested consumption methods however this does make it a little bit more expensive to get started and you will have to buy yourself at least an entry-level product to be able to consume the extract unless you want to just put it in with your joints but then you will be burning it and therefore wasting some of the cbd and finally the extract may feel a little bit less natural to old-school smokers i'm talking the guys and girls that have been smoking joints for 30 years haven't really tried out other consumption methods this is a newer way to consume cannabis right and it doesn't look like it did in its herbal form so it feels less natural to people that have never tried it but once you take the plunge it can be a very enjoyable experience so what is my verdict when it comes to consuming hemp flour or cbd extract which should you pick it's going to depend entirely on you and your motivations but there are clearly some benefits and some drawbacks to both i personally really like consuming the cbd dabs in the morning they're a really good start to the day but i also find myself smoking and vaping cbd flour from time to time so there are benefits to both you know it's really nice to mix them sometimes as well during the day and have a bit of both in different sessions so i find it difficult to pick i really like the flavor profiles and i really like this sort of clear-headed feeling that i get when i consume cbd extracts which is very noticeable for something that's not psychotropic both forms of consumption are entirely valid but you'll get a clearer dosage with cbd extract i'll buy both i'll have both in my medicine cabinet and i will consume both of them but i want to know what your thoughts are on the subject do you smoke hemp flour do you dab cbd extract have you tried both and what is your preference please leave your comments below and we'll be joining the discussion and as always if you've enjoyed this video hit that thumbs up it helps us grow subscribe to the channel for more

thompson president and founder of extract lab today i'm going to be talking to you about a co2 versus ethanol extraction facilities and the cost for each of those we're going to do some comparisons show you what's required and what's not required it's gonna be a good time let's get started [Music] one thing to note when you are starting a ethanol or a co2 extraction facility is the solvent that you choose will have a huge impact on the requirements for your production facility so one thing to really think about when you are building your facility is the type of liquid extractant that you're going to have ethanol is considered a class 1d liquid class 1b liquids are liquids that have flash points below 73 and boiling points 100 or above in fahrenheit class 1b liquids include like ethyl alcohol for example it's really important you know the class of your liquid can really understand what the requirements are for your facility that is coming out of that there are many different engineering standards that you need to be aware of when you're talking about flammable liquids nfpa 30 is a good one and they have all the flammable liquids code there's also 29 cfr 1910 which is the osha code a whole bunch of other codes engineering codes related to that hvac codes the nfpa has a tremendous amount of resources for you on this but the thing to really take home is ethanol as a class 1b liquid you also need to know how much of that liquid is going to be in your facility one thing that's absolutely true is that ethanol extraction needs lots of ethanol typically you're looking at about a gallon per pound of ethanol so if you're going to do 2 000 pounds per day you're looking at approximately 2 000 gallons of ethanol for a day's operation certainly reusing reuse operations or using falling film for example may be able to keep up with the ethanol extraction to reduce the amount of ethanol needed in a facility reduce and reuse operations or recycling operations need to comply with the fda guidelines for solvent reuse this includes specifications back to its original state testing and validation i'm not going to talk about that here but it's a part of the operating costs that you need to be thinking about when you anticipate reusing solvents let's just say that you need about two thousand gallons in an operation the maximum allowed ethanol per control area for an f2 occupancy is 240 gallons you have up to three control areas that means that in your facility you can only have 720 gallons that really limits the amount of extraction that you're really able to do in an f2 facility and most people who want to be able to have their facilities scalable they'll look at h2 or hazardous occupancy so ethanol required definitely exceeds the f2 occupancy therefore h.234 occupancy can be required by your permitting body there are major costs associated with those added occupancy i'm not going to go through all the specific things but let me give you some examples you'll have to have fire alarms every 120 feet you have to have a certain fire resistant walls there are a whole list of things that are related to occupancy h2 occupancy buildings here is the table that drives the requirements this comes from the international building code and the ibc code is kind of used and replicated in the code of fed regulations in the nfpa so they've all kind of gotten together and harmonized what they consider to be hazardous inside a facility and hazardous outside the facility in the case of the fumble liquid in the green bar you can see a 1b liquid or 1a liquid a flammable liquid group when maximum allowable quantity is exceeded requires h2 or h3 you can see that if you don't have sprinkler building it's going to be like 30 if you do have a sprinkler building yeah 120 actually you can double that if it's a sprinkler building so it's actually 60 and 240 so that's really where you get that and this is for storage and you can also have that for use in closed systems and then use an open system so you can see the very limited amount in use in open systems so if you add all that up you're really talking about not a lot of ethanol in your facility you know maybe two two or two totes and you're pretty much limited out and you have to have a different occupancy this really is a cost schedule that you can find at many different places you can go to any of the department building inspection departments for example and find out the cost to build architects will also have this cost to build i mean this is a comparison between f occupancy and h occupancy comparison these are average costs to build per square foot for different types of buildings and the different types of buildings have to do with how the building is constructed what the walls are what the ceiling is is a metal construction is it cement construction is it a wood construction and then also is it sprinklered or not sprinkled so that's that's what the different types of constructions are and you can see that with say you have a 5 000 square foot facility you're going to build it up f2 versus h2 you're talking about a radically different cost to build that building with foreign f2 versus an h occupancy and that just has to do with all the requirements for an age occupancy so the numbers are going to vary from region to region and from actually from country to country for sure just make sure that you are aware of the occupancy requirements for your building if you're going to go with an ethanol extractor so what is scalability and why does it matter scalability is the property of your plant or your property and your equipment that enables the business to start small and increase production as demand increases if an ethanol processor starts off with say half a 10 a day for example or 500 pounds per day in an f2 occupancy building and then decides it wants to grow and add more and more very quickly it'll realize that it's running into the limit as to the amount of solvents it can have in the building a lot of people just skirt the issue and they just run anyway well they're going against the permitting issues safety issues if they get caught obviously that's an issue and insurance is also an issue so co2 has no such limitations you can have an unlimited amount in your building it's an inert gas there are things you need to do just from alarming standpoint and also venting standpoint in the event of leak or for example uh your alarm would trigger a contact closure which would give you a vent fan the vent fan requirement is about one cfm per square foot so that's typically if you have a room and you where you have your co2 basically you can you can vent it out 2 000 square feet would be the size of like a bathroom fan a lot of the bulk co2 is usually stored outside and i know that a lot of people do that also with the ethanol that they have so there are requirements for outdoor storage and indoor storage and how much you have in your facilities even the vessels however if you have a thousand liter vessel for your ethanol you still have a significant amount of ethanol in your facility at all times so that's something to be thinking about equipment can be scaled easily to five to ten tons for co2 no problem that's what's great about co2 it's definitely more scalable within the footprint of an f2 building hey thanks for watching we have many resources available for you to get your hemp operation up and running calculators advanced extraction guides distillation guides cbd jam sessions we have just lots of content uh links to which are in the description below as well as the cards up above uh i'd like to hear from you uh what was your favorite part of the video if you would let me know in the comments below i'd be really appreciative of it also don't forget to subscribe to our channel for more content like this this has been dr john with extract lab thank you and have a great day", "RFBqP7wkUJw": "hi I'm John Thompson CEO of extract lab we're here with MJ this conference basically debuting some new products we love this show this is where a longtime 10d of this show it's it's got great attendance we're just really happy to be here extract lab is a brand of united science essentially extract lab is we do co2 extraction and so we have a whole line of co2 extractors based on the extract lab brand we also have other brands you have a clear steel brand fracked ron brand basically for falling film we have let's say we have some like carbon x4 carbon filtration we have Pier 99 which is chromatography and we have drain droid so those are really make up our brands for and that basically they they really look at different aspects of manufacturing which we're experts in we've launched three new products at this show first product would be the instrument here in the back it's called the clear still essentially it just solved some of the GMP concerns that people have when they when they use you know other pieces of equipment so what GMP is is it's a good manufacturing practices and it's just a quality system that manufacturers need to comply with so we're also have the fraction which is one of our new following films it's a continuous system that really addresses like ethanol extraction and things like that so we're really excited about that and we also have the shotgun Bock which was a piece of equipment we just made because we needed it ourselves it'll do about an acre and a half to two acres per hour in terms of taking all the flour off the stems for him GMP is important for operators especially if you're operating in Canada according to GP P or anybody really collaborating with Canadian companies that want to export to Europe or be in Europe which is a European GMP and then in the United States there's each state has their own set of regulations so we're really up on all the regulations it's in our systems we build all the compliancy directly in our systems so we're really excited about that extract lab is available on the web WWE are a katie lab comm extract lab we pretty much have links out to everything that we're doing there we also have a company that does an operating company our demo facility it's called the magic company and the magic management company and basically we do about 10 tons a day of em processing and so people want to come and see our equipment in action they can go there we're running in eighty thousand square feet the GMP qualified facility it's certified organic so we're running organic to people can really see what an operation looks like", "b44rkf89LII": "[Music] short fat distillation is almost the end of line in cannabis product manufacturing we have basic manufacturing of extracts and then we have distillation than you have chromatography and a high in analytics which tends also can go back in a distillation afterwards short path distillation has been shown to be an excellent solution in providing the maximum yield of the highest quality product and so we worked very closely with manufacturers in this industry and listen to what they had to say with a rotary evaporator without being able to control the cooling the rotary operator won't work it'll overheat and shoot the vapors right in the room so when you're running a rotary evaporator you're gonna have a hot bath a cold column and high vacuum without keeping that column cold the vacuum just going to pull vapor right through the system it's gonna rush out into the room the Pau science chillers that we supply with our customers are so heavy-duty that they never shift from a degree and they're able to keep the temperature on point every single time and they don't start going up in the middle of their run where vapour starts to escape the system they're able to control it and keep it all the way in the road about there are many areas in short craft distillation that require precise temperature control from heating the product to areas where you need a slight level of cooling of the product and then extremely low temperatures for the cold traps to maximize the longevity of your vacuum pumps and get the purest product possible so when the factors are making product a couple years ago even longer they were not aware of how clean you can make a product so in the process of distillation and even when the chromatography andrey distilling the product for purification we can remove a lot of the inactive compounds that serve you no therapeutic purpose when you're consuming cannabis there's parts of it there are therapeutic of the cannabinoids that are they're helpful in turbines and there's parts of the plant matter that's dissolved like fats waxes proteins lots of numerous things including bad flavor you can remove that and create a flavorless product that's very high in purity and actually clean and safe to consume if you're chiller is down you're not making money so people have really come to rely on poly science as a reliable solution that will maximize your yield and also keep your system up and running poly science allows us to control a lot of the equipment that's used in this process we have a lot of heat and a lot of cooling if those parameters are off you can be selecting different molecules or you could be having clogs in the system or you can be damaging your pumps so none of our equipment we manufacturer would be able to operate without cost nice choice [Music]", "lZZobKohdN0": "hi guys extract craft here and today we're back for another educational video on how to do filtration of your alcohol-based tincture so first thing that we had done was we soaked our plant material for about five minutes in the freezer the idea what that was to eliminate as much of the chlorophyll and waxes and lipids of the plant material into our final extract so by doing that in a sub-zero temperature we're going to eliminate a very very large amount of that so what we're going to use today is a Buchner funnel or Buechner funnel these are available on extract craft comm and what this is going to do is we use paper filters that sit in the bottom of the ceramic funnel and we actually have a vacuum hose hooked up to the side of the flask now what this does is it will actually pull the tincture down through the paper filter and into the flask creating a much much cleaner and finer end product we actually will be using the vacuum port on the source turbo as our vacuum assist on our flask so first thing we need to do is we need to go ahead and wet down our paper filter this ensures that when you apply the vacuum the paper filter sucks to the bottom of the funnel in order to make sure nothing goes underneath the paper so as long as you get all the edges and everything else we just want to make sure we got all that then we can go ahead and apply our vacuum so we take our hose and we just kind of hold it over top of the vacuum port and then we can start our process and one thing you want to make sure you do is leave your vacuum valve just a little bit open to ensure that we're pulling vacuum through the whole time and the Machine doesn't stop so we can go ahead and start our process here and then we want to make sure that our filter paper sets down nicely to the bottom and then once we have that we can go ahead and begin to apply our tincture just like that the vacuum pulls the tincture right through and down into the flask now one thing I like to do is I like to make sure I do at least three passes through the filter paper just to ensure that we've caught as much of the fine particle waxes and lipids that we can and just like that it sucks it right down so we can go ahead and stop the process here and then what we're going to do is we're going to do a second and a third pass also okay so now what we are doing is we're going to go ahead and prepare our second pass through our filter paper so we go ahead and hook this up start the process and like like before we want to make sure the paper filter sucks down to the bottom before we start to apply the tincture [Music] okay and now we're done with this second pass so we'll do one more pass after this okay guys so now we're back to do the third pass through the Buechner funnel one thing I wanted you to keep in mind was with your paper filters they're typically going to come in a fast medium or slow feed what's important is to use the fast paper filter on the initial pass on your first pass and then after that once the alcohol has been cleaned up a little bit after that first pass then we can go ahead and use the slow feed and catch even more of that particle and those waxes and lipids so we go ahead and put our paper filter in and we are going to wet it down as always make sure that's good and wet before we get started and okay and now we're going to once again use the source as our vacuum assist at that we make sure that paper filter is sucked down nicely and then we begin pouring in the tank share [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so now we go ahead and stop the process and we can actually remove our funnel and everything but after three passes through the Buechner funnel you should have a nice beautiful golden colored extract tincture ready to evaporate down you can get all these things the Buechner funnels and the kits and everything on extract

"Io1Ac_jClqw": "[Music] hi today I'd like to introduce you to kaplan fabrication and the future ethanol extraction for the cannabis industry as many of you know there are several methods of extraction currently on the market in this video I will highlight some of the key points that separate our ethos platform from the competition but first let's discuss your options [Music] buting well when it comes to butane safety is the number one concern the most operating all too often we hear stories of catastrophic failure even with the most advanced systems because of these safety concerns city and state regulations are becoming more and more stringent towards hydrocarbon extraction facility co2 co2 extraction is considered the safest method on the market today fortunately it's also the least efficient high startup costs low throughput and very heavy lipid contamination are common problems with all co2 systems ethanol at kapner we developed methods and systems that are bridge the gap between safety efficiency and environmental impact our ethos platform is capable of extracting sixty pounds in a 10-hour shift while using renewable food grade ethanol our proprietary supercooled method allows us to walk out any of the undesirable constituent during the extraction process our pressureless design prevents any solvent or flammable vapor from ever exiting the system during operation there's no risk of leaky valves or broken gaskets which can result in a potentially life-threatening situation ultra-pure extracts produced by our systems are completely free of chlorophyll and waxes and they're identical to those produced by hydrocarbons after the extraction process the ethanol is recovered in a rotary evaporator system under vacuum and low heat this allows us to preserve all the light aromatic molecules we call thirteen's oh and you should know that you will be able to reuse more than 80% of your ethanol for the next extraction [Music] I'm confident that after reviewing the data and comparing the safety efficiency and long-term operating expenses your choice will be clear your choice will be camera [Music] you", "9dvw92im-U0": "hello everyone and

marketing and TV\ncompanies in the industry we've been featuring plenty of magazines but here's\nwhat's amazing okay we have a record-breaking growth in the past few\nyears there's a watch this company growth company sells in millions in the\nlast few years let's just fast forward to 2017 2018 ok\n2017 my daily choice ends with about nine million dollars in annual revenue\n2018 over a hundred million dollars in annual revenue okay what happened okay\nthat's why we're here today that's why timing is key that's why time is so\nimportant okay I knew it a new product and your language introduced hemp works\nand we're gonna talk about that today okay\nnow let's talk about a business model that works take a look at this slide\nfocus on the right side first and a traditional company because a\ntraditional company pays celebrities TV radio billboards that's how they promote\ntheir products right that's they get retail to retail customers to\ncome in and purchase you know whatever product their promote okay that's great\nthat's awesome we chose a different model okay we chose word-of-mouth\nadvertising okay so we pay ordinary people like you and me to promote the\nproduct and super cool because think about this for a second okay\nsomeone in the past a friend family someone came to you and told you about a\nproduct about a service that you ended up using why because again word-of-mouth\nadvertising works now let's talk about a business of the 21st century okay so\nthese are industries that I'm sure all of you know so let's start with the NFL\nokay these are annual revenue sales so we're\nNFL nine and a half billion dollars in sales in a year okay music industry 16\nand a half billion video gaming industry this is probably all your halo lovers\nand Call of Duty fans right 67 billion okay now we have the movie industry 80\nbillion organic products 91 billion but you have no martini right a hundred and\neighty nine billion dollars in annual revenue I always tell everybody numbers\ndon't lie okay so you have right here an incredible timing and incredible\nindustry and it's just growing by the day\nokay now the CVD industry is booming this source right here comes from the\nhemp Business Journal so they're estimating okay that by 2022 annual\nrevenue and the hemp-based products is looking to be on the upwards of two\nbillion dollars okay what's crazy though is a few weeks after forced magazine and\nRolling Stones magazine they came out with an article saying that hemp-based\nproducts in the US is looking to be more than the twenty two billion dollar\nannual revenue and stuff okay so here's the way I look at this okay you're going\nfrom an industry right now that's averaging about six hundred million\ndollars in annual revenue that's looking to go by 2022 between two billion and\ntwenty two Billy you want to capture a piece of the\nmarket I know I do now let's talk about the history of hemp okay because hemp is\namong the oldest industries on the planet going back more than ten thousand\nyears literally American farmers in the beginning they were legally required to\ngrow hemp during the colonial era okay the first American flag was made from\nhemp the the Declaration of Independence was drafted on pen paper okay now\nfast-forward to 1937 Congress passes the Mary Jane Tax Act which effectively\nbegan the era of hemp prohibition okay fast-forward 2014 things things are\nmoving as things are changing right 2014 the farm bill allowed hemp in certain\nstates to start research ok Kentucky was a key player in that movement that's why\nwhen networks launched they decided to partner up with a farm in Kentucky which\nis amazing right now the movement is just getting started now\nfast forward to 2018 December 2018 President Trump\nsigns the 2018 farm bill which specified hemp and CBD as an industrial byproduct\nof criminalized by the DEA think about that it's a game-changer\nthat means you can now consume and sell CBD I was talking about Mary Jane versus\nhemp right because so think about it like this cannabis is the name for the\nplant genus hep and Mary Jane are two types of cannabis plants hemp comes only\nfrom one variety which is cannabis sativa while Mary Jane comes from two\nvarieties which is cannabis sativa in cannabis indica okay what really\nseparates hemp and Mary Jane is how they're grown because Mary Jane plants\nare grown far apart that way they can produce lots of branches and produce\ntons of flower right that flower has THC content which is you know what gets\nyou what gets you the high will get you the stony right now the other side we\nhave have plants hemp plants are grown more close together okay not that many\nbranches and they're only harvested before the plant produces flower so what\nhappened is a low concentration of THC and a high concentration of CBD okay now\nhere's the key is the key because in order for these products to be legal\nthey have to have 0.3 THC or less and they all they'll do they're all\ncompliant which is awesome now let's talk about isolate versus full spectrum\nokay because this is this is a question that I've been getting a lot lately\nwhat's the difference right so full spectrum full spectrum uses the whole\nplant extract so you're gonna get your CBD your CBG your CBC your cbn your\nTerps and your THC and that's only gonna be small traces okay but the difference\nis that your body your you already have an endocannabinoid system in you okay so\nwhen you take the full spectrum oil you produce the entourage effect okay so it\nactivates trillions of receptors in your body\nincredible right but let's say you're you know you're you're trying out for\nthe Olympics okay and you can you know risk having traces of THC or whatever so\nyou want to go with the isolate y because CVD on the isolate side all the\nother compounds are removed your CB GCB c CB and your herbs and obviously your\nTHC so you're only gonna have your CBD is gonna be a higher concentration of\nCBD per bottle you're not gonna have the entourage effect but you're still gonna\nfeel amazing now let's talk about the heme works difference\nwhat separates us from you know the oils out there okay first let's start with\nour farming because all our products are grown in the United States that's key\nactually you're not gonna risk taking something inside your body that's being\nshipped from a different country that you don't know if it's even been tested\nokay we our product go through a fresh lock\ndrying system which is key because what happens is everything gets tested from\nbacteria for mold everything that could be bad for you and for the product gets\nremoved before it goes out there to the market everything is grown in Kentucky\nfarms and his key FDA compliant okay now testing we go through all kinds of\ntesting antimicrobial testing we have our certificate of analysis potency test\nliterally you can go to the website you can click on on the on the test tab and\nyou can look up over 200 different tasks from perform different batches which is\nkey not extraction we only use co2 method which is obviously we don't use\nany alcohol or any ethanol any of that or we only use low temperature which is\nkey for the product okay so you don't have any any bad chemicals and in the\nprocess now minimal ingredients is key because we only use two ingredients CBD\nand hemp seed oil to carry the CBD and if you want to be more adventurous then\nyou can taste the flavor of peppermint and cinnamon and they're obviously\ndistilled all our products are non-gmo so they're produced in American farms we\nuse only sustainable methods obviously free of GMOs synthetics filters all that\nnuts nasty stuff like the other oils now\nlet's talk about testing and documentation okay because our products\nour team is it's so proud to be able to provide a product that is not only safe\nbut they can say that let's say you want to try it out okay let's say you know\nwhat Berto you know at the end of this presentation\nyour that you know what I want to try it out the the tincture I want to try out\nthe topical I I feel so good to know that say you don't like the product you\nhave 60 day money-back guarantee empty bottle no questions asked okay that's\nkey because when you're getting involved in a company and you're promoting a\nproduct is very important to know that your clients are gonna have a money-back\nguarantee in case does something doesn't fit with them okay so that's you you can\nrest assure that's what the product but again right everything is tested and you\nhave your money back guarantee no problems so let's get to the exciting\npart let's talk about our product because these are game changers right\nhere right we have a variety of products and if you if you think about it timing\ncouldn't be better 20:18 formula gets signed fast forward\ntoday few months after you can now start promoting products that are not only is\nnight changing view but are life-changing products so let's start\ntalking about our hem works tinctures because we have three different flavors\nokay and we have two different concentrations so premium oils are\navailable in 500 milligrams and 700 milligrams of CVD okay they're both\ngonna be the same size bottle they're just gonna have higher concentration now\ngoing into the flavors you're gonna have cinnamon natural and peppermint the\npeppermint is amazing that's my personal favorite now let's talk about our hem\nworks for pets because if you if you have a fairy pet right you have your\nfairy friend one of my best pots right indigo he loves these products right so\nlet's start with our dog treats we have him works dog treats these are they\ncontain two milligrams of CBD pretty cookie they're 100% natural and you're\ngonna have obviously wheat soy and corn free okay so you know they're gonna be\ngood for your pet now here's

for your for your furry friend okay and these are gonna be full spectrum CVD\nso we use the whole plant I'll tell you how we indigo again he's a Weimaraner\nit's probably like nine months old now super super hyperactive right but when\nhe takes his CVD after he runs he just relaxes it's it's awesome he loves it\nyou literally say CVD he's jumping now let's talk about our heme works topicals\nbecause so we have three different topicals we have the rhenium which is RV\nnew anti-aging cream helps reduce the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines\nand this product contains 50 milligrams of active CBD and obviously co THC and\nI'm gonna get stuck okay you get the revive our revived cream is infused with\ncollagen and retinol and help support you know there are the appearance of\ndiminish fine lines so beauty products amazing the product contains 50\nmilligrams of active CBD and again zero th see now the relief this is actually\nour most popular product the relief cream it's infused with emu oils and\nobviously other powerful ingredients but it contains again 50 milligrams of\nactive CBD and zero THC I use this one a lot all the time it's awesome now home\nworks coffee okay you and I know coffee hits among one of the hottest\ncommodities in the world okay so how cool is it that you can now have hemp\ninfused coffee right incredible so you have 150 milligrams of hemp CBD per box\nokay they're gonna be organic medium row stick array Bick say that with me\narray big coffee beans now you got the key of coffee creamers now these come in\nhazelnut vanilla and mocha these are gonna be 75 milligrams of hemp the ripe\nCBD per box five milligrams per cup so if you take these two combined that's 10\nmilligrams per cup of coffee which is an equal amount of taking one full dropper\nof the 500 milligram oil all right let's talk about\nour compensation plan I always say this because if you're gonna get involved in\na business especially if you're

"oLUXQDJlyLw": "okay Vincent corporation in Oregon I ran a four-minute time test with a twin screw 6-inch press running off of 240 three-phase power off this generator and in four minutes I processed this stuff right here this is post CBD extracted hemp material so they've grew it in large quantities 50 to 500 acres they put it through a modified silage chopper that basically took the plant and just reduced it to this and broke up all the flowers you can sort of see some flowers in there this is what they end up with this their waste material so in four minutes remain forty-two pounds after the four minutes that material that was just in that bucket here turns into this powdery plant material biomass and that you can do something with that but we've taken them up we have extracted point eight gallons of ethanol and there should be some good amounts of CBD oil in that so if you scale that up in an hour's time you could do about six hundred and thirty pounds you'd have about eleven gallons so with your waste material get about 11 gallons back per our process that for CBD oil get your ethanol back where you use it in the future and you could figure out something to do with this anyways um this is what we do its incorporation we can handle 630 pounds an hour 150 pounds an hour up to 35,000 pounds an hour if that's what you want", "-WFXgC4dEps": "[Music] [Music] after the hemp is dried we grind it down into small pieces so that we can then extract it [Music] once the hemp is ground up we put it into these porous bags that then go into our extraction lab welcome to the lab follow me our extraction facility is a clean room so before anyone goes in there we have to get fully scrubbed up so that we don't bring any contaminants in with us now we're going to take you through the extraction process the first step is the ethanol soak bags full of hemp are loaded into a centrifuge where they are soaked with usda certified organic cane sugar ethanol the ethanol extracts the cannabinoids and terpenes from the flowers and leaves after soaking the ethanol becomes a vibrant green color filled with all of the plants natural compounds making a full spectrum oil in the next step of the process we remove the ethanol by slowly heating it so that we are left with pure organic hemp extract as the ethanol heats up it vaporizes and then condenses on cold coils we do our extraction under very low heat as cannabinoids and terpenes can be burned off at higher temperatures raw cbd oil is a dark black almost molasses like substance we take the raw cbd oil and use it to formulate our products", "1K5QXPeQDbw": "The global cannabis industry is on course for significant growth. As interest in cannabis and CBD oils develop, markets are continuing to expand and diversify leaving manufacturers not only with the challenges of increased supply but with demands for higher quality, stability and consistency.

factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks

rating so the C rating means that pesticide-free mold-free East free bacterial free we have to physically grind it and see the smallest size to fit into our extraction of machines when you actually grind the materials you're mixing up the different trichomes plant materials and basically have it to where when you pressurize and pack into a vessel which is well show you the extraction it in that vessel there's no room there's no air pockets so when you actually pressurize that vessel you have the the best yield or potential for oil content that comes out of that vessel so in here is our grinding area right after grinding you would bring the source material here we have four supercritical extraction machines they're made from the corporation called waters corporation we decided to use these machines based on the fact that they specialize in analytical testing equipment extraction per minute for the nutraceutical Markarian history how did you learn about all the stuff yes so my journey started when my son was diagnosed with autism he's eight years old now and I started to try cannabis high CBD formulations and from before you give your son something that you don't know you research the heck out of it and from that research becomes passion and that passion becomes you need to learn everything about it so just why I'm standing here is I'm doing for my son and that's the every single person I talked to from investors to mayors of cities to fire marshals that and you know help us along the way with building this facility it's why you doing this or I have one mission and that mission is to enhance society and heal the world with cannabis yeah because by doing that by enhancing society you do the best practices by here in the world you figure out what's the best formulation for conditional based and my my conditional basis I want to heal is autistic children and also helping people understand what autism is and how cannabis directly helped my son Andrew it's such important work because there's a lot of oil around yeah right and we talked about how some of them are manufactured in places that aren't license like bas necessarily so the fact that you're here doing it the right way for the right reasons is so important for the industry is forward to I think I think that you said the right thing is it's the right time it's the right industry it's the right people I think the combination of why people invest in start and start up their companies is their scope of work and operators you can have ideas but if you don't have the right team you know if you don't have the right systems everybody's not successful you don't prove your concept by proving this concept and by creating a lab like this that is transparent as you can see this is something that we want to educate everybody from patients all the way to farmers to law makers is this is why we built in design bs resource leaders from here we will do the post chemistry so like you said we marinate the meat we got it to the right condition and size with its raw meat so the bulk oil that we create the machine is great is transfer over to our chemistry lab for that fine-tuning which is called links rosacea we just left the extraction room and this is what comes out of the extraction correct we have although there yeah so what we have here is some co2 extract of cannabis oil [Music] once we have the raw co2 extract we end up putting it through a process called winterization and that preserves it for the winter or winter is coming well though the term winterization occurs because we actually bring it to sub-zero temperatures because the solubility of the waxes and other undesirable elements of the cannabis oil extract can be removed because they're insoluble in the cold ethanol in the process of winterization we would dilute the raw extract into another material which we then homogenized with these stirs and then that would go into the freezer for a certain period of time depending upon the batch size and the protocols for that specific material and then it's winterized so this would be what would be characterized as an Amber oil okay so it'd be darker in color alright and this would be of a potency between 60 65 % cannabinoid content okay got it so we're getting closer to the end concentrate levels actually we have some right over here so if you look in this small jar you can see this golden kind of clear oil and that oil is is known as clear in the industry but we know it in chemical terms to be a distillate or a distilled product and in the larger container it would look more like this so it takes on a slightly different color we'll pretty transparent exactly yeah so this brings up a really interesting question I'm pretty anecdotally that the darker the oil the less pure or less healthy it is so this is kind of what the end result looks but how much truth is that I mean if you're looking to smoke a babe cartridge should you look for something more clear well there's different preferences the clearer the product doesn't necessarily imply that it is of higher potency okay there are certain practices within the industry where people do use other materials that would still add no color to it but would lower the potency but in this case what you would have is you would have certain elements of the plant that are not removed yet in the distillate and that a president in the amber now those aren't necessarily any less safe but they aren't cannabinoids in their own right other things that we do collect in this process when we refine the cannabis plant material all the way to the final product is a lot of the material that leaves the cannabis plant is very desirable these are the terpenes that we know and love those phytochemicals have medicinal properties and they also give the characteristic odor and flavor that people familiarize themselves with when they think of cannabis so what we do is we're able to reintroduce those terpenes back into our final products based upon what type of matrix it's going into whether it's an edible of a product a because otherwise the final product would be totally odorless totally tasteless correct or yes if everything works perfectly if everything goes as planned it's so and then you have to add everything back in so depending on what the final product is going to be you adding each terpene there exactly and it depends on what we're designing as well if we're trying to design something that would have anti-inflammatory effects for a certain patient group then we would isolate certain terpenes that we'd like to use in that profile I'm just trying to do one thing well is to formally oil from any plant that I believe in let's help my son personally and find a way to share with the rest of the world Wow yeah so basically if it's good enough for your son it's good enough for the rest of the world and that's what we have to stop start operating right we have to start taking care of the people around us and making sure that the stuff that we're distributing is the best quality to sea level cleanest that you're talking about right well not any of that but who's doing it right who's part of your team why are you doing it how are you doing it those questions I've had when I was looking for formulations and medicine for my son there's no answer so so really our business plan or you can say a business plan that we had was answering all those questions and then finally coming up with a solution and the blessings and responsibility to do just that to answer the how you're doing it who are you gonna work with and what you're doing it what's the outcome mmm and it doesn't come cheap I mean this is a pretty sophisticated facility yeah talk about your fundraising to date a little bit we did a friends and family around we raised about 1.5 million it was a convertible note with a 18-month repayment or when we do a series a raise they'll convert yeah at a 20% discount okay from there that 1.5 quickly guy utilize as any startup and you basically go holy crap I need more money gonna be five times more than one so we're out a 3.5 to 4 million dollar all-in from development to permitting fees to fire sprinkling systems to chemical resistant epoxy floors explosion-proof freezers I mean the list goes on and on when you're trying to be compliant when there is no playbook there aren't excuse my English art not a word but there is not something here that you can follow that you can reproduce this because this is a brand new field there's no precedent there's a brand new leadership and we just felt that we have to lead by example and do the right thing yeah I mean doing it right is not cheap you know it's easy to cook up some concentrates in your basement and do it illegally at a small scale but when you scale up like this and you got the fire inspector in here and you need the HVAC system you got to raise a lot of money you're you're even raising more now correct you're just telling me that you're finishing up the round how's that how's that going we're doing a series a round and it's going very well because now we have proof of concept and you start up you got proof of concept you have have ability to scale and then you got to sell your product if your product it's not good no one's gonna buy it so if I do a hindsight looking back is my main question is a why hasn't there been more opportunities for startups like ourselves to be in this industry so why do you think that it's regulation and just maybe the wrong mix of people God so give me a little bit of the pitch to investors I mean how big is this concentrates opportunity let's put it this way we know operators that probably can sell forty five thousand pens excuse me to vape pens like say half a gram yeah in a month okay and that's three or four dispensaries Wow in California alone with thirty-eight million people in the population but in the medical side you have a few thousand collectives I think this consumption a day is about a hundred kilos of oil Wow in a day Wow okay so the total addressable market here is massive yes how about the risk side of it I mean how do you get investors comfy with doing this I mean still Schedule one drug or 280 doesn't allow you to write off any of your business expenses federally right what's your response to some of those things my response is if you don't have a permit or you don't have a city gonna back you up to allow you to operate safely and invest into a capital raise that will you can own your equipment and you can operate with talent a talent pool that will have payroll have medical benefits and stay with you for you know three to four years as any startup grows don't invest into this industry mm-hmm by having the permanent by having have to purchase the building and be our own landlords investors saw the vision they saw our scope of work our mission statement and that we could be successful or for scaling up like any business you got a scale up but that's really important there's a certain level of exclusivity here right you're the first and only currently facility of its kind right how many more or they're gonna be I mean how much do you think about that is there competition coming people are I think I'm weird by saying this but I want more licenses I want more operators because then it raises the bar it it makes my job a lot easier to go to a city that may have someone else that had to go through the hoops that we've had to gone through with Berkeley and don't get me wrong they support us but it was a it was a long list of to dues that we had to fulfill so if I had to do this every single city and municipality to get a lab going I don't have the time but if there are other companies that pop up at permitting and we're one of the ten in that city to make a great product that's great less work and why not just create a brand of your own I mean you're you're white labeling for a lot of your your co-branding but why not just you know make bas concentrates and that's it well I mean our main premise and focus is to make formulations and great oil to support other companies to be able to share in our ability to do just that just make all however you'd like I was explaining through your other process of extraction how long you want to cook it and what quality you want that's not what for us to decide we want to perfect the process and that our brand is to make bulk oil formulated and support companies to utilize our base product so just shifting gears a little bit I love to connect kind of a professional work that you do during the day with just like what kind of consumer you are you know so right what kind of canvas do you like what kind of oils you know what what's your deal I've never medicated with cannabis okay okay grew up in a very conservative family chose my profession to be a holistic practitioner but I've tried a lot of CBT right so if you don't know difference in CBD and THC or not again so that non psychoactive but I've I've just never chose that as a lifestyle or advice to be medicated with cannabis but I have to try my formulations that I was given to my son with CBD but this some of that have to see to make me euphoric not really because I try to eliminate that part of the formulation to help my son so yeah people ask me all the time are you kidding me you don't medicate with you know what it is I guess my question is do you feel like an outsider ever does it ever feel weird when people say to you like oh you don't want to get high man I do to ask what I do and it's it's it's a fine line right between I think the stigma that I have is that when I was pitching for funding when I was talking to a lot of lawmakers and cities and mayor's they asked me that question have you smoked marijuana and I said no whether that made it easier from either raise money or whether that was more convincing as someone that I'm not excuse the term pothead mm-hmm I don't know I use both ways like this it is skilled both ways and I'm happy where I am and I'm happy being a co-founder operator of a cannabis extraction lab and I've never medicated with cannabis I think it's a really important distinction it's a proof point of how good this business opportunity is yes it's not a lifestyle business for you a lot of people that make edibles or they run a dispensary they just love cannabis well for you it's it's about dollars and cents and of course the great work that you've done with your son right people like him right so understanding how did it monopolize by taking a plant and making it to a commodity and that's that's I think the the sole reason why people believe in our company and why they invest in our company is our belief system and passion behind making it a commodity and monopolizing in the sense where if you're the leader or something you got to have the best product that actually works very well set plug some stuff here bas-reliefs comm any twitter handle's instagram any social stuff that you guys do bas research is are basically every brand and everywhere we pride in what that means and that's what doesn't mean what's best and best akha cultural services okay all right so without the agricultural division of this industry you don't have the plan without the best practices and services you don't have the science in the system by putting those together we can treat basically that's the supply chain and by controlling the supply chain you have a product you can trust them awesome Trust is everything that's why you've tested multiple times four or five times I was hearing in a lab good stuff it makes me feel good that the concentrates I'm putting into my body or maybe from here on alkaline rag in my body are being created with such care and science and really thinking through all these different elements so thank you for the great work that you do and for having us all here and thanks guys for watching we'll see you next time [Music] [Music] [Music]", "0stkxYsD42A": "[Music] welcome to inner health botanical CBD hemp oil education series dr. Sanjay Gupta neurosurgeon and CNN's chief medical correspondent has reversed his position and now speaks out strongly in favor of the use of cannabis to treat various medical conditions he states I think we've been terribly and systematically misled in this country and I did part of that misleading dr. Gupta further states they're refusing to look at the benefits of the product is irresponsible why should you care about CBDs because hemp extract and especially one of its components can Abbott at all is an excellent supporting agent for a healthy inflammatory response in the body world-renowned heart surgeon dr. Dwight Lundell States as a heart surgeon with over 25 years experience having performed over 5,000 open-heart surgeries today is my day to right the wrong with medical and scientific fact he continues the only accepted therapy was prescribing medications to lower cholesterol in a diet the severely restricted fat intake these recommendations are no longer scientifically or morally defensible the discovery a few years ago that inflammation in the arterial wall is the real cause of heart disease is slowly leading to a paradigm shift and now heart disease and other chronic ailments will be treated if such prominent individuals as dr. Gupta and dr. Lyndell are stepping forward to correct and promote new health alternatives perhaps it is time to ask yourself if you or someone you care about could benefit by adding CBD to your health protocol so how do you go about choosing the right CBD hemp oil for your health needs when examining CBDs it can be confusing as to which ones are safe and effective and there are a variety of different processes used to extract and create CBD concentrates all with varying degrees of efficacy for any product you select the safety and quality of the ingredients and the extraction method used are of utmost importance first let's address toxicity from a safety perspective toxicity from residual solvents can be harmful especially if a person's immune system is compromised in any way general health hazards associated with solvent exposure include damage to the nerves respiratory and reproductive systems as well as damage to the liver and kidneys to mitigate toxicity it is important to know which extraction process has been used when creating any herbal extract including CBD oil the extraction method using ethanol produces a complete profile of the plant the end result is a more dynamic and active product with components that are able to work together to create synergies within the body once extracted another essential question is what is the best carrier oil to deliver the extract into the body to further improve absorption taste and safety inter Health's whole hemp and other extracts are suspended in a medium chain triglyceride MCT derived from coconut oil when MCT oil is metabolized in the body it behaves more like a carbohydrate than a fat and as a carrier agent it also provides a host of additional health benefits that have long been associated with coconut oil products and enhanced benefit for anyone using herbal extracts is that MCT does not require digestive enzymes or bile acids to achieve digestion and absorption thereby being quickly and efficiently assimilated into the body it is the intention of inner health botanicals to be much more than just another herbal in CBD product provider it is our mission to deliver the highest quality products on the market all of our extracts and other nutritional products are crafted for purity and with your safety in mind our 17 years in the business and long list of repeat customers confirm the fact that

we're on hot mike all right hey thank you for being here what a beautiful day we have it is a beautiful day yeah thank you for noticing that's very good look at it outside i know it's nice we got a whole bank of windows behind james and april yeah so sometimes they catch shadows on us well yes they cast big shadows hey welcome thank you for being here today is going to be a great day uh those of you who are looking for delta dawn i mean delta eight um i was singing delta dawn earlier we were if we were singing together we were i didn't know if you wanted to admit having some no i thought we did what's the flower you have on i know it kind of ages us just brings me back to the the truck the ford truck you know as a kid what do you mean with the little radio on there it's right out there not that far forget it okay okay welcome thank you for being here lots of resources today we've got questions all over the place we've got an r d lab set up you can see it right over my shoulder here and so we'll be migrating over there hopefully without any technical difficulties i think we'll do it it'll be good it'll be great great great hey by the way samuel gorton from ennisburg falls vermont vermont best bourbon yeah oh i re not to diss kentucky bourbons but vermont bourbons are really good samuel he won um uh what did he win t-shirt and some other goodies jared is saying here he won by doing one of our quizzes on linkedin so apparently we have quizzes on linkedin okay all right i wonder what we quizzed i don't know interesting i'll have to find that yeah hey congratulations samuel so check out the quizzes let me know how those are uh we do have live tours cbd jam sessions advanced extraction guides distillate guides calculators mini courses we've got all kinds of resources thank you for being here if this is the first time you're here there's a little red button on the top that will allow you to refresh the screen if for any reason you get frozen just hit refresh it doesn't take you out you don't have to relog in or anything that's really good uh this is a fun and safe place uh there are poll questions so i'm just going back to this bourbon question i think you know we should do a kentucky versus vermont bourbon smackdown oh that would be fun blind taste test i like get to it i do like that now i know you know vermont has some really good rye bourbons that's my preference i like rye bourbon so we'd have to kind of do wheat and rye okay all right that's fine and then do kind of two different flights yeah well that's gonna be a fun afternoon you know we were talking uh before about doing uh like a scotch tasting online yeah and it'd be kind of fun to fun to do that we should also do a scotch bourbon smackdown oh yeah well there's no there's no comparison i thought bourbon would obviously win we just noticed canadian whiskey didn't even make the but see a lot of the vermont rye comes from canadian rye no i like that that whiskers that you have wisers yeah wisers jp wisers uh is really good but that's a canadian whiskey it it is it but it is a bourbon but it comes via vermont it is really good but it is it is a canadian right anyway the more you drink the wiser you get all right we should probably not digress too much i guess what yeah we got a lot of ground recovery this is delta okay questions please introduce yourself um also ask questions no holds barred questions everything is going simple tough join the chat invite your friends there will be a replay there will be a replay there will be a replay all right um today's topic is everything delta eight yeah delta eight delta eight thc you know then you know we've all heard of you know what has happened with delta 9 delta 9 thc dhca we've got all that cbd a those are all kinds of things going pure thc so we've got a lot of things that we're going into on delta eight the questions are here and i'm guessing you have a presentation i do you have any tables i do he's got tables yes shocking i do i have a table and and okay so this is gonna be uh it's gonna be a lot of fun can we get going i think i think we have started okay you have it i thought we lost you there okay here's here's what happened okay so we went into like okay we're gonna make delta eight so we actually made our first delta eight this week kind of cool there's been a lot of buzz about it and uh so i spent monday in the laboratory and bam we got it with a little help from my friend uh shout out to jagger so thanks a lot for that he basically helped me along and i'm like oh do this do this okay whatever and so we're just going to kind of show you our results what we got how we did it it's pretty simple uh i was pretty shocked at how simple it was so i've got these like jager yeah all right not the mick oh that's the mc version different jagger okay let's uh so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna go into just a little bit of the presentation and then uh we have a lab little lab set up rather than moving you know into the facility and having a gown up and everything it'd probably take five minutes to get it all done so i just brought the lab here into our studio and uh we'll just kind of i'll show you how i did it so i love that this is a picture uh whenever you say lab just so you know i always get a little worried because i i have this feeling that i'm going to be tasting something oh yes we okay i get a little nervous it just happened it's the anticipation yeah okay sorry go no no no i think we should okay everybody who thinks that we should have my friend randy here um to try out some of this beautiful oh delta eight do we have this that'll be fun because i've got meetings this afternoon do we have the puff bar where is the puff bar okay i i think jared had the puff part can we get that here just make sure i got it okay all right okay all right i don't even know what a puff oh okay okay oh shoot it said it was broke oh okay so okay whatever we we're we're probably not going to try on there maybe you dodged the bullet okay or whatever so look at this beautiful beautiful stuff usually it's it's like crystal white clear but jagger told me hey look uh it doesn't it people don't like to have it like super clear because it it like colorless okay because it doesn't look like real stuff so um if you you know if you process it it like gives you a nice yellow color and we got similar colors it was just a little darker because we didn't have time to distill it all so i'll but i'll show you what we got right over there awesome um so how do i advance this and while you're advancing bowden we agree nice bowden and jeff oh there we go nice okay so here's the outline i'm going to help you guys out because we've got a little bit of material to cover um tell you you know basically show you what delta 8 is from a chemical uh structure purpose i like that you use the delta sign rather than spelling it out that's that's pretty rad yeah you're you must be an analytical chemist phd um is is delta a a newly discovered cannabinoid oh it might work hold the phone what uh no okay so i'll just answer that in one question i won't work no okay uh how do i make delta eight okay we're going to go over that it's going to be pretty simple uh what equipment do i need to make delta eight how do i scale it up and how does delta a to thc affect me and is delta h thc illegal so there's a lot of material here to cover and plus i got a demo so i want to make sure we go quick pretty quick are you going to answer those last two questions before i taste it no all right here we go so oh wow guys this is this is like getting into some true chemistry okay this is great okay this is the structure chemical structure of cbd you can notice there's a couple different things uh that differentiated from thc which is right here you can see there's this there's this fused ring oxygen here right there and um yeah i think that that's basically it that's that's the main difference wow they're probably making some delta eight that's t-rex can you guys hear that okay all right so and then here's delta eight the main difference is that the location of this double bond here you can see that the delta eight and uh is over here it's switched sides it's switched sides right so there's really hardly any difference except for the location of the double bond but it is chemically distinct obviously okay so that's what delta eight thc is pretty simple i'm gonna keep this all really high level uh guys so we're not gonna go into very many details but a lot of people wanna know how to convert their cbd into this molecule and they want to know how to convert their thc that they maybe get out of a remediation process and convert that over to delta h so we're going to kind of go over those two two steps here um look at this okay this is a chromatogram this looks awesome what a chromatogram is is it's a separation technique and this is a hplc separation technique look at this green one right here this is my standard okay so here's um this is t uh cbda this is cbd and then this is cbn this is thc and this is cbc okay so those are my standards look how nice and clean they are they're all nicely separated from each other okay now look this this pink line here is actually some of the delta eight we made yesterday you can see that uh we have some little tiny bit of the probably some of the cbd here or i'm sorry some of the thc here you can see that but you can see there's all kinds of other stuff in there but this big lump here uh basically that's that's delta eight delta eight comes out right here in the in the chromatogram it's not just post thc it's just right after thc yeah so we're going to kind of go in about how to do that and then also we're going to kind of talk a little bit about these other minor products that are um that are produced and what they may be and what you need to know about it so is is is delta new is delta 8 a new phenomenon well it may be a new market phenomenon but it's not really new from the standpoint of people trying to make it out of cbd um this is a paper going back all the way to 1966. well i thought it was from 1400s this goes back all the way to 1481. it was the tetrahedon era yes that's great i'm sorry ah that's good i like that um okay so yeah 1966 so i was six years people have been talking about this um you know this is the machulum paper and he has tons of literature on there so um he was starting to do the same exact thing that i'm going to show you how to do basically you see you take cbd you put it into a vessel you boil it up with some this case he's using ethanol and hdl which is an acid um and it's it's an isomerization reaction that occurs he says it's a catalysis reaction and he does actually use catalysis okay um but uh there's evidence in his other papers that you don't actually have to use the catalytic materials and i'll go through what that is in just a moment but you can see he's using you know just normal chemistry techniques he's got some ether solution and uh yeah and then um he's drying it with some sodium sulfate so that's very very clear so it's really not um you can see it's it's not it's not new at all it's been around for a very very long time and all of the side reactions and side products they're kind of listed at them all in there but they're not um you know each each condition that you have might produce different uh reaction products so you're gonna have to know what those reaction products are before you sell your stuff or make it uh yeah you make it and then you characterize it and then you can sell it you don't want to sell something for example with a bunch of unknowns in it right no so that's that we talk about that all the time we do talk about that all the time and that that's one of the you know kind of the um techie type of bucket chemistry you go on to youtube you watch a video like this one try to go do it and then you try to use it you're you're basically creating um you know you got to look out for residuals number one and then you also got to look out for for other those other side reaction products that you don't know what's in there sure so this is another example of another paper um here he's using p p toluene sulfonic acid okay if you go online and you you read the techie blogs and stuff they're always talking about this a toluene sulfonyl acid right exactly um and you can see in this case it's two hours rather than 18 hours right so so they're using this as a lewis acid kind of catalyst it's in there at a catalytic amount meaning it's it's a very small amount um there was in this paper it just makes it go faster yeah they even talk about yeah it goes faster they even talk about the mechanisms in there if you guys want to go look at that knock yourself out you know um also other different types of uh you know derivatives of thc he's got a lot of a lot of uh you know papers on that i'm not gonna go through this but i'm i'm basically highlighting the fact that this is very old very well known there's you can see here he's using ethanol he's using hydrogen chloride for two hours he's got a different he's again boiling so you can you can kind of just precursor and read the literature and get an idea how to do this well use an acid use a maybe a lewis acid and you boil it up while stirring um and make sure that it's done in the hood so that it's not you know evolving you know evolving acid out into the air and make sure you're wearing gloves and good good ppe with your eyes and stuff so how to make delta hthc this is this is quite simple you dissolve yourself how to make delta eight thc you notice i'm in it the delta the black i did i like that and i even superscripted i did see that that now that is that is actually the way it's supposed to be if you look into all the literature that's the correct nomenclature delta to the eighth power yes i guess so so if you if you don't want to be an ignorant um no i can't what are you saying uh no this is how you normally would uh this is how i normally am is that what you're saying my big stop sign just came up don't say it don't say it okay hot mic i see i do have a filter okay so um rarely okay this so your first step is you dissolve cbd in non-polar organic solvent you can use a lot of different kinds of solvents i'll kind of go over in my table i'll show you some of the different options that you have so a non-polar organic solvent for people like me yeah it just means it's not cold [Laughter] it could be cold or hot but polar uh generally refers thank you for that joke i like that uh it just refers to its polarity so ethanol would be considered a polar solvent uh water would be considered a polar solvent but non-polar would be something like pentane or hexane or something like that just checking yep okay i got your back guys all right and then add uh add the acid whether it's lewis or bronsted-acid which is your acid okay hcl in the case of michelin he's using hdl use p he used the sulfonic acid right lewis branstad yeah yeah thank you sorry um and then um and then you stir in it's pretty critical that you get up to this uh you know 100 degrees celsius and i noticed i didn't superscript that sorry guys and then one to eight feet hours it depends so do you take turns stirring um yeah you know you get no we got a little star bar the stir bar stirs it's an automatic yeah it's an automatic stirrer yeah okay so and then you have a temperature uh hot plate so you can use a stirring hot plate for this and you can do it right on the bench um you know um and then and then basically there's some post-processing steps we tried different types of acids we tried acidic acid formic acid nitric acid we tried um you know like a solid support for the acid using a lewis acid like illumina for example just boiling up the acid in the alumina these are some things that i'll show you in the options it's no problem you get conversion with all of them it's just the fat matter of how fast it is and um how how quickly it goes how fast it is and then what the side products are so that's that's the main thing once you have obviously you have this acidic uh stuff over here um you're gonna have to dry it or neutralize it typically use a sodium bicarbonate you'll get you get two phases and then sometimes people extract with another polar non-volatile or volatile solvent like ether or something like that okay it is not out it's not necessary um you can just it'll wash out some of the color some of the products and things like that if you use a little bit of carbon in here you can also take out some of the color that you see you know in the first slide and then you obviously do testing so you're you're taking this pot right here that that is the stir and you're testing it and then making sure that after you wash it you know you're testing it again and you're testing it you're always testing it now this this final product is going to have delta 9 in it so you thought oh i'm going to use my isolate and go all the way to delta eight it'll be perfect well it's not really because you have to remediate it again right okay so now you're now you're back to thc remediation so and it's never you know it's not never so the conversion is not a hundred percent so you got to make sure that you realize that um actually i think i'm going to skip this this is my little video oh here i got a video here okay and this is my yesterday this is one of my reactions that i was doing this is 50 grams that looks like an automatic stirrer oh oh oh what in the heck okay i don't think it's working it's melting too much hcl and then something happened oh my gosh oh poor doug he's not with us anymore okay all right here i'm gonna i'm gonna go to the next one here and i'm gonna skip this one too because obviously our movies didn't work because i'll show you in real time that's better right yes okay so this is the sources of the raw materials you can use um a delta nine distillate um you know you want to make sure that it's not wind it's fully winterized distilled obviously um a lot of people like to use their isolate delta nine waist you know because you'll get delta nine uh out when you make your isolate cbd crystals okay and you'll have this delta nine and usually people just uh really get rid of it right um they can't sell it as a part of a hemp product obviously that's why they have they have that there so um that's the isolate way of using it um and probably what's gonna happen it's gonna be more complex because you're you know you'll have you'll be you'll be stirring with acid for basically everything right you're stirring it and then everything's reacting that's that's in that slough okay so it's kind of tough to identify what the products are the cleanest way to do it is just to use cbd isolate okay and that's something that you know a lot of people can do also this delta nine fraction would have essentially the same problems as this isolate delta nine waste but you can use this delta nine fraction convert it over to uh c are converted over to delta eight and then use the chromatography again to separate out the delta eight delta nine the stuff that hasn't converted over okay so it's it's pretty simple but again you would be using the same type of thing you'd use some sort of uh acid or lewis lewis acid along with a combination of an acid stirring in a non-polar solvent and you heat it up to 100 degrees to start that's it wow so it's pretty pretty simple um here's some examples of some acid washes and neutralizers that you guys now if you go look at the literature there's this boron trifluoride that's the um you know what mushulum calls a catalyst okay and it is a lewis acid catalyst and basically it's an electron vacuum cleaner it says okay i see electrons there i'm going to suck them up let's take out the electrons yeah that's right so that's all that's also the reason why alumina is is in this list here aluminum is also a lewis acid um and zirconia would work too um and then you have but you you typically would acid wash that so you can buy that all commercially you can acid wash alumina which is basically you're just you're just boiling alumina in in an acid drying it neutralizing the supernatant and then using it you know so that it's delivering the acid this is probably the easiest way to deal with um deal with the process because you're just dealing with a powder rather than a liquid and then you have this p toluene sulfonic acid alumina silicate washed acid and magnesium silicate washed acid uh these uh there's all of these reported in the literature and there's many more yeah like a lot so donald once donald that should answer your question if you've got more questions just let us right but i think that you know you can use um something as simple like we did we got conversion with just acetic acid yeah so we got conversion with hcl we form a gas so we got conversion it's just a matter of how long it took to get there so it's still still is converting gotcha um one thing about um acetic acid in formic acid is that they are soluble in your solvent uh in this case a heck uh alkane which would be heptane or pentane or whatever you guys are using there it would be soluble there so not all of these are soluble i don't know i don't think nitric acid is soluble in an alkane maybe someone can put that in there but i don't think it is but but certainly acetic acid is and you've got to use glacial by the way which is glacial acetic acid which is uh a very highly purified form of 100 and it'll go right into your hair sounds cold yes it's glacial into your polar solvent nonpolar solvent okay um okay so then you have your solvents obviously there have been reports i mean there's some solvents here that you just don't want to use or even have in your laboratory at all okay yeah don't don't don't bring benzene to your laboratory certainly they'll break toluene into your laboratory you know you can use some alkanes um the issue with the alkanes obviously just by the n alkanes which are the more purified form of alkanes you are going to have to worry about residuals okay yeah and because they will have them so when you um go to your laboratory to get your hplcs done to see how pure you are make sure you give a blank to them right any acid you use is going to have something that absorbs in the in the uv and it's going to show up there so i would also take and make sure that you're not just looking at one wavelength have them look at the entire spectrum meaning um have them do a scan from 220 nanometers all the way up into the visible like uh 300 and 350 nanometers okay what that's going to do is 20 to 350. yeah have them scan it they have a certain type of detector that they use for that and that'll allow you to identify if there's more issues associated with uh residuals and things like that so and we have we have several podcasts on you know just basically talking about residuals right we do and so you guys can go back we'll post them in the notes uh you guys can go back and take a look at that excellent um bronstead acids okay these are just acids and like i said we got conversion with just just a straight up acid we got conversion of combinations of acids i think you know in terms of the best one we just uh you know it was acetic acid um with this aluminum acid wash that's was the best one we just washed this uh aluminum acid in the acetic acid and then it worked out real good excellent so richard had a couple of good questions yeah this whole process that we're talking about is this an isomerization process isomerization isomerization yes yes that's that's correct that was close yes all right and then the other question he had a follow-up question is as we're using these does one methodology get a more consistent result than another um you know what i i can't say i have enough experience with it at the moment to really say okay hey this this is better than the other one we got like i said we got a conversion with any of these in it and if you just use these types of acids they're easy to remove um so when you scale up your process you need to think about a couple different things of course the cost of the process the cost of the consumables uh you're going to want to make sure that you have you know an easy way uh conversion wise so you don't have a lot of delta nine right because if you if you're just taking your cbd and you're converting it to delta eight but you have a bunch of delta nine there you're still not able to sell it right okay and that is unlawful that is exactly what happened in our case okay we had delta nine in there um which which then means you would have to um you would have to go and do some chromatography or thc remediation which should we have a another podcast on that you guys can go back and take a look we have a a whole podcast on separations and our pier 99 is a great way to do that absolutely so yeah so that's a couple different things there just so there's no real magic bullet you're always going to produce uh in a boiled acid reaction you're going to produce a whole bunch of different products there and you know you really should know what you're producing before you sell it and you should be my guest kind of have an idea what you're doing or it just sounds dangerous i already thought of that oh yeah look at that beware unknowns and residuals this would be the danger yeah it should be in red yeah okay so let's just kind of let's kind of talk this through guys okay if these are solid supports you you're gonna get residuals and leachables from those solid supports you need to make sure they're pure okay okay when you run your uh when you run your reaction you should run a blank reaction okay this this is just common knowledge you run a bank reaction you you work it up with not no active product and then you shoot it and see what you're you're producing see if you're extracting anything from those materials because not all the materials are equal okay i mean you you can go on to for example okay um a good example of that would be if i took the alkanes and i added you know like a luminol acid wash and i had some carbon in there and i boiled it up you would be extracting lots of benzopyrenes for example those are cancer-causing issues no who wouldn't know that that's what you do you would you would be doing that and the other problem with that obviously would be you if you didn't know what it was you wouldn't test for it you give your consumer i said say hell look at this it's all perfect it's good because you're not testing for it so yeah don't don't don't do that so don't don't be that guy don't be that guy okay same thing with yourself i'll come and bite you in the yeah you wanna you wanna okay i use distilled solvents or distill them you know and take all the water out of them and you can redistill them over like sodium metal is my favorite sodium metal yeah sodium metal i like that yeah with a little liquid nitrogen on the cool trap it sounds like that could be another music jam yeah we could sodium metal we got some sodium metal there okay um yeah it's a little sodium metal there yeah that's all right all right oh yeah yeah we got yeah that this is so this is this is just a little little break from the tables [Music] all right okay that was a little bumper music for the getting uh to the rest of the yes final one we do there will be a replay we have it recorded oh yeah fully fully fully no worries you think yeah okay whatever well eli almost beat me to it okay let's see here demand to see a chromatogram oh you know why i must have been a really good mood when i wrote this okay here's the deal like i can say look this stuff uh i can give you a chromatogram let me show you he's in a good mood right here look at this this is exactly what i'm talking about guys right here wow okay look at delta eight 95 percent oh wow what they didn't show you a chromatograph of all the other crap that was in there okay so you got five percent stuff that could kill you okay basically think about that and then you can see not tested for residual solvents how good is this stuff do you want to have this stuff i mean no way no you know what would be fun it would be fun to just do a show on reading coas yeah oh my gosh we could just do like 30 minutes of oh this is crap side commentary on coast everybody would hate me okay i gotta okay so then let me see here residuals may not be tested okay this is a good example demand to see a chromatogram number one what the heck is in there number two uh residuals may not be tested did they test for the unknowns did they test for the residuals and the leachables may be present those may be solid leachables okay in other words they may be ash content they may be they may be any number of cancer-causing you know residuals do not take a chance you guys got to know what you're doing okay so that's why i say we'll be smart we'll just some bucket chemistry here but just make sure be smart with it yeah and god i agree it's more sodium take a look at this so this is what i'm talking about you see all this stuff in here that we created so we took this beautiful beautiful uh standard it wasn't the standard it was just just beautiful pure cbd it was just this just this peak right here that was all you would see and then we made all that crap by by boiling it in acid okay and i was like wow well that's a lot of junk in there is like what is that oh well it's not even showing up you see it the times are not even showing up so we're not even identifying what the material is you see that so we just magically make it appear well through science yeah science and assets okay here we go this is what i'm talking about guys so so beware buyer beware number one consumer beware number two you got to know what you're doing number three uh it's not a magic bullet number four because you're going to be creating uh thc which is going to have another thc remediation process so this that's the realities of it but but but um uh this is the basic workflow for basically the conversion and once you come up with the right technique uh using the parameters that i've outlined for you and i told you what i thought worked best with the acetic acid and the alumina washed acid um here you have a reaction um this is this is basically just some timings when we did our work we did some timings to try to understand okay what would this look like in terms of you know is this a viable process from the standpoint of you know over uh overbearing amounts of of labor no the answer is no because most of it's machine time so you would just be you would put together a process where you do reaction neutralization solvent removal thc remediation and testing and of course you'd test at every one of these processes here but you want to put this together in a workflow where you didn't have inventory building up in between of course everybody's heard uh my to our talks on operational excellence you can go there's some stuff in the notes you should go take a look at it because it could save your business a lot of money absolutely just just spend an hour with me uh implement the value stream mapping tools understand where you know where your inventory is is falling and you can really save a lot of money and take money off your you know free up money from your balance sheet into cash absolutely that's converting yeah waste or inventory that's sitting there that you don't know what to do convert it into profit right we talk about that all the time yeah that's what we need to do exactly how do you remove cost and part of that is wasteful just sitting in inventory just an inventory you don't know what to do with right right and now convert that into something you can sell yes love it yes yes yes love it and i really appreciate you saying that we talked but it was it was your talk no we did we talked about it we did we did we did we did we did we did yes yes okay so here's the here's the uh workflow for cbd to delta a conversion and you know of course the the testing i would test at every one of these phases so here you of course you because i an analytical chemist of course i want a test tester is going to test the test is going to test yeah that's right we're going to do you got to say it right yeah here we got the reaction we're going to test that we're going to testify the neutralization in fact all the input materials have to be tested okay uh your cbd coming in your delta eight coming in whatever it is like you're gonna test you've got to test that you're gonna say everybody's contest okay you gotta test this me test you test okay we're all happy okay all right what equipment do i need you know a lot of people want to know that inquiring minds want to know oh yeah so um you need to have a stirred reactor with a heater condenser on it and i'll show you acquirer mines we want to have white film evaporator yes the way the only reason you need the white film evaporator is is to is to re reduce the color okay because if you really do it like at a really high temperature above 100 degrees okay you're going to get some really dark extracts i'll show you what that looks like did i bring some no i did not shoot what okay i didn't but i i got some really dark stuff yesterday and you know that might that might be good for a white film so if you have one of those laying around you should use it in this case um and then or you could do a short path too but i'm a known short path hater he is and that has come up several times yes short path later yeah i'm a hater on the short path but okay and then um preparative chromatography obviously um you know that's to get the delta eight delta nine out you know so um we're gonna do probably in a couple weeks maybe three four weeks among put that on our show list of doing a uh separation of delta eight delta nine um on with our p909 okay yeah i love it and then uh the uh hblc for analytical so just just let you know um this is what you the equipment that you pretty much have to have okay yes and heidi we're not trying to be testy what we're doing is we're trying to be a little bit quick so we can get to the lab he's so excited about getting to the lab i can't even tell it's like all this pent up energy okay he's just ready to go man and jason we'd love to do an article on oh yeah yeah we'll do an article how many articles do i i mean i feel like i haven't been writing you are quickly but you are quite prolific but but i haven't been writing a lot lately i know i have a slacker i have a big pile of papers april's got something that she's been working on tables oh jared's got that article you want okay here we go so how does the delta eight affect me okay look anybody can go on i need to study this hold on keep going anybody go online and find this information okay um there's i'm not telling you anything that's not readily available with just a simple google search um uh but um according to some of our actual uh user people that we have um okay uh lightly psychotropic lower potency than delta nine so it's going to have a lesser effect than delta nine um it does interact and metabolize in the same way so it goes it interacts with the same receptors in your body that delta 9 does which is really great so the kind of the mechanism of metabolism is known already and you know the quickest way to get the dose in is obviously an inhale inhalation it kind of bypasses the liver and all of that so um be very very careful obviously the same type of if you're taking it internally through the gut and um you know it'll eventually get to your brain but you in you know but you really need to um make sure you don't overdose okay so typically 10 milligrams per dose that's a that's a typical thc dose so um don't don't do any more than that yeah and we don't really talk about doses but that's about the range of what people yeah take yeah exactly so that's what you want to do there and then is it legal um there's been uh pretty cool we have let me see here oh yeah take a look this is a legal memo that just happened in wisconsin to this uh staff attorney to the yeah it's just a very month ago yeah recently and some people in the state wanted to know okay what the legality is um and this is from their representative and uh this this came from cush.com look at that that's funny but they they had reposted it um but you can see the short answer is that the substance meeting and definition of hemp is legal for purposes of state federal controlled substances laws regardless of its delta a thc concentration that is the beauty of it that's the official of it and that's pretty cool so um the same things you here's what you want to do if you're a hymn producer and you want to kind of get into this and take a look at it first of all avoid the states that are you know hemp is not you know uh looked on favorably or not legal okay oh idaho yes exactly i wasn't going to name the names but i wasn't either but i just was rooting for item that's all i love all their sports teams yes um and then avoid uh states where hemp derived oils are not accepted okay that's a good idea and then hemp drive oils oils are fit for commerce if they are derived from industrial hemp and have less than point three percent delta nine thc okay so um one of the things that i you know i was talking to our general counsel about this and we were just kind of going through some scenarios no we just kind of going through okay the scenario would be okay what if uh you know you have a you have a legally tethered product and then you put it out into the marketplace it has delta8 but it's derived from its derived and somehow you get busted yeah you're gonna have uh you you're gonna you know i don't know it it's gonna be a lot of money basically to uh you know to try to get out of that okay that it's legal yeah you're gonna have to especially with the chromatograms that i was showing you hang on let's go back up to that okay okay see this is so this thc if you have if you don't get a nice clear super separation right and uh you have a little bit of thc in there you don't really know how much it is okay that's something you need to think about so get all of your thc out if you're gonna do it just make sure you get all the thc up i don't know i'm the best thing i'm just cautioning people just don't bring your chromatograph with you whenever you use it well yeah just put it in the back of your car and then when you get stopped no no officer this is actually delta nine and see here's the vlog here you can just hand them that memo from the state of wisconsin here's my chromatograph and you can run it right there that's right yeah run it like yeah yeah that's that's weird okay anyway so that's uh that's that do you have a cup i can use [Laughter] how to measure delta eight okay guys this is really super simple delta a comes out right here here's thc intel day comes out right here so um this is a 70 uh 70 30 water group that's not a gradient it's just a isocratic phase i usually use point one uh formic acid in both of these phases you just run it straight out on a reverse phase column with hplc and it'll you'll get a separation so um and you'll be able to get more and more selectivity between the isomers of delta eight and delta nine um just by uh just by decreasing this amount so you go 60 but you see i was too impatient i actually want a two minute run instead of a four minute run i had to wait four minutes to get those results you were impatient oh man oh oh the other thing i want to tell you i can't even imagine okay you see this line right here okay there's a there's a huge peak that comes out like at minute 10 and a half okay really so i don't know what i have no idea i have no idea we're that means we're doing a field trip someday he's going to figure that out take a look at this guys i mean you just want to make sure that you have you understand what the unknowns are oh sure that's about it so okay um be smart i'm just going to show you a quick demo it's not going to be let's go um and then we can get into some of your questions and we can talk more about it but yeah we'll do a quick demo and show you how i did this all right oh my gosh this is awesome can you hear me okay yeah okay so this is like uh rogue rogue chemistry right can you guys get uh can you guys get a pan on this right here okay there we are okay there we are okay now we're cooking okay by the way this is a nice little piece of equipment um so this is one of the things you're going to need to do use for your little chemistry experiment here um this is called a uh well it's just a stir stir plate with a heater on it what's nice about this one is you can set the temperature that you want the process and it's got this little probe here okay and it's nice because it'll it'll always keep that temperature about what you want okay so here i have um cbd this is a isolate okay so i'm just gonna pour that in here this is exactly what i did guys it's not not very hard okay this is heptane so i just poured that heptane in there awesome okay i just splash around see look at that i'm going to start to uh yeah basically this is what i did super simple um this is some of my uh acid washed uh alumina that i did aluminium uh that i did right here so i would pour that in there and i'm putting it about about uh 14 to 20 by weight okay so uh yeah so just keep that in mind guys and then here i have a little acid uh little acid that i'm putting there okay and it's pretty good now this is not a volatile acid one thing is yeah which means is that we're not gonna we don't we can't actually smell it but obviously um you know if you're gonna use a volatile acid like acetic acid you're gonna heat it up to a hundred degrees celsius it's gonna come off so you're going to want to do this in a hood in a hood in the hood is where you're going to want to do this so and that's not wearing a hoodie no no that that is in like in a hood you know walk-in hood it's it's spinning yeah venting hood the venting hood okay so then all i do now is i as i change this here to 100 degrees watch out for that there here randy and i'm going to go ahead and do that i'm going to turn up this heat i'm going to turn this on like that it's at 100 degrees okay it's not going to heat up now i just set my timer for you know maybe three hours and then this will turn color like it'll turn this color in fact right here is that it yeah this is it i made this is yesterday you can see it's got um you see how it's it's kind of um it's got uh it's it's got a heptane in it so i haven't removed all the solvent from it yet but when you take the heptane out you need a rotavap or a fractron or something like that to do that then then then this stuff will all come to a like an oil so that's what that is so it's really simple guys but you're gonna get some delta nine in there and uh you know that's basically it notice it's got a little bit of yellow right there so that is it now i also showed you this once you remember i put that alumina in there so those are solid okay and you want to be able to basically filter all of that out so this is just a simple buchner funnel with a um you know with a vacuum on it and a sidearm so sidearm and then you have uh you have like a little adapter here this is a ceramic uh buchner funnel and then a filter paper okay if you were doing this at large scale of course you use a drain droid for that and then drain droid would be perfect for for that kind of purpose but um i think we got it i mean that's how simple it is guys it's really not really not that difficult and this is just to make a one-off batch make a one-off that's try it yeah you can send in the sample you can send the sample to us we'll run it for you um but but if you do that i'm gonna be looking for all of the uh unknowns i'm gonna tell you hey you got a lot of unknowns in there and things like that so that that's i'm gonna turn this off now and uh go back to our original position okay so um as we go through there sorry for that that was kind of fun actually we we had a little bit of a technical stuff uh here usually we do this right at the lab we were talking about doing it in in the lab itself um but here here here we are all right bam bam okay here we go all right so mike up hey okay now it's working i thought that was awesome oh yeah now and so this is a one-off uh and if somebody wanted to do this what would they how much would it cost us for that little setup there oh you got you got maybe uh 1200 he had the 1200 you got maybe one two three thousand three thousand bucks something like that three thousand dollars you can do some one-off yeah delta eight yeah if you're gonna you might have like a lot of people might have the um you know hot plate already they might have a vacuum pump already they might have a little bit and you can repurpose all that yeah right i think so so i i think that that's good what um if you want to do this at high scale at scale yeah do you have slides on that or is that something we can just talk about yeah we can just talk about that i mean oh okay so if you're gonna do um you know multi-kilos per time you're gonna need to have a large um you know reactor um which is a 50 liter reactor that's a stirred reactor that has a heater cooler on it okay and also uh has a um could you get that hooked up for him okay why are you worried about my arms no i just i just he's worried about me look at that first time for everything you know maybe we should get these things on a little a little stand that goes right here no these are more fun i don't know okay i was able to boom you i didn't i didn't hit you i thought about it but okay i didn't um yeah yeah so oh the acid is acetic acid guys uh that's a yep and uh no it wasn't sulfuric we didn't use any sulfuric acid in there at all yeah sulfuric is really dangerous by the way uh if one little splash in your eye you go blind seriously so be very careful with the uh sulfuric acid um yeah all right sorry he's remaking me yeah i'm i'm far away okay there we are oh and now i'm even further away awesome okay um so scale so if we wanted to scale this up yeah could you set this up as kind of a production yeah yeah so you could set it up as production um you'd have to have here's the workflow that i think you should have i mean you're going to have to have some sort of a solvent remover um you're going to have to have some sort of way to actually reactor so you'd you would never do a scale up like that you know you you know so you would want a host enclosed yeah you'd have a closed reactor um and if you're using solvents of course you have to have a enough um you have to have enough solvent there uh and you have to have a control area for that solvent along with you know approved containers improved storage and if you're going to use any type of motors any in there along with that it has to be a c1 d2 piece of equipment so you know doing it on the lab bench is great but for production purposes there are other requirements you need to be thinking about so you would you would need to have um you know probably a start a stirred reactor with an air motor or a inert gas motor um and then you'd have to have a heater cooler heater chiller on that okay um and you can buy those at a number of places we we uh we often quote those in a quote and patrick package um if you have uh for fractron you can use our fractron to do all the solvent removal um if you have some road of apps you're going to need to have at least a 50 liter road of app um and the reason i recommend to have multiple road of apps or a fractron uh simply because you're going to be trying to remove the solvent also you know and what's great about the fractron is it doesn't have it has two different types of falling film okay it has a packed bed fractional uh falling film and it has a tube and tube tube and shell falling film so you can actually isolate one of those uh vessels one of those uh you know falling film evaporators and just just circulate it in there if you want to use it for a single purpose so that it's super versatile guys very nice yeah so um that would be that and then you're gonna need to have some way to remove all of the um you know delta nine from your reaction pot right so that means uh you know some sort of chromatography or some sort of thc remediation um yeah something along those lines so and we have gone over the thc remediation there's there's lots of different ways to do it there's not just one way um you know you guys can choose a choose whatever it is but we can also put that together into a package for you um and uh you know you know see how that goes along with slps and and uh you know and then training and consulting to really make it happen so what we've talked about is being able to put together a kit for you on the smaller side so it would be a small batch kind of thing that you you can do um it'll be a little more than the three thousand dollar little lab thing that we have here because that's that's just a one-off that's really small so we talked about that but then on the large scale side if you really want to do delta eight you're going to need you know from our equipment side of it you're looking at the fractron you're looking at you know you you need solvent you need the heater and the chiller you need the pure 99 full chromatography and all of this can be repurposed for other uses post extraction right right right yeah that's right true yeah you would use it for other things as well you'd use it in your isolate process you would use it obviously in your winterization process so you're going to be using all that stuff anyway so yeah and then you know we would give you all of our processing methods as well as part of that um and you know we list on that if we were to sell that it's like just over a million dollars yeah that's what we do it's a pretty high throughput though yeah a very high throughput oh my gosh the fractron will do how much yeah so i mean you would have uh you would have a you'd be able to 20 you know deal with it like 20 gallons an hour yeah flow through right right but you'd be able to deal with it with a very low operational cost oh yeah because it's all automated and then the pure 99 you're we're looking at pure 99 pushing through how many liters an hour we're um well we're eight liters an hour or eight liters a minute sorry excuse me eight liters a minute yeah times that's times 60 okay that's a big number yeah eight liters a minute on chromatography that is full out optimized for thc remediation which is what you need for this and that's just post thc remediation right correct so you you run it you've got it um and that through that's a huge throughput so you can get you know delta eight at a high level what what is uh what is the market right now right now for delta eight you know what i i looked uh on a couple different websites and um it was wildly varying um you know when we we looked at some of the delta eight we bought some delta eight and um you know wasn't it has i think a lot of those other things that you see in the um you know chromatogram those are they have they affect the aroma and the flavor so my view of the delta eight is that it has a definitely has to be formulated okay you're just going to put in straight up delta 8. well i don't know if you really want to do that because it's not not going to taste very good and um you know and or have no taste at all i mean you know most people want to enjoy the flavor and aroma right um in order to uh in order to really enjoy it so that that's uh yeah so i don't know what the what the price is but i think it's it's well it's it's a lot yeah i've heard ten dollars a gram that's what i heard you're higher than that so yeah but that's that's a lot of that's a lot of coin so there's a way there are ways to do that and you know for that we're actually doing a special right now rather than one million five thousand dollars we're going to do we're we'll actually give knock 20 off of that so show special 799 000. wow but you have to put in the code yes what's the code dr john rocks okay all right i think that's a wrap and as an alternate the other is a delta 8 lab so you can use dr john rox or delta 8 lab i use that code and will actually even do that for you if you're on and you want it even better yeah we'll even give an extra five percent for the first three that sounds like a good one yeah so we could put that together for you and uh you know basically gave you everything you need with a little sheet here's how you do it and and uh we if you send the test into us we can we can actually test it for you so and we're we do this all the time so that's this is our world and we want to make sure we've got that for you and then we're going to put this other kit together um and so we'll put we'll post that somewhere i don't know where we would post that uh i think we're going to we have a store we have store link that we can put on we'll put a smaller kit together for you know the small batch as well but uh if you need something then go on our website we've got our bot and you can try to stump our bot the bot is the bot rocks spot rocks that's pretty good i like it and just ask the questions and then you'll either get a call from myself or elijah or q or manual or whatever we can and we can answer more questions for you on the equipment itself uh but you know this works for any extract if you're a processor right now let's let's go we can talk about this all of our gear will interface we're co2 on our extraction side but we have we're selling our fractrons and our clear stills and our pure 99s to ethanol processors all day every day yeah um and the drain droids i mean they're yeah it's all going dry and fractron so anyway this was a phenomenal show lots of tables chromatographs chromatographs chromatographs yeah i love that we went through it so so this is good and i don't think anyone else i think did we did we win a prize because i don't think there's another webinar you guys have sat on where there's a million dollar offering did we do it we have never we have never done that actually we've never and we don't usually do that but this is kind of a one-off thing we don't like to push our product but we we did want to give you a special for being here and that's where we're at sounds good so didn't mean to uh oversell but this was awesome there will be a replay and this was predominantly education that's what we like to do yeah and we love being here because we like to hear your questions we love to interface with you that's what we want to do and again congratulations to samuel gorton ennisburg falls vermont uh king of bourbons thank you and i know uh did you see bowdoin and jeff chime saying yes vermont i saw that and i

there's data you know i wanna um this isn't just about what's been published in the scientific literature i'm very happy to share my clinical experience as well which is that a lot of people who use cbd to treat anxiety report that once they get to a high enough dose they experience a decrease in anxiety without the side effects that are typical from regular anxiety medications like sedation and confusion and things like that they feel like they can remain mentally sharp and focused without the anxiety and that's really a great uh distinction between cbd and some of the other treatments so this was a case series uh so not a not a randomized controlled trial but i think this is very typical of what i see in the clinic 72 adults at an outpatient psychiatry clinic were taking cbd most of them 25 milligrams a day in capsule form in 57 patients anxiety decreased and remained decreased for the rest of the study duration which was i think around six months and then sleep improved in the first month for about half of the patients but then fluctuated over time so it seemed like the benefits of this fairly low dose of cbd 25 milligrams a day on anxiety were a very high response rate so about 80 percent of people with anxiety that tried this 25 milligram dose had an improvement that they reported in their anxiety and that improvement was maintained over time and i also see that in the clinic when someone responds to cbd i typically don't see them building tolerance or losing efficacy over time now this was uh this hasn't been published but this is data that was presented at a conference that i wanted to share because it was just four weeks of treatment with the cbd dominant uh product that was produced by the national institute of drug abuse a full spectrum so-called cbd product but we never learned any more about what was actually in it but it was again a low dose 10 milligrams tid which means three times daily so this would these were patients with anxiety that were just taking 10 milligrams three times daily and overall there was an 80 percent reduction in anxiety over the course of four weeks there were also improvements in depression and mood and improvements in many cognitive domains so this researcher stacy gruber does a lot of cognitive tests to assess how sharp people are thinking and how fast they can learn and so almost every kind of domain improved and anxiety got better there was just one test where there was a very small detriment in uh in learning ability and it was barely measurable but the general direction was an improvement in cognition they continued for six months they maintained their benefits for six months they also had improvements in sleep and quality of life with no adverse effects cbd is incredibly forgiving and at 10 milligrams three times a day very few people are ever going to have an adverse effect from this treatment now there's been some studies that have looked at very high doses of cbd for treating anxiety and i just wanted to show you one of those because a lot of people are thinking in the double digits and that's what most people can afford but also these really high doses of cbd can be safe and effective but but what's really interesting is the dose response curve so this was a study where they take people and they make them do public speaking and it causes anxiousness and basically that anxiousness is measured on this scale here and then this is basically before during the preparation during the speaking and afterwards and the levels of anxiety went up for everyone while they were doing the public speaking but looking at the data there were three doses of cbd given 100 milligrams 300 and 900 milligrams and what you can see here is that 300 milligrams significantly outperformed both the 100 and the 900 milligram doses 300 milligrams actually outperformed clonazepam which is a benzodiazepine very strong anti-anxiety medication so i bring this up to show you that more is not always better and there might be some of these so-called u-shaped dose response curves even in the lower dose range and so for someone that's using cbd if they increase the dose and it gets they get a better effect especially with anxiety they increase the dose again and they get an even better effect and then they increase the dose again and the the effect seems to start to diminish increase it again and they're not getting the results they were once getting they've probably gone too high and just like with thc sometimes by lowering the dose you can actually get a stronger therapeutic effect it doesn't make a lot of sense when people think about it they think oh i should take more and i'll get a stronger effect but sometimes taking less produces a stronger effect", "vxIaj0Lf28U": "[Music]

were leh welcome your email and call and we will serve wholeheartedly for you", "8x72FetAb5U": "hi everyone extract craft here and welcome back to another educational video on how to properly execute an alcohol extraction using so what we're doing today is we've already done in previous videos The Washington strain and also the filtration of our alcohol tincture we used our Buechner funnels for that and so now we have our clean tincture ready to evaporate down inside the source turbo so first thing we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and get everything ready here so i've already preloaded our tincture into our crucible up to the fill line so we'll go ahead and put that in and that just simply screws into the heating post so we screw that down nice and easily until it basically stops now you want to make sure you have this firmly down on the heating posts so you may have to give it just a little bit you know to make sure that it is down we want to make sure that we get plenty of heat transfer through the entire crucible so that way we get all the alcohol to evaporate at the right speed so now we're ready to place our lid on and go through the controls with you so the first thing that you're going to notice is that we plugged our unit in and our green light is on so before we start our unit we need to actually set the altitude so the source turbo has the ability to set out to - based on sea level and that really takes into consideration the barometric pressure that we deal with when we're dealing with vacuum and heat so we've set our altitude but we're gonna go ahead and reset it just so you can see for yourself so the first thing you need to do is hold the button down for a full 10 seconds so I always tell people to count like one one thousand two one thousand needs to be a full 10 seconds after that we're gonna go ahead and release the button and then the light will flash at us ten times really fast once it's done flashing we're gonna push the button one two three four five and that's because we're at five thousand feet if you're at two thousand feet you would put the button push the button twice if you were at six thousand feet same thing push the button six times and once once this is done after you've pushed it five times it will actually flash back at you five times to confirm and then once you've once you've gotten that you're good to go you're ready to start the process so now what we're going to do is go through the controls of normal mode vers turbo mode normal mode is designed to slow everything down and really what that helps with is people that are using an alcohol-based tincture that is going to be very heavy in oil waxes lipids things like that so for instance if we would have soaked our material for let's say maybe an hour a day a week whatever it may be that that you've done that's when maybe you want to use normal mode to slow it down so that way we don't get any splattering because a lot of times what happens is as the alcohol reduces down and the oil concentration gets heavier the oil will build up heat and bump as we call it or splatter onto the lid or a little bit on the glass so in order to prevent that we run it on turbo rather than or run it on normal rather than on turbo so normal mode is if we just push the button once that will start normal mode turbo mode is when we hold the button down for four seconds now because we've only done a quick wash and we've did a five minute wash on this particular tincture we will actually use turbo mode for this process so for turbo mode we want to make sure our valve our release valve is closed and just make sure that's good and tight make sure our lids on as you can see we do have the slanted lid so it should slant downward and make sure that it can go in any direction that you police doesn't matter so now we're going to go ahead and drop it into turbo mode turbo is where we hold the button like you say for four seconds so one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand the light will flash twice and now the unit starts and now what you're hearing are the pumps creating the vacuum so they're sucking down the lid and this will actually then take about a minute to get to a full vacuum you should easily be able to pick the Machine up just like that after just a short time if you tense then you need to either apply a little bit of pressure make sure your vacuum screw is tight or make sure that your globe is actually centered on to the rubber map correctly so this will take about a minute to go ahead and suck down and then we'll be ready for the evaporation process we're back guys so now our vacuum has been created the lid is fully secured and one thing you're going to notice with the source turbo is you'll hear the clicking noise going on from the unit that's the heaters relay letting you know everything's operating correctly so as long as you hear that you're good to go now the pumps will kick on occasionally throughout the entire process and this will help to always make sure that the vacuum is sucked down and that we do have a full vacuum throughout the whole process one thing we keep in mind too is the pumps are also designed to control heat so when the pumps kick on the heater relaxes and so what we want to do at this point is we have our ice tray we filled it up with water and froze it as a solid block of ice and we're going to set that on top now the reason for this is we are recondense in the alcohol on the lid so we need to create a cold spot for the alcohol to reconvince on and this will allow the droplets to form roll off the lid and collect down in the chamber now another little trick that you can do to help the idea is to keep everything as cool as possible because once the alcohol heats up and begins evaporating and the tincture begins boiling the alcohol needs to rican dense as fast as it evaporates so we're evaporating it we need to reconvince it the ice tray on top acts as a cold trap for that we can also set a small little desktop fan next to the machine and just blow it directly on the globe in order to keep everything cool so you'll have your ice pan on top and a little fan to help cool everything down as you notice the pumps kick on periodically but that should be about all it does and it won't do it very often but if it does do it too often then we do have something where maybe need to either close the vacuum screw or check our lid make sure everything's secured down properly or check your altitude the other thing that you can kind of experience is if you're using a lower proof alcohol for instance like 151 proof that will completely change the way the machine operates it'll change the way the pumps operate it'll change kind of everything you really want to make sure you use in either 190-proof or higher food grade alcohol so now we basically can sit here and let the Machine go and just kind of check on and occasionally make sure everything's good you can already see condensation slowly forming on the glass lid at the moment so we're gonna set this back on there we're gonna let the machine do its thing and after two hours the machine has an auto shutoff now this is a safety feature we don't want people to walk away from their extracts forget about them and then come back and have them over done so it has a two hour shutoff that will go through roughly two-thirds to about three-quarters of the crucible in the first two hours on turbo mode on normal mode normal mode is gonna take a little longer so the whole process with normal mode would take potentially six hours four to six hours with turbo mode you should be able to go through a full crucible in three hours or less so at this point we'll go ahead and come back in two hours and then we'll restart the machine to finish it off and for another hour and then we'll go ahead and remove the oil from the crucible and show you how to do that [Music] okay and now our lid is ready to come off so we go ahead and set this off to the side and now we remove the crucible Chris we'll just unscrews we can pull this out and we'll set this off to the side now one thing the crucible will be warm at the end so be careful with that so first thing we want to do is reclaim all of our alcohol and we're just going to pour this back into our measuring cup just like that and as you see we started with 300 milliliters of alcohol tincture to evaporate down as you see now we have roughly about 90 to 95% of our alcohol reclaim that we can use now further and it's nice and clean so we set that off to the side now - and now we are ready to go ahead and remove the oil from our crucible one thing you'll need is just a small little spatula to go ahead and do that and so here we go so what you want to do is you just want to go ahead and pour it nice and easily around the mat you don't want to try to pull it too much but we'll show you how to kind of spread it out at the end of this but a little if you need to you know use your spatula to pull it out but it needs to stay in somewhat of a viscous form in order to pour out of the crucible you don't want to take it too far down to more of a concrete or a wax you want to get it out when it's still in oil form so now that we have our oil out onto our mat we can go ahead and begin to spread it around a little bit now this is real simple simply pick up the edges of Matt while it's still warm you want to remove that oil while it's still warm in the crucible so that way it will migrate around the mat and you can spread it out nice and thin and either to let it air dry or what you can do is you can throw it into a vacuum chamber we have our oil we have our oil nicely spread thin on our silicon mat and as you can see it should just be a nice thick oil at this point gonna be tacky you're not gonna want to touch it right away we need to let this air dry there's a couple ways to do that you can either throw this into a vacuum chamber you can throw this into a vacuum oven or you can simply let this air dry with maybe just a small fan sitting next to it blowing over the oil to allow the residual alcohol to go ahead and release from the oil the other thing you can do is now that you have it on the silicone mat you can go ahead and D card this oil just like this I usually take a little small 8x8 baking dish and line that and then go ahead and throw it in the oven at 244 40 minutes roughly until the bubbles stop bubbling and then you will have a full D carb but as you can see we have a beautiful oil here that nice and thick nice smells smells delicious by using a low-temperature evaporation with the source only operating at roughly 105 degrees Fahrenheit that makes for a much much more potent oil and holds on to everything from the terpenes to any medicinal value that your oil may have so one thing also at the end that I like to do is once I've got my oil out I've gotten a spread thin it's ready to go I like to clean the crucible out a very easy way I keep a separate jar that I've used to clean other crucibles at the end because you're going to have a lot of oil residual on the crucible so the first thing you want to do is go ahead and I like to keep this with about roughly 300 milliliters and then this way I can just pour this in each time and use my spatula to just clean all the oil off around the edges of the crucible this helps to just get it cleaner faster get all that oil off and then also you're reclaiming all that because what we can do is after I've done a number of batches and I've used this same alcohol to clean the crucible out what I can then do is run this alcohol and reclaim all that oil that may have been stuck to the crucible or otherwise wasted so no waste no mess guys thanks for watching our videos thanks for subscribing please subscribe to our Channel please like this video share the video

know how to you know angle the questions there will be a replay invite your friends everything's going great we'll talk about next week's kind of a secret we'll get to that later it's gonna be very interesting you'll love it explore our resources live tour CBD jam sessions and man you guys are booking the jam session yeah that's been pretty good it's been great you guys have great questions love the businesses love what you're doing advanced extraction guide the calculator library the mini course library we're a lot of good things Oh julen Andrews winner winner chicken dinner Wow we got okay Instagram one extract lab t-shirt stickers and bottle opener suite the all-important yes bottle opener so enter is just like in Chicago you know vote early vote often enter early enter often go on to our social media awesome so today as you know we are ethanol versus co2 rematch yeah and it's it's kind of fun I mean there's we got people all over the place yeah please introduce yourself and make sure we know who you are farmer processor investor also I want to make sure as we're going through can you tell us I'd like to as the guys are setting up I want to set up a new poll to next after this go ahead and fill out who you are but then think about this because I want to do are you currently processing or our co2 food grade ethanol denatured ethanol all of the above what are you that's that's going to help us as well so we want to talk about that so that we can go now we have tons I mean pages of questions yeah that's good this is fun yeah it's good this is really good stuff so we got to get right into it yeah and before we get dive into the questions what I want to do dr. John really wants to talk a bit about the differences operating cost well I'll let you go this is great yeah yeah hey thanks for the pool lots of processors yes a surprising amount of chemists that's that's cool investors are coming up on the board and go entrepreneurs all right you guys are awesome so growers we got we got a couple growers could you scale scroll up just a little bit so I can see the rest of it yeah okay yeah oh yeah we got some farmers good okay very good well thank you for that we're gonna close that poll out appreciate it just want to know where you guys are coming from happy to have you here as always and I'm just going to start a presentation you know guys it all comes down to a couple things and that is a couple things is one thing in which is cost I mean fundamentally I'm gonna be talking quite a bit about you know operating cost in this in this section and you know there are a lot of questions about okay is the solvent the right solvent and doesn't have the right solvent power okay yeah okay I'm selective okay things like that okay is the throughput high enough or am I going to you know it is it's my machine fast enough is it going to be do I have the right machinery further okay all of those questions absolutely they they kind of all melt in front of the mountain of cost so so we're gonna kind of go through that and I just very very quickly kind of show you just some cost comparisons because a lot of people bet that's a huge deciding factor you know in what they when they're trying to get up and running and they're trying to think about the their business and their operation title because when you're doing when you're starting a business running a business there are so many hidden costs that you your aren't aware of because the reality is you don't know what you don't know exactly and and now we're gonna you know open the kimono make sure that you know what we know and you know we're learning together we're going but you know this guy knows his stuff okay we got lots of ethanol processors here that's really great sweet okay we'll end that poll we got lots of co2 processors we got some denature guys as well which is okay you know thank you so here I'm gonna go ahead and start this up okay so this is all about operating costs in a full comparison and you guys can go ahead and you know well here it is right here okay good you guys can go ahead and you know make comments along the line we'll be looking at the chat as we go along and basically looking at what you guys have and what we'll be addressing them as we go along yeah cost versus quality okay let's let's make it happen so I'm gonna go next here okay so here's a here's a just a table we got equipment and startup cost comparison for one ton per day this is for the hemp farmers marijuana farmers or marijuana growers you guys are gonna do as much but the all the ratio stay the same so you got basically a 5,000 square foot extraction startup okay so here you got your ethanol numbers here here you got your co2 numbers and then here's your cost difference here okay and you have the equipment cost you know one of the reasons people get into the ethanol equipment is because you know it has a less of a start-up cost on the on the ethanol equipment itself so you can see that the co2 for the same set up is is almost double and so you got it cost difference there are two million if you guys are doing infrastructure in other words you're doing large amounts of ethanol you're gonna have to figure out how to deal with f2 occupancy versus h2 occupancy and there's a there's a cost associated with a hazardous occupancy currently if you have a sprinklered you know non flammable type of facility that has a metal roof on it completely metal construction you're basically you can have about 240 gallons of ethanol with three different control areas so that's something you need to keep in mind if you really want to scale up you're gonna have to have more ethanol than that around so in that put you into a different occupancy and occupancy has costs associated with that I'm not going to go into that in depth in this presentation but I got all the numbers and and we can talk about it you guys certainly could talk about on a CBD jam session or something like that so um and then startup solvent costs obviously you have to pay if you there's a lot of food grade ethanol processors here you guys are paying quite a bit for food grade ethanol I think it was yesterday spot price was 33 dollars a gallon which is which is actually double our calculations that we're going to show you here in the next so you're you're actually doubling it up okay our spot price for co2 is four cents a pound just just to give you the idea here so here you add all that stuff up look at your a million-two ahead with ethanol and so ethanol wins / capital-intensive absolutely we're we're yeah game over checkmate okay not right there there's there but wait there's more but wait there's more so let's just kind of go on to the next slide here and I'll tell you hold the phone you only got a fracture of the story so let's start let's start really talking about let's let's break this down okay when you start talking about operating costs for a 1-ton today facility now this is everything here is indexed off of a one ton at a facility you have operating costs that are associated with that now I am neglecting the cost of the biomass because it's the same for both co2 enough and also that's neglected the cost of the facility in this analysis is completely neglected cost of insurance that hazardous waste you know manifestation and you know removal all those costs are pretty much neglected here we're not talking about those at all okay so let's just look at the cost of goods sold which is the direct cost which is labour and you know your materials costs okay what we have here in this slide right here is on the y-axis is operating cost comparison and dollars and we have two the ethanol and the co2 okay the labour here is assumed to be about the same basically for a one ton the number of people that you need to run a unit is about that these numbers here on the the changeover and the loss of solvent those all came from a company called Delta and they have they have calculators that they they give and we looked at their calculator and we kind of did some solvent loss so we took the numbers from those guys so what you're looking at here is right here loss of solvent that's if you recover okay that's if you recover the in the blue that's if you recover the solvent so what we're assuming is that you're recovering anywheres from 90 to 95 percent of the solvent in the number that's a that's really addressed here is the loss due to due to loss of that lack of recovery okay um you know like a lot of the people out there they have they have presses they have like a salad spinner almost or washing machine almost and they spin it out they dry it down but still a lot of that ethanol is still left in the biomass sure okay and anywheres from five to ten percent a good conservative figure would be 10 percent a very very aggressive figure would be five percent if you guys have any questions on that or any comments on the loss of ethanol go ahead and put that in there as you said earlier the cost you'd put on there for ethanol was at no exact 1616 no so that currently the denatured from 7-10 spirits hexane are heptane denatured came in yesterday like at 16 bucks gallon and this to nature yeah denature now all the prices have kind of gone up paid basically because we're in this co-ed time yeah so normal normally you would be right around maybe 16 17 dollars a gallon for food grade okay and then you'd be you know maybe maybe you know 10 11 if you guys have any questions on that or have any real date up-to-date information if you've got it go ahead and just sort of put it in the notes there and give me give me some help there but like I went yesterday I got our purchaser on the line and he he basically got me all the numbers so that they were kind of up to date and it's a little bit it's a little bit skewed so it makes ethanol look a lot worse than it really actually is in this solvent loss what if we took all of this right here besides the labor and we just neglected it this is the solvent changeover and this right here is the testing cost and that's the labor so we just took that and we took the labor out took the labour out and we took everything out you'd still see this is the co2 cost here it's just like infant s mole it's below the car yeah right and that's also including the lawsuit of winterization which you do use ethanol in winterization but you see that you're using so much less ethanol in winterization that the lasas don't really even matter and you can use food grades so the loss of ethanol is really a key driver in your overall operating so make sure I understand this enough yeah so the overall cost and it's the same and we these are old prices these are normalized pricing at $16 per right right now food grade right right right and the cost to operate a co2 extraction facility is less half of just the loss of solvent yeah a methanol extraction facility yeah it's like 15 X less just in solvent well I'm just talking about all the entire cost of 3 2 is less the operating cost is less than half yes the solvent loss around the ethanol okay that's a huge operating deal huge operating costs that's a huge operate I mean hi ok I want to know that okay now no operating costs basically will define your gross margin okay and then you add sales to that you take away sales you add your depreciation expense in there and you got your bottom-line net margin net margin goes to your cash flows absolutely that that number has a huge impact on your cash flow yes brilliant and I'm gonna just show you a couple different I apologize I promise not to ask a lot of questions that's okay it's all good here let me see I'm just we're just kind of going down here trying to see make sure yeah don't be shy and asking questions please please go ahead I see that there's some really good questions coming in so we'll get to those yep and they are adjusted yes they are adjusted for kovat 19 yes they are they're not adjusted for kovat 19 they're the old prices yeah they're just better if it would be just worse for ethanol if we adjusted them for Kovan 19 exactly it would be really bad so let's take a look at this but the price I when it came in I saw David you you asked that question when we talked about the $33 remember that was a current co bid adjusted price yeah but all of these presentations are on the normal normalized costing at 16 for food grade correct Oh correct okay so let's let's talk about this graph here this is a very cool very important graph okay what I have plotted here is the cumulative operating cost as a function of time and this is in months they can't see the mouse oh okay right he's got a really cool fangled Mouse here that he's the vertical on the okay let's let's first focus our attention on the left hand side which is the food grade ethanol side keep in mind the key assumption here $16 per gallon which is the normal price okay the orange line is the basically the cumulative operating cost for ethanol and that includes like losses and all the other stuff that we had in the previous slide and with the key driver of that being you know that solvent loss and the blue dots as a function of time are for co2 and you can see the slope is is what you really need to be looking at a slope of the orange dots is very very high now you can see on the vertical axis we're not starting at zero so we've taken into account the differences in the initial startup cost okay and what's a very important part to just think about is when those two lines cross over because that's the point at which your your money savings from your low-cost ethanol setup just stopped paying for itself well okay so in the case of in the case of food grade ethanol at pre kovat prices we're looking at anywhere from 2 to let's just say 2 to 4 months of a difference in time you know basically the time to catch up to the cost that you would have paid for co2 now you you can see the differences in basically the differences between the what it costs you the between the blue line and the and the the the orange dots those are the cumulative you know cost difference and this is based on a one ton per day yes based on so it goes all the way back to the first slide where we said ethanol one right where the cost of you know a start quit minute startup cost of all of that equipment was far less than co2 right but when you do this your payback is in okay on on the left for me great ethanol performance two months two or four months right so let's let's go back to that slide that you can see that we're not starting from zero again on there's it's not going to the zero on the left hand side the food grade ethanol it's not going to zero so you can see we're assuming that there's two costs there there's we're starting with a cost okay sure well because we're starting at one tunnel yeah so day one is right in the middle of that first vertical squares it's really difficult for ethanol to compete with four cents a pound that's the bottom line that's exactly right very very difficult four cents a pound okay so it on the right hand side I I said okay well let's let's give let's do another analysis where we instead of using food grade we use denatured ethanol and I think I assumed eight dollars a gallon for teenagers don't know this would be ethanol with you know like it has heptane in it or it has some sort of it's it's a licensed denatured ethanol okay and we have the same two plots except in this one it's gray and the gray line with the with the slope on it is ethanol and the blue dots are still co2 and you can see that the time to payback increases about two months basically from three to five so you might want to give it the benefit of the doubt and say anywhere from four to six months sure it'd be something but it's very difficult to compete with co2 on the basis of cost just it is so that's going to get a food grade or denature yeah that's going to give the co2 processor a huge cost advantage in the market because they have margin and here what they're gonna do with that margin what are they gonna do they're gonna hire salespeople they're gonna hire they're gonna they're gonna take and lower their prices so they're going to whatever they're gonna do a bunch of thing so let's go let's go into each one of the other costs that are going into this assumption here these plots and I'll show you what they all mean let's let's go that's a good visual thank you for them yeah okay so let's focus first on the loss of solvents okay so let me see here what is the solvent lost from methanol versus co2 okay the amount of solvent that's not recovered after extraction that's what solvent loss is okay in that's there's an assumption either five to ten percent okay in this particular analysis I kind of split the difference so I think I did like seven percent okay like that solvent can be lost to the atmosphere via evaporation or in the case of co2 may be recovered and reused so that's another way solvent is lost you know like we buy solvent here for winterization and yeah we you know we lose it where to go I don't know I don't know it's it's in the oils or so it's it there's a loss okay so we're buying totes we buy totes of food grade ethanol all the time yeah okay solvent can be lost to spills and transfers major ethanol solvent loss from entrainment in the biomass so this is trying to get the ethanol out of the biomass and it's really hard to do better than 5% without a lot of heat and then you're really not able to recover that if you use Heat okay one of the issues there is you have this also that I'm not going to discuss in this in this time but I have written on it it's the hazardous waste aspect of the biomass coming out of it so if you're using if you have like a lot of ethanol and you got like 10% ethanol in your biomass in some jurisdictions they consider that hazardous waste so you have to pay for that or you have to remove it and if there's hep teen or isopropyl alcohol or something else in there that you use from a diene eight Hrant you can try to ship it but there the or get rid of it in a landfill but you're taking a liability to your business oh yeah so there's a and it's not the same for every location in some locations it's it's more strict than others it's all depending on the municipality or the county that there yeah yeah and it's also people who people like in very aggressive permitting areas typically they'll have more they'll have some more enforcement on that okay you know so yeah so here we go I just shown you the numbers here ethanol loss it looks like you got 30 gallons per cycle in this case you're doing this is like a Cu P 30 so you got 30 gallons per cycle one gallon per 30 pounds basically that's the ratio in this case you can see I've calculated that 90% recovery that means you got three dollars per gallon per cycle that's lost there's about 55 cell cycles per day 16 dollars per gallon with the excise tax you can see that that would be the precoded food grade ethanol price and then forty seven eighty seven cost per cycle and then where there's three machines to make up a ton of day 55 cycles a day that's seven seven thousand eight hundred ninety nine costs per day so if you want to assume just for the sake of assuming that you'll get 95 percent recovery of your ethanol that's fine just take that number and divide it by two and instead of having the crossover occur at three months it's now gonna be six months right I don't care you can do that you can argue with the assumptions I I don't care certainly you're always gonna be losing something sure you never everybody who's done ethanol you know extractions has it knows that you lose ethanol so so and that's a big cost compared to for example co2 you're losing basically 22 pounds per cycle there's a certain number of cycles to get a ton of day so it's you're you're looking at about 200 11 bucks per day at 4 cents cost per pound holy cow so even if you did this at 95% evaporation right right or or or recovery right so you're doing that so what you're doing is you're dividing that cost per day in half almost that's what extends that yeah so your cost per day rather than $7,900 is really gonna be south of $4,000 right if you if you recover or recapture 5% more right okay and that's still versus $211 right this is only looking at solvent loss for methanol that's it so just just the blue Graff yeah and recovery you know recovery above 95% recovery of anything is really hard to do oh yeah so III think that they're kind of at the limits you I take a walk it's hard to recover yes I'm gonna move on here oh yeah there was a recurring question I'm just gonna kind of go just as a sidebar here there's a lot of people ask this question to us we have had okay well people use co2 for ethanol ethanol and co2 for winterization so who cares yeah well it actually is yeah we do use well you do use that for winterization no problem it's totally admit it no no problem at all but that the volume is just in a different category yeah so your losses are negligible they're really not they're hardly any compared to like if you're actually extracting one gallon per pound of biomass or whatever your ratio Wow okay yeah so anyway I'm just checking to see if there's any question from a couple of quick questions yeah David came in with co2 extraction for vape products I know that had come up earlier in the week as well yeah touch on that well yeah everybody's heard my diatribe on that I mean I think yeah I think I got I got all the haters coming out on that one look you can yeah co2 products are what I consider to be clinical grade products because you are avoiding the risk of cross-contamination now if you you see a food grade co2 I really and you use it and you're doing your reuse tests and validation tests on that as you're reusing it I don't really have any problem with that but co2 is going to definitely give you a cleaner extract definitely and if you buy organic co2 or organic the organic hemp or organic biomass and then use co2 you are golden lattice that is the pure stuff that you can find yeah you know and we're seeing a huge push to that in vape I mean at least the things that I'm saying yeah especially because of right ingestion of that we're seeing a lot of that push to organic and co2 because the co2 is automatically organic you can get organic ethanol right but yeah it's yeah it's taking that $33 in trouble yeah okay so anyway what I have here is so yeah true co2 extraction needs ethanol for winterization um that yeah we use that you have a product and Dan you would ask that question that very question you know what's the difference if you know crude is dropped and a lot of people ask 'introduction anyway why why are we having this argument right and it and it's because of it's an it's a scale issue yeah that's a scale you're using so much more in the extraction right process then right so if you're doing a lot of hemp extraction you're paying a lot for you know ethanol I mean you're basically using 22 times more ethanol than what we would use in the co2 co2 process so anyway food grade ethanol is used to avoid commercial chemical contaminants ethanol reuse is still subject to the FDA GMP practice for change on validation specification requirements I'm not going to talk about that that's a whole nother topic what is required from the FDA perspective for reuse of solvents it's it's quite extensive so in other words you have to have a specification then you have to you have to test to that specification and to validate that it is suitable for reuse but doesn't even the thing actually say that it has to go back to its original original state it's impossible really it is impossible so there's there's a there is an issue that's going to happen what's going to happen is you know like when the FDA starts to really start just to inspect they're gonna come into facilities and they're gonna they're gonna start looking at the piles of dirt on the floor okay that's the first thing that they're gonna do and you know some people put them there just so though and then and then they're gonna start looking at paperwork and then they're going to be applying their industrial guidance to these facilities and their industrial guidance that you say okay well where's your validation papers where your where is all this stuff and if you don't have it and you're running a wreath ethanol reuse program and you you know you're gonna run a mock with the FDA so I don't I don't know anybody actually we've been inspected by the FDA but I don't know a lot of people who have been inspected by the FDA unless they have an actual GMP certificate so we we have okay now I'm gonna go on here so now let's talk about solvent changeover okay now some people the GMP requirement okay is that you actually define how many times you can use the solvent again and again and again you can't just continue using it forever and ever okay okay so they make you define that in a document and so there's a certain frequency that you need to change out your solvents okay and I don't know if any of you guys do that if you can if you put a comment in there we'll kind of talk about you know what what is required from the standpoint of compliancy but if you do that and you have a certain number of cycles that you say okay I'm gonna every 30 cycles I'm gonna change all my solvents what that means is that you have hazardous waste coming out that you need to manifest and get rid of it's not expensive it's like you know like maybe four or five hundred bucks a barrel something like that to get rid of you know flammable solvents and then and then you have then you have the actual cost of you know recharging your system with fresh you know ethanol okay now I don't know if you guys do this I'd like to hear from you if you guys do this if you just keep reusing it forever and ever I mean you know your process it's your solvents are gonna get gummed up okay I'll tell you I'll tell you there's a good reason to do it and and I'll just kind of see if I can go forward here oh yeah right here here's a good reason for it let me let me kind of bring it down here so in the first circle you have you have three concentric circles the first one is your starting solvent okay and that's where you have in this case I have a denature solvent so the gray is actually a Dean a Trent the blue is actually water and then the yellow is actually ethanol and you can see that I'm starting off with it you know approximately an 80% you know ethanol ethanol solution okay all right and then after you extract your obviously you have you have cannabinoids that are in there and you have ethanol that's in there and you have your denature it and you have water and you also have other stuff which is unknown okay now you do your recovery operation in other words you're you're distilling off that ethanol that's the third concentric circle and you can see that with the first cycle you have a little bit of that other left in there even after recovery and if you do the analysis you can actually see that in there now you don't just stick with that other actually since ethanol is such a great solvent it's such a wonderful solvent it's you know crazy good it's going to dissolve as much as it can and it's going to cumulate this other component over time and this has been recognized by the FDA and so they're saying hey guys you you have to change us you have to change your solvents out because the solvents you use are typically they'll accumulate gunk they'll accumulate stuff and you don't want to go use rocky stuff yeah yeah you want to cross-contaminate it because some of that could be pesticides for example for example so I'm gonna now I'm gonna back up just a little bit here so is solvent changeover required yeah there's all kinds of FDA guidance here here's what you have to have specifications testing data on impurities and then the maximum number of times the solvent can be recycled this is what's required I highly doubt I have never seen a ethanol operation do this well so I don't know what's what the deal is other than you can go into the FDA it's all there for you I can contact me I'll send you their stuff but this is the summary for you there's the original state and suitable yeah and and the data on the maximum number of times that it can be recycled the question that came in my mind and I'm sure I've seen a couple of questions pop up over here if mmm if you said like every 30 / cycles or whatever rather than me and date a certain number of cycles and using that as a benchmark should you be using that as a test and testing what's there yeah well that's where the testing costs come is Finn right in the specification so usually what happens is okay I have a specification for food grade ethanol there's my specification that's now my accept criteria and I hae need to test to see if I have reached that original specification if I haven't so then what I do is I use it you know 30 times and I establish okay well it looks like I can't meet my original specification anymore therefore now I can't use that anymore or I have to recondition it or I have to do something to it to to reuse it okay so that's what the FDA is looking for they're looking for the manufacturer to have specifications and to have a testing protocol to test again so specifications to see if they have actually done done brought it back to the original state so at the risk of jumping forward the that icky stuff that's in there that's left in there and it continues to accumulate right is that contaminating your next batches it depends on what it is I mean okay so it could be cellular matter or it could be small molecules from the plant I I wouldn't consider that anything bad okay but it could be other stuff like you could accumulate pesticides or if you had you know if you had some other you know compounds in there than unknown you test that yes that's something you need to think and then that would contaminate future batches right right that could be so cross contamination in a FDA environment cross contamination is a big deal and in they are always looking for where is that potential risk of cross contamination from is the risk real or is it perceived in the case of this you would in case of solvents it's definitely real but I think that in combination with incoming inspections and things like that you can kind of establish hey that that other category is at least not not gonna hurt people okay I think that that would be the case plus if you actually went and you measured some you could you could basically say hey look you know it looks it looks good it's not it's not it's not the bad stuff okay and there is a question that came up which i think is pertinent to this and that is what are those common denature ins Oh Ethel and which ones are persistent in processing or are they all persistent ya know okay here here's the deal with residuals and that's what DNA trans are added chemicals to ethanol chemical manufacturers put them in there on purpose they you cannot drink a ethanol solution that has a denature int in it that's the purpose it has a like methanol or HEC teen or whatever my beef with that of course is that we don't really know the health effects and neither does the FDA and neither does the NIOSH or the European FDA on those particular things and if you take them out of there you take them out of your oils and stuff they're still in their adult small amount and my my thing is hey why would you why over if you take CBD stuff or CBD tinctures over time you're basically accumulating them over time so what you have in terms of the most common denaturants are really hep teen you i we have seen we've done a study on this where we've taken a whole bunch of samples basically from ethanol producers there must have been I don't know the last count but it was over 20 and 25 to 30 percent of them had you know like large amounts of diene agent in them so they were acetone what we found we found isopropyl alcohol found some other other things along we found hep teen we found hexane and they were selling these off as real real products so anyway I think that that is a big deal even if it below the accept threshold for me I'm not gonna take it okay that that's it so let me see here what is solvent changeover okay we talked about that okay this is the cost to solvent changeover you can see here's 15,000 here's an ethanol changeover oh yeah this is the there's two different tables at the very bottom okay one of them is a solvent changeover in five days and one of them is a solvent changeover in 20 days okay so you can see you're averaging the changeover over time and if it's 30 days that cost per day is going to go down so for those of you who do this it's a real cost and I'm gonna skip this okay so but you guys are probably asking hey you know I don't change out my solvents you know I know they FDA requires it but we don't do it so what's you know so I don't believe your cost analysis okay so so what I did was I anticipated that and in basically I plotted this I took that whole entire cost out and I just replied at everything and you can see that here over on this side right here over on the right hand side is without that cost put in there so so the long side is the original one that we had discussed that's with this solvent change over cost and then the one on the right hand side is no no solvent change over cost at all I just took completely took it out I deleted it you can still see you can still see the slope is still there the slope is still there it's very very difficult to compete with for cents a pound the cross over time changes from like three months up to like nine and nine months eight to ten months eight to it'll actually it's right on eight so I can I can say it's right on eight so oh yeah so it doesn't prove that but it doesn't help you in after eight months in fact it's still hurting you okay so if you Subang you just say okay I don't care about the FDA I don't care about these rules because they're not helping me and they're not enforcing them at the moment so while you're buying yourself six months I'm buying myself six months that's it exactly but you after that you still have to compete with the guy who's who's extracting it that's a potential of cross-contamination or residual yeah there's that and so you know you have costs associated with that you have testing costs associated with that you have the actual changeover itself so I neglected all that in here so just to show you that hey our analysis is still valid even when you take that cost completely out of it okay now I'm going to talk about energy costs a lot of people we get a lot of questions on energy yes and I really do yeah well you know what do we need here so let's kind of look at energy costs here's ethanol on the left hand side and co2 is on the right hand side this is an into end energy cost which means it's it's everything taken together so it looks like you're looking at about seventy seven dollars a day to run a co2 facility at one ton per day that's a that's about what you're gonna be spending the ethanol is a lot higher in that that has to do with one thing and that that's amount of it's all of that ethanol that you need to basically bring up to boiling point and then vaporize and there's there's a basically that energy deficit is called the heat of vaporization and it's pretty big for ethanol so you have to put a lot of Watson you have to put a lot of power in if you have a lot of ethanol you have to have a lot of power so that that's it so looking at for one ton a day using the Delta Cu P 30 numbers in the kilowatts associated with that y adding it all up along with the heat of vaporization to remove all that ethanol you're looking at it basically 423 per day so that's so basically seventy seven dollars per day versus 423 per day it it's it's it's significantly different that's huge yeah it is so and and just so that I'm clear this is not our data this is not internal data this is data you pulled from Delta and other third party yeah as well as our one on the Left the assumptions I the assumptions is what I pulled from them got it and then in other words we looked at the cut sheets and then we added up all the watts for all the cuts okay would need and then follow their process and in this case they have three units 55 cycles God and they have a certain number of gallons that have to be you know then basically evaporated sure and we know the heat of vaporization we know how much it watts so we calculated it from and put that back into the model and then calculate the cost so that that's really what that is okay so yeah it look we we have a product called the frack tron and that's a basically a solvent remover product okay it removes like you know gallons and gallons and gallons of like what is it forty gallons an hour or something like that it's crazy amount of yeah it really does require a lot of power so I could verify that that's true so you know whatever so it's six times more costly mmm-hmm for energy yeah and ethanol and on co2 yeah yeah I know I always like to look at the numbers as you know kind of ranges so you know give yourself a range because there's always variabilities and these numbers are relative to you know the assumptions that we're making versus assumptions you're making by the way we have we're almost done with the calculator I promise promise promise on this so you can do these scenarios yourself you can put in and do sliders and everything like that on on your assumptions so let's move on here labor and testing Casas just they're the same I mean essentially you know we need one guy to run a ton and he's not going to be working all the time so you know and I think that that's pretty much the same you know one guy per shift to run the see you pee 30 you know you maybe get some labor advantage I don't know if you're doing like a big batch process so you did one ton and you just put it and let it go ours does not like that you had to eat someone there to tend the machine so but then you're not you're not really scaling your process okay you're not like okay I'm gonna go with one ton and I'm gonna run one pound a day you're not really scaling your process up so you may have a little bit more labor with the co2 I don't really know actually not with the Cu P 30 that we just talked about but certainly with certainly with maybe like a really super large machine so you may have a little labor or savings there they're big machines out there yeah they're yeah so that's that's that but I don't think okay so you add you take away a headcount okay you you add it you take like okay take all the labour out I don't even care it's not even a blip on the map yeah I mean it's hardly anything yeah so I don't it the cost analysis what my points the cost analysis is still yeah still very valid absolutely so you know so you you there's a couple things to think about now you have the cost comparison now for one ton per day but then you add in all of that solvent lost cost just looking at solvent loss alone using those figures I mean if you add all that up over time you're really talking about a lot of money that is and so you know the co2 is really going to give you a lower cost per gram to produce you know a lot of people want to press us on that okay well what's what's the what is the cost per gram to produce there's a whole bunch of assumptions that you can make and we can get calculators for you so you can make your own assumptions on those because it does vary I mean what are you sure you know what are you gonna have in for overhead manufacturing overhead which I don't know what you guys are gonna have for overhead what are you gonna have for your sgna which is your sure your sales marketing you know all that stuff is gonna you know add to the chat to it so alright so anyway that's the bottom line and on terms of the cost so that's when you look at how that method then will affect your enterprise value okay let's think about this together so I have two methods method a and method B and you have a huge operating cost that's lowering my gross margin a method a and I have a low cost method that had that cost me more on the equipment sub watt side but it's going to be a radically lower in cost to produce a kilo worth of product which one do you go with well that's a business question right yeah absolutely and in my thought is that I don't want to mortgage the future so that I can save a million dollars at the get-go I'm gonna go with a lower-cost process because the process in the investors everything are going to be evaluating you on your ability to create and generate cash correct that's it long term long term and and a long term and also the cash that you generate in the short term is going to be basically probably reinvested into the business or the more cash you have in the short term the more you're going to be able to invest the more sales people you're gonna have either the more product development your marketing you'll be able to marketing you can do the more March and you have so and then when you think about your your company the net present value which is basically a series if you add up all those cash flows over time and then you discount them to add it to like to give you a value of like today you know that's really where if you have a larger cash generation out of method a versus method B or method B or method a you're really able to say okay well this is really really gonna value my business cuz I know what's gonna happen that's right the accountants are gonna come in and they want I you know they're gonna look at my business they're gonna look at what I'm doing and that number is gonna make a big impact on on my net present value and those opposed to all of the investors are looking at yeah net present values is critical yeah absolutely yeah and then when you talk about maybe the sale of your company then you're talking about a multiple of e beta or a multiple of e bit or whatever metric they want to use but the multiples are greater for higher even a values that's just the way it is also the book value which is basically your balance sheet value you know because it's costing me more you have a greater PPE the book value is gonna be better too and your enterprise value is all going to be much better so things that there's there's a great great virtue in gross margin and if you can you know take your operations and you know make them better to improve your ghost margin that is that is a key a key thing so you know a lot of the well-run companies like it you know that they all talked about that had good operational excellence like GE and whatnot yeah they they all had armies of people going after you know half a point of margin absolutely because because that would improve their gross margin which would improve their net margin which would it increase their multiple which would increase their stock price it flow that's why yeah that's why they that's why they did that and just that's why this is important one of the things just so you know EBIT duh stands for earnings before interest and taxes and depreciation depreciation and amortization that's the doc you bet done so further down when we're talking about enterprise value it's just the e bit you know you know earnings before interest in taxes you take out the depreciation and amortization because those are not cash items right so you take those out what plus cash - dad that gives you enterprise value so those are just things you want to make sure you understand as you're talking to investors as well so that and there's primers all over online for that - but net present value get to know that get get familiar and comfortable with that language because if you can talk about that and convey that to investors they're gonna love it they're gonna they're gonna think you're awesome and you know talking about the EBIT multiples and book values and enterprise they want to know that you understand the business side of it cuz right so you know we could we could have gotten into all of the what I can of them red herring oh yeah kind of they are kind of red herring arguments like Oh Ethel is a stronger solvent so why I don't care yeah well haven't allows greater throughput well I'm comparing apples to apples here one ton for one ton yeah oh well you know it's it's got a shorter runtime again yeah okay yeah okay well you use ethanol in your process of why you co2 anyway well I kind of did explain that one that kind of is helpful for you guys all of those red herring arguments they just kind of wither and die when you when you start to look at the absolute cost of really what you're doing and saying okay well what am I really doing here you've got some other questions here on method C like your next question you know what was the next thing you know we we kind of are focusing on major you know like co2 is use industrial dust really all over the world for a lot of different things including extractions and things like that it is it is a beautiful method there are things you know that are like the next that they're trying to do like microwave all these are or heat even yeah okay all they are is trying to add energy to the liquid so that it will extract faster that's all that is so there's lots of different ways to do that you can use use lots of ways to get the heat into it okay you know ultrasonic is one way to do that your your your putting the heat your putting energy into the flowing stream okay there are advantages and disadvantages of that basically because you've got a lot of bubbles you're making and and you have to have it you have to tune it and actually the energy only goes a little ways away from the horn it's only like you know like a millimeter two millimeters away from the horn there are there are other things you know and I don't say that those are bad it's just they're not normal techniques that people you know people are trying to my point is that if you have an hour-long we're on time you can do 16 kilos an hour you can make that amount you know you can make a lot of money basically just doing you ethanol or co2 or whatever what's the point you know yeah what's the point aren't doing it I'm an RD guy too it's just a really expensive to do Rd and you know I think that when you think about the next it's like okay well I would have to come up with a process that could compete with for cents a pound how can I possibly do that and I think the one thing that I want to make sure that is we're talking about when you when you go with ultrasonic ultrasound microwave other elements those are you know you're putting energy into you know from electronic electrical energy but when we're talking about co2 well we're talking about more is pressure yeah right so that's the energy that we're using more than anything right it's the pressure right as opposed to ultrasonic waves or microwaves or whatever right yeah you're thinking right it's it's yeah so yeah so it's a is there a mass transfer problem with co2 I don't I don't think so it's not there's no mass transfer problem co2 exactly and I'm not saying there there are I'm just making sure you know from my mind that as we compare methods see mm-hmm the comparison is really about right the the pressure as well as the electrical input that it takes to exert that pressure right and not just the cost of yeah and I would I would say that any any competing technique that you have would need to you know it would need to compete with the four cents a pound yeah exactly and and that's exactly in the power yeah yeah thank you Brian for that I appreciate that question that was very good okay okay uh so anyway that that's the that's the main reason why I focused on costs you know there's all kinds of other other arguments that I mean we can go through them really quickly but I don't I don't see you know oh one thing about scalability that was one thing oh it's not scalable see that's predicated on the fact that okay that so the the argument goes like this you have a low ethanol it's better on being solvent power has a high solvent power therefore in co2 is less therefore it's low therefore has a long cycle time therefore it has a low throughput therefore it's not scalable okay all there's just a ton of assumptions in there it's not true it's all bogus busted okay because because you guys can go on to our you know our YouTube channel here and click a online video that shows a five-ton de ton and a facility running on co2 and it's an extremely small footprint so it's just not not correct it's a cool video it's yeah it's about 55 minutes and I would recommend that you go there absolute on our youtube channel subscribe we get a lot of these kind of videos and a lot of Education there too as well are we at a point where I can ask a few other just questions that aren't related to just operational cost or I don't want to truncate you I think this is it that's all I have Oh additional hidden costs oh there's lots of hidden costs there's stuff that I told you we didn't talk about sure okay but one of those would be hazardous waste disposal happy missions in case you are in an area where there's you know concern over HAP and which is hazardous air pollutants which would be ethanol if if you stuck it outside and let it dry let me see here increased insurance costs you know aren't surance company goes crazy you know when we got when we got a total Bethan all in our facility they just go crazy oh kid can't have total Bethan all okay alright fine well we gave him our fire analysis that we do and he said okay it's okay but you know there was I can't imagine what it what a real ethanol processor does when the insurance guy walks through you know and I mean you he wouldn't allow us to keep it outside I mean that was one thing oh well just put it outside so you know unless you have permits for that you know also adjoining building issues that can really sink your whole entire operation so something to think about and there's also costs associated that with that and then local permits cost differences and so on and so forth so those are some of the oh I those are some of the things and then I got ethanol scorecard look at that okay okay so yep infrastructure cost oh wait ethanol wins and okay infrastructure costs we went on the infrastructure because we can operate in an f2 occupancy and if you're doing one ton a day you're gonna have more ethanol that's allowed an f2 occupancy oh and so you need to move to an h2 occupancy and the deal there is you know square footage-wise if you're gonna build it up new is $232 per square foot for an h2 occupancy as opposed to something like 63 for an F to occupy oh my gosh so if you know that's something if you're trying to take an existing building and with an F occupancy and make it into an h2 occupancy you're gonna learn about all those costs okay so we win on that okay ethanol wins on equipment cost we just can't compete with you know low pressure I mean low pressures yeah you know expensive so and then operating cost we win on that for sure and enterprise value we went on that I think throughput is a draw in this case basically because I was comparing apples to apples one time of day one yeah there are there are massive ethanol you know extraction equipment out there that'll do you know ten tons a day that type of thing so I didn't compare our one ton a day to their ten tons a day and say there's winds just comparing apples to apples I'm good in terms of scalability we win because you can there really is a nice way to scale and I that's probably a good topic for us to do absolutely and then our hidden costs we win on those because they're they're all less so in my view here's the here's our scorecard I think we've won oh one other question why does a co2 equipment cost more you know a lot of people have questions about that why does it cost more to for co2 equipment well okay we a lot of the like if you're gonna do a weldment which is basically ethanol equipment is a bunch of weldments you know a lot of those are prefabbed up and you can get them in China so we don't have those we don't have those low cost source of weldments okay prefab weldments so all of our vessels are prefab they're all forged in the USA here we have a foundry we get them we get a big you know billet of material we do all of our own stuff it's all in the USA so that's part of the reason why the equipment cost a little bit more also the pumps are more expensive because you know you're pumping at you know 5000 psi yeah yes so and then high inside pressure by the way high pressure is not unsafe yeah just to let you guys know that I mean you everybody here's is a pressure washer I mean they got you know my pressure washer goes up to 4500 psi and I can operate it and I have my 12 year old kid operate it it's not like you're gonna die but because the pressure you know high pressure does not not necessarily equal unsafe and we I I think that there's been you know among all the co2 manufacturers out there I don't know of a single like catastrophic event yeah but I do know with ethanol there's been fires already like big fires yeah and I also know that there have been explosions with you tamen propane oh yeah and those have been in the in the in the news okay so I I think that you know women if municipalities are cracking down on what they're offering and allowing as well because of that yeah right so anyway so that's why it's more expensive basically you have you know just the components that go into it and of course co2 operations are of higher value so why would we discount all of our all of our you know equipment to ethanol when we're offering such a huge value to our customers in low cost operations I mean it's just you know it's just higher value so anyway yeah so that's the Oh checkmate oh look at that I got the gnome there he just hey couple quick questions and then we'll we'll bounce Cara had asked some questions about co2 yeah in the safety of co2 yeah is co2 exposure has yeah so that you need to have a sensor on your system and we have sensors throughout the entire basically we have them on our equipment we have them in the facilities your exposure is 5000 ppm maximum for an eight-hour period and so you know typically we're measuring you know maybe five for 500 600 ppm max of co2 in the facility it's a it's an exposure that a that would happen if you had a leak but you know so you know if you had you have a leak you you get out and there's also you know a lot of like our co2 systems they're all hooked up to like exhaust fans so you can exhaust it out but normally I mean your breathe that we're breathing co2 right now so it's not like em ethanol for example in terms of even toxicity okay so yeah I would say that that would be you know make sure you have lots of co2 systems and they make ones where you can put them right on the wall and they'll alarm and they're they're really great and we have them built into our facility basically all of our equipment so we have double suspenders all right well that's that's excellent and Kara thank you for that question and many of you have asked if we can get this out the presentation and absolutely there will be a replay link available to you no problem we've got lots and lots of questions they've been they keep coming in or it will have more of these as we go we want to be respectful of your time we've covered a lot of material state good job man well done so join us next week next week we are going to be talking about an illegal primer whoa does that mean we're going to teach them how to be illegal yeah yes so how to make your facility's violate every possible is this gonna be conducted by the gnome that would be kind of fun actually oh my gosh okay too funny alright so next week illegal primer 101 next Thursday noon central be here thank you for being here we just so appreciate it dr. John well done again I just want what you say our favorite part of being here is interacting with you getting your questions understanding where you are we're not we don't have an axe to grind that's not our why we're here we're here to help you make money for us to make money we want to lock arms and run with you as we go forward that's really what we want to do subscribe to our YouTube our calculator library is on its way there were a couple of things that we needed to make adjustments and because dr. John wanted them a little more whiz-bang in the calculators to just bring more value to you guys so that's just taking a little bit extra time sorry about that visit us on all our social channels LinkedIn YouTube Instagram Twitter Facebook and and look at our site as well we've got a lot of resources a lot of Education our blog oh my gosh our blog is like a bunch of white papers I mean how many blogs do we do a week or three two or three yeah and they're like white papers I mean it's not they're not small they're they're not trivial so go there thank you again and congratulations Jewel and Andrews for being the winner and sign up make sure that we get the winning we're good I think so is there anything that they can do to give feedback direct to this presentation if you guys have any questions or whatever I'd be really really awesome it'd be really great to interact with you you know if you got say hey I don't really like this right don't just just give me is there a way for them to get hold of me okay yeah just reply to the registration email and with extra questions with comments with hey you didn't consider this we'd love to hear that what what did we consider what didn't we consider what did you learn we're always learning yeah dr. John one of the big things is hey we're we you know we're we're an R&D facility more than anything and we're always learning and you know you can leave feedback on social media any of our social media channels they're monitored regularly yeah Jared's out there you know doing all of that we got a great team we got a great team San thanks thanks to you guys too we got James and April in the background here these guys are awesome they they make everything run smoothly so anyway and well and they kind of keep us in line they do well they try they push the mute [Laughter]", "2D8idjzO7u8": "hi my name's Travis in this video I'll be showing you how to extract cloves and cinnamon with vodka these cloves and cinnamon have been sitting in this vodka wash for approximately 7 years in order to perform the extraction process I'll first filter the plant material then freeze the vodka wash next I will dewaxing as the winterizing with a Buechner filter funnel it ordered to remove any of any waxes or lipids that have sort of congealed or precipitated out during the freezing phase then we'll do an alcohol purge with a device known as the source by extract craft this is a closed-loop ethanol extractor similar to a rotary evaporator and then the final step of the process I'll do a final degassing using this vacuum chamber the first stage is to filter the plant material I could have used the Buechner filter funnel for this purpose but for some reason I chose not to instead I just chose to use the coffee filter it'll take a little longer because there's no vacuum pressure but you'll still get the same result so once this is stopped dripping I'll put the I'll put some saran wrap on the top of this and put it in the freezer I have about 90 milliliters of the vodka wash here and it'll go into the freezer overnight [Music] before I go get the wash out of the freezer I'm first going to put some vodka in here get the filter saturated with the liquid so that the the suction works correctly and doesn't pull any of the liquid underneath the filter when I pour the washin [Music] I've just retrieved the wash from the freezer it's pretty well congealed it's vodka not ethanol so there's less ethanol in it that then if I was using 190-proof alcohol and it must have extracted over the seven years a lot of lipids or waxes so I'm just gonna let this sit out for a little bit until it turns more of liquidy consistency and then I'll put it through the Buechner filter funnel [Music] [Music] I also have some advice in terms of the filter flask this was the tubing I used the wall on this tubing is very thin it was crimping I highly recommend going with a thicker tubing and see how it can see I'm squeezing it right there much light less likely to crimp with this heavy wall tubing this is the source by extract craft that has the top lid and in the alcohol recollection chamber and vacuum chamber this right here is the the vacuum suction port this is where the crucible goes screws on and I presume it also heats now I am NOT going to use the crucible that comes with the device instead I'm just going to put this glass beaker right on top of that metal the metal bit and I'm then going to push the green button once to put it on to normal mode to help keep the beaker in place on top of the screw I have this three inch diameter piece of copper that I place in first and balance and then I can put the beaker on top of and a kind of rests when I tilt the device back sometimes the beaker will roll back but it's still on the copper so as that screw in there is heating up it'll heat the copper up and disperse the heat so the beaker becomes a little bit warmer than if the copper disc wasn't there when you're releasing the the vacuum after the device is finished evaporating and the alcohol is condensed in the collector here and you can I guess I just unplug it and then I don't know if that's the correct operating procedure or you can just release the bat vacuum by turning it counterclockwise and you want to listen listen for a hiss and the complete intake of air telling you that the vacuum has been released the second thing to be aware of it is sometimes takes a bit of pressure here on the lid in order to - in order for the the seal to be created and for the VAT for this device to hold vacuum once I had this slightly this rubber gasket at the bottom slightly out of place and that wasn't holding the vacuum another time I forgot to actually fully closed this this port the other thing is to use the app I highly recommend using the app that comes with this device just to make sure you are you know you are achieving vacuum if you don't achieve vacuum then the vacuum will just continually start up it's best to just monitor on the app so you think you know you know that the devices achieved sufficient vacuum and you couldn't walk away from it otherwise there won't be sufficient vacuum and the vacuum will just continuously turn on the feet in the front are higher than the feet in the back so that when the alcohol evaporates and collects on the glass that it rolls the back and then rolls down the there are two modes with this device there's normal operating mode and then there's turbo mode turbo mode also goes to a hundred percent vacuum but a little bit more energy is put into device device it's my understanding that the device heats just a little bit more and make the process all that much faster this is the final result after running the machine on normal once and then turbo for additional times with the vodka that I was using there wasn't as much alcohol there was a little bit more water so the process took a little bit more time and I had to use turbo mode a few more times than I would have had to do it if I if the if it wasn't vodka and it was 190 percent ethanol [Music] it's been sitting in the vacuum chamber for at least 24 hours and this is the final product [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause]", "3G-7XwYV6ls": "of this material we used is about 90% of CBD and 0.3 of THC or less because we know how to sometimes during the shock of this relation that each C can rise up and we know how to deal with it that TG will never go up and we know how to clean this up which steps you are removing that hitting those technologies so and also with this bucket you see we can do it like remove the THC from here and this is this is now a 78% of CBD we can make it it will be having 90 percent of CBD and the THC will stay as it as long as it is so 0.19 and it is so simple things so

hi my name is anthony smith i'm the ceo and founder of smith systems and geforce hemp and i'm here today to talk to you about the difference between ethanol extraction hydrocarbon extraction and co2 extraction when it comes to large scale hemp you need to be as efficient as possible and there's costs associated with scalability in this process you want to try to find the best balance of quality and efficiency and scalability through your extraction technique with hemp the best choice in solvent from our findings and our data and you know being a post extraction refinement lab for many years that deals with hydrocarbon extracts co2 extract you know ethanol extract methanol extract hexane extract it all comes down to doing it the fewest amount of steps with ethanol you there's you can do it in a single step producing a fully winterized deep carb oil with co2 extraction you're going to produce a raw crude and it's going to still have your waxes your lipids your fats and your pigments still more present and what it does is you might see a higher mass yield with co2 sometimes but in your product your extraction solvent is going to target more of your your unwanted less of your wanted so with with ethanol you're going to be targeting you know a lot more of what you want so you're not going to be pulling the waxes the lipids the fats like you do with the co2 resulting in a lot cleaner oil in a single step the main advantage to single solvent cold ethanol extraction is there's no need for winterization which is a secondary step to remove impurities so in in ethanol extraction we are so cold and we have an inline filter to where we catch all those different fats lipids waxes that don't end up in your final product with hydrocarbon extraction and co2 extraction a secondary process is needed called winterization which is dewaxing your oil of its fats and lipids with the other forms of extraction you're going to have to introduce ethanol later in the process anyway so why not just start with the choice solvent you're going to have to use which is ethanol [Music] through our strategic partnerships and sister companies we're able to help standardize this process to allow farmers to have a peace of mind kind of what to expect in this process and we're also able to provide full transport to our facility as well and in most cases we have distribution to help the farmers monetize their end product and you know make make it so you know they want to do this again and it standardizes the profitability at each step to where it's going to be sustainable for long term", "8y2-SU7om-A": "hello my name is Troy from extract craft in this video I'm going to be explaining purge mode for our ito Pro ethanol recovery unit in addition to the information I'll be providing here you can also check out page 11 of the user manual that's downloadable on our website WWF comm so now let's kind of get into it what is purge mode why do we use it and all the intricacies of the actual function itself as you can see on the control dial there there's a red art and the green art the red arcs for extract the green arc is for purge extract mode is primarily for ethanol recovery and oil production while purge mode is a post-production option to further reduce the residual ethanol in your end concentrate so when do we need post-production purging and purge mode first it's not necessary for all botanicals in fact it's not necessary for most botanicals typically this mode is used for end products that are destined to be either smoked or Veit second you can some people who have an acute ethanol sensitivity might feel more comfortable purging it further third and like it helps create stability in your concentrate so if you're trying to make things like wax shatter butter crumble those types of things stability is quite an important thing and that you can achieve by further post-processing using the purge mode keep in mind stability is also influenced by things like the quality of your material quality of filtering the presence of fats lipids plant material the stage of D carb the plant material may actually be in and you know other things strain characteristics are actually very important as well lastly post production is likely going to be necessary for licensed producers to satisfy any regulatory needs for residual solvents so now let's talk about purge mode and how act how easy it actually is to use you simply take your oil and you put it in the kettle you don't want to use a secondary containment or mat to put in because as it progresses you don't want it to adhere to the kettle on the sides or on the bottom so use the secondary silicon utensil inside the actual unit once it's in there you choose on the dial in the purge mode between 80 and 100 degrees what temperature you'd like to actually do the purging at push the button one time what's going to happen then is this the pumps will cycle one time just on and off just to let you know the command was accepted and then you'll start getting gentle heat in the bottom of the kettle it's that easy so there are two easy ways to use purge mode you can use it as a simple hot plate with no lid no vacuum or it can be used as a vacuum oven by adding an auxilary pump and lid like these using purge mode as a hot plate is very easy just like I select the temperature push the button you get gentle heat and that's all there is to it using purge mode as a vacuum oven is more complicated here you'll need the extra equipment I mentioned a simple vacuum with lid that works on an 8 and a half inch diameter chamber and a 3 CFM two-stage pump is probably quite sufficient for your needs you may also want to add a cold trap to protect the pump and keep the oil clean it'll increase the longevity of your pump by quite a bit and protect it from the ethanol vapors that you will be purging from the contents of your kettle Thank You Merlin are all pretty similar and have the same basic components the gage the vent and the vacuum port the gage allows you to read what vacuum level is being pulled inside the chamber as the vacuum pump is pulling down now when you get a new one you're going to always want to make sure you cut off the diaphragm nipple or pull the pin to let the gage equalize to your local altitude the vent obviously allows air to either go in or out either allowing the vacuum line to create the vacuum or breaking the vacuum to allow air in having a filter is very important so you can keep all contaminants from being sucked in the vent is also pretty cool because you can while the pump is running you can leave the vent just cracked which we call a bleed and maintain a lower level of vacuum that's got a continuous flow at all times to kind of vent the chamber as well a little bit advanced so you might want to just start with the closed valve and let it kind of evaporate and then open and burp it and do that kind of cycle on the vacuum port side this is very very important this can cause some problems for newbies and even experienced people quite often if there's a negative pressure in this line and this vent is left open excuse me I should say vacuum port is left open the negative pressure can suck oil out of the case and the pump into the chamber and pollute your concentrate obviously you never want that to happen so the good rule of thumb is always have this vent closed before you turn the vacuum pump off if you follow that you won't have a problem with it also if you are going to use a cold trap which i think is a very good idea and I would recommend it will protect the oil in your pump and increase the longevity of your pump to stop the vapor from the ethanol vapor from traveling into the pump and degrading the oil the cold trap will go basically right here in between the lid and the pump highly recommend using one okay here are some tips for using purge mode as a vacuum oven first you're going to want to elevate the oil a little bit off the bottom so it doesn't get the direct heat and has more ambient heating next before you apply vacuum to it put the oil in let it warm up for 30 minutes to an hour so when you when you applied the vacuum it'll have a nice even activity to the concentrate you're gonna see a bubble and muffin and that's good but when you apply that vacuum pay very close attention to the amount of activity that's happening if it's going crazy and bubbling all over that's too much if it's not doing anything it's not enough where you want in the beginning it's kind of this nice round muffin and see if you can hold this muscle it looks almost like a parachute because that's going to give you the highest rate of evaporation in the beginning as the purging goes goes on your concentrates can become more stable and activity is going to get less and less so what you're going to want to do is a couple things one periodically you're going to want to burp the chamber which means allowing air to go in so you open the vent allow air to go in close it and then reapply in the vacuum so you have basically fresh air that fresh air in there and you get rid of the ethanol that's trapped in there that may inhibit the faster evaporation of ethanol they're still in the concentrate next you're going to want to flip the slab once in awhile which means taking it out and flipping the concentrate over so the bottom has the ability to evaporate as well as the top side so that way you get equal evaporation on both sides of the concentrate and stability will be had more quickly lastly be patient and pay attention these are very important for quality post process purging and high-quality output attention and patient is paramount finally I'd like to conclude with a few very important points first never leave the equipment unattended it's very dangerous because it's very highly flammable electronics so always pay very close attention to what's going on second always use the equipment within the confines of the law third and most importantly thank you we extract craft appreciate your support your questions and your interest more than you can imagine so thank you

hem videos in today's video I'll be going back to its firm in the last video I showed you out on the field what the hemp looks like in this video we'll be going into the shed and showing you what the hemp looks like inside the shed and exactly how you dry out the hemp plant and turn it into a product that you can sell to the end customer I'll be showing you all of that in this video this is the third video in this series in the earlier two videos I showed you out in the field and just explained here about the business ideas behind hemp and I linked up them to videos below this video so that you can check it out if you haven't checked them out yet but yeah this is something that I'm really interested in at the moment I'm learning as much as possible about hemp and all of the future possibilities there is with this plant and build businesses around it because I think there's gonna be so many opportunities to build businesses in this industry in the future and that's why I'm spending so much time learning about it and I'm sharing with you what I learned here so I hope that you're joining us if you are enjoying this series give it a thumbs up so that I know that you like these types of videos but what I'm gonna do now is just flick over and show you some of the footage that I shot while on aids farm and you can learn for yourself exactly how the hemp is dried out and the end products that are made out of us [Music] so hope to be the moisture yeah you know but now that's that's our stuff that was hand picked hang home here about on just on this side here if I win acres worth ham polka and it took four lads a full week that coat is and hang it up now it's good quality stuff but it's it's tough know that I'd like to be getting properly dry it into it will air dry but now with the wet weather it is so Coco Chanel cocoa that's you really it's the drawing is the biggest problem with this whole crop but you need to be able to try that and in order to deserve it now as long as there's it was it was fully dried it is taking in a bit of moisture but it's not it's not doing any damage yes if if I seen air a little bit of mold in a guitar I'd be getting worried but but it's it is fine it is it is okay it's good and what would you do if there was mold bits in it do you fool them I wanna know yeah I want you can have it only spread yeah you know it's not too bad now it's okay yeah there's only very neighbors what a hint they're like you're looking at getting over over five around five hundred kilos all to actually pop that leaf leaf and flower you know so it's that and that's where you're you're you're cannabinoids air is going to be on that but you know that's where your hemp oil yeah but you'll get seed as well this was harvested early which will still have seed because I have males and you're not going to get to weed out there with males okay like I wouldn't buy I wouldn't bother buying family I seen unless that you knew that you're a percentage of CBD was going to be say anywhere from twelve fifteen twenty percent CBD and this is this is going to be anywhere from probably about three percent up to well we got her tested at eight percent which is very very good but I'd usually say anywhere from 3% to 5% okay can you explain the difference between CBD percentage and THC percentage well the THC is your tetrahydrocannabinol and we can only pick varieties that are going to be below zero point two percent THC th is what gets you high yeah cannabis that you'd buy on the street would be anywhere from 10 percent up to thirty percent being that super skull okay and what TAC is only 0.2% and it can only be a maximum with 0.2% and so then therefore you'd have to smoke a telephone Paul sighs joint in about ten minutes to stand like the die of smoke inhalation before he gets thrown so it's just not possible to get stoned off this him yeah and what the other compound there is your THC or CBD yeah so your CBD is your cannabidiol and that cannabidiol then can be and it would probably be anywhere from two to five percent on this variety whereas the Rays other varieties will be much higher but we're not allowed grow those they're generally varieties that are in and the states would have been crossbred with your your cannabis was the likes of ac/dc is a variety there that will have about 15% CBD it generally correlates the to generally currently together that the higher that the tea may see generally the higher the CBD of course because we're only allowed two broads ear 0.2% that's why your CBD is down now there's certain leader coming out with new genetics that you can have zero THC and a hypersensitivity force because this is industrial hemp and you're you're generally looking at a sort of two to five percent CBD now we're using this because we can because we can Road who are allowed to grow it but really and truly in the future you need to be getting into those higher percentages to justify putting in that very expensive equipment for the extraction processes your ethanol ratio to the your co2 could be half a million a million so then you have to have high percentages to justify spending that half-million no whereas what we're doing is we're called pressing this so this this is basically blended up and into a powder and mixed with seed for to a cold press and then whatever this is whether it be 2% to 5% whatever it is that's gonna melt and in that cannabinoid or and could you briefly explain what's next with what we're seeing here so after this is hung up try it out how long does it take to dry out generally about three to four weeks to dry out so and then you want to be keeping sunlight offered if sunlight comes on to that it start to go up around and not that not that that's a huge problem but just aesthetically and you want it to be nice and green so once we have that droid will be will strip strip this off and we'll we blend it blend it down to a powder and then it's mixed with that seed put your cold pressed [Applause] so this is the best day the oil tested bottle now of the of our oil so you can see here now is the book with a seed I have a show so this is the hand seed that's that's your hem see so that's about 20 percent oil right you won't get a full 100% extraction when you go through the cold press you'll get so it takes about a kilo of this seed to make this 25 to 250 ml bottle of of oil and once you press that seed the end up with this cake so that cake is very high in fiber and high in protein so this that's that's the company that presses it for a stylish health or as they're often Ashburn and this is the it's that cake and is milled down and it's put into that package so you have a nice fine powder that you can add to your smoothies or shakes your cereal biscuits bars various different things very high in protein very high in fiber then this is your your oils then that's what's your brand minimum okay Dean Mountain Farms okay you can see you son Facebook and Instagram stop and what does most people you could be on your for and well it's I suppose salads is the big one now it's not what you call a cooking oil it doesn't like that really high heat it's a poly saturated fat so it doesn't like that real high heat you can do a bit of baking with it and things like that what is it it's used similar that you would use a grapeseed oil but it doesn't like that it's not a cooking oil like you wouldn't be frying in my head now or anything but it is it's a very it's a very healthy oil to be just using on your salads using in estos homelesses I do just take that I actually get a glass of milk and pour out two tablespoons of oil into my milk and I drink it down that way and it's a bit like a peanut milkshake like it has it has a nice nutty flavor little bit grassy push it's a more of a notary or taste and it's it's it's not five like it's not an oil no that you take off the spoon like the die-hard might do that hearted but generally I put it in ass will be exactly cool yeah put it in a smoothie added in that way because it is a really healthy oil because you're getting all of your amigas I get has the perfect balance between concerns you know of that four to one ratio Omega six to omega-3 closer has GLA which is gamma Leone gases and that Gamal ionic acid is an anti-inflammatory I hope that you've learned a lot from this video I know that I've learned a lot from us and I've also more videos comment along with this series hope that you're enjoying this series give it a thumbs up if you are enjoying it in the next video I'll be showing you what the future entails within the hemp industry I'll be questioned and aired on that and bringing that video to you that'll be the fourth video in this series if you haven't watched the earlier two videos I will link them up below this video as well as IDI contact details if you want to reach out to him to ask many specific questions about hemp because he just has an abundance of knowledge about us hope that you've enjoyed this video look forward to speaking to you on the next one speak soon", "XQKqrdEGAPw": "hey guys Nick with precision here back with another video and today we want to talk about the wide world of cannabinoids what are these molecules what do they do to your body how are they produced how do we isolate them and how do we ultimately use them for a better standard of human health and life overall so the first thing I want to talk about is this this entire world of cannabinoids and you see we've got some of them back up here on the chart but the important thing to know is there's about 113 identified cannabinoids right now a lot of these do come out of the cannabis plant but it's interesting to know if some of them come out of other plants some of them are produced within your own body so understanding how these cannabinoids affect our body is extremely important to understanding how to isolate them and how to manufacture them in an extraction process the first thing that I like touch on is the endocannabinoid system within your actual body so you have something in your body called the endocannabinoid system and what these are are actually receptors similar to like a neurotransmitter receptor in your brain except it's an endo cannabinoid receptors so they'll specifically bind to these cannabinoids and you have these endocannabinoid receptors in two different forms it's called a cb1 receptor and a cb2 receptor so the cb1 receptors are generally concentrated through your brain cerebral cortex your central nervous system and so forth and the cb2 receptors are more concentrated through your immune system your lymphatic system your body and so forth and what you'll find is as we're looking at these different cannabinoids they have a different reaction and different interaction these endocannabinoid receptors in your body and these endocannabinoid receptors are ultimately what regulate your sleep your appetite your immune system so when you look at all these different world of cannabinoids and how they affect these receptors in your body this is why you see all these benefits to cannabinoids or cannabis in particular because it's the most cannabinoid rich plant that we know of so things like THC increasing your appetite reducing nausea things like CBD reducing pain reducing anxiety reducing insomnia these are all because of the effect on your endocannabinoid system within your body so understanding more about these cannabinoids understanding more about your endocannabinoid system and and as a whole understanding this entire field of science is what is going to progress us from using cannabis as a Minnesota plant to being able to actually isolate these cannabinoids and have many different uses many therapeutic uses and as I said previously contributing to overall human health and quality of life in the long term now when I said there's 113 cannabinoids that are known today we're always discovering new ones and scientists are actually synthesizing new cannabinoids or new cannabinoid derivatives that have effects on your endocannabinoid system but one of the most interesting things is you can look at some other plants that have cannabinoids or cannabinoid derivatives in them like echinacea and it's pretty commonly known by everybody that echinacea is a herb that has in effect mostly on your immune system and part of the effect of the positive effect that is on your immune system is because of the cannabinoids in the echinacea actually binding and and modulating your cb2 endocannabinoid receptors within your body so I'm a firm believer that the universe has kind of given us everything that we need in order to survive in order to thrive and we just haven't discovered all these fields of sciences yet and botanicals in particular are a massive passion of what we do here at precision looking at these different botanicals obviously particularly cannabis and help but also looking at these cannabinoids and how they interact with your system and how they can contribute positively in the long-term so we talked a little bit about how cannabinoids are occurring in all sorts of different botanicals but it's also interesting to note there are cannabinoids and cannabinoid derivatives that are endogenous to the human body meaning your body actually produces these compounds so your body is in turn producing these compounds to bind to your endocannabinoid system so that your body can maintain homeostasis whether it's you know immune modulation or sleep modulation or whatever it is your body is always trying to come back into balance and it's very interesting that these molecules in particular binding to your endocannabinoid system are what help keeps your body in balance and if you're not consuming them say from outside botanicals your body can actually produce some of these different derivatives of cannabinoids endogenously within your own system it's very fascinating to know so now that we have an understanding of all of these different cannabinoids how they can produce I'm sorry how they can be produced either outside of your body and botanicals or they can be produced endogenously within your body and also I have an understanding that the majority of cannabinoids 80-plus of them are actually found in cannabis or in hemp let's take a look at what these molecules look like and what all the different derivatives are and how the how the science of this kind of plays out in a very overview rudimentary layman's type of fashion so these are all cannabinoids that can commonly be found in the cannabis or hemp plant and you can see that there's some common ones that most everybody would be familiar with such as THC and CBD but there's also some uncommon ones and these are commonly referred to as the minors but these are the outliers like CB e CB n CB L C BC and CB G now when we look at these will say common minor cannabinoids the parent cannabinoid is referred to as CB G this is the parent cannabinoid from a chemical structural standpoint because it's easily converted into any of these other cannabinoids so really starting with the CPG as a building block we can convert that CBG to CBD we can convert it to THC we can convert it to CBC and unfortunately there's not a strain of cannabis or hemp right now that's ultra heavy CBG but there are people that are working on the DNA manipulation and the genetic variation within these cannabis plants in order to make CBG dominant strains so you can see how advanced botanist advanced chemists are already exploring this world of botanical research they're already exploring the massive amounts of possibilities by shaping the genome of the cannabis and hemp plant and ultimately being able to produce a wide range of cannabinoids so what we really focus at here in precision is how are these cannabinoids contained in the plant number one how do we isolate these cannabinoids from a extraction standpoint what is the best way to do that while preserving them while not degrading them and ultimately this the second field of research surrounding this that we really focus on is how are we converting these now so how can we go from CBG to CBD or CBD to CBE and what are these conversion methodologies how stable are these conversion methodologies and by isolating individual molecules what future use could they have for for example managing disease or increasing somebody's quality of life these are all things that could be considered and again going back to the firm belief that kind of the universe has given us everything that we need we just need to discover it these are all naturally occurring compounds that are found ubiquitously in nature through a variety of different botanicals all we're doing is concentrating them studying them and figuring out how they're used most effectively within you know human health and and the human sort of lifecycle so for those of you that are more familiar with cannabinoids you can see THC here being one of the main ones this is a psychoactive cannabinoid that works principally on the cb1 receptors and again the cerebral brainstem psychedelic type high that you receive from this is because it is has an affinity for the cb1 receptors although it does bind also to the cb2 receptors when we're looking at these molecules here we would actually look at a chart that would have about 80 of these molecules so if you're looking at a common cannabis plant whether in trace amounts or in large amounts at different concentrations you have this entire spectrum of all these cannabinoids and it's commonly known that there's about like I said about 80 in Kent in cannabis now once you have these individual molecules there's different derivatives of these molecules called isomers and one of the most common things that you see with THC as we see THC a here which is the acidic version what actually happens in most cases with THC is it's decarboxylated which means we lose this carboxyl group here this is just a co2 that comes off through Heat and what happens with that is that actually removing this allows it to bind your endocannabinoid system without removing this it doesn't bind to your endocannabinoid system which is why if you eat raw cannabis or you eat raw THC that's not been decarboxylated for the most part you won't get high unless it D carboxylates in your body and there's some enzymatic reactions in your body that can do that but not as prevalent as doing it ahead of time with a heat based reaction in addition to this there's all sorts of different isomers and and those of you that are common with are commonly familiar with THC understand that there's different isomers and some of the commonly known ones are Delta a there's also Delta nine but there's there's several other ones there's there's Delta 10 there's Delta 7 so these different molecules can also be manipulated through simple reactions and or things like decarboxylation simple things like photo oxidation and things like that they can alter the structure of these molecules so really looking at this from a overview standpoint not only do you have you know 85 87 different cannabinoids that have been discovered within the cannabis plant you have some that are in different botanicals like echinacea and other botanicals throughout the world of domain and you have all these working together synergistically and then you have all these different isomers of these molecules and you have this system within your body that's ready to accept and bind these molecules to regulate the homeostasis and bring your body back into balance so it's really a fascinating field of research and what you'll find at what you'll see I think over the next five to ten years is you'll start to see these molecules start to become more and more prevalent we've already seen you know a market that was five years ago only knew what THC was then we saw CBD come in now we're starting to see a lot of cbn for insomnia we're starting to see a lot of CBG being sold and and genetics being isolated for this so we're just kind of at the tip of the iceberg one of the things that I would say for extraction companies is this as a field of science that you should understand at least rudimentary level or have somebody a partner such as precision that understands this very much more intimate level because the business will change over the next five to ten years and you'll ultimately see these molecules being combined and being used for different uses and you'll see this spread very vastly throughout the entire cannabis and extraction space throughout the consumables of cannabinoids and it'll ultimately make new markets every every time one of these pops up a new market it's gonna pop up for it a new use is gonna pop up for it the the furtherance of the studying of these molecules will give this industry additional tailwind and the extraction isolation manipulation of these molecules is really the name of the game you have to understand that science you have to understand how you're going to extract and isolate these molecules in order to not only help people on the go forward but also to have a thorough understanding and solid base of science surrounding your business surrounding your extraction company this is something that we're continually working on we've got a lot of good IP and methodology surrounding the conversion of a lot of these molecules and it's something that we look forward to providing to our client base and helping assist them navigate the future waters of the cannabis and hemp industry so thank you for watching the video today I look forward to bringing you a new one every week and see you guys soon you", "DWZJEQv7kqY": "[Music] [Music] hi I'm Belinda Carly the director of the Institute of personal care science and I often get asked how can I make a verbal extract so in this video I'm going to show you two different ways to make a herbal extract for cosmetic use before I get started though I do want to make it really clear that the way of making extracts I'm going to show you today is not the same as the extracts that get provided by larger suppliers with their efficacy data they use highly proprietary processes and then assay their finished products to make sure they contain a certain amount of active contents they also have other quality procedures in place that are beyond the home crafter they also conduct efficacy testing in vitro and in vivo methods to demonstrate improve the efficacy of their extracts you can't use their supporting data as if it's sufficient to prove the use of your extracts because you have no way of knowing if your extraction method is the same and in any case if you haven't conducted the efficacy testing you can't use their data to suggest that your extract will have the same performance let's take liquorice extract as an example and I've got an example of the method that we'll be using today you could make a licorice extract just like this but this particular licorice extract is not standardized in components that create the lightening or whitening effect that you can get from more specialty suppliers it's not the same as a glabra Dhin extract or a dye potassium glycyrrhizin aid extract either now these have demonstrated efficacy for the materials created by those raw material suppliers so it's not correct to suggest that your licorice extract would have the same efficacy or results as those more advanced materials but they can be a great way to add to your product story in the Marc took place you can also purchase small quantities of extracts from soap or craft suppliers instead of making your own but if you'd still like to go ahead I'm going to show you how I'm going to show you two different methods today one is a cold process method using ethanol and the other is a heated process that gives you a glycerin based extract at the end and both of these methods mean you don't need to add extra preservative so let me show you how the first one I'm going to show you is using ethanol and this means we can make a cold process product making cold process is a good idea if you want to not destroy heat sensitive active constituents but again unless you're are saying you wouldn't be able to make the claim that they're present anyway because you haven't tested for them to do this I am using um denatured ethanol I have seen videos where they use vodka or methylated spirits that's not what I'm recommending you really need to use at least a 95% chemical grade of ethanol as part of this extract to maintain good quality standards so now in here I have just got 10 grams of green tea we're going to make a green tea extract and to this I'm going to just add 20 grams of ethanol and then we need to stir it now if you're using other herbs you need to grind them up this is already in a very fine flake form if you get larger leaves or roots you'll need to grind them first using a coffee grinder or other similar device and you are better to make one kilo or more at a time I'm showing you really small samples in the lab today that you are better to use larger pots and vessels so that you can create larger quantities of extract just because it is a time consuming process so I have my ethanol in there and then you need to seal it off really tightly make it airtight because of course your ethanol will evaporate and then you need to stir this or shake this again in a larger vessel you'd need to make sure you appropriately shake it without losing any of your ethanol over the course of at least a this is one I prepared a week ago as you can see I've made it very airtight now we are ready to strain off the ethanol portion now I'm using food grade oil filters you can get these from a hospitality supplier I have cut them down again to suit my lab size samples that I'm working with here but you can of course get larger clinical strainers that will enable you to do this on a much larger scale [Music] now we have our concentrated extract and we need to make this up to the required volume with ethanol and we are making it up to 60% ethanol so that it is very self preserving you could make it to 40 percent ethanol but home crafting this way it's a little riskier with potential contamination so to be absolutely certain this will be self preserving for at least a three year shelf life I'm making up to a sixty percent ethanol extract solution and then I just add my 40 percent of water give it a little stir and pour it off and there I have my 1 in 10 green tea extract self-preserving I have at least three to five years shelf life on this product keep it kept well it will never go off but of course we have a lot of consumers that don't like the use of ethanol in their products and you would be required to list ethanol as one of the ingredients in this particular extract in a finished product in the ingredient listing to be compliant so let me show you how we can create an extract that will be self preserving for home crafters now again remember this is using a hot process method because we need to create the extract in this way so that we can make its self-preserving so let me show you how so in this case I again have 10 grams extract so again you should be doing this in a larger pot so you'd be making at least a kilo at a time if not more now we just need to cover this with water [Music] and again we're using the green tea it comes nicely ground but if you're using another herb or another root type substance you will need to grind it first and some materials are very fibrous which means sometimes you'll need a lot of water just to cover them and if that's the case then you need to add more water usually you need about two times as much water as the herbal extract er but sometimes you could need a lot more than this and then we need to heat this and gently boil it we don't want rapid boiling over but we need to gently boil it for at least a half an hour now you may choose to boil it for two hours it's usually between half an hour to two hours in the boiling process and we do this because we want to extract components from it so also make sure it's covered so you don't get too much evaporation again a larger pot would make that a lot easier so now we've got it gently boiling we just need to leave it for be half an hour do come back and check on it keep your eye on it if it starts to evaporate and get too dry you need to add extra water it will be okay at the end you just don't want it too sloppy but you definitely don't want it boiling dry either okay so here we have our extract that has been boiling away nicely for half an hour and now we are ready to pour it off and collect the extract [Music] so here we have the concentrated extract and in some cases you may only collect a small amount we now need to make this up to 20% water and then make it up to the 400% with glycerin now again you could use less glycerin if you wanted and still have a self preserving extract but especially in a home crafting situation I'm not going to recommend that simply because we want to be sure that this product will not have microbial contamination you are working with herbal substances which are from nature directly and could be prone to microbial contamination and a finished product we don't want to take that risk so I have made this method to ensure that it will be totally self preserving [Music] then we give it a stir [Music] and we can pour it off into our storage packaging so there we go that is how you create extract so again we have the cold processed version using ethanol and we have the hot processed version using glycerin both self-preserving without need for additional preservatives now you do need to make sure you have batch to batch consistency which means every time you create your extract you should be following exactly the same method make sure you record important parameters such as finished product pH appearance and of course their self-preserving so you won't need to worry about microbial content you saw me prepare small samples today ideally you should be preparing at least one kilo of product at a time to make it time economical for you but of course there's plenty of other extracts available out there already now remember when you're making these sorts of extracts you shouldn't be making high and efficacy claims because you have no

we'll be showing you how to make a CVD teacher [Music] so what exactly is a tincture and how is it different from other CBD edibles well a tincture is a medicine made by dissolving a drug into alcohol in this case we're dissolving the CBD on the hemp buds into the alcohol because of this CBD tincture is sort of the same thing as a CBD infused alcohol although with a tincture we're trying to maximize the amount of CBD then each drop to be used in small doses as opposed to a seaweed infused aloe Hall where each serving is most likely more than a few drops and by using the drops under the tongue the arterial blood supply under your tongue will rapidly absorb the CBD allowing it to take effect much faster than with any edible so first things first we're going to be using a lot of medicinal hemp because we need a pack a lot of CBD into each drop so half an ounce to a full ounce of medicinal hemp is needed second we're more interested in extracting as much as CBD off the hemp buds as possible then we are the taste of the alcohol so we're using the highest percentage of alcohol we can find from a distilled beverage in my case I'm going with a 750 milliliter bottle of Bacardi 151 which has a seventy five point five percent alcohol content and for those thinking why not just use rubbing alcohol event don't do this we're still going to be consuming this and most rubbing alcohol are made with isopropyl alcohol which metabolites is different from consumable alcohol and is very harmful if ingested now we need to decarboxylate the hemp and to do so Wolford grind it up onto a baking sheet decarboxylate in the hem will convert the CBB a in the hemp to CBB and is done so by heating up the hemp buds so after grinding it all up to help it heat evenly we'll place this in the oven which has been preheated to 250 degrees and we'll let it bake for 30 minutes after it's done grounded buds will have a darker baked colour and you'll want let it sit a little to have it cool down before handling it after its cooled will place the decarboxylated hemp in a jar and then pour into alcohol from here if you have the time to spare you can just cover it up and place it somewhere dark for a couple of days to have the CBD infused with the alcohol slowly over time just be sure to give it a good shake once a day if you're going with this method if you're short on time though there's actually another method available they'll infuse the tincture much quicker and that's to give the glass jar a water bath he will expedite the infusion process down to just 20 minutes except instead of beating a jar in boiling water you'll need a lower the heat until the water is down to a low simmer this is because unlike water which has a boiling point of 212 degrees Fahrenheit alcohol has a lower boiling point of just 173 degrees Fahrenheit which means that the most we should heat up the teacher is a hundred and seventy degrees to prevent any of the alcohol from burning off as you can see from the thermometer this is what a low simmer of a hundred and seventy degrees looks like but even if you don't have a cooking thermometer and actually burn off a little alcohol since we're not drinking this for the alcohol content it shouldn't matter much just know that by doing so it'll make the teacher slightly more concentrated which will have a stronger effect you'll need a place something on the bottom of the pot so the jar doesn't have to write contact with the burner make sure the water in cases the alcohol but isn't so high that will accidentally pour into the jar and be sure to take the lid off the jar I also only recommend this if you have an electric burner I don't recommend using this method with a gas stove as it's too risky to play something with this high of an alcohol content near fire alternatively if you have a sous-vide cooker in your kitchen this is much better to use to ensure that the water stays at exactly 170 degrees with a sous-vide cooker all you have to do is clip it to a side of a pot fill it with water and then set the water temperature to 170 degrees before placing the jar in note that water is denser than alcohol so you need to play something on top of the jar to make sure that it doesn't flow I don't recommend using what I'm using but it's why I had nearby so I made it work either way you want to heat the tincture uncovered for 20 minutes after that we can take it out and just leave it out to cool until it's warm to the touch now for both the long method and the quick heating method the final step is to filter out all the plant material from the tincture and here you can either use a cheesecloth or a coffee filter just place out on a funnel and pour it all through making sure to squeeze out any alcohol left on the plant material so nothing goes to waste depending on how you plan on using the tincture you either want to put it in a dropper for easy consumption or in my case a jar to store for future use as a tincture is really useful for a number of recipes just be sure to store this in a dark place if available definitely use a tinted glass jar to further protect the tincture from light and that's it", "lPegyBRqRws": "welcome everyone thank you for joining us for today's webinar considerations for scaling evaporation processes following cannabis six Knutson at the industrial scales presented by

right thank you for that wonderful introduction and today I just want to get started with presentation on consideration for scaling evaporation processes following now I'm going to go over some industrial scale extraction equipment and other equipment that falls in the industry for the cam cannabis and hemp industry and different applications for those pieces of equipment so I'm just kind of going more into the outline of what we will be doing the canvas processing workflow so to talk about scaling evaporation and some of the equipment that goes with that industry we need that just kind of a general understand you know how cannabis material have material gets to a state where we need to actually do evaporation steps so by doing that will you know have to look at the current state of cannabis processing technologies such as extraction solve a removal molecular distillation and crystallization with an emphasis focusing on that solvent removal in the evaporation side so we'll be looking at you know what things we have to consider to scale an evaporation process a lot of things we see now in industry are more on the lab scale and what we gotta do to get an industrial scale and then at the end of the presentation we would be going over all some more of those other types of industrial cannabis equipment processing all right so so cannabis processing workflow generally the plant material is grown in in a greenhouse or field and then it's got to be extracted to get an oil or the products inside the plant material we want to get out that the process is really called extraction normally used solvents to get that material out and by doing that we end up with a concentrate and we need to constant we need to do an evaporation process or a solvent removal process which we'll be talking further on later in the presentation once we remove that solvent though then we have refinement so we may be getting a crude oil out of the plant but we need to look at you know how do we remove the color any of the fats that could be in there to make it a much thicker compound wants being escalation purifying out a specific product in there so that way for the final product formulation we're looking for so whether we're trying to make a tincture or make a drink we got to get the crude oil to a product or a point where we can actually add it into our food beverage or our most suitable type product and then from there you know people would take it and package it off so a little bit just more in-depth on the extraction side there's kind of two sides of extraction there's mechanical separation which you know could use a press dry sifters which just basically tumble the material get trichomes i'll and then there's more you know some of the water separation type technologies that we'll get some of that material out but won't do a full solid extraction of the plant material itself so we firstly have to go into solvent types of extractions where hydrocarbons are used to get those oils out along with there's carbon dioxide at higher pressures to do extraction processes and then election alcohol or ethanol extraction which is becoming more and more popular just because of the fact that it's ethanol it's a consumable type product but the downside of that is a lot of solvent has to be used and you go look at using big large-scale evaporators to get that ethanol back out so you know concentrating it you know on a smaller scale rotary evaporator it's commonly used so you know let's say we have a couple liters of ethanol mixed with our products we can use a rotary batch evaporator getting into a larger scale would be you know following film rising film type of operators and then as it gets more concentrated we got to get into agitator or white film type of evaporators and those two right there on the continuous side we'll get more in depth than later so for the refinement side evaporators are used as well but on a smaller scale so we've removed ourselves and we still have our crude oil but it may not be in the form of what we want or we want to concentrate the internal products of CBD or THC so it can be used for that final product stream we're talking about well right now a lot of people use soar glass type distillation or a smaller scale white film or short path distillation type products what you can see here on the right as an example something else that could be even further purified which we won't really get into much is the crystallization process so after we run it through a short path or a white film evaporator we can actually take the product even further in purification and turn it into a crystal or isolate so getting more in depth on the evaporation side so what is an evaporator or you know why do people need to understand the fundamentals of an evaporator well evaporator basically takes a solvent nasaw you and applies a energy or a heat and allows us to evaporate off the salt the solvent so you know these products would have the solvent and the product itself have different boiling points so we're going to use a vapor pressure we're going to separate them when using heat being applied to this system so that way you know it's an easy separation for us so you know when we're looking at designs evaporator there's really some key aspects we have to look at to do that and then once we understand those we can look at small scale and how do we scale it out so the evaporator itself is really going to be how do we heat train get the heat into the product through heat transfer what is that vapor liquid separation of those two compounds or multiple compounds we need to look at and then initially herb on top of that we need to look at you know do we do this process efficiently when you're talking about a lab scale you know something that's a couple hundred Watts and not a big deal but when you start scaling it and you're talking about millions of BTUs it really gets energy intensive so one thing about with the fundamentals of operation we there's not just one particular vaporators for every application or one specific evaporator can cover every application there's multiple evaporators out there different design shapes so you know when looking at scaling evaporation we also have to look at the product itself say is it really viscous or is there following issue you know if they're high or low in different scales as you can see the little chart here on the right kind of says different types of AB raishin technologies or evaporator types that are out there that give us a range that we can pick from when we start thinking about which one we're going to select some other things that kind of go into that is you know how much product are we trying to actually deal with and evaporate so you know if it's a small amount we may not want to build a really big type of evaporator if a smaller one will do also the product characteristics and then just the overall utilities that are gonna be required to heat that unit so with these types of evaporators so you know there's there multiple types and we'll get into that in a minute but every evaporator we kind of have similar characteristics or process parameters at which we can control so you know vacuum level and we pull a vacuum on the evaporator we can actually reduce the boiling point of the products for trying to evaporate giving us overall lower temperature and protecting some of the products so organic products at higher temperatures will break down well it's not necessarily a good thing we're actually losing yield and not going to recover as much of the material we want or we may burn something else we can control is how is evaporated being heated are we gonna use steam hot oil loops water there's a lot of different ways we can control the heating media we can also help the evaporator efficiency by preheating our product so we can put the oil into a tank on the front end or use a heat exchanger in line to preheat it before it actually gets to the evaporator which can you know minimize the heat up time in there and and utilize that evaporator and actually we can size down the evaporator by preheating because they largely get the more expensive they get and then overall surface area of that evaporator how much surface area is going to be required for this particular product you know will scale it accordingly and then something that last ball point there that rotor tip speed is really only on white film evaporators actually then film evaporators I'll get a little bit more detail in a second so we got also look at what impacts how fast we can evaporate when we're gonna look at scaling up our evaporation process so as I kind of mentioned earlier our heating media you know what utility are we going to heat this system with but then we can start looking at materials of construction we build it out of stainless versus carbon steel we look at you know if the solvent that we're putting in there can flash too fast that'll actually put a lot of heat load on the system so how much solvent we're putting in there in the operating temperature of that and then the vapor velocity as that really gets into the design of the interior components of that actual evaporator so you know as I mentioned a little bit earlier we kind of looked at a chart that talked about look at our products and what types of operators we should pick or you know what range of evaporation technologies fit into our scope of what we're trying to size and build so there's long tube evaporators which are called common name is a rising film evaporator if people know what a shell on tube is it's really just putting a long show into single pass vertically following film would also fall into that same type of showing to the heat exchanger you're gonna have a product on the tube side and it's gonna be very similar to the vertical rising film but the product flows the opposite way and there's no mechanical interaction in this type of evaporator it's all gravity based which you know requires less maintenance and work a little bit differently but also can't have as viscous type of materials because they just don't function as well and then we get into the mechanically agitated type of evaporators white film evaporators they have anterior paddles and agitated then some of the operators also do and then a short path is very similar to those that have paddles in it but also has an internal component that's slightly different which I'll discuss in a minute so just a little bit more understanding the rising film evaporator as you can see the picture on the right product will feed into the bottom up into the heat exchanger on one side of that heat exchanger there will be steam or a heating medium that's applying heat to our products it's not in direct contact there's actually tubes inside this unit those tubes are being heated product flows in there as it's heated the solvent material in there will start to heat up and boil trading vapor flow and cause the product to move and separate or move up in through the unit and go into the vapor liquid separator as you see on the right towards the top vapor will go one way and our product will come out the bottom so we're essentially removing our solvent left with our products in a rising type of fashion for the hemp cannabis industry is now it's commonly used unless there's a large residual amount of solvent to be removed following film a little bit more common on the smaller side for the incoming cannabis and hemp industry being that it's a thicker type material it flows slow and uses gravity to flow down so looking at the picture on the right there our product will feed into the top our steam or heating medium will be on the shell side again but instead of our product rising up it'll actually go in a downward direction using gravity and as it gets towards the bottom the vapor will come out to vapor liquid separator on the right and our product come off the bottom one nice kind of feature of this is you can actually recycle that so you can get a second pass on it to make sure you get all residual solvent out so white film and edited thin film evaporators use a mechanical type device interior to their design so if you look at the picture or the images on the right there that's kind of a chopped view showing the paddle actually moving the products so so the solvent mixture when the oil will actually come in at the top the paddle will come around and spin and wipe it along the wall now the speed of that rotor is pretty critical we want to make sure they were actually building up a decent amount of material where it's actually kind of turning the product over on itself it's called the phenomenon of the bow wave very important for white film evaporators thin film or agitated thin film evaporators if you're getting low yield out of it it's probably because you're actually not operating at the right parameters and it's normally because the bow wave phenomenon nice thing about this is they can handle very thick materials low resonance time and you can move a lot of product through these with a smaller design so the short path is very similar to the white film or thin film evaporators works on the same concept the only difference is the wiper design is a little bit different where it will have an internal condenser so if you're looking at the picture on the right there there's kind of the green in blue that is a condenser so what happens is product will feed on the top the wiper will wipe it around the wall but as it's being heated part of the compound that's lighter or boiling off or it could be solvent in this case will travel very short distance to the condenser to the center and actually be condensed out before it leaves the unit by doing that it allows us to pull deeper vacuums on here so we can lower our boiling points even more it also allows us to not have any external components it's all one tight unit and it also is where it gets its name it's a short path the evaporation sequence happens from the exterior wall to the interior condenser in a matter of you know inches feet whatever the size of the unit is versus traveling outside of pipe to another unit so you know short paths for the cannabis and hemp industries it's starting to become a more and more common thing one for the deeper capability of the vacuum you know as I just mentioned it drives our temperatures down so when we're trying to concentrate CBD and THC we don't want to operate those at too high a temperature where we start degrading the material obviously don't organic compound side of it you know get it too hot it'll break down and we won't be left with the same product and reduce our yield it's also very beneficial for this industry from the short residence we're now not spending a lot of time in there goes right back to you know not degrading the product and then you know if you've handled this material or seen this material it's fairly viscous so to have those panels and they're moving it around this works really well to get it through the system so now we kind of understand what the vaporators are the key characteristics that we got to look at when picking evaporator looking at an evaporator you know how do we size up from the smaller scale evaporators that we've seen maybe in a lab to something we see an industrial type of environment really there's a lot of things you can look at the biggest one is what we call the overall heat transfer coefficient it's commonly used in a lot of heat exchange applications well we also utilize it when sizing the different types of evaporators where there's a non mechanical type of evaporator or mechanical and basically what it is is a buildup of how well we can get our heating medium like steam or oil to heat up our product on the inside to create that separation type of process so our overall heat transfer coefficient this is just a formula I wanted to show it in the presentation I'm not going to get too much depth about each component of it but it's just build up we know how much heat it's going to require to create the separation process here's all the things that are required to make this happen into our formula so I know they're just kind of breakdown of that overall heat transfer coefficient when we really start getting into what that you value is when we think about us are our product flows down through this evaporator up through this evaporator we call that a thin film heat transfer coefficient low will also have the same on the steam or heating utility side and then we'll also have the limitation of the wall this the metal wall that's between the two the either the heating medium and actual product so we got to add what we call those are like resistances that each can only take you so much heat transfer at a time and they limit how well we can transfer the heat into the product that we're trying to separate or that solvent oil mixture or even on a molecular distillation type of level of concentrating our CBD and THC how much heat we can get actually get into the product to separate it so just looking at the equations on the left the top one is our outer thin film coefficient the cube would be in the middle is the wall resistance and then obviously the product one is the last one so adding those three together changes how well we get that overall heat transfer coefficient value just going a little bit more detail so well with those equations now we kind of put those three together that very first equation there is the buildup of those three coefficients to get us at U value and once I get in the next couple slides you'll see how important that you that is so just an example to kind of really show how important those three characteristics there are so that outside and that inside film coefficient if on this example just shows you know we're getting in this example heat transfer of 155 now if I go to the next slide we show we or change one of those film coefficients let's say we went from an oil heating method to a steam heating method it would change how much heat transfer we're getting into the evaporator so you can see in the bottom left corner there it says our heat transfer is now 253 on the last side it was by 153 so for us just change say a flow rate or a temperature of operation on our utility side or that heating medium we can change how much heat is being applied to the product side on the actual evaporator so knowing those values we can get a good view value and then we can get into okay so we understand what are you values how do we take that information and scale it well let's say we have a laboratory evaporator we can run tests on that evaporator with the product we want to scale - and we can basically back calculate these equations here on the right so our sensible heat sensible heat is basically looking at how well the heat is actually getting into the product how much heat is required to create a separation process we're looking at in the evaporator latent heat is how much energy it takes to actually turn it into a vapor and then our process superheat is how how is it going to get once we actually evaporate it so we can back calculate those and that gives us what we call like overall you value for this whole small scale evaporator so tiny little lab skill operator well now we want to build a bigger one we want to build one that can use five times the rate so we got a u value for our lab scale and then we can take that we can plug it into it basically compare some type of equation and get it what we call corrected U value so our bigger evaporator may have thicker walls and a different type of heating process because it's just more effective well what we do is we enter that information it gives there's a corrected u value so that way we can properly design that larger scale evaporator so we go through you know all those resistances in the u-value equation or overall heat transfer coefficient equation from say a lab scale and scale it up to a large scale so a lot of times in you know scaling them to an industrial size we either have have processed data or a small test scale so something like we have here in our facility we have test units you know you can ticket a product that is no one run it through get an effective you value out of it go back and calculate those few equations that I just showed plug in into our corrected you value equation and scale it up very easily and know that it's it's gonna work into the parameters that we want so you know just kind of looking at okay every vaporators different every evaporators gonna have a different you value you know that test pilot test get the values we need punched into this equation and i'll give you how easy it is to to scale it up and and what it's actually gonna take to do it so that's kind of it on the scaling up side a last little bit here i just want to go over some other industrial type of processing for the cannabis and hemp industry so it kind of go more detail on the front end and back into why you know it would be important to have an evaporator that's a larger scale and why you would even need it so i'm just gonna go into a couple things quick different pieces of equipment for some examples so you know the beginning the presentation talked a little bit about extraction rotary extraction is a solvent based process extraction that uses a lot of solvent something like this would be running about four thousand pounds an hour of solvent but that would be mixed with your oil and then you would send it downstream to a large scale evaporator you know they new batch sizes of you know something like this and the right image here we're doing it from fifty to a thousand pounds of cannabis or ham per hour I don't think it you know it's a lot of solvent and you're gonna need a pretty big evaporator to process that much solvent oil mixture another type of mechanical extraction unit that also uses a lot of solvent and requires an evaporator or this one it here itself actually has an evaporator built into it but basically uses large mix tanks Sol liquid solid separator in a decanter and you're left with a solvent stream mixed with old oil that has to go to an evaporation process now like this type of unit has what we call like a small-scale agitated evaporator on it and then it would go from here to say like a white film evaporator and so just kind of reiterating on the solvent recovery side or our evaporators in general this is a batch style kettle evaporator so it has an agitator in it and it uses thin film type of technology that we had just discussed earlier to move remove solvent and leave you with the oil the image to the right there is actually a white film evaporator that would be used more like on that Rotex or rotary type of extractor to recover the solvent back out and get the crude oil so you know if we have large-scale extractors and we have large-scale evaporators we're also going to be larger scale type of processing for that crude oil to get it refined a process that commonly needs to be done on a small scale is winterization and removal fats this is you know just a general process of mixing it with the solvent cooling it down and crystallizing those fats out you know the image in the middle there is actually a winterization type skin where those that would happen in those mixed tanks and then there's some filters on the front there where those fats would be filtered out those colors could be removed as we had talked earlier short paths distillation this unit here on the right can do 50 litres an hour I think a lot of units and a lab scale right now around three to five liters an hour so you can see the scale up size but it can also be set up to be a short path distillation unit as well so if somebody needed to concentrate their CBD or THC you would run your product through after you've run your solvent out of it to concentrate it and this same unit can do both and then isolates and crystallization on a larger scale would look something similar to what a winterization unit is but there's no picture here so it's kind of harder to explain how you would get that there so solving processing I want to go over the just briefly I think as people see systems grow and we talked about you know we need large-scale evaporators to get this solvent back a lot of times that solvent comes off the evaporator it's not going to be pure so we actually need to repair by it or make more of it we may lose some of that due to vacuum systems or just residual left over in the system so solvents actually keep you made on a pretty easy system of you know biologically from any net using beasts and sugars or naturally with our synthetically with ethane and steam which is more of an industrial type application a lot of ethanol or yeah ethanol being used as a solvent in the cannabis and hemp industry is actually being manufactured via fermentation well once you ferment it you got to actually run it through a still which just so happens to take an evaporator to concentrate but then it actually goes into a fractional column to purify it and then something else with you know ethanol being using these processes the point material may not always come in perfectly dry well that moisture gets pulled out if you use an ethanol or other types of solvents and we can actually run that through what's called a molecular sieve or a molecular distillation column which is really just a large skinny tank full of a packed bed material and that's all that's run through it and at that point the salt the molecular sieve pulls the moisture out and leaves you with clean solvent for reuse so that was kind of the equipment I just want to go over it so you can kind of see there all our other industrial types of equipment I have to get scaled up I know we spent most the time out of operation but I hope from seeing some of the horn to us just some of the general understandings of the different types of evaporators out there that you can see you know the different applications and maybe when you're talking to a vendor or engineer or somebody trying to get your system scaled up or you're interested in the industry and see you know there's a little bit more to it than just saying I want that bigger unit I hope that kind gives you a background an understanding of that that's it for my presentation I just want to thank lab roots for the opportunity to go over you know the cannabis have process on a general process flow and then some of the larger equipment and and giving me some time to spend go over the evaporation technology and what's all involved when we have to scale smaller scale small units to a larger scale thank you Thank You Evan for that informative presentation I would also like to thank laberd's for making today's educational webcast possible before we go I want to let everyone know that this webcast will be available for on-demand viewing

"oa-HfwJCqTg": "so today we're going to the labs to see how we can make crystals and other interesting things today I'm gonna show you how to make pure 99% cannabis crystals now it doesn't matter if you make THC or CBD it's the same process here we're making CBD right now in the lab the process is very simple you need a two you need some sand you need some liquid take the extract put it through the column put some liquid inside apply some pressure and there you go you have to wait now if you don't apply pressure you're gonna wait for many days but if you have the pressure it goes very fast you need do it a couple of times in order to get the purity so to get this pure beautiful crystals sometimes up to five times depending on the raw material you have now we have been working very hard to find a way to do this on a coffee machine but I can tell you that I haven't figured that out yet however I think we're gonna work hard on it and in this method you know it's not that simple because you can't buy this everywhere in any supermarket it's very specialized if we look at it in a perspective of CBD and THC first this will be CBD and this will be th see there's a small difference in the molecule so CBD will come out fer first and then teacher will come out so it's very simple just to optimize you have a column okay inside the column you put some very fine sand now you put the mixture of different molecules on top of the sand apply some pressure and the material the sand material will be the filtration material and we'll separate small molecules from big molecules because the small molecules will travel fast so through the sand and the big molecules will travel much slower and some will not even travel if they're too big okay and this is chromatography very simple I'm gonna show you how it works with a color so what happens when you put the extract through and extract you know it's not so colorful you're not gonna see that much but I'm gonna put some color inside so you better can see how it travels through the column now we take the color and we applied in our chromatography machine put the lid on apply the pressure [Music] so the question is whether the crystals appear they will be deluded in your liquid then you have to put it on the coffee machine to evaporate and you will have your pure crystals in the jar simple so let's look at the big machine this machine here is the same as the tube you saw upstairs just much bigger and the pressure system is much bigger here but the principle is the same take the extract this time you take more of it put it into our container and put through the system where we have the sand the small sand yeah and then you get most likely pure can have no it's out in our case pure CBD after doing this process several times next time I'm gonna show you how we do on big scale in real production that's big it's even bigger than this one because to make kilos you need volume you just have to make few grams maybe this will work but we need two kilos so we need a bigger factory for that we tried to make this process simpler and we tried also to develop a method of how to do this in a coffee machine still not working we're working on it how to tell you that and if any of you know how to do it well give us some hints cos we have tough time doing it all right but anyway once we have the solution of how to do it with

broad-spectrum oil and tea free so let's jump right in alright so we're gonna talk a little bit about short path distillation today and what what the purpose of it is so we use short path distillation to extract cannabinoids from the crude oil so basically we're really doing refining operations using the short path distillation system it's very similar to the chemistry that was used in the white film molecular distillation that I talked about in a previous video just on a much smaller scale but you can also be a lot more precise with this equipment so several different components of the equipment of this whole entire system and so we'll start off from the beginning first piece that we have here is a low temperature coolant circulation pump and this is used to keep the condenser which is right here cool and what this does is it takes the vapors that are created by heating up crude oil in this boiling flask and it turns him back into liquids so as mentioned we have a boiling flask here inside of a digital heating and stirring mantle and what's going on in here is do I put crude oil in here we stir it at specific settings as you can see here below we have it at 330 rpm and 237 degrees Celsius what that does is that heats up the cannabinoids to the point of vaporization they turn into vapors they go up the distillation head they hit the cooler temperatures at the condenser right here cooled off by the chiller and once they turn back into a wick they come down into this thing called a cowbell and I can only hear the comments and jokes from here so so get them all out of your system now yes we all need more cowbell so what the cowbell has is you have your head and then you have your three main collection flasks and in each collection flask and you'll be collecting something differently in the first collection flask that you see in the background kind of a like a dark nastier color you're collecting heads and what's in those heads is any ethanol that wasn't recovered during the rotary evaporation process there's a little bit of terpenes some fats and waxes and lipids a little bit of CBD comes through here but really this is junk the second collection flask that we have is our mains this is the good stuff this is where we're collecting a majority of our CBD and as you can see it's pouring in there nice and smooth right now and a nice golden color that's that's what you want to see and the third flask which we haven't started using yet we'll use that at the end we're gonna collect our tails these also contain some cannabinoids but you're starting to get a really dark color which you really don't want in there and you're starting to collect a little bit more of some of the undesirables that are left behind in the crude oil after your cowbell yes we all need more of it you'll see a cold trap and this cold trap is designed to protect our rotary vane vacuum pump that we have down below here in this cold trap is on top has a mixture of ethanol and dry ice as you see is sort of bubbling right now right like it's not boiling that's just really really cold and that's what ethanol does when it gets it's probably below 30 minus 30 Celsius right now and so that cold trap is making sure that any vapors that didn't turn into liquid the cowbell are turning into vapors before they make it to the rotary vane vacuum top if they didn't then it would end up potentially damaging the rotary vane back and thumb so this vacuum what it's doing is it's lowering the atmospheric pressure of the entire system so that the cannabinoids don't have to reach as high of a temperature in order to convert from liquid to vapor and the reason why I want them to convert to a vapor at a lower temperature is because we get to have degradation of those can monoids at a higher temperature and we want to avoid that so that we can have higher quality and we're wrapping up this session by talking about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and tea free or isolate oils so full spectrum has terpenes CB d minor camera cannabinoids and a small amount of THC what I'm making right now is full-spectrum stuff broad spectrum includes terpenes CBD and minor cannabinoids but no THC an isolate or tea free includes no terpenes no minor cannabinoids no THC and only CBD that wraps up this session thanks for joining me in come back again later on have a great day", "r_mF84ZqsdA": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I'm gonna be doing a product overview of our CDU 3000 distillation apparatus and I have mark here from you labo that's going to talk about the paired youlab low temperature controllers with the unit so some of the great features that you're gonna see on this CDU 3000 are the 10 litre crude feed vessel and the great thing about this as well as it has stop [ __ ] at the top so if you've got a big barrel of crew that you want to feed in on some sort of automated system or with a dosing pump you can do so following your your feed vessel down this is of course jacketed now the entire path of this system is heated in order to avoid the gumming and the residual sort of clogs that you would get in any other distillation system with this you're going to feed your distillate in through your through your feed pump down here and you can see your adjustment for your feed pump right here now you can feed slower or faster depending on how you want your product to come out you want it more pure do you want it less pure do you want it at you know up to 4 litres an hour throughput or do you want to run it a little bit slower so you're trying to do single pass these are a lot of parameters that you can play with with this system in order to optimize your distillation how the original crude oil was made was a hydrocarbon extracted how clean is it how well was it extracted at what temperature how good did the biomass look like right so we have varying ability to handle any sort of crude in this machine and get it up to a very very high level of purity above 90% and sometimes even above 95% purity with this distillation apparatus so with feeding your distillate through this reservoir you're then coming up it's coming through this heated feed tube and this is actually coming into your evaporator here now your evaporator is going to evaporate that distillate and it's going to reconvince on an inner coil which is where you're gonna get your separation between your your cannabinoids and your non-kinetic right so all the gunk so to speak or the chlorophylls and residual phosphides and all the other compounds in the plant that are undesirable are going to come out on your left side here right which is your we call this the residue side that'll be your black sort of reject right and you'll have your amber gold on this side which is your distant now on this particular unit you have output metering vessels and basically what that is is you don't want to starve your distillate or your residue pumps you don't want to starve your feed pump right this is meant to be run as continuous operation a continuous feed system right so it's very important that those pumps don't get starved that you keep everything heated right because if you've ever played with distillate or with crude oil you know it can be very very sticky right the viscosity of finished distillate can be like a warm Jolly Rancher if it's kept at room temperature right and with this being said we want to make sure that everything is heated we have our discharge and you have ultimately your residue coming out of this side and you have your finished distillate coming out of this side so continuing to follow this path here we have a cold trap the cold trap is basically what is going to be your channel of vacuum through your roughing pump and then back here we also have a diffusion pump and those work in tandem in order to bring this apparatus into a very deep vacuum so that you can achieve a very precise distillation that vacuum is controlled via a vacuum metering valve so I know that there's people that like to run different parameters on this machine and again talking about the different variations and crude the different variations and output right we can adjust the temperature of each individual zone right we can run a little bit hotter with your colder we can we can adjust the vacuum levels in order to accommodate now when we install this product we install it for you we train your staff and we give you an SOP but there's a lot of people in the production community and scientific community that like to play with those parameters so to speak of myself being one of them so there's a lot of different variables that you can do in order to make these different products and optimize the process of what you're doing here with this machine a couple cool features with the cold traps is you actually have a terpene removal call this flask that can remove the terpenes simply by opening this valve and you're never breaking vacuum cool a little feature of this and you do have a dual cold trap and you can see the secondary beaker down there I'm sorry in secondary flasks in order to remove your terpenes with your secondary cold trap as well now as Marc's gonna discuss all of these individual zones right so your your your feed zone your pathway for your your distillate your evaporator your cold trap all have individual temperature zones further compounding the ability to run custom parameters on this system and make a desirable output product so we have two core EOC DBC for heating temperature circulators and 230 volt these provide two kilowatts of heating power of the temperature capability up 250 degrees C and on the CDU 3000 they are plumbed to various zones to provide temperature control to make sure that the highly viscous cannabis extract and distillates can flow through the system properly on this side of the system we have the SE six high temperature heating circulator this has three kilowatts of heating 30 volt with the temperature range up to three and a degrees C and in this case the SE six is plumbed to the outer jacket of the still itself providing the the heat to do the actual distillation next to it we have the choreo CD 600 F and 230 volt this has a two kilowatt heater with 600 watts of cooling power at 20 degrees C and 220 watts of cooling power at minus 20 with an operating temperature range of minus 35 250 degrees C in this CD you 3,000 it is plumbed to the vacuum trap here which protects the vacuum system and also enables you to get a turbo down below we have the F p-51 SL refrigerated heating circulator this has a temperature range of minus 50 to 200 degrees C with a three kilowatt heater two kilowatts of cooling power at 20 degrees C one kilowatt of cooling power at minus 20 degrees C in the CDU 3000 it's plumbed to the condenser inside the still where the distillate collects and then goes into the lights collection flask on the C 2 u 3 the CDU 3000 provides quality engineering from Detroit ped with German engineering from UIC and olavo providing a perfect setup for a turnkey solution catered to the hemp and cannabis industries one thing that I stress is really fantastic about this unit is its you already right so if you guys understand the compliance issues between CEC SI and ul and understanding the electrical inspections and parameters this is a unit that becomes pre-certified with your paperwork that's compliant in any regulated jurisdiction so if you would like to have one manufacturer to see e compliance for introduction into the European Union or South America that's something that were completely capable of as well as CSA compliance for Canada the main units that come to the United States here are of course ul compliant we wanted to take a look around the back here about the UL compliant power distribution boxes the great thing about the UL power distribution boxes is that you have all of your hubs connected into one central location and you have a singular whip to connect into your power source right this is gonna make it very easy for an electrical inspector to come in look at your paperwork look at the compliance look at the integration and understand hey this is what I'm looking at this looks good it's compliant here's the you all stand for the CSA stamp for the Cee stamp or whatever it may be which gives us a very much more ability to vastly integrate your product into your laboratory a couple other key features if you have ever worked with a variety of different distillation devices you'll know that there's all sorts of courts to them right in terms of breaking them apart breaking vacuum taking the blast off putting the blast back on reaching up in order to put your your distance re your crude oil into your device in order to be distilled you can see with this system everything is very very economic right anywhere that I want to reach to do anything it's all right here right makes it very easy to operate and very user-friendly so to speak the other thing that I love about this system is that your body is all stainless steel right your entire pathway here this is all jacketed stainless steel making an extremely extremely reliable the glass units while they're excellent for laboratory scale and introduction their glass right you have somebody come in and you know hit one of your machines with a pole or something like that all of a sudden you've got a you know $35,000 piece of glass that can potentially be broken not saying that's gonna happen I'm sure all of you are very careful but the reliability of stainless is certainly a benefit and the throughput ability of stainless is certainly a benefit as well I hope that this video was helpful for everyone to help understand this piece of equipment what its capabilities are what it does thank you guys for watching the videos please leave comments if there's anything else that you wants to talk about or specific features that you'd like to know more about on the unit you can always give us a call or shoot us an email its info at

So it turns out it's pronounced\nSpa-ge-rick. Spaa-ge-rick, Spaage-rick. Man, that was not my first guess. Today we're going to be talking\nabout Spagyric Extraction and why it's important and maybe you're someone who's\nheard of it before, maybe you've never heard of it before. That's okay,\nthe whole point of this video is to kind of, give you a easily digestible\nbreakdown of what it is and why it's gonna be beneficial to your body. Right\noff the bat, a lot of the stuff we're talking about directly relates to\nbioavailability and the entourage effect, so if you're not familiar with either of\nthose things there is actually another video on this site that explains all of\nthat. I would definitely recommend watching that before this one because\nalmost everything we're talking about directly relates to bioavailability. So\nreal quick a couple of things we're gonna go over in this video are: What is\ntruly full-spectrum mean? And why is that important for your body? What is\ndecarboxylation? And why is low temp decarboxylation important? Okay, so let's\njust jump right into what is truly full-spectrum and why does it matter. We\nmeasure the potency of CBD on a spectrum. From\nno spectrum or zero spectrum, all the way up to truly full spectrum. So, on the low\nend of that spectrum where it's no spectrum, that is single molecule CBD and\nthe reason why that is not very effective is because our bodies are just\nnot very good at absorbing one single molecule. So then if we go up that\nspectrum all the way to the very top, that is where truly full spectrum is and\nthat is going to be the most bioavailable to your body, because it is\nthe least altered form of the hemp product or the CBD product out there. So\nwithout diving too deep into the intricacies or technicalities of\ndecarboxylation, it's worth reminding you that all forms of CBD extraction are\ndone at high temperature except for spagyric extraction. And the problem with\nthat is that high temperature extraction damages a lot of the cannabinoids\nand the terpenes, which is generally a lot of the reason or most of the reason\nwhy you want to be taking CBD in the first place. So spagyric is done at low temp.\nWhich means it's not damaging any of the valuable cannabinoids or terpenes and\nit's doing it using the plants own natural chemistry by reintroducing the\nmineral salts from the plants raw material back into the hemp oil and that\nis only done with spagyric extraction. Every other form of CBD extraction takes\nthat raw plant material and just trashes it, they don't even use it. So with spagyric, you're getting this whole another added bonus. It's like you're getting a\nthird of the plant that is not available in any other form of extraction back\ninto it. That is why spagyric extraction is the\ntruly full-spectrum extraction method. So by now you probably understand why at\nthe beginning of the video I said everything we're gonna be talking about\ndirectly relates to bioavailability. Because when you're using a\nlow-temperature decarboxylation process, you are preserving all of the valuable\ncannabinoids and terpenes that you want out of a CBD oil. And that is why you are benefiting from the entourage effect\nfrom all of this because it is the least altered form of CBD oil that you can\npossibly get, at this point. So I hope this video helped you understand a\nlittle more about what spagyric means, what low-temperature decarboxylation means,\nwhy it's all important, how it directly affects to bioavailability and why you\nbenefit from that. But yeah, if you see my face somewhere else on the website, click\non me, means I'm explaining something else.

chief technology officer of precision extraction solutions and today we're going to be checking out our x10 MSC platform the x10 MSE platform is a multi solvent extractor it's intended to do between seven to twelve pounds per batch and it has a 24 litre material capacity the x10 MSC is a multi solvent platform as you can see it's extremely compact it's ideal for small to medium production and it can process anywhere between 40 to 80 pounds per day some of the key features of the x10 your solvent tank is 50 liters which gives you more than enough capacity to flood both of your material columns you have ASME PE d and c e rated tanks meaning they're applicable for any European Union or any United States or Canadian jurisdiction the machine is peer-reviewed past regulation and all regulated jurisdictions another great feature about the x10 is the ability to use material sacks pack your material and drop it in or to use our stainless steel food grade material cylinders the cylinders will allow you to almost put it in like a bullet and pull it right back out allowing for a very fast turn time there's no issue with having to take the columns off and repack the columns right now you have two different turnkey solutions based upon your manufacturing on how you would like to achieve that again like our other extraction platforms including the ex 40 the x10 has a dewaxing column with a submersible coil and you have a variable filtration at the bottom the filtration can be filled with any different sorts of filter media including activated carbons diatomaceous earth or bentonite clay things like that you can also put variable grade filtration in there whether it's plural wool filtration or quantitive or fault of papers all of those applications work with our filter mechanism the collection tank is an asme rated collection tank suitable for butane propane or any solvents that you're going to use you can see that it has a high duty asme rated clamp and in removing the bowl the bowl also has a feed spout at the bottom if you want to remove your extract without removing the bowl if you want to pour off from the bowl which is common in extracts where you don't want to have a lot of agitation or nucleation then you're going to do so by removing that bowl I'm pouring it off it's a very versatile machine which can do both so the x10 MSE is an extremely valuable platform again because it's a multi solvent extractor when you have pivots in the market you don't know where it's going to go you have the ability still with one platform to make ethanol based extract full

opioid use after acute traumatic injury thc improving the brain's response to threat in people with ptsd cannabis for opioid withdrawal and then two studies on cbd bioavailability water soluble cbd and the addition of black pepper extract and then we'll just uh dig a little bit into some of my thoughts on covid okay so getting started this is a matched pilot study looking at cannabis uh based or nabinol so this is essentially just thc a pharmaceutical preparation of thc for acute pain following traumatic injury now in the past there's been contrary results on thc and acute pain it seems like sometimes it can help acute pain sometimes it can make acute pain worse and the determination may be someone's familiarity with cannabis or if they're a regular cannabis user perhaps thc would be more likely to help with acute pain but if their cannabis naive it might be more likely to exacerbate acute pain but this was an interesting study looking at people who had had a traumatic injury they were hospitalized and they had at least 48 hours of treatment with just opioids for their pain and then sometime after those 48 or more hours when the clinicians decided wow these opioids really aren't working we can either increase the dose of the opioids or we can add some thc and see what happens and so they had 33 cases where they did that and then they had 33 matched controls so similar age cause of injury hospital length of stay and they were really looking at the opioid dose before and after adding the dronabinol or the opioid dose over the course of those who didn't get the journal and so for most people the thc was administered twice daily uh commonly in doses of 5 milligrams or 10 milligrams and what you can see here is that these are all the cases and the controls on the left here and what we're looking at here is morphine equivalent doses so this is a bar graph showing essentially their overall dose of morphine and how that changed in the before or after getting the thc that's then you need to advance the slides oh my slide's not advancing i i i should go on healer uh-oh let me get out of uh let me stop sharing because on my screen it looks like it's advanced but i'm gonna oh it says sharing is paused thank you for telling me that ethan we're gonna try it again okay are we are you seeing a different slide now uh yeah match pilot study okay so this is what should have been well let's um thank you so let's go up a little bit okay so this is this is the front page where we have 33 cases and 33 controls i talked you through all of this and now everybody's seeing the graph sure okay good okay so um so what this is essentially showing is that the before and after doses of the dronavinol which are in the dark bar here were was we're going to start looking over here first you can see a significant reduction in the average morphine equivalent dose or the average opioid dose and those that were receiving the thc compared to those that didn't get the thc over here there was a slight reduction but it wasn't statistically significant then over here on the right we're looking at the same data except limiting to the 19 people who received thc that were already cannabis users beforehand and you can see that the cannabis users maybe got a slightly better result but not a big difference there and so overall there was an average of 79 uh morphine equivalent per day reduction in those that got the thc and in those that were cannabis users there was even a greater reduction of 97 morphine equivalents the opioid consumption for those that didn't get the thc was mostly unchanged and so overall this was a nine-fold greater reduction in opioid consumption for those that received the thc compared to those that didn't the author's reasons why adding thc would be favorable instead of increasing the narcotic dosage in people with trauma who weren't having good control over their pain well first of all the addictive tendency of cannabis and the negative effects of that addiction on morbidity and mortality are magnitudes less for cannabis than for opioids these are the words of the authors and in the acute care setting the effects of thc on vascular neurologic response and respiratory depression are really nothing compared to opioids especially when they're using the thc in an effort to reduce opioids or prevent needing to give more opioids and these same authors are currently enrolling a prospective randomized controlled trial of 120 patients so this could be really interesting if this is solid data for hospital inpatient use of thc for opioid sparing purposes so that's the end of of this study now pause there any comments ethan yeah sure i mean it's always amazing to me that uh we're having to relearn stuff that we actually have known about for 150 years uh it was well known in the 19th century that you could considerably reduce uh the amount of morphine or opioids necessary to treat a patient when uh at that time indian hemp products were used so this is really complex in terms of what it does we know that even sub-threshold doses of cannabis can reduce uh the opioid need and it's not just a matter of reducing dose um as mentioned the associated morbidity goes down uh the tendency towards withdrawal goes down and you know if you continue this long enough the real goal is going to be to discontinue uh the opioids entirely and likely that's going to be a lot earlier than it would otherwise be uh but again it's just uh unfortunate to me that uh in the 21st century we have to relearn what uh wise clinicians knew in the 19th absolutely thank you all right well let's move on to the oops to the next one this was a really interesting one and i'm glad to have a neurologist on board for this this is looking at the brain activity in people that are exposed to trauma with and without thc when they're exposed to things that are threatening to them so i'm gonna walk through this and explain a little bit about brain function and ethan chime in whenever you'd like so we know from previous work that low doses of thc can decrease anxiety and reduce the activation of the amygdala which is a part of the brain associated with threat and negative emotions reduce the activation of that part of the brain and also enhance the functional coupling which is like the cooperation between that reactive emotional part of the brain and the medial prefrontal cortex which is uh more of the planning and assessing and modulating emotion part of the brain the effects of thc on cortical limbic function so on that connection in response to threat have not been investigated in adults with trauma-related disorders so this is the first study that actually looked at this in adults that have been through trauma and so as i mentioned the amygdala is critical in the generation expression and experience of negative emotions that's over here and there's this top-down inhibitory effect on the amygdala where the frontal cortical regions can modulate the amygdala's activity and if the amygdala is overactive like having a strong emotional reactive to some perceived threat then this frontal region should be able to control that and dampen that down a little bit both of these regions have high levels of cb1 receptors so it makes sense that thc could impact this function oops and this coupling let me go back there so a stronger coupling exists between the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex during conscious emotional regulation like reappraisal and this is exactly what we want and people that have been exposed to trauma that are in the habit of having some overreaction to a trigger it's important for them to heal and become empowered to control that reaction to consciously regulate their emotional reactivity so there we know also that individuals with ptsd often have a dysfunction in this region there's usually hyperactivity in the amygdala especially in response to trauma related imagery combat related sounds or smells photographs and words and that hyperactivity of the amygdala is likely due in part to that frontal part of the brain not controlling the amygdala enough not enough top-down regulation so that's that's kind of the backdrop to this and so what happened in this study was they had three groups that they assessed the brain's response to threat using functional mri they had a group of non-trauma-exposed healthy controls people that had been through trauma but did not have ptsd and then people with ptsd this was randomized and they either received seven and a half milligrams of thc or a placebo they were given this well-established threat processing paradigm where they're essentially shown different faces of actors some look happy some are neutral and some are very threatening and they're measuring their response to those visual stimuli so in the results in general in the ptsd group compared to placebo thc showed attenuated amygdala activation so that hyperactive emotional part of the brain was less active with the thc on board they had increased activation of the frontal part of the brain which helps regulate and plan and then increased connection between that frontal part and the amygdala in response to threats those those uh pathways of connectivity lit up much more when the thc was on board so uh the authors concluded together these preliminary findings add to the growing body of literature suggesting that pharmacologic modulation of the endocannabinoid system may be a promising approach for addressing cortical limbic dysfunction which is a core feature of ptsd and stress-related psychopathologies any comments ethan yeah sure well you know this makes sense i always wish that they used a properly constituted cannabis extract instead of pure thc i think that they'd get a much better result but notwithstanding that um it is very sensible the amygdala is an area that's involved with emotional reactions um additionally with rage so it's really easy to understand how thc would tamp down uh those tendencies and it's part of the constellation of post-traumatic stress uh you've got to treat the anxiety you also have to treat the intrusive dreams and its ability to mildly suppress rapid eye movement sleep is another reason that thc is helpful in treating post-traumatic stress um so you know i think it's a good study that corroborates what clinicians doing this kind of work have seen for a long time now ethan if if a single dose of thc can have these changes in response to threat imagery what if someone with ptsd is using cannabis on a regular basis under which you know in their life they're exposed to things that are their triggers are threatening could that uh build and emphasize these neurologic connections and make them better able to control their amygdala reaction even when they don't have cannabis on board yeah absolutely eventually uh one hopes they'd be able to extinguish the problem uh you know so if you had this kind of treatment and association with some kind of cognitive behavioral treatment eventually you hope you can extinguish the stressors uh and the triggers to an attack um you know in practice that's a difficult thing uh there's only a small percentage of people with established post-traumatic stress that really extinguish the syndrome um but that would be a goal and treatment and i would expect this to work better over time you have what are essentially hyperactive uh connections in the brain you're trying to suppress that activity down to a dull roar at least and uh eventually hopefully again to extinguish it great thank you and uh for those of you that are interested the lead author of the study christine rabinek has some other small studies on cannabinoids and ptsd as far as fear extinction looking at you know single doses that can be really helpful so i think that is the hope that appropriately used cannabis over time in the context of life that's full of stressors and triggers could help you know remodel these hyperactive emotional responses pathways in the brain and get better conscious control over them okay so this next one is the impact of naturalistic cannabis use on self-reported opioid withdrawal this is a survey study of 200 people that were recruited through amazon mechanical turk amt which i'm i'm not familiar with i've never been on that but essentially it's individuals that register as these workers to complete human intelligence tasks to earn money and they're given these tasks like respond to the survey and so um they they have to complete the survey and uh do well on the attention checks uh the inclusion criteria was endorsing past 30-day reports having experienced some opioid withdrawal so out of the 200 respondents 125 reported that they used cannabis to treat their opioid withdrawal 72 percent reported that cannabis improved their opioid withdrawal symptoms a little bit lower than i expected it to be 20 reported that cannabis improved some but worsened other symptoms 6.4 reported that cannabis worsened their opioid withdrawal symptoms and only 2.4 percent or three people said that cannabis had no influence on their opioid withdrawal symptoms and so you can see here's a list of the symptoms that were most likely improved with cannabis anxiety was the top one tremors trouble sleeping bone and muscle aches restlessness nausea craving stomach cramps vomiting sweating and of course cannabis is good at addressing these symptoms whether they're related to opioid withdrawal or some other condition 6.4 percent that reported worsening symptoms these were the the symptoms that were worse yawning tearing eyes and running nose which is also a little surprising because cannabis usually tends to dry up uh the mucous membranes but i you know i believe that in some people it could have made it worse oh it's from smoking yeah it could have maybe the smoking was irritating their upper respiratory system so then if we look over here this is an opioid withdrawal score and you can see in total uh those uh with cannabis and without cannabis there was a lower uh score for opioid withdrawal and those with cannabis and a lower overall severity or intensity of their withdrawal symptoms so and and the changes when you broke it up by gender the changes were greater among women than men the average uh decrease was 14.2 in women versus 9.3 in men but this study did not collect any data on how they're using cannabis how much they're using cannabis which is unfortunately very typical of of cannabis research especially that the type that's published in some of the fields of addiction behavior but of course the route of delivery the dosage the cannabinoid content and so forth makes such a big difference there so that's uh that's it for that study any other comments ethan uh no again uh i think uh they're just corroborating what we'd expect um just for as a general comment um i like to see these kind of supportive data the problem is uh that this really doesn't uh raise the bar very much um in terms of convincing our physician colleagues that may not have utilized cannabis um you know unless it's a randomized controlled trial uh this doesn't mean much and it certainly would mean nothing uh to the fda um but again it's good corroboratory data uh so yeah i agree i mean this is what we've all been seeing in our practices anyone uh and it's not just uh clinicians that are seeing this of course people that are out there uh in the field that have know people that are uh withdrawing from opioids cannabis can be a savior to them and and sometimes the dosage really is important some people do well with low doses and other people need extremely high doses to relieve some of these intense opioid symptoms but for a decade now with my clinical practice watching people get off opioids and i had another patient today uh that uh tapered for three days and then went cold turkey and used the cannabis pretty strong and um and prior to that he was not a cannabis user he was cannabis naive and he's been off opioids now since december and just doing great so this can be helpful but again i agree this is not going to change clinical practice a survey study like this just another little piece of data okay let's go to absorption bioavail availability of cbd um i think a lot of you that have been on the webinars in the past have asked questions about what about water soluble cbd what about nano cbd what about liposomal cbd what about all these different things transdermal and you know my response is typically that these formulations have great potential but until i see a pharmacokinetic study that actually checks the blood levels of the cbd and validates the claims these companies are making to me that's meaningless you know making claims isn't it doesn't mean much to me it actually makes me think less of these companies that make claims without the data to support their claims well so that's why i included this one because this is one that actually has some data so it was a randomized parallel arm double blind study and only 10 healthy adults but that's fairly typical for pharmacokinetic studies pharmacokinetics means this study of how the drug is absorbed metabolized and excreted and differences in basically comparing two different cbd powders one was lipid soluble and one was water soluble and i'll tell you more about those two powders on the next slide a single 30 milligram dose and then blood samples were collected over six hours these researchers also did another little part of the study where they collected some immune cells from the blood at baseline and then 90 minutes after cbd administration and then kind of irritated these immune cells with something called lps which is something that's classically used to stimulate an immune response and then they looked at the response of these cells to see wow are they less reactive after they've been exposed to cbd so in other words what's the anti-inflammatory effect of cbd and can we measure that by taking the immune cells out of someone before and after they take a dose of cbd so the water-soluble cbd was prepared in the form of an emulsified homogenized uh 2.5 cbd powder containing medium chain triglyceride oil modified food starch and sorbitol and then the lipid soluble cbd was the same exact ingredients but it was not emulsified and not homogenized they didn't talk about their process of emulsification and homogenation emulsification basically means uh getting uh the water and the lipid layers to mix and that's that's what the um uh the well i guess the modified food starch is probably the main agent that's helping these two things mix uh the lot contained 99.1 percent cbd and was free of thc so here are the average this is the average among the 10 participants here and you can see cbd blood levels on the left and the time course on the right and it looks like the water soluble cbd was absorbed got reached a significantly higher blood level and stayed higher for that really that whole time course compared to the regular old lipid soluble cbd and you can see this over here is called the area under the curve which is if we kind of some summed up all the area under this curve here what does that look like uh it's kind of like the total dose that's being absorbed and you can see here that the water-soluble cbd had a much better absorption than the lipid soluble how much better about 4.5 times more bioavailable now that's great that might mean that you need 4.5 times less of it to get a similar effect which would really save people money but there is a caveat and that caveat is that patients were asked to fast for six hours prior to an arrival in the clinic they were um then after they uh had their cbd 9 at 90 minutes or more after they were given a standardized meal of sausage orange juice and a vegetarian breakfast burrito i'm not sure who is in charge of the menu but that's the vegetarian and the sausage go together and then previous work showed so you know 4.5 fold sounds like a lot but if you look at another study which admittedly was using much higher doses of cbd one that i reported on that came out about two years ago it showed that just by taking your cbd after a high fat meal instead of on an empty stomach you could also increase the maximum level of cbd in the blood and the total amount absorbed the area under the curve by 4.8 fold and two fold respectively so what you know what we're seeing in this study is that the water-soluble cbd essentially allowed someone with an empty stomach to absorb as much cbd as they would have if they had just had a meal with some fat in it prior to that the other thing that i want to report is that there was a lot of inter-individual variability so those charts i showed you before were the average here's here are the individual participants so you can see one person like really absorb that water soluble cbd a lot another person barely absorbed it at all down here so lots of variability and then interestingly at least one person had this peak here right at first then their blood levels of cbd went down and then it went back up again which to me suggests that they probably absorbed some uh in the small intestine and maybe a little bit more in the lower part of the small intestine or in the large intestine i'm not sure but it seems like there were two periods of absorption there this is the other study that i mentioned from 2018 you know much higher doses but again you can see a lot of inter-individual variability between the fasting state and the fed state i'll pause there for you ethan yeah well yeah there's a difference between the preparations how exciting is it well i don't know at all and for exactly the reasons you mentioned there's this tremendous variability um depending on when you take this in relation to meals and uh even in the same individual particularly with marinol synthetic thc people may note onset people are taking it regularly main note onset after 30 minutes it might take three hours on a given day and there isn't always a lot of rhyme or reason to it so you know if the question is should we get excited about this water soluble preparation perhaps but i don't know yet because i guess the real advantage would be if it end up ended up saving material so that it was cheaper but this takes a process to make and chances are it's going to be much more expensive so in the best of all possible worlds where there's good access to cannabidiol material preferably from the plant with a full entourage of suitable terpenoids you don't need this kind of thing so again it remains to be seen what place if any this kind of preparation is going to have thank you i agree oh and then i forgot to give you the answer about the immune activation no difference uh between the two preparations and how uh strongly those immune cells were active uh you can see there was a little bit of a decrease before and after um in uh in the immune cells at zero you know before the cbd or after the cbd but that was same difference in both formulations this is an average over everything so a little bit of an anti-inflammatory effect not statistically significant okay and then another cbd bioavailability study this is looking at piperine which is an a component of black pepper essential oil and it's been studied a lot before it has several pharmacologic properties that are desirable including antioxidant anti-carcinogenic anti-inflammatory but it's mostly known for its effects as an absorption enhancer and it's very commonly been used with curcumin the active component of the herb turmeric which has great therapeutic properties but poor absorption through the gi tract and piperine has frequently been used to aid the absorption of that and there's some theories about how it works perhaps it decreases liver metabolism of some of these compounds but there's also been some contradictory findings about its role as an absorption enhancer suggesting that it may at first upon the first dose or the first couple doses enhance absorption but with repeated use over time it might actually decrease absorption by up regulating these liver enzymes and therefore making it so the liver breaks down these compounds even more before they can get into the blood so this was a rodent study not a human study looking at pro nano lipospheres of cbd with and without piperine so what are what are the pro nanolife lipospheres again it's a mixture of a lipid a surfactant and a co solvent that will dissolve the lipophilic or fat loving molecules so it's another way of getting something that's fat soluble into a watery type of context upon contact with this watery environment the formulation spontaneously forms a stable nano dispersion so basically tiny little bubbles of water on the outside and fat soluble on the inside with a particle size of 50 nanometers or less and the addition of piperine resulted in a statistically significant two-fold increase in the area under the curve and a 1.4 fold increase in the maximum concentration in the blood and interestingly treatment for 10 days and these rodents didn't alter the effects of the piperine the benefits were maintained throughout that period so again you know in my opinion not super exciting i think uh having some black pepper oil with your cbd probably wouldn't hurt except that it's not going to taste very good but maybe in a capsule form a little bit of papering could be helpful any comments ethan uh no but you want to use black pepper with your curry to get that curcumin absorbed so um yeah they should try the same thing in humans and see if it does anything and same comments as before if it genuinely produces a cost savings in your preparation then you've got something otherwise it's just another experiment got it okay well moving on to covet i have my head in covid research for about half a day um and i don't claim to be an expert on it but we're all facing this and my real um you know goal here was to kind of answer a couple questions that are very relevant to my life and to all of your lives how likely is someone to contract covet 19 after close contact with a symptomatic case and what are the outcomes there's been quite a bit of new data coming out in the last couple weeks that help answer these questions but i will say that um and i'll mention this as we get into the slides the the information about covet is coming out so fast that a lot of it is not being peer reviewed and so it's as if it were a peer-reviewed journal article but it's getting published on a few different sites that are basically putting it out there to the scientific community without proper peer review and you know i just really want to emphasize there's just so much we don't know and it's important to stick with that ambiguity and to be comfortable with the ambiguity i think that's a sign of a healthy brain and a healthy thinking is to be okay with not knowing and not being attached to having all the answers because we're going to be let down or misled if we are attached in that way but to try to answer my questions about how catchy is it and what are the outcomes i first looked at the data surveillance data of the first 10 cases in the u.s so these 10 people had close contact with a total of 445 people and all of those were followed only 19 or 4 percent of this 445 were members of a patient's household but i think that's uh important data five of the 19 continued to have household exposure to patients during their whole isolation period so interesting to know how many of them got sick 104 were community members who spent at least 10 minutes within six feet of a patient with confirmed disease that's typically the definition of close contact in these studies is uh less than six feet for greater than 10 minutes and a hundred were community members who were exposed in a healthcare setting and the other 222 were healthcare personnel so to begin with 54 of the 445 close contacts developed new or worsening symptoms deemed to be concerning for covid19 and in my opinion that's the most important data point here how many people seem to get sick maybe they got sick from covid maybe it was something else you know anything's possible but to me that's what's most meaningful because when we start looking at the rest of the data only two out of the 54 that were tested had positive covid tests but how good are these cova tests and what was the timing of testing the person you know there's just um it's in my opinion it's not really reliable uh to determine the rate of transmission based on uh testing of covet dna on a nasopharyngeal swab you know i just know that no test is perfect but if we were to look at that data how many of those that developed symptoms actually had positive covid the rates of transmission are incredibly low just surprisingly low 2 out of 445 close contacts would make it a 0.45 percent so half a percent symptomatic transmission among all the contacts if you looked at the now these two were household members so if you look at just the household members only 10 percent had symptomatic transmission none of the other close contacts tested positives and 2 out of 445 tested positive none of the others including five household members that were continuously exposed during the isolation period none of those five tested positive so maybe the tests are terrible maybe this really isn't as contagious as we thought or maybe it's somewhere in between but again i think the most important part of this data is the 12 now uh moving on to some other data that might help inform us we have uh from a who world health organization report uh three different data sets from china one and this was all based on testing not based on symptomatic presentation but these are large data sets so 280 2842 close contacts 100 of them traced 72 of them completed medical observation among the close contacts again only 2.8 percent found to be infected with covid another very large data set of 25 000 close contacts only 0.9 percent were found to be infected based on testing with covid maybe some were infected that didn't test positive but it's still surprisingly low to me um and and then the third data set of almost 10 000 people a little bit higher here 4.8 percent were found to be infected with covid and then uh i have um well i'll just pause there and uh open uh for comments from you ethan but my comment is that this seems um like a little less scary to catch after i read this data i'm not suggesting uh that people um you know start um hugging again maybe that's a good idea maybe it's maybe it's not um but it makes me a lot less fearful of uh talking to my neighbor or going out into public when i see that this amount of data of people that were within six feet for more than 10 minutes failed to get sick yeah well i wish i was optimistic um this really doesn't jive with the data that we're getting out of uh santa clara county and los angeles county that seem to uh indicate that there are tremendous numbers of people who test positive um who apparently were asymptomatic so was that data here too right yeah you know so and we'll see i imagine but uh the point is you can't tell who's sick and it could be anyone and so someone is perfectly well gets exposed to granny and granny's gone in a couple three weeks um so i don't think there's any substitute for the isolation um i've been off island once and uh well i haven't been off island in six weeks everything i had planned is cancelled till september and you know not everyone can do that but so far it's working for me and for me i've been mostly home enjoying my family and you know i just want to periodically circle back to all the blessings and silver linings of this epidemic the you know the air quality is better than it's ever been in like 20 years in los angeles and many other parts of the world i think um i think covet is bringing us a lot of gifts especially if we recognize that gifts in our personal life in terms of figuring out what's more important and and what do we really want to prioritize focusing on time with our families a crash course and homeschooling which has been delightfully uh challenging and rewarding for myself and um and uh you know just imagining what the world might be like moving forward so i agree you know this data that i've presented so far is looking so far as looking at symptomatic transmission so you're absolutely right ethan this is how many people got sick how many of these close contacts got sick and then a lot of the data like what you see on the screen right now is how many got sick and then tested positive with imperfect tests and those rates are pretty low but how many people caught it and didn't really get sick or maybe just got a tiny little you know runny stuffy nose for a couple days and then got over it and never reported anything you know a lot of these were followed very closely though and i think that even mild symptoms would have been included but then again i have no idea if i can trust this wh o data from china or the data from the us you know i have a very low trust level on any of the data that's coming out right now but um moving forward this is another uh study that was not peer reviewed looking at epidemiology and transmission of covet 19 in shenzhen china so uh 391 cases and 1200 of their close contacts you know first of all i think this is this data is interesting here of these confirmed cases how many were mild moderate or severe and the vast majority have moderate and of course the severe cases as you've all been hearing are people with pre-existing conditions and the elderly but looking over here in the 228 cases with known outcomes the median time to recovery is impressively long 32 days on average in people between 50 and 59 years old 27 day course in younger people and a 36 day course in those over 70 so this is a long one a lot of people that i've talked to that have had it have had this relapsing course where they think they're about to get better and then they get sick again and and this is as many of you know not just a respiratory infection this is affecting almost all the organs and systems of the body and so it can switch between respiratory and diarrhea and muscle aches and pains and even neurologic symptoms this this cohort of 228 cases had three deaths and then you know so so these are the outcomes that i'm interested in and then also we have a little more close contact data here there were 1286 close contacts 95 of them followed for 12 days or more i'm not sure if 12 days is enough but it might be like again i mean i heard last night that uh they found it in the nose for 21 days yeah so yeah i don't think that 12 is enough but this you know looking at the secondary attack rate fourteen point nine percent of household contacts got sick but again this isn't a hundred percent this isn't you know eighty percent it's only fourteen point nine percent um and then nine point six percent overall of close contacts got sick nine percent took more than 14 days to develop symptoms so there can be a long time before someone develops symptoms which shows us that that 12-day observation isn't great but based on this study the reproductive number or r was 0.4 and that means based on their data how many people would one confirmed case infect and in this situation they're saying that one confirmed case would in fact less than one other person would in fact on average a 0.4 of one other person so that's that's really low other studies have estimated much higher reproductive number so um and then uh just one more piece of data about how catchy it is this is 482 confirmed cases uh reported uh to uh when zoo municipality uh reproduction number in this data set was 2.9 but this was looking at the severe cases so this was all people with severe acute respiratory syndrome uh were estimated to basically pass it on to three people per each case of infection so you know i gave you a lot of data there i think some of it shows that it's more catchy and some of it shows that it's it's less contagious but overall this data makes me feel like it's a lot less contagious than i might have been thinking about and you know just like touching an envelope that comes in my mailbox and i'm gonna get really sick you know maybe that's possible but i'm i'm feeling a little less scared uh after digging into this data but still i don't have any uh full confidence that this data is accurate or truthful yeah and you're not a geezer like me yeah it's true it's true i'd probably be a little more cautious if i were and maybe this will still be going on when i am a geezer we'll see but then you'll be a super geezer ethan and we'll have to come visit you but we'll keep our distance so uh this is the data that ethan was referring to out of santa clara county again not peer-reviewed but i read through it and looked like a good study over 3000 people recruited with facebook that were tested for coveted antibodies so and now in this case the question isn't do they have an acute infection the question is did they have an infection these are all people that are now symptom-free feeling fine going in and getting their blood drawn and looking for has their immune system been exposed to the virus this uh test which was actually developed in in china it's a rapid developing test it's not expensive uh it it was validated in three different methods one by the manufacturer and uh two based on the study using uh confirmed cases and confirmed negatives that were in sanford hospital and then also using blood samples that were pre-covered and they estimated a sensitivity of 80 and a specificity of 99 so what does this mean sensitivity means uh the rate of having a true or a false negative test so like how many people um does it test uh do how many people get a negative test that really do have exposure to the virus and um and that would be around 20 percent and then specificity is more related to the rate of false positives so this would suggest that less than one percent of the positive results were incorrect uh but but of course some could have still been correct so um looking at their data they estimated that the sterile prevalence of antibodies to coven 19 was 2.49 to 4.16 percent so they're saying that somewhere between two and a half and four percent of the population in this major county in california has been exposed to covid that's a lot of people this is this is implying that by april 1st somewhere between 48 000 and 81 000 people had been infected this is a much higher estimate than what we had been thinking based on the number of symptomatic and positive cases based on testing people while they're acute so as of april 1st the number of confirmed positive cases was only 956. so a minimum of 50 times more than the confirmed positive cases had antibodies in their blood or you know based on the calculations were likely to have antibodies in the blood so what does this mean uh it means that a lot of people got this and didn't get very sick maybe they didn't get sick at all maybe it was just a very mild upper respiratory infection or something like that this also in my opinion may mean that covet has been around in the population longer than we believe now i've spoken with a few friends that practice emergency medicine and and just observing my patients we had something here in maine in january and even late december that people were calling the six week cold you know and now as i'm looking through my medical charts here in in april and uh looking at visits from january you know doing a three-month follow-up with patients and i've had several patients that made the comment about whether they got the six a week cold or they didn't get the six week old i don't know maybe that was covid so and and some of uh emergency uh uh clinicians were also saying that they were seeing this before it was making headlines seeing some type of a respiratory illness that was behaving differently than what they're used to so maybe there is a lot more of it in the population now if you take the same data and you look at how many people are confirmed to have died of kovid you know of course if the number of deaths stays the same but the number of infections goes up by 50 fold then the fatality rate becomes 50 full lower and so this data is suggesting a fatality rate of 0.1 to 0.2 percent which is about the same as the typical annual flu again i don't know how perfect this data is but yeah please comment ethan yeah well we we don't want to make trump right i mean this raises more questions than than answers really uh one thing we know again i think this was reported one or two days ago that uh it's pretty well established now that uh the first cases in the states were in california in santa clara county and not uh in near seattle um so the really sobering part of this is let's say that this is accurate the real problem here is we do not yet know whether having uh antibodies of this tighter is protective to getting re-infected and until we answer that we're really going to be in a world of hurt um because we don't know if any of these antibody tests are predictive of whether someone can return to work and not be susceptible again not give it to someone else we really don't know that yet which is really unfortunate um i agree i mean this there's also different version you know different um strains of kovit right there's at least three distinct versions of that have been traced and so perhaps if somebody were exposed to one previously they could still catch the other or maybe they could catch the same one all over again it seems to have a relapsing course anyway so even after someone seems to be better their nasal swab there was a different study that i didn't present in these slides but one study showed that uh people who were confirmed cases their nasal swabs turned out to be negative you know later in the course as they were recovering or recovered discharged from the hospital two weeks later they're tested again and they're they've turned positive again so they've started reproducing the viruses started reproducing again in their body and potential potentially shedding again so if it's relapsing within one individual i i think that it's certainly possible that those have been exposed could be reinfected as well so a lot we don't know and then one other comment that i'll make is that a lot of my patients and i think a lot of people want this antibody test because they want to know have they had it are they protected against it you know one thing that's important to know is even though these antibody tests have a high specificity which means there's a low rate of false positives if the overall prevalence in the population is low say like two percent or four percent then something called the positive predictive value of of the antibody test is still very poor so you know for example if i tested 100 people and only one of them had covid and then i got one false positive test you know it's still a good test but i got one false positive and one true positive the chance of of that positive test you know being accurate is now 50 and pretty much worthless i do think that antibody testing could be helpful in answering a question that i'm wondering about myself which is have i had big bad covid you know am i someone that gets really sick with it or am i someone that has a mild case of it and um you know if i if i suspect that i've been exposed to it that's an that's a question that i would like to answer but again these tests don't answer that perfectly by a long shot and then just one last slide on covet and we'll get to the q a this is new york survey you know kind of similar data looking at the antibodies and and this would had even higher 13.9 percent of the people tested in the study had antibodies which again puts the implied fatality rate way lower all the way down to 0.5 percent so again this is kind of like if it's 50 times more common than we thought then it's probably 50 times less fatal than we thought and um and again it's imperfect data it's ongoing i'm not suggesting that people change their habits or or do anything different you know please uh you know continue to keep yourself and and keep your community safe and listen to your you know local health authorities and the cdc but um but it may not be in my opinion it may not be as bad or as contagious as uh we were originally thinking i i hope that it's not uh yeah again we've got 60 000 people dead so it's already equivalent to the total of 13 years of the vietnam war um i i don't take any solace from this at all even if it is accurate okay all right well let's stop the screen share and start with the q a well i see we've had a very active chat here um which i'm not going to be able uh to respond to but i think simone is probably here moderating all the questions i see my mom is online hi mom great to see you and uh yeah so uh let's go um where shall we start with questions simone i think karen should get first shot you got any questions mom oh you're muted i don't know someone can you unmute my mom uh only the the new drug they've they've been trying rem yeah yeah that sounds hopeful i mean slightly it's the numbers aren't significant there either but it seems that it's helping people to recover faster oh you know what guys i wanted there were there was another slide that i wanted to share with a little bit of hope so let me let me go to that while you're getting that i'll i'll talk i mean um yeah please rem death severe was developed for other viruses and there may be some cross reactivity but you know we don't don't have the numbers yet um one company has said that they've got a signal uh we really need to see the data again until it really goes through peer review i wouldn't hold my breath um everybody hopes that it it's helpful but we just don't know yet yeah so you know i i take a perspective of uh what can we do to support health and that predominates my thinking about treating disease what can i do to support the patient's innate healing system rather than what can i do to combat the virus or the infection even though both approaches are very important this was just two cases presented by richard horowitz who is a a very prominent author and a clinician in the tick-borne disease world lyme disease and so forth and um but he you know reading this study he brings attention to some really well established data that in acute respiratory distress syndrome and in other you know viral diseases and in cases of this cytokine storm and in you know inf inflammatory cascade where essentially it's our immune system that's uh scorching the terrain and and causing all the damage that uh glutathione levels are are really important and so glutathione is like this strong antioxidant that our bodies can make and levels of a decrease with aging which could be a part of why older people are more susceptible to this and so he presented two cases of people using both iv glutathione and liposomal oral glutathione along with other supplements that support our glutathione production like alpha lipoic acid and n-acetylcysteine and there was a uh dramatic symptomatic response that was observable within an hour or so after administering the glutathione similar to what you can see um you know there's videos online about iv glutathione you know before and after people with parkinson's and other neurologic conditions it's something that can help a lot of things so that's you know just one other interesting study if people want to check it out he covers vitamin c and some some of the other supportive treatments that might be useful in this paper okay so now let's definitely get back to cannabis okay what are we going to do so simone is saying let me know yeah let's do some live questions right uh we've got only a few that were submitted ahead of time so i would love to have any live questions just let simone know and uh via the chat and she will unmute you and well i'm not muted so did you read the mercola article on hydrogen in um to uh combiat covid 19 i didn't i didn't read that article uh no i didn't i just saw the headline but molecular hydrogen is very interesting therapy again kind of like glutathione that can help with so many different things okay well while we're waiting i think i'm going to go over to the questions that were submitted ahead of time because sometimes i don't get to those and i know that's probably frustrating for the people who submitted a question that i didn't answer so let me um just pull those up so the the first one um was from suzanne mueller who's living in germany it's difficult for her to get cannabis flowers uh and she was really asking about what's the best way for her to create a preparation of cannabis so this is applicable to anyone she says she did two organic ethanol washes with about 30 grams of dried but not decarboxylated flowers and then she put that ethanol that had been washed through the flowers into a distiller like a green oil machine and her question is she's read that after the distillation the thca has not converted into thc and needs further processing how should she process that and asking a lot of questions about heating it but correct me if i'm wrong ethan i believe the temperatures involved in distillation would be enough to also decarboxylate that thca what do you think well you know uh she's talking about 110 degrees celsius um that's going to be plenty so long as um the time is long enough the decarboxylation curves are temperature and time dependent in other words you can either go for a very high temperature for a short time which is going to blow off all the terps or you could use a lower temperature even below boiling point of water uh for a longer period of time um so 110 degrees celsius um 105 to 110 degrees celsius for three hours that should pretty effectively decarboxylate it now the other point i'd make is that the remaining thca isn't going to hurt anything at all as dustin can attest better than me having used it clinically quite a bit um so i think that should be adequate um and you know really uh you a patient should be titrating to the benefit on symptoms anyway uh so you can answer the question you know i think total efficiency is not necessarily the goal because you can definitely decarboxylate it but you may be eliminating useful components such as the turbinoids so um to me lower temperature for a longer time is better than high temperature for a shorter time agreed thank you and then the following question from dr robin ellie will patients taking thca test positive on a urine test for thc uh the answer of course depends on how much thca they're taking but most likely yes uh and also depends on the threshold of sensitivity of the the urine test but any time that you have some thca you're going to have at least a small amount of thc it's nearly impossible or totally impossible to have just pure thca without even you know a tiny bit of thc in there yeah it's true even in the plant i mean i've heard people say that thc isn't a natural product of cannabis uh but that was in the era before um good uh analysis uh without uh you know uh without uh gas chromatography when you're doing a technique where uh it's done at room temperature there's always some thc so there's spontaneous decarboxylation and tca is inherently unstable um you know one hopes that with a low level of ingestion it's not going to be enough to trigger the test but that doesn't matter if you get in trouble so it's unfortunate another reason we need to get the laws changed and then conversely for people that are using herbal cannabis but trying to pass a drug test by saying that they're using pharmaceutical thc like marinol or dronabinol there is a confirmation test that can be performed that looks for thca so even and this has been used for a long time so even people that are just smoking cannabis where you know most of the cannabinoids are decarboxylated you know through the process of burning it there will still be a small amount of vaporized thca that enters the body and can be checked for in the urine so those two are really hard to separate unless it's a pure pharmaceutical version of thc then there would be zero thca in there that varies by jurisdiction they used to test for traces of thcv as a proof that somebody wasn't just using marinol but was using cannabis some states accepted that as evidence some did not um you know i'd like to see this kind of testing fall by the wayside but that isn't likely to happen anytime soon agreed okay um how about a live question before we go on with the previously submitted one uh can we have uh someone who's uh submitted or raised their hand it looks like cheryl has a question i have a quick question i was unmuted it's dr rita from okay michael how are you we met in portland yeah my question is two parts one do they know why males are more susceptible to having worse outcomes with covet 19 and the second question is uh about plasma donation there is one hospital here in chicago that did their first successful plasma donation into a covet 19 patient and what has been your um reports in your areas about plasma donations being effective yeah i don't i don't know i wish i had answers to that rita but i um i think plasma donation in theory makes sense but of course we'll need a lot of data before we know that it's worthwhile um but i like the kind of altruistic uh aspect of it i've i've gotten over this and now i want to help other people get over it and i can donate some of these antibodies but we just don't know how protective the antibodies are yeah i've seen a few people on tv that thought they got better much quicker than expected after getting a donor plasma back to the first part of the question men get it worse because of the weaker sex also risk factors are worse men are going to be greater on the smoking drinking obesity stuff that seem to be risk factors and that probably accounts for it i don't know that it has anything to do with the y chromosome per se but more with behavior of men thank you okay and then i saw that uh cheryl wanted to ask a question um she's right on the top of my screen if we could unmute her please there you go cheryl looks like you can hear me yes okay um i have a i have two if you get an immunity test i'm gonna go have one tomorrow um so how do you tell if you're immune i mean about besides the usual way um is there a way or might there be a way soon to test yourself test your immunity i don't think we're gonna know for a long time if a positive antibody test means that you're immune to catching it again i you know i think even if so if you're gonna go get an antibody test tomorrow my strongest recommendation is if there's anyone that you've been close with that has been symptomatic bring them with you because because without that other person there or that close contact the positive predictive value of the test uh meaning how say you get a positive test what's the likelihood that that positive test is accurate that could be anywhere from five percent or one even as low as one percent all the way up to 80 or 90 percent and and what that number what that accuracy really depends on is the prevalence in the population but if you had it you know so for anyone out there if they had a close contact and both of you had some sickness and it was a similar sickness and you thought it might be coveted and you go there and you both test positive then it's almost certainly going to be an accurate positive okay the reason i i'm i wasn't afraid i'd come in contact with anyone but my husband and i both got sick in with a weird sort of flu-like illness in january and he volunteers at an airport national airport so you know he's got people all the time from everywhere coming in and he got sick first and i just wanted to i just felt like you know it wasn't just the flu so yeah so can you bring him with you if you guys both tested positive then that would be a most likely a true positive he'll go if i if i uh turn out to be positive he'll go ah he's made it go to go together because then you're gonna i mean well who knows maybe maybe um you could start where you start but if whether you're positive or negative just know that that single test isn't going to tell you anything about your immunity but it might tell you if you're someone that survived covet um or not okay great thank you and i have one more is that okay sure okay two um when you're talking about reinfection could could it be that the i think in one of the diseases one of the like hiv a long time ago i heard that the virus can hide and then come out again later not sure if it was hiv but i i heard that sure well that has been shown to to occur in covet i mentioned it before but i didn't show the slide where people who had positive tests then they had negative tests and felt better and then two weeks later they had positive tests again so that is possible to have this relapsing where it seems like the immune system is beating down the virus and getting it under control and then it just pops up again so that would you wouldn't mistake that for getting re-infected would you who knows yeah i mean maybe i mean the people that i've talked to more often than not have a course where they feel like they're just about better and then they get sick again not totally better but just about and then they're sick again that that's that's been a common report okay just my final question for for ethan um i've been reading seeing a couple papers about cobid and cannabis and um i was wondering if you'd seen them or if you think if you how you think cannabis could affect koben uh yeah i'm gonna rain on people's parade here um okay first of all um people worry about immune suppression i don't think that uh that's a problem first you know there's a bunch of old literature with respect to thc most of that uh was with doses in rodents that were 50 to 100 times the psychoactive dose which is crazy certainly cbd is immunomodulatory i wouldn't call it immunosuppressive um but particularly uh things like uh antagonizing tumor necrosis factor alpha which you need to fight viruses i'd be really shocked if uh it had a negative influence but it would be possible so the question really comes up uh in relation to cbd can it treat the cytokine storm so this is the overreaction immunologically that may be responsible for a lot of the pulmonary damage that people get and end up in icu um i can think a lot of a lot of reasons why it might be helpful but none of that matters at all until we have some real data so i just can't encourage people to do it and certainly nobody should be smoking at this point if they're worried about exposure we know that smoking damages the cilia in the lungs that help clear out things from them and if you get this virus you're going to have enough trouble clearing the lungs as it is so for people that need to use cannabis medically at least they should be vaporizing and preferentially using oral mucosal preparations or oral preparations and really that's all i i would say i mean i i've read a few of these things not the formal articles again theoretically yeah i could help but it's totally unproven at this point thanks thank you and but i i think what you're also saying ethan is that you wouldn't encourage anyone to stop using cannabis either because they wanted to prevent covid or if they had an acute case of kova that neither of those would be reason to stop cannabis with the exception of smoking yeah no that's that's it okay i agree i have a question that was previously submitted that's for you ethan about cannabis roots i've i've read some positive things about cannabis roots being used in topicals for pain do you know of either research data or clinical verification of the benefits of roots as medicine or roots combined with flowers i think this is from amalthea you're asking the right person because he's probably the only one in the universe that's published a paper on cannabis roots well yeah with natasha we published a paper on roots a few years ago i'd known for a long time decades i've been collecting these references to cannabis roots what's really interesting about the roots is they've been recommended for a lot of the same things that the tops have although they have nothing in common biochemically so in the the flowers of course you've got monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids and the cannabinoids um in the roots you have triterpenoids which are also anti-inflammatory and have anti-cancer effects and you've got a bit of alkaloid although the amounts are so tiny um it's probably it's hard to know that they do anything um traditionally the roots have been used to treat wounds uh to treat uh fibrotic problems particularly in the skin um and to some extent cancer um we do have corroboration for the tri-terpenoids um uh fredolin and epifreedelanol um you know these are definitely active molecules um yeah i'll just mention an anecdote that dustin and i uh were in valparaiso in chile a couple of years ago and on the street there was a guy selling various cannabis preparations including a tincture of cannabis roots anyway if you want to know more about roots um if you go to ethanrusso.org you'll see my collected articles and the one by natasha riz ryz and me is on there somewhere and you should have free access to the pdf on you'll see all the details about um what's been done historically and what the science says about roots so thanks for that question yeah thanks for the answer uh how about another live question do we have anyone uh someone that's up for a live question but while we're waiting since i'm my mic's still on i i saw one um that i like i'd like to address and it's whether there's a difference between uh cannabinoids from the plant and cannabinoids made by yeast uh the cannabinoids made by yeast hopefully they're the same molecule but they're going to be tremendously more expensive there are a bunch of companies that think the weight of their financial success is by teaching yeast through genetic modification to make cannabis and vats and there was a company that actually taught yeast to make multiple different cannabinoids but uh not necessarily at the same time um the amounts they've gotten so far are really small it's very hard for me to imagine that they'll be able to scale this up to a point where it's really economically viable keep in mind that you can grow acres and acres and acres of cbd and the plant does a damn good job you know there are people making plants with 15 uh tea i'm sorry cbd in the flower i yeast isn't going to be able to do that that concentration is is toxic uh to the yeast cells additionally they're never going to be able to reproduce the entourage that you get from the plant so to me unless it's multiple cannabinoids and multiple terpenoids it just isn't exciting so i think the science is fascinating i'm not a fan of genetic modification you don't need to do that with cannabis because its genome is so plastic given the time and effort you can teach the plant to make anything you want so i don't see yeast supplanting cannabis and then a follow-up question uh from lonnie ethan that i saw on the chat is that he'd love to hear you talk more about a better constructed cannabis product to help in opioid research um yeah well this is easy um again going back to the 19th century we know the thc works the preparations that they had available the indian hemp was basically uh high thc preparation probably didn't have cbd at all um so that that would worked um unfortunately in our society even among uh scientists there's still this morbid fear of thc there's cbd additionally has definite anti-addictive effects and this is not just for opioids but any of the addictive substances and it may work by uh depressing function in the insula that part of the brain that seems to do with craving among other mechanisms but um you know there's nothing that cbd does that isn't enhanced by having at least a little thc um additionally on the uh terpenoid side uh it's a tremendous advantage to have a good amount of caryophyllene uh so it acts as a cb2 receptor agonist um and drugs that do that also have anti-addictive effects and they're quite distinct from the mechanism of action of cbd so if you have a combination of a pretty high dose of cbd with a reasonable dose of caryophyllene and just a little bit of thc um you're going to have a very good drug for treating addiction and withdrawal and then you know other components a little antidepressant effect from limonene a little anti-anxiety effect from lima lull and you're off to the races sounds great let's get that into the studies all right um we usually stop around now but i know we got started later than usual because of the technical difficulties and and for those of you that are having to watch on facebook or youtube uh thank you for watching there and i'm sorry that you don't have a chance to ask a live question do we have anyone else that wants to ask a live one i see uh and andy's raising his hand and so is maureen simone we could probably field them both i would you simon are you there to unmute uh maureen or andy hi okay we got you yeah hey hey dr russo um i i asked you a question back in 2018 um how do we get medicine involved at the point of distribution and um you answered me that a good doctor always listens to his nurse so i took that as an imperative and to get out there and and start advocating for this plant um to anyone and everyone so now um at this point in time two years later let me ask you the same question probably to both doctors how can we get medicine i'm an rn to um at the point of distribution now that um now that we know enough well i we always need to know more but you know again i think this has to start with legislation uh we need a new administration uh we need laws that are going to allow access um and legalization isn't always the answer legalization uh was a disaster for patients in washington state and it hasn't been very good in california either talk to anybody in the industry about how they're getting strangled uh by the regulations that have been imposed this stuff is not plutonium and it's treated as if it is um so it's gonna take continued uh education of uh particularly politicians uh to get this to the point where there's legitimate access and uh while we're at it i'll just add that they're always gonna be three echelons of activity um they're going to be pharmaceutical forms of cannabis like sativex and epidialex they're likely going to be supplements by various companies that'll have some amount of quality control and regulation and there's going to be herbal cannabis the mistake that people make is that they think that one facet of the industry can eliminate the others and it it just won't happen it didn't happen in 1985 uh when people thought that synthetic thc as as marinol was going to solve the cannabis as medicine issue that never happened uh pure thc is a lousy drug nobody likes it and it isn't that good for much um it needs the rest of its companions to create an entourage so it's a long steep climb yet i'm afraid maureen but as long as we have people like you out there carrying on the fight there is hope thank you both of you for great question and comment hopefully someday we won't need to talk about that but it seems like it's uh it's been a long time and uh thank you to all of you who are on the webinar tonight that have been working to improve the situation for decades i know there's a lot of folks that are are new to this field also in reaping the benefits of the the blood sweat and tears of the activists and educators that have been doing this for a long long time simone uh let me know that her mic is not working but she does have a cue of live questions and it looks like uh gershon that you are uh you are unmuted go for it hey dr uh doctor i feel like we actually have at the conference in new orleans i don't know if you recall i do recall um but either way i had two questions um one is who are concerned about the long-term uh uh unknowns of using cannabis medicine you know what gershon sorry man can you uh can you type the questions it's like really choppy so um type them in we'll make sure that it's not really working on the audio so type them in the chat and we'll we'll and we'll make sure that we answer them [Music] no no no sorry and and you were muted so sounds like you were in a tin can i'm afraid but i have uh you know i'll feel the question that came in on the on the chat well he's muted but it's like so delayed that it still is coming i think um a question that came in on the chat this is from sierra campbell the elderly how do we best treat them with cannabis is taking it internally hard for their liver for pain relief inflammation etc even for dementia so you know i think in treating the elderly based on my experience and also based on several small studies taking cannabis by mouth is a great format usually an oil or a tincture that can be titrated it's it's not going to be hard on the liver unless it's in doses that would be too high to tolerate anyways we have several residents at a local assisted living facility uh for dementia that are using cannabis oils and uh the nursing staff love it and it's just it's just you know helping with the agitation sparing benzodiazepines and antipsychotic drugs and who knows maybe slowing down the progression of the disease but um let's have our neurologist comment on that as well well it's really not that different um you know obviously caution needs to be applied you don't want to overdose anyone but particularly an elderly person because one of the dangerous side effects of thc would be orthostatic hypotension leading to false which uh you know is a big deal in the elderly however i can tell you from the sativex program i saw all the pharmacovigilance data for basically the 11 years that i was with the company and we saw no significant differences in adverse event profiles in elderly people compared to younger people in fact i remember there was a 98 year old guy that was on huge doses this was early in the program when they allowed really extravagant doses of sativex um and apparently it helped but the really noteworthy thing was that he had no significant side effects um you can develop tolerance to thc and tremendous doses um the key thing i would emphasize um is just slow titration which applies to anyone and and no less uh in the elderly because of concerns of sedation or orthostatic hypotension or drug drug interactions although again i think that those get more attention than they really deserve in practice um yes there can be issues but um it just isn't a big issue most of the time um so start low go slow applies to everyone young or old i agree thank you and we got gershon's questions in uh the first is which what do you tell parents who are concerned about the unknown long-term risks of using cannabis even just cbd as medicine i think that's a great great question because there are a lot of unknowns you know we have some knowns about adolescents that are super heavy cannabis smokers usually in the context of poly substance abuse and they may have worse outcomes cognitively and academically but i don't think that really applies to medical patients so what about all the unknowns around long-term use of thc and cbd well i think you need the context of each individual case so for example these compounds are safe enough to do a therapeutic trial of say two or three months and during that two or three months if you're seeing things that do have known outcomes like better sleep better attendance better academic performance you know say less pain whatever symptoms you know concrete goals of therapy if you're achieving those concrete goals and some of them are knowns that are related to future outcomes then i think you have a case that the risk is less than the than the benefit yeah absolutely um again we have history on our side here we really know that again these medicines have been used in kids for millennia um and they just generally aren't problems usually in a child we're dealing with some severe syndrome or disease and risk benefit analysis favors using cannabis um this is not a situation like a new chemical entity where we're going to discover five years from now that it causes aplastic anemia or some other disastrous side effect we know exactly what it can do and how to avoid it um so i'm not saying that problems can't happen it's just that properly used is extremely safe even in children thank you i have another one that came in on the chat uh asking you dr russo any real benefit of removing terpenes from cbd or thc uh wrong person to ask again i think it depends on what's in it the only thing you might want to reduce would be excess amounts of mercy and because of sedation um but beyond that um you know i i think in terms of building up rather than tearing down and um there's so much uh contribution that uh terpenoids can make uh to the cannabinoid profile that i'm always gonna favor and extract over an isolate and i'll just agree i think the one situation where i've seen there may be some benefit would be someone who does really well with cbd for daytime treatment but they find that their you know broad spectrum cbd product is sedating for them i've had several cases like that that i've then switched over to a cbd isolate product typically at a somewhat higher dose but they're able to still get some benefit from that without the sedation and you know i believe that you know hopefully the field is moving forward towards developing varieties of cbd dominant cannabis that aren't very high in mercena and are less sedating and on that note i would love to unmute andrew mcintyre because he had a live question that he's been waiting patiently on thank you thank you dusty thank you ethan for your work and everybody involved tonight uh i just want to ask um if anybody if ethan or dusty or anyone on the board um had reviewed the the trial study in israel uh they were gonna mix cbd with um with uh steroids so so i think to mitigate the cytokine response and i um wanted to ask and just give some of my experience and then have you guys talk and maybe there's a connection because when patients come with copd i make a vape pen with cbd with pinene um and limonene and that is like a vasodilator and it blew my mind that they would get better by smoking something but now we have in the covid um realm the pine tree needle tea extract with pygnogenol which very simple every american can make uh it's a steeped tee and that that blew my mind because it has the same terpene complex that i put in for for the these patients alpha and beta pinene lemonine and mercyn come through my vape pen with cbd and i just i don't know i i think i would like to reach out maybe through tikkun or some eye contacts in israel to try to see if what's going on with the study but with the pine needle tree extract you get the pycnogenol plus the vitamin c and a and i just in terms of if we're going to look at cannabis in covid and to reduce the code this the cytokine response which is essentially killing the people um is the overreaction to the viral outbreak and having the pygnogenol and perhaps other things like zinc and selenium included in the study so we can find a way around this you know while while they search for this vaccine which we don't know if it's going to work right uh but i'll have you pause there and we can we can comment ethan do you have any comments first uh you know sounds good again i think we need more data uh to have an idea certainly be one of the safer approaches to make a pine needle tea and um you know i've heard a lot uh from terry willard about other approaches uh with other compounds uh particularly some of the uh far eastern mushrooms um uh can have antiviral properties or a rare northwest species the garrick on um and um uh he mentioned something i we've got here in my area a lot i i didn't know anything about and that was alder catkin tea which uh in the spring hang from the trees but um again um a guy like him is going to be better informed on the herbal side i'd like to see more data you know i think that um thinking broadly about the approach to covet with the little that we know right now we can think about how can we limit this cytokine storm right so what are some ways of suppressing this excessive inflammation probably cb2 agonism is one of many targets there we can also think about how can we upregulate things like glutathione and our antioxidant and protective systems and there's you know many botanicals and botanical compounds that have been shown to do that you know like resveratrol and curcumin and other things and then also what can we do to help the parts of our immune system that are going to likely help fight the virus but not cause this inflammatory damage like the natural killer cells and i think that you know there's probably um it's that's probably the mushrooms you know primarily and other natural compounds that can support the safer more beneficial aspects of the immune system so we've got you know some general ideas but i agree we're just so far from knowing what's actually effective for this infection and to the part of your question andrew about the research they're doing in israel i'm not aware of it and that you know i don't think that there's results out yet that are worth talking about now uh simone notify me that we have a bunch of people that were actually ahead of andrew in mind so i'll let you go to them uh simone and sorry for budging andrew and but uh you know the reason i did that is because i was talking about um breeding low mircine cbd dominant chemo vars which is something that andrew's been successfully working on for a long time who's next and um simone i think she's having trouble with her mic so she can't announce who's next so she probably unmuted someone that might not know they're unmuted i'll let you go to them sorry for budget andrew okay somebody i think benson was starting to ask a question and then he got muted next look at this okay benson i think you're up um oh that was my feedback i think somebody that's listening on facebook or youtube which has a delay and it was coming back in well let's go um let's go to uh someone else that has a question um this is fun but we gotta wrap up at some points so any anyone else with a live question that we can take [Music] yeah can you hear me yes we can er thank you very much for the night seminar and greetings from colombia i'm also a canada scientist trying to reinvent myself with the kovic situation so i recently saw a publication claiming that cv1 was able to down regulate the angiotensin receptor which is a get gateway for the coronavirus to enter the cell and therefore claiming that it was that cbd could help you protect from the virus but i cannot help to think that this will also cause the angiotensin concentration to remain high in the bloodstream which is also related to lung damage so i was wondering was what was your opinion about that because uh although it sounds very beautiful i don't think hannah is the solution for it and i trust more that maybe the cannabis industrial development of the cannabis industry would be a good alternative to somehow help us say um yeah go over the coming economic recession well i'm not aware of cb1 reducing angiotensin receptor levels have you heard of that before ethan well i know i i have not it and it's certainly possible that you know i don't doubt that there's some data that this ecs is just so complex but of course we've been treating people on ace inhibitors for a long time with cannabis and there's no problems there again the point i'd make is let's say thc does this um again it shouldn't be smoked in this instance on if it proves to be the case it should be taken orally and you know the the concept of down regulating angiotensin receptors as a worthy objective in the prevention of kovid you know i think you see your your comment is accurate that doesn't seem uh to be a great physiologic strategy because of the you know cardiovascular implications uh probably better to boost immunity and antioxidant activity and who knows maybe not antioxidant because that can be a two-edged sword as well we use you know free radicals to fight infections in in some situations but uh but thank you for being a cannabinoid researcher reinventing yourself in the era of kovid i um i see paola pineda online and i um just so happy to see your face i'm wondering if you um if simone could unmute you no pressure but if you have any comments or perspectives on what's happening in uh columbia and uh or just in your world in general i'm very curious i i think you're unmuted okay thank you very much dustin and hello to everybody and now i think that in this moment we are just learning a lot about kobe that many things we are reinvented of our way of work for me it's a little bit difficult to work by internet with the patients because it's very important to be close to stay more close to the patients but you know we are studying a lot we are trying to change our weight of eating of drinking more water doing more exercise we are doing anything not just cannabis cannabis is important but in this moment we need to reinvent ourselves it's a great opportunity for growth you know i think in every challenge there's a lot of opportunity and it's just so apparent that the world can grow and change in response to this pandemic but i agree it's hard to see patients i came into the office today typically i've been working from home with pajama bottoms and a work top on and um you know that's been fun but i really miss getting my hands on patients and treating them osteopathically and somehow the telephone and computer work seems more tiring i think that reciprocal energy loop of contact with the patient really inspires and nurtures me in a day a long day of work that i don't get tired at all but i'm staring at the computer and talking on the phone i i do sometimes but we're still taking good care of people and and helping people improve their health remotely that's true yes all right um let's just do one more i think this has been a super long webinar but we've got a long a lot of audience here uh do we have uh simone the next one and if you want to text me or chat me who it is then i can announce them so they're aware and then um if if there's anything that you're seeing on the chat ethan while we're waiting for the next live question feel free to respond to that [Music] yeah question uh you know and it's an interesting when kathy fagan asks you know that she's been using opioids for many years unfortunately she wants to get off them but she can't find a doctor that will prescribe opiates while she uses cannabis i mean that was a very common problem that we had in maine where as soon as someone would become my patient and i'd start them on cannabis then their pain doc would you know either abruptly discontinue their opioids or literally discharge them for from the practice even if they were upfront about it and if i had copied that pain doctor on my chart note but over the years i just wrote a lot of letters and made a lot of calls and explained that this is going to help them taper their opioids which is a common goal amongst all three parties and just give us a chance and and it's usually that conversation that can help and then the 2016 cdc guidelines on treating people with chronic pain with opioids came right out and said don't test their urine for thc because the results are not clinically relevant sometimes showing that guideline to the pain doctor and setting up a conversation between a responsible cannabis clinician and your your opioid prescribing pain doctor i mean i think it's really all about communication but i'm sure that's still a big problem for a lot of people i here wrote a uh an editorial cannabis thing in the journal of pain that made exactly a point at this time unconscionable drop a patient with chronic pain because they ask positive for uh t metabolites uh really counterproductive and justifiable cruel but probably uninformed you know coming from a place of ignorance and uh just the way things have been done in the past and so hopefully education can help all right oh and uh lonnie it looks like lonnie's open for a question or at least uh someone uh texted me that so it looks like you get to wrap us up tonight lonnie what do you got for us well hello there and uh can you hear me absolutely okay well it's a pleasure and it's a pleasure to uh speak with uh both uh yourself and dr uh russo tonight um i really loved what you're talking about earlier with uh the opioid dependency i had some clients that were in the process of taking them off of the opioids in particular i got a case last week one of the doctors that you know well dr michelle weiner and i are working together this patient fits uh what was in the 2016 article about clinical endocannabinoid deficiency and i just wanted to get some feedback from dr russo on taking a patient off of really high amounts of fentanyl things like that and switching her over to moving to plant-based medicine cannabis products she has fibromyalgia irritable bowel syndrome and migraine so classic patient and i just wanted to kind of hear your feedback since we have that opportunity tonight uh sure well you know in terms of opioid taper slow is the name of the game in fact as uh dustin will attempt um you often don't need to provide a construction division because they tend to do this on their own and they might come back in a month and you find out that they've completed the taper without a lot of feedback um but you know i would say all decrements a few days or a week at a time hopefully there's not a big rush and you know if it took three months what's the big deal on the end they're going to be on a safer regimen um you brought up an unfortunate situation so about migraine irritable bowel and fibromyalgia are comorbid conditions they occur in the same people so somebody might have one and at some point in their life they might be afflicted by one or two of the others in a situation like that excuse me i'm always going to recommend that they be on a prebiotic and probiotic regimen as well um because it works and it's more akin to how humans were designed to eat and i'd be really surprised in that situation if over time that they weren't able to lower a lot of drugs uh that they're taking uh so there'd be a really worthy goal um and uh yeah i definitely recommend that as an adjunct to whatever medical treatment that they're getting excellent thank you so much i and again thank you for an amazing discussion tonight it was just wonderful sitting here watching the chat on both youtube and zoom i just loved it tonight i've been looking forward to it and again thank you dr russo for your answer thank you you're welcome lonnie and i'll just chime in you know i see uh kind of three courses when people are tapering their opioids you know and there's a lot of overlap but there is uh the probably most common where someone is going very slowly and gradually as ethan described then there's the guy who i talked to today who i gave him this long you know very in-depth plan about how to titrate up the cannabis and come down on the opioids and you know i talked to him three months later and he says he just was so sick of those things he got rid of him you know he tapered for three days and then he stopped abruptly and he used more cannabis to deal with the withdrawal and he's been off him ever since and so thankful and then the third path which i i see a lot also is there's a rapid taper that happens at first say in the first week or two of of getting to a therapeutic dose of cannabis they're able to decrease their opioid dose by maybe 50 percent or more in the first couple weeks and then it's a more gradual taper after that and i think in those patients sometimes they might be getting a little frustrated like they had such good results at first and now it's a little more of a struggle for them to get down on the opioid dose and that would be a great opportunity for a lot of encouragement and reassurance that slow is a good way to do it you know you were blessed to have this rapid taper you know initially but let's just keep the slow steady up right now and on that note ethan thank you so much your time tonight was a gift to me personally and a gift to our whole community and your your constant mentoring of myself and all the other leaders in this field you you've just done so much for all of us you i don't think you'll ever know how many people you've helped so thank you so much and also thank you to everyone who's attended including many experts that didn't get to express their voice and just listened i'm just so flattered by this community and thank you to everyone who's uh electing to be a part of the solution uh the cannabis solution the uh the humanities solution uh thank you all and thanks to simone for moderating even without a microphone tonight this was so much fun we're going to do this more often especially during the covet shutdown so we hope to see you soon good night everyone", "ydZRyIeEvaM": "Hey it's Dustin in this video i'm going\nto be doing a cbd review on this PureKana 300 milligram mint cbd\ntincture so stick with me. Alright when it comes to cbd oil\nthere's three criteria that i want to judge it by and review it by and those\nare quality taste and price so obviously if we're\nreviewing a topical there's not going to be any taste so\nwe'll skip over that one so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to tell\nyou about the quality of this product and uh and i'm just going to give you a\nbrief overview we're going to talk about taste and price after that and then\nafter that we're going to go over the computer and i'm going to give you a lot\nmore nitpicky when it comes to quality we're going to look at the coa\nwe're gonna look at uh everything that's in it when it comes\nto the different cannabinoids and i'll let you know if this is a quality cbd\noil more in depth at the end so be sure to\nstick to the end brief overview of quality this is a quality product if\nyou're just like hey has a quality product or isn't it\nyes it is and the reason i say that is because um i've looked they sourced\ntheir hemp from kentucky decent place to do it i think uh oregon\nand central oregon specifically it's better to do that because we're on\nthe 45th parallel and so the light cycle is much more natural to grow hemp\nanyway that's a different story it's a little bit longer story if you're\nlooking for the best hemp i'm going to argue it comes from central\noregon they do it in kentucky and that's just fine they if you look at\nthe color of this product you'll notice that it's almost\nclear it's almost see-through it's a little bit golden\nin color and so that tells me that they're not using crude oil they're\nusing distillate so when you extract hemp the oil out of\nhemp it's going to first of all be a dark almost black very gummy crude oil\nand i i believe since this is so light in color they're not using\ncrude oil they're taking it to the next level through distillation\nso it's a lot more refined and so as a result\nthis product is not going to taste very heavy so i'm going to taste real quick\nand it has a good taste this is mint flavor\nand really it's got a refreshing taste you put put it in there you're not\ntasting very much hemp and you're tasting a mint\nflavor and so as far as taste goes it tastes really great\nin fact our product at green method farms we also have a mint product and\nthese basically taste identical let's go into price real quick\nuh we i have it pulled up right here on my computer this 300 milligram bottle\nwhich i bought you can get for 54. if you want to\nupgrade to the thousand milligram bottle which\nis kind of where people usually are at it's going to cost you 139\nand green method farms our product we offer a thousand milligram\nfor 45 on our website greenmethodfarms.com you can check the\nlink below if you want to look more into that\nanyway so these two products here if you got a thousand milligram purcha or the\nthousand milligram green method farms very similar uh in quality\nand very similar in taste this one's going to cost you 139 bucks this one is\ngoing to cost you 45 bucks so way cheaper and so anyway that's kind of\nthe review when it comes to quality taste in price now let's go to\nthe computer and i'll show you a little bit more in depth\nwhen it comes to quality and i'll be able to show you a little bit more\nuh the nitpicky when it comes to cannabinoids because here's something\nthat you need to understand um when it comes to the cannabinoids\nwhen it comes to cbd oils cbd is great right we know that it helps\nwith inflammation and with many other things but one of\nthe ways that the hemp plant and cbd oil that's extracted from\nthe ham plant works the best is through something called the\nentourage effect that means when your oil contains the minor cannabinoids so\nof course it has the major cannabinoid which is\ncbd when it has other minor cannabinoids in there like\ncbn uh cbc cbg those are the those are the big ones but\nthere's also other ones in there when it when your oil contains those as well it\nall works together better than if it was just a cbd product\ncoming from a cbd isolate or something like that where there's nothing else in\nit but cbd so if you have the choice\nbetween a cbd isolate product which has nothing but cbd in it or a cbd product\nthat also has the minor cannabinoids in it you're going to want the miter\ncannabinoids so let's go to the computer and we'll take a look at the coa the\ncertificate of analysis and we'll dissect that and we'll\nactually do a side by side comparison to green method farms versus\npure canna because this is kind of the benchmark because i'm the one doing the\nvideos and i'm the one that grew the hemp and i'm the one that extracted the\nham from the one that created this product\nso i will do a side by side i'm doing comparisons and i'm gonna be i'm gonna\nbe completely honest about it there are some cbds out there cbd\nproducts that are absolute crap they're scam\ndon't buy them uh purecam is not one of those this is a good product\nit's an expensive product but it's a good product so let's go to the computer\ni'll show you what i'm talking about okay so here we are on purecanna's\nwebsite and this is the page for their 1 000 milligram uh\ncbd tincture as you can see it's 139 dollars\ni'm gonna go over to our website real quick and i'm going to show you that the\n100 000 milligram full spectrum cbd oil tincture basically\nthe same thing 45 so let's go over to um their coa we'll talk a little bit\nmore about quality so this is the pure canna coa on their\nthousand milligram uh cbd tincture and you're gonna be able\nto notice here they have 30 39.4 so um\nyeah 39 milligrams per gram of cbd so you can see here on the graph\nthat's mostly what this bottle contains there is\na little bit .06 milligrams per gram of cbc\nso that's a minor cannabinoid there's point three\non well actually this is part of cbd product so never mind on that\num and then uh cbl point zero eight cbn point zero\neight milligrams per gram so very small amounts\nand then uh thc point seven milligrams per gram so a little bit more\non the thc side i wanted to point out that when it\ncomes to cvg it doesn't even register so there's no\ncbg in this let's go real quick to green method farms and\nwe'll do a side-by-side comparison okay so here's the certificate of\nanalysis for green method farms 1000 milligram cbd tincture again this is 45\ndollars if you want to order it at greenmethodfarms.com\num and we'll just look at the graph here because this points out the major and\nminor cannabinoids so we'll go to the big one first\ncbd it's got nearly 31 milligrams per gram\nso of course that's going to be the highest cannabinoid in the cbd oil but\nlet's look at the minor cannabinoids as well\nif you look at the delta 9 thc it is 1.2 milligrams per gram which is going to be\nhigher but if you look at the percentage it is\n0.12 so the legal limit of thc\nin the united states is 0.3 of a percent so we are\nwell we're almost one-third of uh below the legal limit so um\nit's basically a tenth of a percent of thc in this but thc is actually good\nfor you so i mean it's not a bad thing i'm just letting you know that it's\nbelow the legal limit but there is some thc\nin it and there is some thc in the uh purecanna\nversion as well it says full spectrum oil so going\ndown to let's see here um cbg we have a point two\nmilligrams per gram so um cbg at pure canada didn't even register so you're\ngetting more cbg in this and then um that's cbga just regular cbg\nis going to be one uh milligram per gram so\nway more uh cbg than the pure canna and then cbc\nis also a 1.1 milligram per gram so anyway the minor cannabinoids are\nhigher they're more concentrated in the green method farm so again my\nopinion this is going to go this is going to be because of the\nquality of the genetics the farming and the extraction uh process so let me\ntell you real quick what i mean by that so\npurecanna is sourced by farms in kentucky kentucky is on the 36th\nparallel and that's significant because the closer the 45th parallel\nthe better um in on our farm in central oregon we actually are on the\n45th parallel the reason this makes a difference is because of the light\ncycle the summer solstice around june 20th it's an 18\nhour to six hour light to darkness ratio and so when the days become shorter the\nplant the hemp plant decides hey the day's getting shorter it's time\nfor me to start flowering and that's when they produce the most oil so\nin central oregon you're getting a really dry climate which is great\nbecause you can rake it's got you know lots of sun the light cycle is great you\ncan regulate as much water and nutrients as you want\nthrough the drip line and so that's the reason i'm a little bit biased but i\nreally do believe that central oregon is a superior place\nto grow hemp compared to other places like kentucky\nbecause of the dryness of the climate and it being on the 45th parallel\nthe other thing that i want to mention is that uh\npurecanna uses a co2 extraction method where green method farms uses an ethanol\nextraction method now you probably don't know chances are\nyou probably don't know a ton about extraction this might not\nmake a big difference to you in our experience\nco2 extraction produces a real gummy and not as high quality of a crude oil\nand as a result it takes more through distillation to be able to have\na good product and i think that that might be either the genetics or it's the\ndistillation is the reason that the pure canna\nproduct has less of the minor cannabinoids\nin green method farms we use an ethanol extraction\nand in our experience ethanol extraction is a lot more clean of an extraction\nwe take our uh extraction to crude oil and then we water wash it which removes\na lot of the impurities such as fats and lipids and sugars and those kind of\nthings so that you're actually left with a pretty good\nclean crude oil and since that crude oil is clean to begin with when we take it\nthrough distillation it's just an easier process and i think\nthat you're left with more minor cannabinoids as a result so that\nis in my opinion starting with better genetics but also\nending with a more pure uh product cbd product that goes through\nthe distillation process they don't have to refine and pull out as much of the\nstep the cannabinoids like cbc\ncbn cbg as they do with pure canada so anyway both\nproducts i'm going to say are great um you're not going to have any problems\nwith the pure canada product i'm just saying and i'm a little bit biased\nbecause i'm the one doing it but i have spent\nthe entire process from farming through extraction to bottling\nand formulation so maybe you're wondering why are we selling our product\nfor way less when we could be selling it you\nknow if it's the same product as pure canada we could be selling it for 140\nwe've got two reasons for that one because we can we're a small family farm\nwe have 10 acres and uh and so we extract enough oil to\nbe able to produce enough oil to extract at our extraction\nfacility which i work for so we get a deal on that so\nbasically our overhead is just it's just not\nvery high we could charge 140 bucks for this product\num but we've decided that we don't need to\nand because we really believe in the medicine we want to be able to get that\nout there as to as many people as possible and not you know have to\ncharge the 140 so anyway if uh if you're interested in\nbuying cbd oil cp oil tincture i'm definitely going to say buy it from\nus because you're going to get a great product for a fraction of the\nprice if you want to spend 140 bucks this is a\ngreat product go ahead and do it pure canada\ni highly recommend them i mean this is a great product it's just expensive\nso if you want to get the same thing maybe even a little bit better of a\nproduct because of the extraction methods\nbecause of the genetics that we started with green method farms is the way to go\ngo ahead and click the link below to purchase uh 45\nfor a thousand milligram cbd tincture and charge 75 for the 2000 milligram\ntincture so still you're getting double the cbd and it's still significantly\nless than the thousand milligram here so\neither one that you want it's gonna be a high quality product we\nstand by it there's a 30 day money back guarantee if you're not satisfied with\nit and so if you have any questions about\nanything concerning cbd oil how

and clarified it considerably and i'm just going to run it again through another 2.5 micron filter just to make sure that everything is out of there the 2.5 micron filter on the left was the first run and the 2.5 micron filter on the right was the second run so we've now filtered out pretty much all of the stuff that can be filtered out and now we're ready to go to the boiler to recover the ethanol and here's our nice clear fluid ready for ethanol recovery and extract concentration what we're looking for here is a rolling boil like this okay we don't want it going much higher than that and we don't want it going lower than that we want a rolling boil we're running about minus 19 inches of mercury and that's that's a good place to run note that the ethanol is now moving from collector 1 to collector jar 2 and down here where we look at the exhaust we don't see any evidence of any pass-through here we have three liters of recovered alcohol this is the reduced extract there is still a significant amount of alcohol in here but we're going to evaporate this part off the atmosphere in order to condense down to the final extract and here's the final extract and you can see the viscosity by the drip we've taken the recovered alcohol and put it in the freezer along with the biomass and we're getting ready for the second wash so we're cooling everything down for the second wash you can see it's got a bit more greenish tinge to it we're going to put it back in the freezer and then we're going to winterize and filter it before we run the final concentration it is now being sucked up through the filter base here's the second wash concentrate we're evaporating off the remainder of the alcohol and then we will gather up our final concentrate and here's the second wash final concentrate it's a little bit darker but it's not bad you", "Re1VZwJavR8": "today really just I was about to do a distillation for meditation over the next couple weeks and thought I would try and do a better video than some that I have posted trying to go through the process a little bit at least with what I do you know this mayor cannot be right or wrong he's given the equipment that I have so one thing I wanted to talk about here was the difference in Chinese glass box or glass I guess that's one thing that was passed in one of my other videos and they mentioned that there was an article mentioning toxins in the glass now personally I've been smoking for probably 20 years or more this is something I've never heard of I've used bikes from the cheapest finished glass you know two bucks at the convenience store to the more expensive types of pipes like 80 90 bucks a head for just a basic plate you know I could see a difference a lot of it I've never heard of the toxins I've never read about we seen anybody to mention it in the article that I didn't read about it it was like somebody who you know I'd say they probably had an idea but it also didn't apply to laboratory glassware they were speaking specifically at players now I don't know about toxins but one thing what I do know about the Chinese glass for the office was causing problems but stuff like this work comes down to his tolerances and inconsistencies in the glass like you're gonna have you know the glass is not going to be you don't want thickness it may not be the best quality of borosilicate either it's they probably use something cheaper but if you use the types of soft glass mention in the article in this type of application the heat would absolutely destroy it so the other problem we've got with the Chinese type of glass are these ground joints here where they may not may not make a perfect steel you know you'll never really see it unless it's really really bad but if it can't make a perfect ceiling here you're gonna end up with say maybe this is just a little bit longer than it should be so the tolerances will be will be different they'll be way out a lot more than what you would see and say american-made glassware they're tall matches are gonna be really really close so that's one that's one of the issues were running to there and what happens when like this is too long or especially too short as this heats up you know it expands and then this joint will actually it'll fall in just slightly and as it cools down it'll grab that and it basically you know prevents that swipe from ever coming out again that's where you went into less of those problems with american-made glass also there's there's the the sealing ability here now you always need to use vacuum grease on these but with a really good quality Canadian or American made glass from a reputable company you would find that you could get a vacuum seal without using any grease or additional stuff in there but that would not be good because again you'd go back to welding your joints together and things like that so you always want to use a greasing so that being said this is just the quote-unquote cheap distillation unit you know it's not it's made by some offshore company so it does the trick but it could be better like I'm pretty sure I run into packing leaks and things like that there's no insulation around globe flasks and other such things like that where you see improvements like that on the American stuff also your electronics in here these are very cheap electronics so it doesn't have the accuracy in temperature it does about the same plate control that something better would happen where this just controls the temperature by a thermal probe and basically turning the heating on and on and off repeatedly you know to maintain a temperature a more professional unit will use wattage control where it'll actually just adjust [Music] the amount of current going into the heating element instead of turning on and off it's actually regulating regulating the current that's feeding it so that you have a more accurate more steady temperature so not all being said now I would like to get this [Music] I just like to every night at the back you pump right [Music] and I've reached over my shoulder down to zero so I [Music] another thing I wanted to talk about here is the back in Greece I started off using this Dow Corning's but the person I think it's garbage it's thick it's it's sold us back in Greece but it seems to leak through the joints no matter how little I use or doesn't create a perfect seal if I don't use just the perfect amount you don't need a lot anyway what I've started using here is krytox GPL 207 which it's a little thinner it's not marketed as back in Greece but it's a parent induct and a fighter temperature resistance so when you're using this stuff you really don't need a lot a little little dab on there just a little dab will be it's hard to do with one hand and then so on your joint you would just apply a little bit of that is down the edge there just like that even that looks like quite a bit there I don't like to come all the way down to the bottom on this piece just because this doesn't see a lot of the heat and I you know I don't like the trip to seep into the joiner end up running past now but how do you pull the vacuum this will thin out it'll really in the filament will pull into the rest of the joint you do have to make sure to actually put enough on there though otherwise you'll still end up with joints that are hard during just put a little bit on there like that and you stick that in the joint you just spin it back and forth until you get a nice clear joint seal showing that like it's easier to spend titles so here's how to properly grease the join now I've got a nice thin little coating on that side that side put it in there carefully just minutes with the devil corny grease it tends to make the joint nice and clear I've noticed with the cry box it doesn't clarify it as much they just spin it there and you shouldn't feel any any glass grinding together get you just feel smooth all the way around that's nice and snug and stay longer I'm actually gonna clean house and as is your joint don't forget to put a cat clip on it there should be plenty enough grease one thing to take note up here do not forget your [ __ ] stir bar because I do this just about every time and I have to take this out plop it in there and we grease that joint make sure you put your spare bar in there every time I'm about ready to get this started now I get my cold trap cold and for anybody wondering what the purpose of this bowl here is the goal trap will collect any of the vapors and they'll drip down into this blast now the extra cold will help also condensed extra [Music] boiling installing cycling so with everything hooked up greased up everything's cold vacuums been running for a while and gotta like glasses together so the first thing I'm gonna do is run it back to you and don't worry about that little dog this is the flash don't fly called a joke this I mean it will cause some certain problems as it will also try to boil and want to vaporize compounds that are still in it but that's already distillate so this should be pretty negligible and yes I should have taken the time to clean that better but the other two that will collect everything are clean much better and as this is just for personal use I'm okay with this yeah I'm not too concerned about that right there so the first thing we're gonna end up doing here is turn on a vacuum gauge also this PVC pipe isn't hooked up that was an experiment before I was going to run in public that PVC is just not the way to go it off gases and a week too and it just there's there's too many points of leakage so it's just not word that maybe some Dale gold stainless steel but right now that's just not you know it's it's not in the foreseeable future so I'm just using the government roses and then [ __ ] everything up or whatever I need at the time the vacuum regulator just hooked up because for other purposes if you did that great out of the way out of the back and pump through the table into the vacuum regulator - bull trout so whenever I need to use anything else I just I just unscrew that fitting there screwing whatever appropriate fitting I need so right now for for the distillation I'm just going to do turn it on and set it to pull back in because we don't need any regulation here it's probably isn't the greatest pump but I'll worry about these problems a little bit later down the road for us to change the oil I just changed out while the singular form works next another the dryers as well [Music] smells pretty clear to you this is just a reservoir [ __ ] chambers in here so question they tell you almost impossible through here [Music] missiles you gotta be careful in your film because we have company [Music] so just be wary about it got one of these pumps right now I'm just pulling you back c'mon I'm gonna let that pull down as low as it'll go before I even start heating it up as you can see is kind of slow with this welcome other part of this problem is my lines could be dirty so you know there's terpenes and stuff collected absorbed into the lines and they're gonna be vaporizing and off-gassing as well so that's another thing that'll affect your vacuum level another thing that I'm aware of and we'll try to address in the future see what I can do about that so I'm aware of some of the problems that I have here another one should be this should be robbers I guess in some tip while I'm not really sure what I should wrap it with I'm going out there how quickly you're done oh yeah but how does of great now like when this is running this is just acting as a condenser as well I'm going I did try packing the head with stainless steel steel wool I wasn't really sure how much of there's also the condensation that bill here which is an issue running degrees so that's another thing they're going to take care of possibly wrap that up so there's there's key things that I'm aware of that I need to fix that could improve the distillation overall we'll see how long this takes it's just about one o'clock in the afternoon I'm hoping to get started here by one o'clock and see how long it takes to get through this whole process thing so right now we're sitting at 1,200 with this particular batch I have done more filtering on this than dispatches okay I kept filtering it through stage one and full of a stop boat that I really freeze up to 24 hours again we filtered it through stage one and I kept doing that if there was nothing coming through in stage one there are nothing getting left behind the filters to stage one which I wasn't doing previously and I probably should have been actually I definitely should have been alive and I repeated that through stage two and stage three as well so what's in here is has been more filter than anything that I put in previously so I'm curious to see what kind of an effect last thing you have going with this with this current class of distillation and what's in there right now is just to put exactly 1,000 grams fully winterized and filtered plenty of oil they you know make thanks to a closed loop system actually made to a terminator style system so here we are at 9:20 so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna let that just sit for a while without backing pull-down we'll come back when that's that's not a star I've been holding steady at 860 for a while got a pretty good boil there I mean realistically I'd like to see it not boiling but someone's car cleaning it up now [Applause] I'm gonna heat up to 50 degrees you're running before I start turning on the starboard point of advice if you want your driving school last a little longer one thing that makes a good seal not let any moisture in there because it hit moisture freezes and then encouraged to do a block of dry ice to do is just stuff it all blankets or towels or whatever in this remove all the air space that you tend from the dry place and this will last the cooler I'll have this pool of dry ice in a couple of days and I constantly use it topping this thing off making sure it stays cold that's the process for now it's just going to be one once it hits 50 degrees start going up by 30 degrees so then I'll heat it up as soon as it is 50 I'll ramp it up to 80 and then from 80 I'll go to 110 and so on and so forth like that usually once I get to about 180 I've seen a bit of reaction from water and other call the files and stuff up here and ahead so I will hold it there at that temperature for a while we'll let that stuff collect into the ship blast so I haven't had a bit of an opportunity here and I see we have boiled up a little bit [Music] but it's not 60 degrees right now all should be 56 overshot that's already pointing system so at this point now since it's not Ronnie Emma on the skewer because we see over there 1,050 [Music] the pressures come up because the vapors in here well this is the first time ever you do this to me only goes so fast that we're gonna stop [Music] except this 286 the other thing too is this is a PID so it's gonna learn it know if I want to get to 50 I'm gonna end up going up to 80 anyway so I guess it's kind of learning that it came to order shoot the temperature a little bit stupid [ __ ] but this is where your this is the difference between your basic PID and something that actually controls the wattage right now I'm pretty sure that's just collecting water and ethanol but only mostly ethanol what was left after the evaporation process the reclamation so this unfortunately won't be reclaimed it will just be thrown out I just about at 180 now pretty vigorous reaction going on I'm honestly not sure if it's supposed to happen what this right now this isn't anything good this is just the about earlier least I think it is anyway so in this pointing I've been told these puffs of smoke are not good [Music] I can't remember the reason why and I'm not running entirely correctly with myself can leave your song [Music] so I will just hold this here for a little until this reaction stops basically distilled all out just got pure stuff here over the right now we're in 860 so it's been just about an hour come up to this temperature get here of course that our like it's gone up to a Nazi 1200 [Music] gen-i smoking stuck there too Nessa's tough innings of is out there the bus now if I had a secondary cold trap on there I'm sure so I know this server stuff didn't like - all this hold America last one during about ten minutes later you're taking the reaction up here stock for the most part I stopped collecting stuff as a pastor [Music] [Applause] start turning because this would take a while [Music] hormone when this to exchange so slope is still down at 790 microns now [Music] about 220 now and [Music] after twenty twelve hundred microns was lower I was starting to see a little bit reaction here so I've set the temperature up to 230 and I want to stop it when I start having a reaction here 46 degrees at the head I'm going to junk this is starting to get a little bit more yellow kind of a bit a little bit thicker oh I also set this up once this hit [Music] so probably by the time this event of 225 or 220 6w3 in addition to 25 right now with 154 point two degrees and temperature dropping at the head well 50 micron 2-minute 86\u00b0 I'm actually going to hold that right there that is now 240 in the afternoon when I started this about one o'clock from here I am our 40 minutes in see this is running by the Chinese stuff that's gonna overshoot the temperature not measuring correctly as to why to swing hysteresis I only seen a really big clean reflux rate in this setup once or twice I mean no one wants your twice but I mean just to replicate it every time I probably turn around run for a bit michalak [Music] so it's 3:45 started except one I had the temperature such as a little too either to 35 and it's kind of boiling over but it has gotten to the fraction looking for I think it looks pretty good the most part yeah some kind of something's showing up I'm not sure what it was but so far this looks pretty good here another got this stuff coming down before coming down it was little green colors like this because he [Music] I'm so willing to do now is I'll rotate this over and begin collecting this fraction and collected in this separate jar here yeah rotated cow turn the temperature down 230 actually keep this one 2:33 instead so collecting distraction I think I have noticed that I've got I mean you see it down there very well little bubbles right there in my class I'm sure how they came about or where they came from [Music] I believe this is the hearts hearts fraction I wanna say but I don't know also not really sure with those little bubbles I run I think it's just an air bubbles I want to save all this I hope it is it looks like it is [Music] I'm sure this looks like animals [Music] and there's old that's collected someone that will be I guess wildest one and then I put this stuff into it our container later right after all the same process I gotta collect all the garbage and let it sit this fraction that off [Music] [Applause] and so far so far just looking like the nicest distillate I've produced out of this which I attribute to the extra filtration that I'm wrong see how it looks on collects an alert so while 280 degrees when we got eleven fifty microns not ideal I was able to pull a lower vacuum on this and the temperature would be much lower than the same results right now it's five o'clock now so that's been going for about four hours a couple hours since I actually started to cover it it's another nine hundred and sixty microns now we're degrees up in the head to put it 32-bit 50:33 it seemed to be working pretty well so bit of oil over but in the most part I guess it's working okay this what's already here there was at some point there's a little white cloudy [ __ ] showing up I'm not really sure what it was but it's not there now it's not showing I'm done here this in a second distillation with help I'm not sure what that [ __ ] is it keeps showing up in here I have never shown like one of my other videos I'm not really sure how it started why it started it's not something that I've always seen and quite frankly and really saw in flesh and doing all the filtration so that's what confuses me the more but I don't see anything down here and now right from there we are a couple hundred grands who goes [Music] this is actually pretty clear the stuff that you see in there there's a lot of air bubbles it's hard to see on camera but you know what right there right there a little I feel swirl thing that's that murky [ __ ] that I was we play those bongos across there down from the top goes over there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that seems like a lot but I eat about five or six grams probably about 10 grand you're just eating this [Music] 20 up there 6 evening now and I'm pretty much just gonna wrap this up on you there's a bit left in there I'm sure there's a lot I could collect still I don't feel like letting it run all night it's director slow down and get a lot of character so [Music] Kangra doesn't really show it too well there's there's a lot of stuff on the outside of the glass that's showing up in here there's some air bubbles and what's dirtier than it really is but it's not it's not that very this however this does look a little bit cleaner still less air bubbles it's a higher heat yeah I did turn this up specifically so I would get a higher boiling right but even now I can see it's starting to slow down there somewhat so it's about at this point I'm just going to shut it off here and we got we're at 10:50 so I find pretty disappointing a lot of times that dullness I've been able to achieve a lot lower results in fact a couple of times by this point I've been down to probably 200 or less microns so I've definitely got some issues here and I'm welcome some of these got some suggestions or nonsensical help me out I call that some people suggestions and done what I hadn't but at this point I'm not sure just too much too much more I can this is certainly clogged up you got a goblin come down there you want some [ __ ] that's one thing that having problems with usually that starts happening at the beginning it causes trouble the whole way through but when that plugs up the boiling air stops I'm going to give it a little bit water - for sure color week too low 6:30 6:40 [Music] now you can see where it blocks where it becomes plugged and stops the boiling across it's still going there's not a click still a bit in there I'm just a little pressed for time this evening unfortunately so [Music] well I do when I shut this down I just turn the temperature way and just back down to zero and I'll let this cool down under packaging all still running because if I unplug this right now if I disconnect a vacuum right now this will fill up with smoke I don't really like doing that I don't like it and smoke in there it's all about you're in a while to cool down and then disconnect all files and applause playing out with the next and four blasts into the jars did you make a medicine so I just released a vacuum on that bye I loosened up this time I just kind of pulled it that'll do with support so I want to collect that stuff my trusty heatgun here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when you're cool enough heat gun to mine has a cool setting [Music] any rate when you pull off your heat gun you're always going to want to put it up like that will maintain the light to your heat gun and be less dangerous because unless the heat escape up inside that's just a this is a little FYI I'm gonna turn the pump in here there we go we'll call now today I said I'll just pull these once it's out here like so and before I have to you know wipe up the grease inside there and we have I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna try and you know I'm not gonna be anything I'm sure I could have better results I just don't know how I would love to have better results perhaps I would be able to consume less of it on a daily basis but for the time being it is what it is this is pretty much what I did it looks pretty golden and nice when you look at it you know in a syringe or in a little on a little jar something like that piece of glass until the drunk did it take in there like I said I'll recycle that that plainly stuff in the bottom yeah I love your backs and that's kind of stuck but you know it can be recycled it's gonna be cracked and so I just don't like waste and if I can waste as little as possible I will should we got that up I'll set that to uh turn off for about you meter the condenser so I'll take that part this is some little and that's it for today that's just from that distillation thanks for watching everybody", "rGQ_XVfLE68": "what's up thank you so much the usda uh hemp rule was blowing up and so i decided to do another one of these because if you haven't watched that one you should and at the end of it i said well what happened to the wall in processing hemp extract i've abbreviated that as w-i-p-h-e and that's what we're going to be discussing on today's live episode of thanks so much for dropping in my name is tom i'm a lawyer with the collateral base and if you want to follow me on instagram you can you can just find cannabis industry lawyer on ig and follow me there today we are going to be discussing more about the usda final hemp rule we did a usda final hemp rule video last week was quite popular and so was our delta eight thc and its legality and the vape cartridge ban that arose from the omnibus bill that donald trump signed a couple days after christmas so until march 27th you can buy vapes and products in the mail after that you're probably not going to see them so today we're going to discuss the wall in processing hemp extract because as you know the usda's rule did an excellent job of saying that you can have up to a one percent uh total thc amount and then that would that would keep you from being negligent if you test that you may now remediate it and so you can add it to other hemp biomass and chip it together so that that total plant tests a thc a compliant of the 0.3 percent and then that biomass where's where's bio mask and earmarked for it's not primable smokable flour no it's not going to become delta 8 moon rocks it it will become a an extract a cbd extract it's going to be thrown into an extractor so if you are tuning in and you have hemp extraction give yourself a thumbs up and click subscribe because on wednesdays and sundays we do cannabis legalization news yesterday i believe yeah we had a great show with nano emulsions we have our wednesday that's our business show and then on sundays we have activism so we're going to try to get some more of the people that were pardoned by uh president trump on his way out to discuss about why nobody should be arrested for cannabis let's get back to how the uh agricultural marketing service which the usda final rules that abbreviates as ams how they addressed and approached the wall in processing hemp extract conundrum because if now you're able to remediate this hemp and turn it into biomass it's going to the extractor the extractor is going to have ethanol or super probably ethanol with the volume that they're at uh and that is going to create a winterized crude eventually and that crude is not going to be thc compliant in the sense that as you strip out the the biomass and the moisture that's in there you concentrate the percentages of thc and so a terrible ifr that's an interim final rule came out by the dea last august and that kind of casted dispersions regarding the legality of hemp extraction which of course is ridiculous and then i was hoping that we would have something in the final rule to discuss about that and we kind of do if you dig to the final rule down to page 181 and then you zoom in because you're trying to you know make sure that people that are reading this at home can follow along let's see here the ams response to the 2018 farm bill directed the usda to establish a national regulatory framework for hemp production in the u.s and the final rule outlines provisions for this mandate the ifr and this final rule do not cover hemp or its products beyond production period further dea has issued regulation covering some some of these products or in-process materials and then they footnote down here oops i have already cued this up and i've zoomed in much better on it nope ah they override uh that is bad coding on the policy of the um department there because now when i click back it's going to go all the way back to page one this is what it clicks out to let's hit forward that's terrible and this is the dea publication that came out like i was mentioning earlier august in 2020 and that dea publication then discusses uh how they're supposed to be treating this hemp extract and i had it queued up before i screwed that up extract there you go it does appear 22 times and they kind of punt on this as well and they point over to the fda and that fda regulations that should be coming out into the future and then they link out to the fda here it is this is the one that i was looking for this interim final rule amends the definition of marijuana extract and then they get into it this revised definition now includes the 0.3 percent thc limit for the extract meaning hemp derived extracts containing less than 0.3 uh thc are also decontrolled along with the plant is itself as discussed previously production of the hemp and its extracts defined under the aia now falls under the same regulatory authority and shared between the states of tribal territories and the usda now look that's a little interesting because it says extracts right there and then uh in the final rule the the usda actually punted on that issue because they said oh the dea has the information they link to this page and then the d and they also made this this fleeting thing that the fda also has some so the fda also has regulatory oversight over these compounds and then they link out on that to this uh fda thing which is from the last administration so that's going to be interesting because this one's from december of 2018 by scott gottlieb who is the um the acting administrator i believe the the dea and it basically says that uh it's illegal to advertise them in a dishonest way like you can't make any specific benefits and any specific treatments but people already knew that and then it also says that there is no generally regarded as safe for cbd yet both of them contemplate this other thing that's going to be by the fda so no there's no new answers on the wall in processing hemp extract and not only is there new new answers there's a punting and then that punting has a link to a dea article which is then another punting and they also then ensnare the fda which still hasn't published its rules and now there's been a changing of the guard at the fda so who knows how long this is going to take uh the important thing is that nobody who's currently processing hemp i think recently correct me if i'm wrong in the comments uh has gotten anything shut down from the dea yet i haven't heard of any and i'm pretty sure if it happened somebody would tell me pretty darn sure okay so there's a few other things in the new uh dea not dea usda final rule for hemp production that we should mention prior to wrapping this one up as well and that has to do with the amount of testing that they're doing and so now they had a dea requirement which is still there but that dea requirement is effectively being continued until 2023 to allow the dea to get its affairs in order to have enough registered labs and uh that 30 day it used to be a 15-day harvest window and that was changed and now it's going to be a 30-day harvest window but that again that doesn't come into play until the dea is then going to be testing on that and that doesn't appear to be a case until 2023 so however your state is currently testing the hemp will continue to be how your state will continually continue to test the hemp for 2021 2022 and then i believe there might be some movement on this or at least there would be a a new farm bill or ron rand rand senator rand paul's one percent thc may have passed the senate and we all hope that it does other than that there was some very interesting which i didn't really understand much testing flexibility that they reported on and so like what does that 0.3 percent mean and how should it be tested to determine if it is compliant or not like should you test the most strong part of the issue the the material by the dry weight or should you test everything uh it was pretty interesting all in all the the usda's final rule on hemp is an improvement but it still has this gray area about that wall and processing hemp and how cbd is going to be regulated by the fda the dea clearly has no authority when it comes to the production of the uh of the hemp the problem with the uh dea's interim final rule that came out in um august 20th of 2020 is is right here and it says you know as a result a cannabis derivative extract or product that exceeds point three percent uh delta nine thc is a schedule one controlled substance even if the planet was derived from was hemp you know point three delta nine on a thc on a dry weight basis and so that's essentially kind of directed maybe at the wall in processing hemp extracts issue where uh you're processing it and it goes over that now we can make the argument that that's not fair to test it you tested it when it was harvested uh the dea has now been satisfied it's compliant hemp like you knew that compliant hemp went in uh you have no basis to think that anything would be wrong and then of course you could also argue that it's not done yet and then that would be that um that argument that was like how do you test this substance and so they were talking about like you know you could kind of do these flexibility type tests and so if you're testing a winterized crew that's not a product it's it's not i don't know nobody's unless there's people that are out there retailing winterized crude and there might be um it's not fair to test it at that particular juncture we still don't have that information anyway uh hopefully you guys are

Georgia I will now turn the presentation over to him welcome sir good afternoon thank you for that introduction I appreciate it and welcome to all of you this is lull in Saudia I'm the CEO of thought process and today I want to talk about supercritical fluid extraction in particular but in general cannabis extraction we'll start off with a background on thought and course experience in supercritical the different extraction techniques that are out there and we'll follow up with issues related with scale and scale up supercritical both on the extraction side and also on the purification side but those who do not know what's supercritical is you'll see a slide on the right-hand side and at the extreme right you will see a point which says a critical point as long as you operate out the critical pressure and the critical temperature you're in the supercritical region that is what we are working with here now if you look at the horizontal line at the critical point as long as you are above this point and horizontally you can decrease the pressure you can increase the temperature you can play with all of these parameters to get the right extraction conditions you need or the process you're trying to do now at the very end I'll summarize with all the lessons that we have learned today so to give you back the history of supercritical here in 1982 we started a company called super X we were the first supercritical company in the whole world so you can see the background we have been doing this for the last 35 years in Super X we developed instrumentation specifically focused on extraction and chromatography we launched the first capillary SFC in the world and ultimately the company was sold to Isco in 1990 I started far in 1990 in 1990 we started working on various equipment for supercritical but not the analytical site we made pilot plant and production scale onwards you know we went on to spin out number of divisions from tar and we started building large-scale systems and we have built over 20 production scale I'm talking about 500 liter thousand liter systems in the last ten years between 2007 and 2010 we have done a number of different things we built a prep scale SFC on words build the largest act colonists have seen in the world we built a counter-current column going up to 30 feet long where he can do separations instead of using a chromatographic separation we can use a counter-current separation then in 2011 we built a large facility at the back of our building that we are located today it is a 25,000 GMP facility where we extract astaxanthin which is a antioxidant from algae called America blue Wallis and late last year we doubled that capacity so right now we are one of the largest if not the largest algae producing company in the world over here algae extract essay using supercritical fluids the extraction pressure is fairly large you're talking about 15,000 pounds of pressure so it's one of the highest extraction systems in the world onwards we have moved into also making chromatographic separation equipment which is HPLC and SFC we do both depending on the sample and we have built a 600 mm which is a 24 an inch ID column three of them for a pharmaceutical company overseas so we have a strong background in both extraction and chromatographic separations the mission of thought process is to be a global leader in supercritical fluid technology and equipment by providing solutions involving involving chemistry design process development and optimization we take our customers from concept through commercialization our competitive advantage in this critical area we are the most experienced supercritical only company we have been doing this for the last 35 years we didn't start this a few years ago when the medical marijuana extraction market came into force we have been doing supercritical long before people on green tea nology was fashionable from a design point of view we bring all the different process and equipment telic technologies together we manufacture our own equipment so we put things together which is optimized solutions based on the initial feasibility studies all the way through production and all systems as I mentioned earlier and major components are designed developed and assembled and one warranted by our process and this is all done out of Pittsburgh Sylvania lastly we are customer centered partnerships from proof of concept through commercialization or their production solution of choice so we are very customer friendly company so the examples of work that can be done with supercritical is you can do polymer purification you can remove solvents from synthetic DNA astaxanthin from algae you can do a less intense recovery of residual specialty oils extraction of spices flavors fragrance fragrances and any active ingredient from herbs in short if the wood oil is used we can probably extracted from the natural product besides extraction supercritical can be used for reactions impregnation scouting so there's a variety of applications that you can use it for and if you are trying to make specialty products using these cannabinoids you can use the impregnation technology to do it for any kind of applications you might have the what I'm going to start off today is talk about different extraction technologies there are really five of them out there you can do with ice water which is one of the oldest techniques where you take your cannabinoids you take your plant material grind it up put it in ice water and since THC and CBD and all the cannabinoids are heavier they settle down on the bottom it's a very simple process but the overall extraction efficiencies you can use hydro cam solvents like propane butane hexane these are all nonpolar solvents very similar to supercritical co2 but the disadvantage of these they are highly explosive so you have to have explosion proof requirements and there are a lot of regulate ratios and how much you can have these solvents at your building and you know constraints associated with that and that is a you know always a worry of explosion so you have to be a little careful about the other technique which is the RSO which is similar to the hydrocarbons but instead of using propane butane and xane you're using naphtha or isopropyl alcohol the process is still very similar the other extraction solvent which is becoming popular these days is ethanol ethanol is significantly more polar than co2 so the kind of compounds the selectivity is very different the ethanol is a very good solvent because it is physiologically compatible but again from a regulatory point of view there are restrictions on how much you can use so if you're trying to scale this it becomes a regulatory nightmare to handle methanol on a scale the last of course that we are talking about today is supercritical co2 and we believe supercritical co2 is great solvent and the question is why and if you look at the list here first we start with it's a zero global warming potential it's a zero ozone depletion potential physiologically compatible it's inexpensive and available everywhere you're talking about one hundred and fifty dollars a ton which is really inexpensive and the most important is he does not need any explosion proof requirements so you can almost put it up anywhere the other advantage of supercritical is by varying the temperature and pressure you can extract different things and by running a low temperature extraction you can get high selectivity but the negative of load Reiter extraction is that you have a high solvent to feed ratio so you have to run the co2 that you are using for now you know about a factor of 10 in the same overall extraction efficiency on the other hand you can increase the temperature so you can do high temperature and high pressure and you get a very high efficiency of extraction but the selectivity is low so you end up extracting things like waxes which you have to remove further and but overall the solvent to fade ratio is low which means you get high productivity so there is advantages and disadvantages of any of these things that you do you have to look at the pros and cons decide what is the right thing for you now in a typical process you can see the schematic on the left-hand side of the screen you have a pump where you can pressurize the vertical co2 and it goes you preheat it then it goes into the extraction vessel you extracted you depressurize it and you collect it in a separator and the co2 comes out and you recycle so the major components here are pumps vessels and separators these are the three major components that govern the scale of issues and you can get these vessels all the way down from you know one liter five liter to as much as 500 liters or larger depending on who you go to now when you come to sizing the important question you have here is how do you determine what size you need when you do scale up the first and foremost question that comes here is what is the solvent to fade ratio you do that trials on a lab scale 5 liter system and then determine what's the solvent to feed ratio the reason this is important is as I mentioned earlier I'm preacher and pressure play a major role in the extraction so if you are doing low temperatures you may need a solvent to repay ratio of e 120 and if you do high pressure and high temperature the to feed ratios so solvent to feed ratio controls your sizing so that's the first thing you need to know once you know solvent to feed ratio you define what is the capacity you're going for is it in kilos at a 100 kilos a day at Sun a day what is the capacity and based on the capacity and the solvent to feed ratio they'll get you a number which is the total amount of co2 that you need on a daily basis and the next question becomes once you have this number whether you're doing this in a 8 hour time frame or a 24 hour time frame you can calculate the pump flow rate so we start with the basic thing here pump flow rate defines your capacity it does not the vessel size which is what everybody thinks it is actually the pump flow rate if you have a small pump and you put a little and if you even double the size of the vessel it doesn't mean that your capacity has gone up because the capacity is controlled by what is the flow rate of the pot so that is the most critical thing from a scale a point of view is defining the pump flow rate which is a function of the solvent to feed ratio and the capacity that you need once you define the pump flow rate then you what you do is you design the vessel diameter and the vessel diameter is defined by the linear velocity of this flow rate inside the vessel if you have a very large vessel diameter and you have a very low linear velocity and if you have a very small vessel diameter you have a very high linear velocity if you have a run high linear velocity the herbs or the plant material will go to the other end of the vessel and get stuck potentially plugging it so you want to make sure you have an optimum and there are numbers that we use over here typically in the range of 20 feet per second so we use those to calculate what the vessel diameter should be once we do the vessel diameter we define the vessel size by determining the vessel length and that gives us the total diameter total volume of the vessel between e lastly this what I want to mention here is the subcritical co2 extraction which has high solvent afid ratios will force you to use a vessel which has a very large in diameter which obviously increases the cost because of the pressure while the supercritical extraction which is high-pressure high-temperature has much lower solvent to feed ratios so you come up with sizing for a large scale or on a scale of issue now I can show you some vessel equipment that are available in the marketplace the one on the left that you see typically a water's pro provides five liter systems to ten liter systems the one in the middle it's medium scale you can get them from apex and one on the right is a large scale system and this is 750 liter to vessel system so total of 1500 meters this one actually operates at 15,000 pounds of pressure that I talked to you earlier about and we extract astaxanthin so this is our system at our facility in Pittsburgh so you can get variety of sizes and you need to size them based on the previous slide that I showed and come up with the size that you need so again talking about scale up issues over here how do you calculate cost here's from our experience we say capital cost is y power X in other words if you had to double the size so Y is a factor of two and we power it to point six eight then the capital cost will go up by one point six so it's not linear it's not a logarithmic the power is typically powerup point six eight so every time you double the size you can assume the capital cost goes up by a factor of one point six typically the utility cost is a function of flow rate which largely remains the same on a per pound basis when you process it so you don't get much reduction by going a scale up maybe about three percent for every doubling of the flow rate so you don't get a substantial reduction on utility casting and finally you come to labor the unfortunate part of labor is labor remains the same whether use you use a five liter system or a hundred liter system or a thousand liter system so labor becomes the largest portion of your cost and as you scale up labor becomes a smaller portion of the overall overall cost so it's very critical for you if you want to drive the overall cost down to scale up and scale up to as large scale as possible the the other way to design your system is to have different configurations the basic system is you have one vessel and one pump and that simple straightforward you have a vessel a pump and a separator you are done that's what most people sell you can go from here and say how do I increase my Cassity you can have two vessels and one pump and while the first one is running you can load the second vessel vessel get it ready and get it moving and that will give you a 30% increase in capacity that's a typical number sometimes it's a little high sometimes it's a little low it all depends on what your total extraction time is shorter the extraction time greater effect it has longer the extraction time less effect it has so you can who from a one vessel to a two vessel system and all you are doing is adding a cost of a vessel and couple valves and that immediately increases your capacity by about thirty percent the next thing you can do is a see this configuration this is very interesting so what do you do what you have here is three vessels and two of them are connected in series and you have only one pump so the same pump that you used in the first two configurations you can use in the third one and this co2 will go from the first vessel to the second vessel and because you have two vessels in series you have the highest extraction efficiency in other words if the first in the second one gave you a 80% extraction efficiency for the same conditions problem you'll definitely get more than 80% it could be 85 it could be 90 it's a function of the application but it's the highest you can get and while the first two are running the third one is being unloaded cleaned and loaded back again so then then you switch and you take the second one out put the third one in front of the first one and you continue the process and you continue this every time so you will be able to get the same 30% as the previous one but your overall extraction efficiency will be higher and you'll come out with more material the material that you're looking for that's important and the other option here is you can have three vessels and two pumps actually and that will double the flow rate or you can have one pump with 2x the flow rate and you can get 2.6 X which is the highest extraction configuration from that point of view the last one is you can do a parallel configuration which is two vessels and two pumps which is literally double of the basic configuration that you see up there and that will get you to X the capacity but the only doesn't give you is the highest extraction efficiency which the serious configuration kills so you can play with these things depending on what your needs are and come up with the right configuration and the costing for each one is obviously very different the basic configuration and the parallel configuration are literally twice 2x and the capital cost will be 2x from that point of view and the most expensive is the three vessel one pump with two Explorer eight that will be the most expensive capital configuration but it also has the highest capacity so we use these different configurations to define what our scale-up are and what our configurations are to get to where we want to get you now the practicality is we believe that there's going to be market consolidation so far we have had a lot of people doing mom-and-pop operations with small systems as the market grows you will find that people with scale are going to win because labor is one of the largest portion of the overall costing which when we talked about in couple slides ago whether you have a 5-liter system or a hundred meter or a 500 liter system you need the same amount of labor so if you want to drive the overall costing down you reduce labor as a percentage and the only way to do that is by going scale now this has been shown to be true for other nutraceuticals and here are just three examples whether it's fish oil or Co Q 10 or astaxanthin in all of these things scale wins and people end up moving from small-scale systems to large-scale systems and we expect this to be the same even for the canvas industry now the question becomes the next question becomes is when you get to scale are we better off contracting or be better of doing tassels that's a function of scale like in so the question if I do have to repeat the question should everyone whom they're SFE or will be less expensive to send it out to LA scale processors now in the whole food industry especially in the cannabis right now we do not have major regulations because cannabis is not looked well upon by the FDA but as soon as the regulations change you can expect significant regulations coming down to follow cGMP requirements for the extraction and once you say you have cgmp requirements for your product you have a ton of quality control procedures that you need to fall typically you may have three to five people dedicated to follow this cGMP requirements and as a percentage if you have a small operations they become very very expensive it also requires you to have in-house expertise or all the different things whether you need a mechanical engineer to maintain the equipment a chemical engineer to run the process or quality control people analytical people and especially if you want to anything that says we need certification we need cGMP certification we need kosher certification halal certification organic certification all of this requires significant amount of paperwork which drives the Casta should say kosta so what are our options our options are threefold right so you can have a co-op style for ethanol exchange the extractions of corn oil and canola oil you can see a number of farmers join together and they built their facility and that facility ran that on to extract the oil or canola to the oil you can do the same thing and we expect some of these to happen in the industry the other thing we also see is people will bring in while units will bring them to your facility and they will run it and they will run it because they have all the expertise which comes along with the mobile units so they'll run it produce the oil the oil that you want whether it's winter ice oil or refined oil or even the unrefined oil any of those things they can provide that for you so you will have places where people will drive in and attract one or two trailer trucks and provide these mobile units to process at your site and of course the last one is you'll find people who are set up large-scale contract processing facility where you can send the material to them and they will process it and send it back to you and they have all the quality control people the engineers everything to manage it so it on a per kg basis it could potentially drive the cost down so those are the three options that you have besides you building it yourself and maintaining it now when you go from extraction to purification it's the knowledge is even more critical than extraction chromatographic separations require a greater technical knowledge but the scale of issues are similar to extraction the regulatory issues are similar and so we have little ease the same scale of issues that we talked about for the extraction site what you see on the slide here is a prep scale system with three separators for a Croma drain a supercritical fluid chromatographic system and what you see on the right is the largest tack column for supercritical fluids built by car and it's in Malaysia they use it to separate the oils from palm oil so if you want if you're looking to do multiple kilograms per day then the first question that comes is you need a large diameter column and these columns are available all the way from a just to 24 inches and the pressure ratings on these columns have to be in the range of 175 to 300 bar and the flow rates of co2 and who solvent typically in this case is ethanol range as little as 5 kilos and memory to as much as 15 kilos so those are the typical specifications for a multiple kilograms per day of chromatographic product and then the scale scalar parameters are very straightforward if you double the diameter of column the total amount that you can process is typically 4 times and the productivity is directly proportional to flow rate selectivity which is very critical for chromatographic it's a function of particle size smaller the particles you get a greater selectivity but the cost of the particles the chromatographic particles go up so you need to do an optimization typically we suggest something in the 10 to 15 micron range our probably the ideal particle size from a cost performance basis our speed capacity and selectivity are very closely interrelated in chromatographic systems you can get high-speed high capacity and high selectivity if we want all three of them then it the cost quadruples so you have to optimize this to get these solutions that you're looking for lastly I have couple slides here which I'd like to conclude my talk and talk about what lessons we have learned today the first one is sizing is a function of solvent to feed ratio the capacity of the pump the capacity of the system that you want we are looking for the pump flow rate the vessel linear velocity and all of that so those are all interrelated and you start with the solvent to feed ratio as a tea you get the rest of the kilometres subcritical extraction is very selective it's a great way to do it but it has a very high solvent to fade ratio and a lower efficiency so you have to pencil what kind of product you're looking for and if you're looking for winterized oil critical extraction is a good way to go without going through a thermal extraction and the packet the supercritical extraction has a much lower solvent to failure ratio typically a factor of 5 to 10 less than the subcritical extraction it gives you a higher extraction efficiencies because you're running at higher temperatures and pressure but it extracts waxes and other unwanted products so what you have to do is once you extract this you have to go to a conventional winterization using ethanol and that cost time and money so your it's a trade-off whether you want subcritical or supercritical extraction sometimes a good solution might work you may want to do a subcritical extraction to get a clean winterized oil and then go back and change change the pressure to a higher pressure and higher temperature go back and extract what's left to work so you overall you get higher efficiency and you get two products one is a winterized oil directly the other one is where you have to do anything it's an all extraction and produce of interest oil and quite a few people will take both these oils and mix them together to get a complete spectacle spectrum oil so those are the things in this V I'm going to summarize by saying we do expect consolidation to happen we expect as the market grows you have larger and larger people coming in to play both internal for their own needs and also external for working with other people so large-scale extraction will be the norm as we go in the future many group will either set up their wherever they think they have the technical capability and the money to do it so they don't have to send the material but that does not work for everybody they'll have mobile extraction units which will come to your facility to do this high-technology extraction as a service at your site or you can go to a toll processor who will provide you the same service at their facility so you have all of these options and you can expect every one of them to be in be a solution for what you are trying to do and depending on what you would like to get at the end of it you can pick one or the other of course if you can if you have the money the best is to set up your own large-scale extraction unit because you can control everything you can control what you are trying to extract the technology and it's all internal but that might not worker forever for everybody in that case you might be better off going to an outside facility or the last one is as I mentioned earlier a group of people can join together create a co-op and run the coop for all their shareholders so all these options are available and with that I would like to conclude and say our process will be happy to be an extraction and purification partner and if you have any questions please feel free to let me know and I'll be happy to answer I do very much for listening to me today thank you dr. tortilla for that informative presentation we will now start the live Q&A portion of this webinar if you have any questions you'd like to ask please do so now just click on that ask a question drop down box located on the far left of your presentation window type the question into the box that appears on the screen and click the send button will answer as many questions as we have time for so let's take a look our incoming questions from our audience our first question doctor Sharia is at what point is it better to subcontract instead of purchasing the extraction so I would say it's really a trade-off between capital investment and subcontract costing setting up a facility especially a large one requires a lot of handling and people all of these cost money and time it's always cheaper especially in the short term to subcontract the extraction and the purification this gives you the ability to go to different vendors and when your volume gets very large then you can think about setting up your own facility because by this time you have learned the business you're making money and you have the time and money to invest in your own facility optimizing to the products that you want thank you doctor Sharia and this next question from an audience member is two-part question is supercritical co2 extraction process too complicated and do I need highly technical people to handle that yes or no the process is fairly simple but because it is high pressure it requires the use of properly designed products and caution when you using them in other words if you have nuts and bolts tightening you have to tighten them so you really have to take care to do this properly you cannot be them circle about it you can also think of the process based on the raw material and that requires a technical understanding of what you are trying to do so is it complicated yes it's a little bit complicated but if you have the right people you can handle it thank you and I want to remind our audience members that any questions not answered today will be answered via email our next question is is there any use for the left over Rafa to raffinate I think that's a very good question that is many ways to figure this out the simplest one is you dispose it off or you burn it and you can take the heat that generator to produce hot water or electricity so that's thermal energy that you can get from your raw material but the more interesting thing is because the cannabis plant is a high fibrous plant and it's been used for years - in textiles and ropes it becomes a great substitute or paper or text in textiles so you can find these upcoming new applications for the leftover material which if you had to set up a plan to do it it just makes good economic sense and it gets a faster return of investment thank you for that before we close dr. Sharia do you want to provide the audience with any closing remarks I I just want to say that supercritical co2 is a great shoe you know as I mentioned earlier you cannot get a better solvent it's physiologically compatible it's inexpensive if you know how to handle it you should use it you can use it efficiently it can be very selective it just makes the whole process go easy and you're not polluting the environment thank you again dr. Shar dia for your presentation and your important research I'd also like to thank lab roots for making today's educational webcast possible before I go I want to remind everyone that today's webcast will be available for on-demand viewing through June 2018 you'll get an email from laborat the swipe cast will be available for replay please share that announcement with your colleagues who may have missed today's live event that's all for now and thanks for joining us we hope see you again soon bye-bye thank you all", "INVzvJHc2PA": "hello everybody and welcome back to the channel in today's video we are going to be making cbd oil with a crock pot but before we get into today's video folks if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please consider subscribing and for those of you that have already subscribed thank you so much i really do appreciate all the support and if you all wouldn't mind please give this video a big thumbs up okay folks so you may or may not know but our farm is solely dependent on our sale of hemp flour and that's what we're going to be using today our hemp flour now if you guys are interested in cbd hemp flour to make your own cbd oil go ahead and check out the link in the description below also go ahead and check out this link up top okay so first and foremost we're going to need cbd flour to make cbd oil you will find an array of options on our website if you're purchasing from us you'll see large flour or regular flour you'll see small flowers you'll see trim and some other odds and ends on there as well but today we're going to be using regular sized hemp flour the variety that we're going to be using is biox which is our most popular flower which is my personal favorite but there's also cherry wine on there i'll sweeten it a bunch of others that are all great as well it really depends on what you're looking for um but today we're going to be using biox and that's probably our most potent flower as well and that really depends on your potency level also and the same thing goes with trim versus small flowers there's a whole bunch of different potencies if you guys have questions go ahead and email me i'll be absolutely happy to answer any and all questions that you guys have about the hemp flour okay so we're going to need some stuff to make cbd oil with a crock pot unlike using an expensive machine like the magical butter machine you're going to need some other kitchen gadgets in order to make cbd oil correctly at home with a crock pot and so first and foremost we need a carrier oil now this is obviously you use this for a magical butter machine or any other machine we're going to use mct oil today other popular carrier oils are hemp oil and olive oil i really don't like olive oil that's just my personal preference i do love mctl it's the best carrier oil of all of them but if you're looking for a little added flavor hemp oil if you can find it is really good as well but today we're going to be using mct oil and the reason why coconut oil and other oils aren't in this is well coconut oil will be solid at room temperature so that's not good for cbd oil and other ones don't have the necessary fats to be a superior carrier oil and you really need that absorption rate to be high especially for a crock pot okay obviously next you will need a crock pot um these are relatively inexpensive you can get them for like 15 online you don't need a large one uh your batches are going to be anywhere between one to two cups of oil and one to two ounces of flour so really you don't need a large crock pot a three to six quart crock pot is plenty um another thing you will need is something to decarb with now we're going to use our magical butter d card box i love it there's no point in using a pyrex dish if i have this but you can use a pyrex dish with a cover that works as well and this will be one of the first steps we do here as we make our cbd oil the next thing you definitely need is going to be a filter of some sort some people use a cheese cloth um i don't i've never used that i've always used the magical butter filters you can get this pack on their website or you can get any type of micron filter i believe it has to be 150 or more um that's just what we use uh you can go more or less probably depending on the amount of plant material that's going to go through or how many times you actually want to sift through it this package also comes with a silicone glove i really like using that too especially when we're squeezing out the oil but that's going to be later on in the video now this part isn't necessary um to use i'm going to show you how to get around this but a lot of people will use this to cut up or grind up their flower a nutribullet or a magic bullet of anything like this to cut up the flower pre-decarb but i'm going to teach you a trick today on how you can avoid that it takes a little time but there's a trick now if you buy your hem flower from us it's going to come in a package exactly like this this is a pre-packaged um one ounce pre-packaged from us and what we'll do is we're gonna throw this in the freezer for four to six hours and what that does is it makes the hemp fiber very brittle and once it's brittle you can scrunch it all up in the bag and boom you don't have to use a grinder to cut up a flower we've already done that process and here we go here is our scrunched up flower and a ziploc now you don't have to use the bag if you if you're not purchasing from us use a ziploc same exact method in there for four to six hours scrunch it up and we're good to go so we've already done this step i'm not going to time lapse it or anything like that you will need to cut it up one way or another whether it's the bullet or it's through uh freezing it so let's dive into making cb duo with your crock pot here at home and get into the next step okay folks let's get into making cbd oil with our crock pot here we have already measured out a cup of mct oil so we're going to get that in the crock pot now to get it warmed up this process doesn't take very long but this is going to be the first thing you're going to want to do is measure out your oil and get it into the crock pot we're going to put it on low and we're just going to let it sit all right we're going to move this off to the side here for a minute next thing we're going to do is we are going to use our magic butter d card box again you can use a pyrex dish as long as it has a cover or any other baking dish as long as it has a cover now what you're going to be doing is you're going to be de-carving so get your oven preheated to 250 degrees 250 all right so we're going to preheat our oven right now again 250 uh preheat and then once we put this stuff in there it's going to be going in for 30 minutes now again you're either going to this step you're going to be blending your hemp flour which i just don't like making a mess so that's really just not what i want to do but this is an option you can do that get that you take your um your shredded up flour whether you use the magic bullet or you use the freezer method like we did and you're just going to pour it in to your d carb box whether that's the pyrex or this particular box you're gonna make sure that it's nice and even you're gonna cover it and we're gonna throw it into the oven for about a half an hour once it's preheated to 250 degrees so that's what we're going to flash forward to next and then we'll start getting into making the cbd oil okay folks so let me move this out of the way here real quick all right so we have done we are done with the d-carb process again 250 degrees for 30 minutes and there is your nice fresh ground uh cbd hem flower so now we're ready to go um but before we dive into putting it into crop i want to make sure that this isn't the end-all be-all recipe so we used one cup of mct oil for one ounce of hemp flour you can use two cups you can use less flour you can use more flour it really depends on what you want but i'm going to stand by one cup per one ounce if you want to go less you know you can use 14 grams of flour per cup i really don't recommend anything less than that because i don't think you'll get a good experience with cbd i just don't think the potency will be there for you the other thing about the crock pot too it's not nearly as efficient as the magic butter machine so this is going to be a process it is going to be in the crock pot for four to eight hours really depends on when you're ready the longer it has to be in there to cook into the oil the more chance of a higher absorption rate so just remember that as well and again guys you can find all this stuff on our website or feel free to leave a comment or email me and you can find us on facebook and instagram as well if you need to get in touch with me through there okay so let's go ahead and get this going into the crock pot now remember we put this on low already the oil is already nice and warm we have our ounce of ground flour here and we're going to go ahead and dump it right into the crock pot okay so now that that's done we're just gonna move around the flower and we're going to let it cook down [Music] and that's really all we're doing now we're going to let this cook down absorb all into the oil we're gonna cover it again you can use more oil or or i wouldn't use anything less than a cup of oil but you can use more oil like two cups we're just doing a very small batch for the video but as you can see it's already starting to go right into the oil so now we're going to check it about every hour on low so we'll see in another hour and then we're going to repeat that for probably six hours for this particular batch so that is how we get started making our cbd hemp oil in a crock pot okay folks we have let this go for about eight hours i lost kind of track of time and we've been stirring about every hour and this is what it looks like right now very liquidy you know all broken down and that's what you want to look like again you got to go for the longer cook with the crock pot i know with the magic butter machine it's four hours but you're really safe with an eight hour on low cook um of course the setting is low for the crock pot so now what we're going to do is we're going to get our strainer again this is something you're going to have to purchase in order to make cbd oil and then we're going to get some gloves and we're going to slowly pour this into the strainer all right so here we go again it's a balancing act with the strainer just got to take your time get this out of the way here you're just going to let it all go into the strainer there kind of write it up a little bit now again we only did a cup of oil very small batch and what you can do now is get all the plant material in there much as you want because what you're going to do now is once it's in the strainer you can squeeze every last bit of oil out of the flour because the flour does absorb some of the oil okay now one of the things that you get with the magical butter kit uh when it comes to buying these strainers is they give you the silicone glove it's pretty important because it helps you squeeze out all the [Applause] oil all right that's about all you can have with that and then you can put it in your container whatever you desire whether it's a droplet bottle a mason jar but this is the finished product this is your cbd oil and you made it with a crock pot so that's really it for today's video guys if you have any questions feel free to comment in the video uh or you can reach us um via facebook or instagram or email if you guys are interested in the hemp flower that we use today go ahead and check out our website link in the description below but that is all i have for you guys today i hope you enjoyed the video hope you all stay happy healthy and i'll see you in another video", "cxYkAx0hPmo": "[Music] [Music] five traps to know when buying city oil online trap number one what child for love city oil prices there are so many companies now selling CBD oil out there that is hard to know the good from the back go online and search by CBD oil online and you'll get thousands of results naturally we tend to go for the lowest prices when purchases anything but in this case low price CB oil would probably mean a low concentration and you must probably throwing your money away prices of quality cv oil will branch around $50 to $75 or 300 milligram trap number two don't buy CD oil that cures everything if you think that there is one see the oil that will cure every medical condition then think again there is no such thing and anyone that wants to sell the Varsity oil in the market that heals everything is probably lying when buying CBD oil from a store is important to read the fine print and what they claim the product does mass reputable stores we have different products that have been created and fine-tuned to treat various conditions some will have silly specific oils that can help a number of conditions but no company has one miracle potion to toss it all Civic oil must be lab tests and refined to find the perfect combination to treat different medical conditions trap number three look for the non-psychoactive stamp the first thing to look for when browsing an online CBD store is for the non-psychoactive seal of approval cv oil does not contain THC or it contains extremely low levels also by law it is illegal to show psychoactive substances [Music] trap number for the extraction method and lab testing of Sibley oil the most important thing to take into consideration when buying civet oil is to understand what are you getting is important to make sure that that manufacturer of the cv oil is a licensed pharmacist that understand what you're doing when formulated civil products it is important to check that the help use is organic and certified and that the extraction method delivers the best possible product when attracting cv oil from the hemp plant is the best to use productive extraction processes such as co2 pulao temperature high pressure technique this type of techniques allows the manufacture of capture co2 in a liquid state and efficiently draw the CVD and turbines from the plant once instruction is complete it is important that the campaign uses a third lab to test Roe compounds this guarantees that you are gaining an unbiased opinion of the CVD oil from a third party lab [Music] trap number five lack of transparency on the side you want to buy silly oil from before you go and buy city oil with an online provider it is always best to check the fine print and death of the Soler's website a reliable and trustworthy manufacturer will have no problem showing it accept ingredients of their products and also their lab tests you don't have to be a pharmacist to understand them but the fact that they want to show you the results means that they stand behind the quality of their products [Music] do you want to learn about city FL which is the number-one-ranked to the oil company in the United States approved by the Department of Agriculture just click the link below we have a 60 days guarantee money back and because you don't like it and also you can sign up for if you'd like to learn more about gtfo benefits for you just click the link below gtfo is ranked number one in the United States because it's a proof but by the Department of Agriculture you still have 60 days guarantee money back policy and just in case you don't like and thank you", "bOYGLB8IDi0": "hello and welcome to digesting the soul today I will be going over the potential risks involved when you're vaping CBD oil and I think there's some really important information that everybody should know and understand before they purchase their first vape pen so please stay tuned [Music] where the I've gotta make sure [Music] [Music] breathing okay so probably the most common question that I am asked is can vaping CBD oil impose any risks to my health and potentially the answer is yes but there are some things that you can avoid to reduce any risks potentially involved so what I'm going to be doing here today is sort of going over after I did my own personal research and I was looking for a company to purchase my first vape pen there's sorts of things that I was either looking to avoid or looking to verify from a company's website so first trade off would be the extraction process so how is that final CBD oil extracted now there are several methods and no method is perfect but obviously you do want to extract the hemp in a method that's safe and non-toxic so some of the early methods that were used by farmers were petroleum-based solvents which included like butane and propane and another commonly used method currently is ethanol extraction but the most high-tech CBD extraction method currently available is something called supercritical co-team method and I will put links that I found some great articles about the extraction process if you're unfamiliar with this and want to know more about it but with the co t method it's believed that the benefits create in the end product a much cleaner product and reduces the chance of any contaminants so and it's good to note that this same co2 extraction process is the same one that issues when they're decaffeinated coffee and teas and it's also the same process used to make essential oils for perfumes so and why is the extraction process important well one reason is that during the extraction process there's parts of the plant that called the waxy plant material that it's the outer covering of the hemp leaves and what can happen is during the extraction process these particles can end up in the oil and what will happen over time because vaping is done at such a low temperature it's not going to be able to burn away these particles and over time these particles will begin to clump together and they can then settle on your lungs and obviously cause someone potential health issues so after I had researched the various extraction processes I was looking for a company that said on their website that they did use the supercritical co2 method so next some of the other very important thing is to identify is what are the carrier oils used as well as any thinning agents and as you probably know all CBD oils are combined with suspension oil and this is because the cannabinoids and the hemp can easily break down so it's required that they are combined with a fat soluble liquid and there are many many different carrier oils and sometimes the carrier order oils are combined with thinning agents and that is because there's believed to give a better vape so when it comes to vaping you'll probably want to avoid these three substances and the first will be PG and it's propylene glycol and PG is a thinning agent it was very popular with cigarettes because it's one of the thinnest solvents on the market but when PG is heated during the vaporization process it can produce known carcinogens byproducts like formaldehyde and obviously we don't want these causing irritation in our lungs the second thing would be VG and that simply vegetable glycerin and this is a carrier oil and this is also known to have cancer-causing compounds like formaldehyde when it is heated improperly and lastly MCT and this is medium chain triglycerides and the most common form you're seeing related to CBD oil right now it's coconut oil and while this is not carcinogenic when it's specifically baked you can develop a condition known as lipid pneumonia and this occurs when the oils build up within the lines and it's the effects of this buildup affected the exchange of oxygen and carbon monoxide when you're breathing so it's definitely something that you don't want to have in your liquid base so the next things that I was always looking on CBD oil companies websites is I wanted them to provide documentation that the CBD oil was being tested for both purity and pesticides and obviously all of these laboratory tests should be done by a third-party and in addition I was looking for documentation that the CBD oil was being tested for its potency and it's also its cannabinoid profile also done by a third-party because the CBD oil that I babe does not have any THC so I'm looking for documentation that confirms this so when you're looking to purchase CBD oil from any company I really think that these things should be transparent they should be offered and easily accessible on their website so lastly would be simply just the quality of the vape pen John Hopkins did a study on vaping and found that with that when they were heating some of the coils leached notable amounts of heavy metals and these were you know released into the vapors that were then inhale so you definitely want to stay away from lower quality cheap pens and and I think the point I'm making here is that in general you want a higher quality CBD oil you want higher quality pens and you know these products may cost a little bit more but since you are consuming these you know I think that is an important consideration and well worth the cost so the truth is is that more research does need to be done on CBD oil and in general and also vaping CBD oil we don't know a lot of data on the long-term effects that's why I think you do have to weigh the pros and cons based on the little information that you can find and is out there but what's so great about CBD oil is that there's something for everybody because it comes in so many options for you to consume it and you know I first started off with the oil the sublingual oil put it on many people use the capsules there's also edibles there now making crystals and Shatter and then you have the whole topical ring so you've got your bombs or your butters your gels and even massage oils now so I think at the end of the day each person does have to weigh the pros and cons of vaping specific to their situation now obviously for me one of the surprising things when I did a contrast in comparison between the CBD oil and the vaping is that it's once you vape the effect is instantaneous its immediate so for me that was the pro of a thing however there the risk to consider and I think for example say you're somebody who suffers from anxiety and you're prone to anxiety to panic attacks when you're in public and then a vape pen might be something that you invest into occasionally you know have an immediate relief effect or if you're suffering from you know severe chronic pain syndrome or something there can be those occasions where you do need that immediate relief that you can't wait for your capsules or the oil to take effect so I think it's a real personal decision but I think if you have done the research and know the potential risks involved then you're definitely ahead of the game when you're going out there there's so many companies now popping up in selling CBD oil that you really have to be a responsible consumer and do the research and hopefully you're making a purchase from you know a reputable reputable and ethical company so I think that about does it if you have any further questions please don't hesitate to leave a comment and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can and as always and wishing everybody all the best in great health and I will see you in my next video [Music]", "Gbu45xvubSM": "so one thing that's not on my list that I kind of wanted to ask you and your thoughts on is extraction methods there's a lot of different ways that we extract CBD there's and in your world you probably understand me at the the ethanol process with acetone and harsh solvents and whatnot that's out there versus the co2 attraction which is what we use some critical supercritical extraction is there anything you can add to or any information you can give us on what's important when it comes to extraction and what's what we should we be looking for when we're picking out a product okay so with each extraction method you're going to be having different chemical parameters which changes the composition of that extract slightly so supercritical co2 extraction will have a different profile of the molecules from the plant then say ethanol extraction ethanol and extractions tend to pull more chlorophylls oddly enough and then you have butane which honestly you just want to stay away from so supercritical gets you away from a lot of those problematic solvents the additional ethanol that would be done you know the ethanol extraction method is advancing there's some really good the equipments getting better or recovery getting all the ethanol out of it but supercritical co2 is much more clean and much more clean extraction from solvent base and I would just encourage everyone to take a look at that residual solvents section on the CoA which we didn't mention earlier because look at look for those ethanol content look for you know that and yes ethanol is used for the Rick Simpson oil extraction you're absolutely right Stacy but you just have to make sure to drive off that all that ethanol off and that takes heat and the heat can if don't do it just right you can start degrading the cannabinoids and that is a something we don't necessarily want to do gotcha so while technologies are advancing that's great so ethanol was not completely terrible as long as they get all the solvents and extras out of there that may have been left behind the residue left behind from the extraction if you're using a co2 method you don't have that issue yeah exactly right now I would put supercritical co2 still very much in the lead for as far as a cleaner extract ethanol is in second you know and it's closing the gap but it's not there yet and then any of the other harsh solvent based those are you know those I just wouldn't even yeah so would you say that the reason why not all companies use co2 is because of the expense behind it is it a more expensive technology to use or why doesn't everybody just use it if it's if it's superior the well one it's a cleaner the one problem with it is that it is a very you can't do large quantities at a time with supercritical co2 you're limited on the total amount of extraction that you can do at a single time you know if you want to do extract a bunch of him very quickly you better off going with ethanol your throughput is much higher but that's the trade-off is getting all that ethanol out plus you have a different composition so supercritical co2 tends to be that's the industry standard gotcha so it's a little bit slower but it's worth it in the long term you guys slept over that's good to know", "zmS8CLwQj9k": "[Music] hi guys we're here with some winterize material step- 80 degrees Celsius basically a mixture of ethanol and our crude oil that we've extracted through a butane system we're gonna start by putting it into this column right here this is our refinement filter gonna take out a lot of the fats and waxes and the material then from there we further transferred through this hose to the shotgun condenser right here the shotgun condenser is set to 60 degrees Celsius it's going to bring the material of our semi and temperature of our material up and then by the time it leaves the shopping condenser it will be ready for a hot scrub through this column here this column is packed with activated carbon as well as Maxo and then a seal a at the bottom for a dozer from there and we'll go through this hose into our collection vessel they're being pulled under a vacuum the entire time we're going to use pressure assist as well and the material filter over here let's get started having we have our middle hole plugged up and place the ball valve I get into pressurize the filter to 30 psi now that we have our filter pressurized I'm going to open up this drain valve we're going to see the material starts to go through this hose into the top of our shopping event [Music] now that we have some liquid raining through our material for our powder column they're going to close the top and use a little bit nitrogen it's it's going to help us push the e-liquid through the it may be hard to tell but you can see the material has been a remediated of most of its color you look at the hoses here the input hose versus the leaving hose you can see a little bit of color change in here [Music]", "uRdUIhRsN_w": "alright love Jonah barber I'm the president of MRX labs and MRX extractors and it's wanted to take you kind on a tour today about some of the technology we have here this is our 20 litres supercritical extractor here this is our product vessel three to eight pounds goes in there of a trim typically what's really unique about our extractor system is that we have full process control over the entire process the three most critical parts when you're doing co2 extractions or your temperature your flow rate and your pressure we have full control so what that means is when we set our parameters it's going to stay in a very tight tight zone it's not going to deviate which means we're able to actually preserve the terpenes through the extraction process that means we don't actually have to try to reintroduce some but they're actually preserved for the process so our customers are actually winning awards like the dope Cup an organ Medical Marijuana Cup with their products we could teach just about anyone how to run it essentially and go ahead here put in our product wait most of our customers are running six to eight pounds they're doing about 10 to 11 hours per run and there's a two runs a day so they're running essentially 24 hours a day seven days a week so here we set our product weight how many hours want to do we do offer fractionalize extraction and so we can do a THC extraction or a CBD extraction here here you can actually go and can control your settings as far as your psi for THC extractions your temperature your CBD extractions once the products actually set and you hit start what that actually means is we one of the patents we have pending is an automatic high pressure low pressure and temperature Corrections and so if we set our extraction target at 1800 psi in our temperature at 120 it's going to stay in that very tight zone and it's not going to deviate and if it starts to deviate it'll automatically self correct itself what that also means too is that we have essentially we can go ahead and have repeatability with products because you now you're taking the human element side out of it and you don't have to have a high paid engineer or artist or chemist running your machine once it's actually set up and going they can actually step away and do another part of the process and it actually has the smart technology and there will actually call your phone and tell you if you're getting low on co2 or if you have a problem like your power went out would actually call your phone and then as you can know each strain is very specific and can react differently so if you have a really good successful run you can actually go back in after it's over and look at the trending analytics and they'll give you the whole entire run showing you where your temperature and pressure were what that means is you have repeatability for your product lines even as you go from state to state it's not it's not going to be dependent on the operator a couple key features on the machine here is that we're a SME stamped and certified and ul approved the ASME stamping is the highest certification you can get for pressure vessels some exciting news is - we actually just got certified by a fire marshals to be permitted for Washington here which they said is extremely challenging to do they said we're actually the only extraction system unit to be permitted by fire marshals another key feature here is our liquid storage system a lot of other companies use five-gallon water chillers I mean hot water bath to try to change the temperature of their vessel what happens though is you're impress your temperature goes up and down that's where your product can cook it can decarboxylate you can get unwanted plant material in there lose the terpenes so what we have here is we had this built specifically to match our machine specifications and so we have 20 gallons of hot water 20 gallons of cold water in here 40,000 bhu so what that means is when we set that temperature it stays within a degree which we preserve the terpenes through the process there so this is our extraction package here what comes out of the this is the separator here some of your product comes out of for lack of better term it's almost like a butter typically what comes out of there is what we'd call like a silver product in a 35 to 50 percent THC or CBD range what a lot of our customers wanted actually was high quality co2 pins and cartridges so what this is here is uncut co2 oil that's THC it's about 65% how we got that is we actually refined it using a post processing and winterizing with some the buki equipment here this is the Boogie 20 liter roto vapor system here and so after the product comes out of the vessel there we mix it with a grape seed out Organic grape seed alcohol and we mix it ten parts to one and essentially we'll D wax the product once the product is D waxed then what's left is just brave seed alcohol in Pere THC or CBD oil we put it in our roto vapor system here we have full control where we have the vacuum circulating pump the shower here and we'll put it under pressure and we'll read will then pull out the distillation is what it is so will then go in and pull out essentially the the grape seed alcohol so then when you what you're left with is just pure uncut THC and CBD oil so we're also really a technology and development company and so what we see bottlenecks with our customers and so why we were doing a lot of the extraction and roto vapes we saw our customers were filling their cartridges by hand it's a very time-consuming messy dirty job and a good day they would get about three hundred five hundred cartridges done so Paul Tommaso who is the engineer and one of our partners here he's also the scientist behind this design here but he built this cartridge filler that essentially will pull the caps a fill recap and so in the very first day of production our customers ended up doing 3,500 cartridges in eight hours versus doing them by hand one other thing we do is we REM rx labs as well we're the largest cannabis testing lab and what we do is we back everything up with data and science - so not only extraction facility will we test everything going in everything going out the terpene profiles the cannabinoid profiles and so that's an advantage we have the other companies don't have to be able to back everything up with analytical data as well micronutrients very soluble and readily available it also has your fulvic acid but the real kicker in here", "vhi-NPeeSY0": "okay so I ran a four-minute time to test with our twin screw 6-inch press I ran this material here it's not terribly wet it's post ethanol extracted hemp for CBD oil as you can see there's still some flowers here but everything has been chucked chopped up there's some branches in there this is industrial scale someone that's got fifty five hundred acres and just want to get it done so they're gonna wash ethanol with that and in four minutes we did forty two pounds and after after you know we started with that you get this everything is just ground up it's almost like a dust in some ways but this is what it does we got 42 pounds of this and we got eight down marker they're 28 gallons of ethanol back up and that's a press liquor that can go through your your process to get more CBD oil out and recover your ethanol basically at a rate about 11 gallons an hour running about six hundred and thirty pounds an hour of this material so six hundred thirty pounds and an hour 11 gallons of ethanol get your ethanol back and there's a lot of CBD in there", "MSzIYGWRXbE": "- [Narrator] You've probably already heard about cannabidiol,\nbetter known as CBD. It's exploded in popularity with claims of treating everything\nfrom insomnia to diabetes. - That's the only thing that would help me with my migraine headaches. - [Narrator] It can be consumed as an oil, applied to skin, or inhaled it as a vapor. We know CBD is a component of marijuana, but it's derived from hemp,\nusually does not contain THC, and won't get you high. The game changer for the\nCBD industry came when President Trump signed a farm bill legalizing hemp cultivation. One prescription drug\ncontaining CBD has been approved for treating two rare forms\nof childhood epilepsy, but the vast majority of\nwhat we know about CBD has been limited to personal experiences and unproven animal studies. - More often than not, things\nthat look good in animals, when you go into humans,\nthose effects aren't there. - [Narrator] According to a\n2018 Harvard Health Blog post, scientists say they still don't know much about how CBD affects the brain or which doses and\ndelivery methods work best. For example, if you put a few drops of CBD under your tongue, you\nmight consume 10 milligrams. But some researchers say you\nwould need 30 times that amount to reach a threshold\nthat can relieve stress. And since CBD products\nare primarily marketed and sold as supplements, the U.S. Food and Drug\nAdministration doesn't evaluate whether these products\nare safe or effective. That means if you buy a CBD\nproduct, you don't really know how much CBD is actually in the container. There's no denying the\nCBD revolution is upon us and the marketplace is buying in. However, there's still\na lot of TBD about CBD.", "l0AntCR6314": "hello everybody and welcome back to your word cannabis and today's video we're going to be making a CBD alcohol tincture but first if you wouldn't mind if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button and if you've already subscribed thank you very much and if you wouldn't mind give the video a thumbs up it would help our channel out quite a bit so today we're going to be making an alcohol-based CBD tincture this is a simple yet kind of complex recipe only because of the amount of plant material that goes into this recipe normally if you've seen my other videos about making cannabis oil or CBD oil if we're talking grams to cup of oil so you know a certain amount of grams per cup of oil and that's usually the recipe it can be fluctuated but today we're going to be talking Elsa's 2 cup so we're going to be using ounces of flour per cup of alcohol and the reason this is is because alcohol can extract plant material the best it's pretty much the best home remedy to get the most out of plant material it grabs onto those cannabinoids and rips them off the plant material and it makes some really potent stuff and you can use it for all kinds of different applications including adding to your wine or drink at night but for today we're just making a base alcohol tincture so I've already measured out 3.3 ounces of CBD by ops flower and this runs at 21.1% CBD we've also used our trim bag recently so you haven't checked that video please do and we're going to be using some Vioxx flower trim and the reason why I have some trim here and flower is because I want to do about one ounce of flower per cup of alcohol so we're going to be making three cups of CBD alcohol tincture today but I want to use the trim to add CBD a to the mix we want this to be a full-spectrum CBD alcohol tincture so we'll be using some of this probably only about an ounce or two of trim along with the three point three ounces of flour so as always we're going to decarbonize de carve our trim because when you dakar you lose the a and cbda and it becomes CBD so we're going to be getting all of our CBD from the flower and we'll be getting a lot of our CBD a from the trend and if you haven't seen my decarboxylated technique run through it really quick today all I do is they preheat my oven to 250 degrees and I put my flower in there for roughly a half an hour you can go a little bit more you can go a little bit less it really depends on what you want your conversion to be but I like to go right about half an hour sometimes 35 minutes or 40 minutes given the amount of material I may go 40 minutes today so I'm gonna preheat the oven on a decarboxylate this and then we're going to get started using our magic butter machine and the recipe to make our CBD alcohol tincture okay so our hemp flour has now decarboxylated I did 250 degrees for 40 minutes just because of the amount of material I wanted to make sure that that was going to be fully d carved then while I was waiting for that to D carb I measured out one ounce of biotics flour trim so now let's get the magic butter machine and start making this alcohol texture okay so now we have our magic butter machine and we have our one ounce of not decarboxylated hemp flour trim and we also have our decarboxylated hemp flour so today the alcohol we'll be using is a fan-favorite for extraction this is Everclear its grain alcohol and it's a hundred and ninety proof now you can't get this here or Virginia and certain states you cannot get it in so you're just going to look for your high prove I know a lot of states is a 151 or something like that whatever the case is but the higher the proof the more extraction and this is going to give us pretty much the best extraction we can buy so all we need to start doing is gonna get our not decarboxylated trim and we're going to start adding our decarboxylated fat flower okay get that in there all right so now we have all of our flower in our magic butter machine as you can see this thing is packed full but that's going to be okay so that is this is four point three ounces of products so this is all biotics flower in here this is four point three ounces of Vioxx hemp flour whether it's trim flower it's just all plant material so now I'm going to be doing three cups of alcohol so we'll measure here now you see why I use three cups just happens to be a coincidence that it's the 750 milliliter Everclear is just about 3 cups so once you've measured that out go ahead and pour that in okay now we're all squared up everything is in we're going to put the top on our magic butter machine as we always do and we're going to plug it in okay so now we've plugged in our magic butter machine all as well so for an alcohol tincture you're gonna go to a hundred and thirty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do eight hours now you can do four but I want the most out of it so I'm gonna do eight hours so we'll see it eight hours and we'll show you the finished product okay so the magic butter machine is all done and we just got a scoop off all the remaining plant material now remember this was like four point three ounces of plant material so there is quite a bit but you're gonna be really surprised what it looks like in there so it all gets blended down and I'll show you here so what was once a pile of flour is now gone so we're just going to dump it all out into the micron bag try to get everything out of here this is a quite a bit of plant material now at the bottom I'll scoop some out so you can see it just put that right into the white crumb bag but while the plant material in this recipe a lot different than the will recipes so now that that's done put your silicone glove on your dominant hand so you can squeeze it the best clean that up a little bit so the amount of plant material makes it definitely more challenging than the oil recipes because you're squeezing four ounces of plant material dried plant material now it's all wet can be quite the challenge and so what I like to do is put it right back in to the Everclear bottle so you know it's the alcohol tincture so that's what we're going to do here so that's our recipe that's what I have for you today folks I hope you enjoyed this recipe and use it to your advantage I will leave the recipe in the description below on the video go ahead and try it yourself if you have any comments questions leave them below you can also find us on Instagram and Facebook I'll leave those links in the description and I will see you in another video take care", "HSCsCI0gHHs": "what's up everybody alex here from uncanny wellness and today I am bringing you another video where we are gonna talk about water soluble CBD nowadays there are so many people that are hearing about CBD for the first time just discovering it and the odds are they're hearing about it in one of its many oil forms like a tincture like a cream like vapes oil and water don't mix well we know that and the vast majority of use cases out there are gonna be water based I'll explain a bit more leg or what I mean about that really it all comes down to bioavailability the way in which you consume the CBD dictates how bioavailable it is so before I get too deep into it let's go find a place in the woods to sit down and talk and a little bit more of a beautiful [Music] [Music] [Music] so the first thing that's crucial to understanding why water-soluble is so important is known as the first pass effect or first pass metabolism and this is a physiological phenomenon where basically when you're delivering a drug any drug compound to the body the concentration gets greatly reduced before it can effectively be absorbs and basically what's happening is that this drug compound whatever it might be in our case it's CBD is getting processed by the liver before it has a chance to effectively enter your bloodstream what that ends up meaning is that you have a great decrease in bioavailability and it's not really a novel problem it affects tons of different drug compounds from curcumin which is the active ingredient in turmeric to morphine and tons of other things that are pretty normal in drug delivery and pharmaceuticals but they have the same exact issue which is the first pass effect preventing it from being efficiently absorbed in a certain state so to overcome the first pass effect there needs to be some sort of conversion process for these molecules the first pass effect only affects the bioavailability of CBD if consumed into the stomach or oral consumption if you're absorbing a tincture properly under your tongue through your skin or you're vaping it it doesn't have those issues because the first pass effect is specific for the stomach so the good thing is that scientists have created techniques to successfully overcome the first pass effect which means that you can take something like CBD which normally has extremely poor bioavailability in the stomach put it through this conversion process and then all of a sudden you can drink it or eat it or however swallow it into your stomach without sacrificing effectiveness so what's the big deal why does all of this matter really it all comes down to the fact that we can't effectively absorb CBD and our stomach as is and you might be thinking what about all the CBD oil capsules out there isn't that just an oil that I'm swallowing into my stomach or what about CBD drinks am I not getting the full dose for those either and the answer really is it all depends on how those companies formulated their CBD for example what we do at in uncanny allows it so that in a capsule or in a drink or however you want to take it by swallowing it you're still getting the maximum dose because of this unique conversion process that we do but basically a lot of CBD oil capsules out there are not converted in any special way and actually gonna have really poor bioavailability this is science that not everybody's aware of or if they are aware of it they've chosen to ignore it for some reason so what does that look like it looks like if you took a 25 milligram CBD capsule you could only be absorbing 5 milligrams of that expected dose so the reality is that out there in the world of science and drug delivery science up to 40% of new drug compounds a lot of them being from plants have this same issue of bioavailability in the stomach so the techniques that have been created to overcome this problem are tried and tested and well known in the scientific community and are being used every day for other compounds it's still just new to the cannabis hemp CBD industry one of the best ways to overcome the first pass effect is to convert the oil-soluble CBD into a water soluble form by doing this not only does it increase bioavailability in the stomach but it also greatly increases the ways in which you could use this product because with an oil-based extract you're confined to mixing it with other oils and using it that way because of course oil and water don't mix but with water soluble you can much more easily incorporate that into baked goods frozen goods coffee tea juices and so much more the technique that we use here at uncanny wellness is recognized for possessing unparalleled potential for increasing the oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs and I know that's a mouthful but basically it means that the technique converts the soil into a form that increases bioavailability in the stomach so how does this work basically you could think of CBD oil as a big blob and this conversion technique takes it from a big blob of oil and breaks it down into a bunch of really really really small pieces and all of those small pieces are micro or nano sized so that ends up being what's known as a micro encapsulation literally encapsulating pieces of that CBD oil into small enough segments so that I can effectively enter your bloodstream in the stomach and overcome the first pass effect the end result of the conversion process that we use to take the CBD oil into a water soluble form ends up creating a off white powder it's very fine to the touch and still has the smell from all the terpenes and other naturally occurring compounds in the extract besides at the CBD so why should you care well you know maybe water soluble CBD is not for you if you really like creams if you really like holding a tincture under your tongue then by all means stick with that but if you want to expand the ways in which you can use this substance water soluble is for sure the way to go because otherwise you're gonna be throwing your CBD oil into your smoothie or into your water first of all it's not gonna mix well second of all you're gonna be absorbing maybe 50% likely less really to incorporate something and build it into your daily routine it has to be easy so water soluble CBD allows you to just consume it in a much more friendly way without having to guess what dose you're expecting without having to sacrifice bioavailability and without having to deal with holding a oil under your tongue to properly absorb it when we take a look at what's on the shelves of health food stores like if you walked into Whole Foods if you walked into any natural food store near you what you would see is you'd see powders that you could add to a shaker or smoothie and you'd see pills there are some textures but there are a very small minority compared to what is in the supplement department as a whole and so those two pills and powders either way you're gonna use those it's entering your stomach and so to use CBD in that way it really needs to be in a converted form for increased bioavailability and a water-soluble CBD can do that for you now I believe that if CBD is really going to go mainstream like we all know it can it's gonna be in the most user-friendly way and in my opinion I think it makes the most sense that the most user-friendly way for CBD to be delivered to the body it's just by swallowing it drinking it using it in a capsule and that way it has to be converted otherwise you're losing out on most of the dose you know there's a lot of people out there that have really great CBD tinctures but when they start dropping that tincture into a smoothie it's really misleading to their customers because yes the tincture is perfectly fine absorbed under the tongue but if you're just dropping CBD into your smoothie you got to know that you're getting only half that dose or less a good example is if you go to fill your car up with gas okay if you go to fill your car up with gas and you pay for a full tank would you be okay only getting half a tank or even 20% of a tank probably not so if you're paying for a dose of CBD and you're just swallowing oil then you got to know then that's exactly what's happening so that's it everything you need to know about water-soluble CBD really what it comes down to is we all have these incredible endocannabinoids systems in our body that are the precursor to our nervous and immune system and are essential for the full functioning of those systems and maintaining health and balance within our body CBD is arguably the best way to supplement that system and support yourself on so many levels so however you want to incorporate CBD into your life is up to you but just remember that if you're going to be swallowing it in a capsule or in any other form it needs to be converted in order to overcome the first pass effect what we do is create a water-soluble powder which does overcome that bioavailability obstacle and also greatly opens up the opportunities for you to use it in creative fun and interesting ways so that's all for this video thank you all so much for watching if you made it this far and you enjoyed it please like the video it would also mean a lot to me if you can

infused coconut oil using a double boiler hem there are multiple ways to make diffuse oils and today we'll be going with one of the most common ways the double boiler method which is an easy and effective way to infuse health into the oil note that this method works with all oils and not just coconut oil olive oil vegetable oil grapeseed oil they all work so depending on what you're using it for you can substitute the oil you want to infuse so here you want to start out with a quarter of an ounce of buds or trim per cup of oil of course trim will not be as potent as buds so if you're using trim you can add more if you want the oil to be stronger or if you want it to be less potent then trim is a good choice as always I recommend using decarboxylated hemp to get the maximum amount of potency however here today I'm feeling lazy so I'm just going to add them directly into the oil and let it decarboxylate while it's being infused all I need to do is grind the pound then mixed with the oil in a bowl that can fit on top of a pot inside the pot I'll add about 3 cups of water this will vary based on the size of the pot you're using but you'll need to add enough water so that it doesn't completely evaporate after two hours of simmering but not so much that it'll touch the bottom of the bowl you want the bowl to be heated by the steam of the water and not the water itself for a consistent temperature I'll then put the pot on the stove let it boil and then turn down the heat so that it's slowly simmering and finally place the bowl on top of the pot the bull should fit in such a way that almost no steam is escaping from the pot although there should be enough pressure from the steam that a little will constantly escape the steam will consistently heat the oil up to 212 degrees a perfect low heat that will infuse a CBD in with the oil and not so hot that it will burn off any of the CBD if you saw my video on making butter note that both this double boiler method as was directly simmering in the water method are interchangeable when infusing I like this method more when working with oils because other than coconut oil most oils won't turn solid when cooled which makes it harder to separate from water so although this method will have a stronger flavor since there's no water to remove some of the terpenes and chlorophyll which gives flavor it is a lot easier to produce I stir it a little bit from time to time and let it sit for about two hours to properly decarboxylate and infuse now that the oil is infused you'll want to let it sit for a while before straining it since a lot of the oils are stuck to the plant material you'll want to make sure the oil is not hot to the touch because after filtering it through a cheesecloth you'll want to squeeze out all the remaining oil from the plant material to get every last drop and that's it the oil is now ready for use and you're storing the oil be sure to keep it in refrigerator or freeze it if you want to store it for long-term use", "VjxZVpGv_aM": "this is a demonstration video we're going to show you guys how you use the cell light 5:45 and other filter medias like our charcoal filter media what we have here is a Buchner funnel with fretted disc in it satellite 5:45 it's a manufactured product it's like filtering through talcum powder you can use this to clean up a solution very very nicely what I mean by that is it will really take the clarity up quite a bit so what I'm doing right now is I'm gonna add enough to create about a quarter-inch thick pad just scoop it in there and I'm gonna add some water and fill it up about 3/4 of the way or so using a reverse osmosis water that's totally pure stir it up what I'm gonna do is turn on my vacuum pump and it's going to pull down the filter [Music] all right so as you can see we have a filter layer right here that filter layer what I normally do is I'll let the vacuum pump run for a couple of hours on this just to dry it out you can also leave it overnight so that you can be prepared in the morning to use it okay so I have a filter pad right here that's all dried out the previous video we made one as you can see so we have a dried filter pad here with the satellite 5:45 and I'm just going to demonstrate what it can do so as you can see this is a pretty cloudy stuff and what I'm gonna do is filter it so you can get an idea of how clean it can actually be [Music] okay so give you an idea here and we're pretty pretty cloudy no you can see how much clearer it's actually become you can see right through it so it's still green though also you can see that some of the sediment that's up there that's been picked up is on top of the pad if you actually were to disturb this you'll be able to see right underneath it yep there it is that you're just letting that sediment sit on top we're gonna swap out this collection jar fresh one guys and we're going to now go to a second step which is an activated charcoal product so we have our step one and now we're gonna filter this this stuff is again same batch we have a organic material and it's mixed with an extracted alcohol now we're gonna add some to cooperate we're creating is a carbon layer and I make it a mess at the same time so I'm just gonna even it out so again we're gonna flip on our vacuum pump after we get this started poured [Music] all right so I let this run through for a few minutes and I can see that it's a heck of a lot clearer but still have some of that chlorophyll coloring in there so not really happy with the result so we want to do is actually add more carbon to it it's another trick that you can do is add carbon directly to the fluid and put that down so I'm adding carbon two scoops of carbon to the fluid directly we're gonna switch out the flasks get a fresh one going there filter back on it your vacuum pump going this runs a little bit finer so it's gonna take a little bit more time I'll probably have to run the vacuum pump for about three minutes or so or five minutes or so to vacuum off right there just save us some time okay so here we are", "PkP8CCCnrio": "[Music] hi i'm dr jesse lopez and i am a traditionally trained surgeon i've been practicing medicine for 28 years now and that has included surgery as well as integrative health i've had multiple patients who i've worked with utilize cbd as a supplement to assist them with their health care some of the things that cbd can do is provide for a more restful sleep period it can decrease swelling that might be present at an ankle joint or a knee joint it can also allow for better focus cbd stands for cannabidiol now when we look at the whole cannabinoid tree so to speak there are multiple cannabidiols cannabinoids are a compound that comes from the hemp plant one of the pieces of misinformation that people have is that cbd is psychoactive or that cbd is marijuana or thc and that is not the case cbd works by affecting special receptors in the body each system in our body has cannabinoid receptors our own body makes cannabinoids and not many people know that when we take an exogenous or an outside source of cbd that it may actually cause our body to produce more of its own natural cbd and that's some of the leading edge research that's being done right now i was much heavier and i had pain a lot in my back and my hips you know there's just many patches that you can put on and i tried opiates along with it and it just i don't like being where i can't think on my own i just told dr lopez about it and he recommended that i try some cbd oil cbd oil has helped me relax and reduce my cortisone level and reduced my stress you're able to take that deep breath it changed my stress level in turn changes your life if someone desires to take cbd they need to take it from a reputable source so they know that that is what they are getting i believe that american shaman cbd is definitely safe to use and it's safe for anyone with any medical condition however if an individual has multiple medical conditions and are on multiple medications it's best if they do it under the advice of a physician the future of cbd i think is huge literature and research is constantly coming out as we begin to look at it more in this country and embrace it more do more of our own research in this country i think that we're going to be very surprised at what it can do to help [Music] individuals", "ktZuC4cPwA0": "[Music] you [Music]", "kES6fuNMde4": "right now if it were me and I was making products this is what I would be making CBN everyone it's it's we're in the middle of kovat we're in the middle of stay in place we're in the middle of a presidential election people are stressed out and I have a few friends who are doctors and they are telling me that their patients are having a terrible time sleeping just it's a stress and then the more stress you are the less sleep you have that's it destroys your immune system CBN is very easy to create as a product it's basically when THC breaks down all you have to do is heat it and it creates CBN and CBN is great for it's a it's a it's a very strong sedative and it's mildly psychoactive but it's great for pain it's anti-inflammatory because that's another way that the co vid acts with the body is it creates inflammation so you want to be able to use whatever you have in your arsenal to be able to reduce inflammation as much as you can so CBN is an inflammatory it's antibiotic it helps regulate the immune system it helps with bone healing and growth you have to understand this plant in order to create these products you can't react it to the market Oh CBD Oh THC give me as much in that product I only want that I don't care about it and make it cheap it's not sustainable and it's and it's it's not smart because you're going to be in a single lane and want something like COBIT happens or we're able to legalize maybe if it'll happen soon and then what are you going to do you'll have all of these opportunities to utilize this plant and you won't know how to do it you", "k2yAcaFR18Y": "this question comes from John Doe in San Antonio Texas he asks on me country you chemically separate CBD from THC me please describe how you did this ok so first of all the way it was depicted on the show is [ __ ] that just there's no way I'm actually going to perform any legal chemical separation on TV when there's that scene where I say arguably I just committed a felony that was salad dressing no felony committed hurry in terms of how that actually happens the on the show the the part that was real as we really did chemically separate CBD from THC and provide it to that child we just didn't do it on TV the the method that was used was this it's a chemical extraction using resin and it's the same resin that's used in thinning plate chromatography and what it basically does if you picture a column where you first take all the cannabinoids and dissolve it in a solvent the solvent I prefer to use is ethanol your men use vacuum filtration to pull it through this thick resin CBD travels through the resin faster than THC so if you have a hundred milliliters of cannabinoid solvent and you pass it through a resin like that and break it up into ten milliliter vitals the first few are going to have much more CBD than THC and the last few are going to have more THC than CBD if you do that over and over again you can eventually have a very high ratio cannabinoid even if the original input material was not high ratio that system works it's it's not a good system though Frank there's there's better technologies in play that are now available to us there's another system that uses supercritical co2 extraction and those systems are expensive and not really don't really work in a home lab but if you if you have a supercritical system you can if you dissolve all the cannabinoids into supercritical co2 and then very precisely inch up the temperature and the pressure the CVD drops out of the solvent faster than the THC does and that makes a very nice clean separation the most typical way that a chemical engineer would want to separate the two uses something called vacuum distillation and with that basic the most typical one is called a roto bake and if you picture just a glass ball spinning at very precise temperatures and so the oils inside that ball create this thin film along the side of the ball and it's done in a vacuum so that as the temperatures rise up certain chemicals jump out of the oil solution into the vacuum at different temperatures than other ones and you can very precisely calibrate those temperatures and get the CBD to jump into the vacuum and then be recollected in another vial and that that's really the typical chemists wave so in terms of parents of special needs children are they gonna be able to do this at home know that it's just not a realistic option for the parents of special needs children if you're a chemical engineer you can do it without breaking the sweat but if you're you know if you're just trying to make this medicine work for you and your family the the way to pursue it is to grow your own plants and there now we have these high ratio plants that are perfect just the way they come and you can grow the plant up pretty you know make an extraction using a variety of different methods that we'll cover later and those methods don't require a chemical separation and they preserve the entourage and they they allow for a much cleaner you know better medicine", "_KOUuNB0N9M": "[Music] what's up everybody Alex from uncanny here and today I want to talk to you about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and isolate based CBD hemp extracts [Music] I get this question all the time and it is honestly a pretty confusing topic people throw these phrases around without really knowing what they mean but today I'm gonna tell you exactly the difference between the three so first let's just talk about what this spectrum really is in full spectrum a broad spectrum and the spectrum really refers to the different compounds that are in the natural extract so when you think of a CBD oil it's not just CBD that's in that oil there's different fats there's different terpenes potentially different cannabinoids and other things that create the full picture and so in that sense a full spectrum product would be just that it has the entire full spectrum of naturally occurring compounds that are found in that extract so on the totally other side of the spectrum would be what's considered an isolate and as that sounds it's the CBD that's been stripped away and isolated from all the other naturally occurring compounds in that extract and then in the middle between an isolate and a full-spectrum extract you have the whole range of broad spectrum and as that sounds it doesn't necessarily have the full set of compounds but it has a lot of them or most of them for example at uncanny wellness we remove the THC from our products so that is technically part of the spectrum which is why we don't call ours a full spectrum extract instead it's a broad spectrum extract so it has the CBD it has the terpenes the flavonoids and all those other naturally occurring compounds in the extract a common misconception that people have is that you need THC in order for CBD to work properly there is some truth in that because THC and CBD work synergistically together but you don't need the THC for the CBD to work going off of that something like an isolate would work it just doesn't work necessarily as well as a full spectrum product so full spectrum is going to have apps everything in it as such if you remove any part of that spectrum whether you're removing the THC or even if you're distilling down and concentrating what's in the extract you're getting into the territory of broad spectrum so really most of what's out there in the market is gonna be a broad spectrum and not a full spectrum because full is just a very absolute phrase and as a natural result of the processing and extraction and refinement in to that final product form you do lose certain parts of that spectrum another important thing to understand is that the spectrum a full spectrum broad spectrum directly relates to what's known as the entourage effect and the entourage effect basically says that when you have CBD in conjunction with the other naturally occurring compounds that it's usually found with it has a greater amplified effect versus an isolate which is just CBD has no entourage has no other components of the spectrum and is less effective than a full or broad spectrum product so you can kind of think of it like there's more entourage effect happening the more full the spectrum is and as you start taking things away you're removing naturally-occurring compounds from that spectrum you're losing members of the entourage and over time you go all the way to an isolate format which has no entourage effects happening whatsoever the nice thing about a broad spectrum extract is that you can do something like THC removal which is what we do and that's nice for people that may have to get drug tested or just don't want any trace THC in their system or maybe they want to give it to their kids or a pet or they're a pilot or any reason like that they can still enjoy the benefits of the entourage effect and of a broad spectrum CBD extract without having any residual THC because the legal limit for hemp products is 0.3 percent THC so a full spectrum product could have at most 0.3% but you could easily remove that making a broad spectrum or end up removing everything for an isolate for most people the best option for a CBD product is going to be a full or broad spectrum extract isolates are kind of the pharmaceutical reduction of CBD it strips it away from everything else reducing its holistic nature and making it more controllable as such isolates are the cheapest form of CBD available and a lot of times people will actually just throw isolate into a product to make it a really high milligram count and then end up charging you more even though you're getting a lesser quality product so when you're out there trying to figure out which CBD product is best for you it's fair to either ask the company or look for where it says it on the label to see is it isolate broad spectrum or full spectrum and that should help you decide exactly what you're looking for so in summary on one end you have an absolutely full spectrum product that's gonna have the most other compounds besides CBD and it's going to have the most entourage effect on the other end you have an isolate where the CBD is stripped away from all the other naturally naturally occurring compounds there are no extra compounds in the extract and there's going to be no entourage effect and then in the middle you would have the range of broad-spectrum extracts that don't have all the naturally occurring compounds but have most of them and you're still getting the benefits of the entourage effect because of the turbines the flavonoids the polyphenols and all of the other array of compounds that are naturally present in a CBD hemp extract so that's it that's the breakdown between full spectrum and broad spectrum and isolate thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a like leave a comment down below if you want to share your thoughts and make sure to share this with friends so that they can understand the difference between these three forms of CBD as well that's all for today see you next time peace [Music]", "K1T5JLfl8J8": "so the lifecycle of extraction is a really important factor to understand there's lots of different ways to extract we personally here at sweet hill start with the flower obviously and the flower within it has a lot of different things that make up the total mass of that flower now in the extraction process we're actually going to go in and reduce what's in there and take certain fractions out so I'm going to start talking about this at the different layers of what we were moved so starting with the hem we we begin the process by removing the natural terpenes and this is the smell these are the fragrances these are also used very medicinally pineys and other things that are out there that are terpenes these are the same terpenes you're going to find in mother nature so we extract these terpenes through a steamed distillation process that steam distillation process removes the terpenes from the plant in its steam is then cooled and turned back into a liquid that liquid is then deposited into a flask that flask removes because the turkeys are actually lighter they're going to float to the top and the water has been heavier so it's going to follow the bottom and create a separation layer that separation layer gives us our pure terpenes at the top and water at the bottom from the terpenes we then take that same flower substance and we bring it in and we put it through an ethanol extraction process the ethanol extraction process produces what we call a crude oil that crude oil contains a lot of components that we'll talk about in a minute but the ethanol process that we use we reduce we take the flour we put it into a reserve that reserve has alcohol that has been kept at a temperature of negative 40 degrees Celsius to negative 70 degrees Celsius we take that alcohol and wash it over top of all of the flour what happens the reason that we winterize it we take it through this process is because everything that is connected to the water molecule is frozen at that negative forty or that negative 70 degrees temperature that frozen matter stays tied to the plant we remove the trichomes the CBD the cannabinoids as a whole and then as we remove them we do still end up with fats and waxes and lipids and anything that sticks to that water molecule sugars and other things and that's what's in here this Prudhoe oil is filled with all the chlorophylls and all those dark contaminants we'll call them for right now and they're really not a contaminant they could contain omegas and other things that you would actually walk with in your diet they're very healthy as a whole but in our industry we create a lot of cosmetics and human consumables and it's very important to have a purity level we extract crude but then we take it to the next level of purity that next level of purity ends up being a pure gold this is 98% ca\u00f1on total cannabinoids so we'll have CBD and THC in a CBN CDC's all of the whole major and minors of that profile what it doesn't have is terpenes right now because we pulled those terpenes out previously we put those terpenes back into the natural oil that was created and that's this process is done through a wiped film process that white film process what what happens there is we take that crude oil I showed you a moment ago we put it into a charging flask so we charge the flask the flask is charged with our crude oil and it's heated to a very specific temperature that temperature then allows that crude oil to move through the neck of the short bath white film system it's then white onto a glass surface that glass surface is at a very specific temperature that temperature is where we're going to pull the fraction out of the total mass whatever is at that temperature whether it's the THC CBD whether it's the fats waxes the lipids whatever we're going after with process that is the temperature that we would set the system to and so whatever is at that temperature turns into a gas and then it is immediately cooled on the finger in the center of the system it's turned back into a solid and that solid drips down into one of these flasks at the bottom whatever is not at that temperature falls to the wayside and we then rerun that through that material and that's why we do three to four runs at our material which gives us the purity of that 98% and so coming back to our perfect gold battling with that perfect goal what I was talking about we remove our fats waxes lipids sugars anything that sticks that water molecule and that's what this is this is a byproduct of that end result and so it's as hard as tar when it's heated back up to a pretty significant temperature it becomes a very different consistency but the cool thing about this by-product that most people are actually throwing out or getting rid of we end up reusing and we reuse it in one of our newest hemp sustainability products this head of sustainability product is what we call our fire firestarter it has an incredible acceleration rate when it doesn't affect it we are producing these now for the open market it doesn't have any smell of hemp because in fact we've gone through and refined everything and pulled everything out of that that plant matter and and you as you see within the plant matter that we have in in some of the different points of this video the everything's been stripped of it there might still be some proteins and there's fibrous mass and there's a couple of other components but we've removed all of those extra the CBD and cannabinoids the fats and some of the chlorophylls and the waxes and so forth and so that's what this by-product and made of it's made of our heavy dense fat flexes and removed product and it's made of hemp that has been run through this entire process which gives us the ability as farmers to be able to take advantage of more than just the CBD that we're growing this plant is an extraordinary thing and it gives life back to the entire cycle and by us just having plant matter that we use in a compost pile or plant matter or fats and wax and lipids that are end up being some type of a by-product that we have to get rid of in some other way whether it goes out to it a plant or a disposal location so we're trying to use that hundred percent of what's there and in fact we continue on down the story and we've started to make hemp plastics these hemp plastics these are our sample lotions or our travel sized lotions these lotions are made from an hemp plastic that hem plastic is dejar we know that we're giving out a lot of samples we know that we're providing a lot of awesome products to people and so we don't want to really pollute the environment so we've gone ahead and made em plastics additionally with our hemp plastics we've made a mask so this mask can be reused the filter that's actually in the mask is additionally hemp it's a head mat and it has charcoal in between it so two layers mashed together to create a filter and this mask was a prototype that we put together we didn't end up going to market with it just simply because there's been a lot of business for the companies that develop this extrusion process they've been focused very much in the medical industry with our current pandemic obviously in producing plastics that meets the need of of those organizations as opposed to the head plastic so it's become secondary in the markets demand and then finally we have one of our other byproducts or one of our other products that we're working towards and it's our hempcrete the hempcrete is very strong very resistant now hempcrete is just a combination of a couple of items normally concrete has sands and silts and rocks and other things that are within it in this case we only have about four major components water my and all of that's mixed together and it creates a nice strong structure however is not as strong as the concrete that's in our driveway in order to accommodate that I think you have to be able to mix in a number of other items to be sands and other things so unfortunately I'm not a concrete guy I am just a heme farmer and and we're trying to find other ways for our farmers to be able to reuse these byproducts you", "jFhDRvBzQ8g": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you",

Let me know why share the video Don't forget to stay to the end because there is CBD there so full spectrum CBD oil is a type of CBD oil So if you're not really sure what CBD oil is in general, you can check out the video in the card above Basically CBD is one of 104 cannabinoids which are chemical compounds found in the cannabis plant These cannabinoids are particularly Medicinally useful for things like pain recovery mental clarity Inflammatory relief depression and anxiety relief and a ton of other cool stuff CBD is really helpful for humans full-spectrum CBD oil is CBD oil that has been extracted from the cannabis plant which includes all of the chemical compounds that the plant produces this includes terpenes flavonoids cannabinoids fatty acids and even THC when you extract all of the compounds from cannabis in Context of each other. They're more beneficial for you therapeutically Did you say that was th seed that now I did say there's THC in there Some people want THC free oils and that's totally understandable but a lot of times the THC content in a Seabee full-spectrum CBD oil is actually Point 3 percent or less so it's a trace amount of THC at best and it's not going to get you high You're not gonna feel any of the effects of that but it is going to help with the context of all the medicinal benefits that all the cannabinoids terpenes and flavonoids have for within that CBD or full-spectrum CBD oil is different from broad-spectrum CBD oil and CBG isolate exactly as it sounds is 99.9% CDD it usually comes in a powder looks a little bit like cocaine, but it's not cocaine It's CBD. It has wonderful healing effects for you but you do put it on your gums or under your tongue broad spectrum CBD oil is a CBD oil that has been doctored to contain many of the cannabinoids terpenes or flavonoids But they are usually select by whoever's mixing them or producing them and very generally speaking Broad-spectrum CBD oils and never have THC not even a little bit So you might ask why should I care? because full-spectrum CBD oil is actually clinically proven to be more beneficial for you than CBD isolate or even broad-spectrum a study that I'm going to put in the link in the description compared CBD isolate effectiveness to Full-spectrum effectiveness, they found that CBD was producing anti-inflammatory and anti What when they increase the dose there was a drop-off in the effectiveness they then remedied this by adding CBD to a full plant extract full-spectrum CBD and the dosage and effectiveness both rised together so like I was saying CBD in the context of all of the chemicals that the plant cannabis Produces is more effective than CBD itself, and I just wanted to show you guys this it's not Super relevant, but it is relevant. There's a website that has a terpene slider so you can go see what effects you want And then it will tell you what terpenes and flavonoids that you should get in your oils That's pretty freakin. Cool cannabis has over 400 known chemical compounds that it produces the majority of medicinal benefits come from cannabinoids like cannabidiol and THC terpenes and flavonoids also have medicinal benefits, but they're not unique to cannabis A lot of essential oils are actually made from terpenes and flavonoids These chemical compounds are generally responsible for the way that a plant or oil smells or tastes Flavonoids are more responsible for the things but pigmentation as well So what colors are in your plant because full-spectrum CBD oil comes from a certain plant. It is actually very important to know what strain your CBD oil is coming from so You know what specific medicinal or therapeutic properties that you're getting in that oil because it's relevant to the genetics of the strain of cannabis That it came from that's what I got for you guys today except for one more thing Which is a link in the description to get some broad-spectrum CBD oil from a veteran-owned American company that sells CBD called pure American hemp oil Try them out first link in the description below and generally thank you guys so much for listening once again I appreciate your time.

ball with 250 milligrams of CBD that's 2.5 percent of the liquid is CBD here we've got 100 mil bottle if that had the same amount of CBD in the hundred mil bottle it'd be point two five percent so that means don't spend more money just because it's a bigger bottle spend if it's got more CBD yeah number two hemp oil CBD low they are not the same thing do not confuse the two with the same hemp oil is way cheaper hemp oil has much much much lower levels of CBD so if you see a bulb with a really high amount of hemp oil and it's still cheap it's because it should be it's got this much CBD in it don't confuse it to number three three number three don't vape CBD oil a liquids are not called oils oil is oil a liquid is a liquid you get CBD oils to find your tongue CBE liquids to vape you do not want to be vaping CBD oil so that's number three don't vape see videos also a liquids are way more bioavailable what was by available me professor bioavailable means your body absorbs they're not better so if you put a drop on your tongue goes into your stomach gets absorbed for your at SIDS and all your hamburgers and your vegetarian sausage rolls and your pigs in blankets and your muesli and then it goes in your blood system whereas you vape it goes into your lungs those strains your capillaries into your blood system that's what being bioavailable means so if you faint CBD liquids more bioavailable just don't pay just don't feet you see video oils number for putting nicotine in your CBD liquid nicotine degrade CBD so if you get a CBD shot of nicotine included give it back to the shopkeeper you want your CBD as CBD came without nicotine number five is the right kit and the right tank for CBD CBD a liquid is pretty runny so if you use a big tank with a big coil the chances are it's going to come straight out the air holes all over your pocket your hands and your device that's expensive so use a simple little device like a pod system or a starter kit the best thing about it is they're also cheaper so if you get sold a big fancy flash kit for CBD vaping give it back to the shopkeeper and asking for a pod kit hi guys I hope you found this CBD video useful if you did please

like to hang out in things that are nonpolar so polar things like water Canada extracts won't mix into so what's commonly used to meet tinctures are things like like alcohol or with a lot more common these days is a type of oil coconut oil sesame oil olive oil I've seen lots of different oil blends butter as some tums but the extract needs a fat to bind to in order to be carried to get into your body and so the tinctures are a great example of that you eating sure and you swallow it it goes into your stomach and your stomach acids and your enzymes start breaking down these fats and start getting to the CBD that's mixed in with them and that CVD has to be carried through just like anything else at uni it's carried through your stomach and then the intestinal tract where it's absorbed into your bloodstream and then that happens the root sends it basically through the liver which is your body starts to break down whatever it can you know the livers job is to take anything that he thinks might be unhealthy for you and break it down and when cannabidiol CBD hits the liver you have enzymes in your liver that notice that it's not something that's naturally occurring in your body but something exterior and so it tries to break it down so say that you eat maybe 100 milligram dose of Kingstree after it's digested in the body goes through your intestinal tract and is broken down you know in the stomach acid and then kids the enzymes and start to get broken down in your liver you may only get maybe somewhere between 40 to 60 milligrams that are actually sent out from the liver and distributed to tissues in your bloodstream so humans have been using hemp and cannabis as remedies for ailments for a long time and the way we normally administer them is called the parental administration and what that means is your mom or your dad can give it to a sick kid in an easy way and so that normally like eyedroppers or nasal spray are obviously tincture you know something that you can put in your mouth or hold under your tongue or some for some unfortunate children suppositories and basically the way that humans have dosed themselves with hemp and this for like the last two thousand years have been very basic what I would call rudimentary parental administration techniques the way that Charlotte Figi was originally being treated for her CBD style with an artist Oh and so that was an ethanol extract of cannabis and that was given to her and in an oil form or in an alcohol base and that's not much different than what the Romans was out there caring for themselves in order to use cannabis to its full potential so we tried to develop a nano encapsulate to really try and fix some of the dosing issues that are classically found the cannabis and so instead of just being the oil like the tincture the piano is in oil in water emulsion and what that really means is there's oil droplets very very small oil droplets that are suspended in water like balloons floating in air and the little balloons inside hold all of our CBD we make these little balloons so small we're talking about nanometers in size we know that's why we call it our nano formula but an inner meter means one one billions of a meter and our particles are coming in somewhere between maybe fifty three and maybe a hundred nanometers that is very very small it's in fact it's so small that the particles themselves can slip between the spaces of your cells and so when you put this nano on your tongue which is delivered as a pump gel you put the Nano on your tongue and immediately the oil droplets are slipping right through the spaces in yourself and being delivered directly into the bloodstream almost as if they have been injected and with this method you can bypass the metabolism of the liver that destroys that good portion of your active molecule and so we can deliver a smaller dose of active molecule but we can ensure that the doses that we administer are almost fully absorbed in the body and so you don't have to worry about eating a hundred to get somewhere between forty and sixty if you eat five effective milligrams you get about five of EPs notes it gives you a lot more precise control over when you dose when you expected to kick in and how long it lasts which is you know between the tincture and the Nano the Nano further standardizes how our body metabolizes it by illuminating a few variables between tincture and nano so the effects of single doses can be a lot more predictable you", "8JVnDYV3k_g": "essential CBD extract is a multi cure medicinal supplement

hello I'm Jennifer here extract flats in Boulder Colorado today we're going to talk about our cvd t-shirt I'll go over a few of our options we know it can be confusing so we're going to make this as simple as possible we have two different strengths regular extra strength three different sizes 15 30 and 60 ml and now we offer four different flavors original lemon mango and raspberry to keep it as simple as possible our regular strength options are all the same strength solution just different size bottles so you'll see increased from five hundred to a thousand to two thousand this is all 33 milligrams of CBD per ml whereas our extra strength is also you know same solution different sizes 66 milligrams of CBD per ml now I'll show you how easy it is to take our t-shirt we recommend taking 1 to 2 ml one to two times a day with each bottle every dropper as much as you can fill up it's going to be approximately one milliliter of solution or DVD match I'm going to take a half of an ml you want to take this as a sublingual which means you hold it underneath your tongue or approximately 30 seconds and they say it helps increase the absorption rate so here we go it's a little awkward for the video you and that's it all you got to do easy as taking a tincture be sure to subscribe so you can stay tuned for all of our entertaining CBD content and educational videos of course we're

for short, is an oil derived from cannabis. It contains none of the psychoactive ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol or THC, so there is no \u2018high\u2019 from it. But the many health benefits claimed for CBD including: reducing inflammation, pain relief and reducing anxiety has seen its use in foods, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics become one of the fastest growing trends in the process industry. Silverson high speed, high shear mixers are increasingly being used for R&D and small scale production in this emerging market. They're ideal for a wide range of applications, including blending, emulsifying, dissolving, disintegrating and powder/liquid mixing. A Silverson can easily mix liquids of widely different viscosities, so high viscosity CBD oil can be blended in a fraction of the time taken by conventional mixers. One of the main production challenges is dispersing the oil into aqueous systems such as beverages, as minimising the droplet size is the key to maximising the yield of the active ingredient. With a Silverson this can be achieved almost instantaneously. The same goes for other ingredients such as flavouring essences which can be difficult to disperse. For emulsions such as creams and lotions, the high shear action of a Silverson mixer finely disperses the droplets to give a stable emulsion with a typical droplet size of 2 - 5 microns. Finer emulsions down to 0.5 microns can also be achieved, depending on the formulation. By simply changing the workhead, the mixer can also be used to perform many other operations such as preparation of gels and sugar solutions, disintegrating solids and incorporating powdered ingredients such as stabilisers and other supplements. Another advantage of Silverson mixers is scaling up from the laboratory to full production is a straight forward process, as all our mixers are engineered to the same fine tolerances and exceptional quality we have been known for, for over 70 years. Whether you're looking to make beverages, gummies, snacks, baked goods or creams, shampoos, lotions or capsules, a Silverson mixer offers the most versatile and efficient solution to your mixing requirements.

is a user manual included this manual has tons of information on how to run the extractor properly complete with parts lists and flow diagrams like that I mean you know we have a silicon slick pad we have an extra gasket set some propane or butane stickers design your reactor just know that they are propane and butane machines we have a can piercer this is used for small cans of butane put them right in here this little needle will pierce the can and you can safely hook up a hose to here and then use the valve or some sort and we have an HVAC hose yeah those are vacuum pump over here we're going to use this to pull a vacuum on the entire extractor after it's packed up with material I'll leave that to the side obviously right here is our extractor it's a one pound Apollo they come with this LP tank here our tank is already loaded with about 10 pounds of butane and we're going to use 6 into this extractor I'm going to start packing my column take off the top clamp first this clamp here the single pin we showed no power with this let's see inside you have a screen at the bottom and a hard to see without a light but that'll keep our our material from going straight through to the base so they start putting my and material and I'm gonna use this here it'd be a lot easier because I don't feel anything I had ops that were previously vacuum to a different episode I'm gonna take these and so I put them in the phone pull out any sticks or any garbage at all one in there so this extractor will work with any botanical material my agent hops here for demonstration every so often I'm going to take off my funnel I'm going to use this column Packer has a hole right here for air relief make sure that's lined up before you start can use this push the material down far as I can I want to pack as much as I can in this column this will help to make the butane take longer to get through and it will saturate the material better if you would like you can use a hammer to smack down the top of the rod I bet one recommended Deborah mallet just so you don't cause damage to anything put the funnel back and woman here is going [Music] [Music] [Music] cap back on we're using a three inch single pinion clamp this clamp is rated to over 150 psi we should have no problems here to turn it tighter can use a screwdriver or any random allen wrench will do tighten it up now to start my run I need to tear out my butane make sure I'm going to have a clean scale with nothing else on it I'm just going to sweep everything off so included in this kit is a ve 160 vacuum pump we have our vacuum pump on this side of this orange hose we ran it through the wall because he's functional explosion-proof we can't have them in the occlusion booth you can see our pump over there he should only be used on an empty system with no v10 inside of it and you think going through the pump could cause minor fires or explosions even so we're going to open up the vacuum valve I'm going to turn on the pumps and they see this gauge go down it's going to evacuate the entire system of air we do this after we pack our column because if it was not packed yet we got to open it again that wouldn't be possible so after a report complete vacuum will start running the system close to negative thirty inch of the moti I'm gonna turn on after closing the vacuum valve of course okay now this line doesn't matter anymore you can leave it on if you like or you can take it off stay relevant to us at this point so what I'm going to do first is I'm going to tear my scale so this is a intrinsically safe battery-powered scale I'm going to use it the way out my butane as it goes through the system this system can hold about six pounds of butane we put about 1.1 pound material in the column so that should be plenty to extract this system here is known as the top fill means you can only put liquid butane through the top of it there's no manifold to go it bottom up can only top down I'm going to open up my liquid port here just now even liquid butane rushing through this line when I open this valve it's going to shoot it through the column you can immediately see our gauge is going to start going up in pressure as butane is added to the system can even see our column so it's get pretty cold with the butane rushing through so as you can see we still have our scale moving down is set negative four point one right now and drop in which means you have four point two pounds of butane in our system if your scale does not move down at this rate or it even stops before it gets this low it means you have some kind of vapor lock in your system which can be due to your temperatures or pressures this can be solved usually just by adding some warmth to your tank so I'm going to give it a little demo right here what I would do is get a bucket of warm water I would put the butane right inside of it and make it warm this would help us to boil off more butane and increase the pressure in the LP tank so we're just about adds negative six pounds which means six pounds to evacuate our LP tank into our extractor there we go I'm going to turn off the liquid valve now in top valve our tractors so there you go that's how you run an extractor all the oil is then pushed through we're going to get a little look inside the sight glass here you can see that earlier resin is a mixture of our oil with butane still in it next step of the process is to recover all our butane back into our LP tank and this is going to be done by using Bernie's a passive system which means there's no recovery point it's just going to be different so the temperature recovery phase I'm going to dump this whole extractor into my hot water shown by the red box hot water is going to heat up the butane and build pressure and that's going to make it easy to recover through this line here this right here in our LP tank we're going to put ice and water I'd recommend using dry ice and ethanol that'll be the quickest way to recover because you'll have the lowest pressure in your LP tank somebody dumped some ice and it's just some cold water but you could use that's all here and dry ice which we recommend it now that I have all my materials put into the bucket on the scale after tearing the scale once again and this time we're going to see the scale go positive that'll be the amount of butane recovered from the base of the system into the LP tank so first I'm going to open up the valve from my base and then open up the gas Inlet under our P tank passive recovery is a bottleneck of the process we also have units that use active recovery we can use units that use chillers and heaters for better heat and cooling there's all kinds of things you can do for your covering and then point out a few things and we can do for upgrades on the system one great upgrade to be a ball valve right under the material column a ball valve here would allow you to soak the column in butane before you dump it into the base this will maximize your yield another comment and update will be high pressure clamps if you'd like to use higher pressures or you the propane blend you should use high pressure clamps and that will allow you to do so we can use metagraph sites as well that will also allow for higher pressure use a polycarbonate currently we're only about 30 psi that's not a big sell a large psi we also have the car for you pumps such as at SEMA this grill will take bed in the middle of this line here it will pull from the base and push ends in the collection this will speed up your recovery as well so I'm just gonna let this recover for a while you may take up to an hour or so I'm not really sure but all the pens on your heating and cooling thanks for watching today stay tuned we'll show you our end product soon", "4_pIn9DeP-4": "yes we make this dvd-based from this machine with my plan mr. wall yes and it's very nice I think I think", "ngWuODwllSs": "[Music] each CBD

using a rosin press now we're using the my press portable rosin press today they're also a sponsor of Raphael studios if you use the code roughhouse at my rosin press calm you'll get an exclusive discount and also you'll be helping to support Rafal studios here's what you'll need to do this you would need a rosin press of course and you'll need some high CBD hemp we'll talk more about that in a second you need some parchment paper a pollen press a cold pack that you'll want to freeze in advance you need a scraper tool we use that to scrape up the oil at the end and also a scale now when it comes to the materials what you want is to probably get hemp the hip is high CBD in this case it is 16.7 6% which is really high in CBD and it has a 0.23% of THC very lows to eat THC so this would be good for our purposes the first step is going to be to preheat the press we're going to use a pretty high temperature of 220 degrees Fahrenheit that's higher than I would normally use for cannabis for this experiment today we're going to be pressing 2 grand pressing and then a 1 gram pressing so first you'll want to weigh out your head and then you will put it into the pollen press and then you add in the weights and then some pollen presses have a little t-bar this is just a simple screw together on both sides but you screw together really tightly as tightly as you can and then when you press it out you have a nice concise puck that'll press a lot more efficiently now you want to take that puck and you want to place it in your parchment paper I would recommend using 2 layers I'm only using one in this demonstration but that's not how I know you need probably to use 2 because it can bleed through because it's a real hot temperature and then once you have your puck centered in the parchment we're going to now place it in the press and you're also going to Center it and depress and now we're going to what I call a pre press and then over the next say 30 to maybe 45 seconds we're going to be slowly lowering the lever adding a little bit more pressure every few seconds and not to a fully press it yet but just this is to allow the heat to distribute through so for about 30 seconds we're going to pre press and let that heat fill all the way through from top to bottom on that after the 30 seconds or 45 seconds you're going to finally close down the lever and give it a full press after about 30 seconds or so of that you'll start to see the hemp oil protruding it from around the edges and it'll bubble and run and you'll want to leave this on full press for one to two minutes because we're using a high temperature you don't want to go too long because you don't want to burn off all your terpenes but it is more tolerant than cannabis is and you can see we got a really good yield there so the next step is the cooling step and normally I would have not opened it up and removed the puck to show the camera like I did a second ago I would have taken it directly from the press and put it right until they folded over a compressed bag like you see there and let it chill for about one minute and what that will do is to slow down the heating process and to preserve our curve beans in our flavor profile the next step is to scrape it off and collect it I find doing that with the compress as a backing to the paper makes it a lot easier to remove the oil and you see I garnered about 11 percent yield on that first pressing with the 2 grams then I pressed a 1 gram pressing of the same hip and I can see now I did I have that less of a yield but with one grandma have a better percentage of a yield and in fact on that one I got just at 17% yield a really great deal so it's really happy with the way that my press did it pressing the CBDs if you'd like

extraction summer the process begins with a pressure checked full solvent delivery tank the solvent has been placed in the tank and it has been pre chilled or heated to the desired starting temperature the solvent delivery tank has just recovered the solvent from a prior run and should be cold to start for volatile extractions we recommend normal butane Desmet cleaned by distillation using the tanishav extractor step 1 attach your solvent delivery lines connect one end of the summit delivering line to the top of the solvent delivery tanks liquid siphon centered exit valve connect the other end of the solvent delivery line to the top of the column liquid Center inlet valve step 2 attention recovery lines connect one of the three ends on the recovery line to the top of the column vapor outlet on the side and the top of the extractor tank vapor outlet as indicated connect the third end to the recovery line to the recovery tank vapor inlet valve step 3 begin extracting after your solvent or solvents have been combined and set to your desired solvent temperature in your summit delivery tank you can then use the heat input on the solvent delivery tank to create the head pressure to expel solvent from the liquids - line and the solvent delivery tank into the column of the plant material to prime with a full liquid saturation soak at any desired temperature for any length of time note solvent temperatures will not increased by the heat use to create the head pressure so long as a solvent is allowed to expel from the tank during heat input to perform a temperature controlled extraction leave the solid delivery tank liquid outlet valve closed during heat input until you reach your solvent temperature setting commonly ranging from negative 40 to 120 Fahrenheit to perform a low temperature traction you can omit closing the solvent delivery valve it can be left open until the solvent delivery tank is completely empty as low as five minutes total contact times can be achieved before starting a full recovery of all the solvent from both the extractor tank and column of plant material why do only liquid solvent extractions require four times more solvent than the column we hold the first volume of solvent that enters a column is a solvent that does 90% of the extraction and has also absorbed into the plant matter and will not exit to the remaining solvent from the solvent delivery tank washes it out the second body mixing slightly with the first and the third volume mixes slightly with the second and so on it is known that by the third and fourth volumes very little desired compounds will remain in the plant matter that is a third volume of solvent that washes the plant clean of any dissolved compound the fourth volume stays in the plant matter and must be recovered from that position although these volumes are mentioned that separate actions however they float through one continuous cycle step 4 soaking once you observe the solvent flow out the bottom of the column into the extractor tank you can stop filling by closing the inlet valve on top of the column closing his mouth creating a hydraulic vacuum on the top of the column that holds the solvent in the column area the filter below prevents the liquid solvent from exiting the column this will allow you to soak the column what solvent for specific time at a specific temperature to target specific compounds if no slope times desired keep the column inlet valve open until the solvent delivery tank is completely empty step 5 starting recovery open the outlet valve and the extractor tank the Ilyn bond the recovery tank and the connecting valves on both recovery tanks if both are being used to recover in a series using both recovery tanks cuts your recovery times in half by doubling the condensation surface area open the top column vapor outlet valve blasts until it has had time to drain sufficiently preventing any solvent from bypassing the column be sure your extractor tank heater is set 95 210 Fahrenheit and your column is 5 degrees warmer to help the heat penetrate into the plant matter remember there is no liquid inside the column to help transfer those BTUs to the core although the column is smaller it will take just as long to evaporate all the solvent absorbed inside key note it is imperative to safety that all butane is evaporated from economy the process is designed so the column finishes first so long as you use a 1/2 for loading ratio step 6 draining into the sucker dryer tank just prior to recovering all the solvent from the extractor tank use was remaining to drain your extract into your sucker tank where the final phase of recovery can take place afterwards the tank can be relocated to another work area where it can be dried down to zero parts per million readings of any trade solvent step 7 closing the wafer valve and removing the column while waiting to recover the final trace amount of solvent into the same recovery tank from your dryer tank you can break the system down to expel your spent column of plant material and reload it to perform another extraction or you can have a pre loaded column ready to go emptying the column is an easy job with the removal corporation plate that expels the columns content from below if you have not closed your wafer valve already be sure and close your way from up on your extractor tank to seal it so you can safely remove the column to prevent fill in the work area with flammable vapors expelled from the extractor tank this also prevents solvent loss from the solvents that filled and vapor lock to your tank the extractor tank is self-cleaning and will never need to be cleaned so long as you drain it into the secretary it is common to perform as many as 5 extractions and 4 recoveries before opening the sucker dryer tank to access your finished product this allows you to eliminate unnecessary steps involved in removing your product from the dryer tank when extracting repetitively from the same material the second tank also served as a dryer tank to clean your final product of all residual solvents step 8 we're sealing and press or checking any open tanks any open tanks will need to be pressure checked again this will be the sucker tank once cleaned and resealed and the column once filled and resealed the air pressure checked again each time because those are the tanks that have had their seals broken if you do not drain your extract out of the extractor tank into your sucker tank you will need to reseal that tank and pressure check it after removing your extract from the extractor tank choosing not to drain your extract from the extractor tank into the sucker tank has not recommended for safety reasons as well as

got going we're going to introduce itto our newest product just one to start out here so anybody that hasn't been to our office can see it's more of a shop than anything else this is lovely Colorado this is our front door and says extract craft if anybody ever kind of comes and wants to check it out I'll take you through a little tour this is the walk-in doors it's all our boxes this is Colby's Colby's den testing room manufacturing all kinds of Mad Science back there this is my office so I'm gonna start in here just because I can use my phone to get more kind of mobile and better angles to kind of introduce you to ito and then after I get done with this I'm gonna shut this live off and we're going to go to a Facebook live off the computer because it's got a better angle the kind of static angle to kind of have Colby maybe run through a little demonstration so without further ado oh and there's Goku it's a wonderful day in the name and here's ito so this is the this is the big bad boy he folds four liters you can see the control panel we've got the still have the green button the control panel shows the control ability for the temperature so it's going to go anywhere from 96 degrees up to 105 for maximum performance that 105 point is going to through four liters in about two and a half to three hours which will demonstrate here after a while this is the pot which we call the kettle get a little whole screen back for it this is the pot that holds the four liters plus kind of comes out like a normal cook pot with the plug side rails for a really good stability the dimensions are approximately 22 across 19 deep and above 12 i weighs about 35 to 40 pounds fully packed it's gonna be about 45 pounds oh okay there's no family vanillite it's a model Vanna Colby so what else anything else no let's get started okay so I'm going to turn the camera around and Colby's going to demonstrate doing the hops extraction but what we're gonna do is we'll show kind of how we load it how it gets going the pumps start going for a while then it pumps down it's gonna be about two and a half hours so we'll cut out once it starts going and we'll check in periodically just update to show you kind of how the how the how the progress performance how the performance actually moves and it's fast so without further ado Coby cheese tonight so what what we did is we got basically you know what is pretty close to four liters because I think this is about the two liter mark so we got about four litres of hops so we soak this last night so we're just gonna put all of this in here and get this there we go so as you can see Tory Anya shot us so you can see like how close it comes to the room so that is 4 litres there so next we're gonna start the process we have a little holder back here for our lid because our lid stays attached so basically same kind of design we have the rubber slant and built into the lid so this and then it slants it backwards to - what would you call this our vacuum port vacuum port there you go and so then we need a jar here now basically what we do is we're going to create a vacuum here and here so this isn't really finalized but we will have a different lid but right now this is where we wrap so really what we do is we're gonna set to where to where we want so we're gonna set it at a full extraction so that's going to get us right at that 1:05 mark maybe 103 somewhere in there and that's really where we want to be when we're doing especially a full pot like this we want to make sure that we're doing a full full extraction so we simply hit the button which the nice thing about this is you're still going to be able to set your altitude just like the source turbo so same thing hold the button for 10 seconds you know blinks 10 times and and then push whatever you want you know for whatever elevation you're at 1000 mm so same thing you'll be able to set that elevation so for now we everything's good so we're just going to start it [Music] that's nice [Music] and then once these two to get [Music] between but as you can see it starts moving along pretty quickly it doesn't take too long the heater all build in here will begin to get this heated up what a cool thing this thing mr. replay once that so once that reclaims done are you gonna do is put the top on the jar and store it easy-peasy hold on back Toby you know we basically just have a line that runs down all your reclaimed going [Music] corner down fast we can basically do this [Music] Galla charge here where you can use the half gallon jug use the half gallon jars you're going to need to stop this process when it gets to that fifteen hundred you know lead there were no liters of alcohol and exchange simply to stop the process will tell you that later on here we go but but if you had a whole gallon jar even just [Music] so pumps are still it's up you down getting vacuum but already we're starting to condense on the inside of the glass the nice thing with with Edo and then we have the sort of terrible night really allows us fans already we're pretty much pretty much a rapid boil [Music] first 20 years first and 15 kind of warming it up once you picked about the half-hour mark that's when you productive really yep the system vapor three convincing [Music] alcohol before it can get back in here what that 20 minute mark who really started seeing a kick-out okay so now the pumps are shut off and so now we're just heating and boiling and evaporating and at this stage the pumps will only kick on occasionally just to just to control if you can pull that back in back down so I think at this point we'll let it go we'll get it started I think you've got the idea of how it works how it starts we'll come back in ten or fifteen minutes once that production starts ramping up and kind of show you the flow of the ethanol flowing into the reclaim and then we'll take another break for a while and come back kind of when it's about done and show you how it's going there thank you all very much we'll see you back very very soon appreciate you checking it out bye hello everybody this is the third part of our video documentary on the introduction of Ito Pro this quick update on the progress and here's Kolby to give you the update sup guys okay as you can see we're about 25 minutes in we're sitting about probably with 350 an hour 50 milliliters already collected nice and nice and clear and then just cruising away on the inside you know evaporating pretty fast now that the heat exchangers filled up it just keeps filling this this jar up so this won't stop till you need to stop it switch out the charge but basically we're we're cruising right along here so three hundred and fifty milliliters in about 25 minutes so doing pretty pretty good work but yeah we'll just keep running this we're gonna just keep coming back live keep showing you kind of where we're at throughout the process when we need to switch we'll show you how we just switch it's pretty simple we just have to process but we'll go through that later but until then we will just keep that breathing so we are back we ran our end I accidentally just just hit the button but that's alright so we're at about a thousand milliliters after the first hour that because we have that twenty minutes before the heat exchanger starts kicking out so basically you know cruising right along here as you can see you know still there we go now we're gonna empty it out a little bit so when you shut it off it's gonna drain out of the heat exchanger so we just kind of give you a little idea here what that looks like so you can see it starts filling it up pretty quick already up to about 1250 so yeah I mean it kicks out quite a bit out of the heat exchanger still still coming off the lines so and then we we can simply just turn it back on so you can stop to start the process [Music] you'll switch this out you know you don't have to release the bathroom stop time you stop it's going to be back in we always have to keep in mind when you start / stop you don't simply because [Music] the rest of the team anytime just make sure you have plenty of room can you kick back out and plus that system other than that we're we're still back in a little bit kind of keep showing you the progression Oh campers this is the fifth segment of our Ito launch demo I was coming up on an hour and a half so we're going to show you basically where we're at an hour and a half basically like 1.75 so it's gonna be about two liters including what we're gonna clear out of the heat exchanger when we open it up so Kobe's going to show you where we are and how to change that reclaim jar as you can see everything shuts down now if we were to wait a couple minutes the vacuum will release on its own or we can actually hit the button and will release the vacuum before then the light will flash and then you can hear it all back so then the rest of the alcohol comes out of the heat exchanger so one thing you always have to keep in mind is anytime you start and stop the process like mid process like this and you you clean out this heat exchanger a foot you know pushes it all out when you go to restart it it's got to refill the heat exchanger so that's why in that first 20 minutes it always takes a little bit just to even get it going so you'll see that when you go to restart it's not instantly going to start filling the jar it's got to refill the heat exchanger first so once the vacuum release is quick we simply move to a new jar set this one off we're good there and then we set this guy up and now we just go ahead and start it back up there back in here first we're trying to what now I can touch this he's kind of creepy when he touches things anyways yeah we're back to [Music] first probably another half-hour or so everybody's the final segment of the ITO introduction debut and Colby's getting ready to harvest the hop oil that we've been making we're right at about the three hour mark and here comes Colby okay okay so we are already in as you can see this is the two mil or two thousand milliliter mark so we're just short we're down to oil it's basically just kind of bubbling away so we're gonna go ahead and stop the process and then we're gonna release the vacuum so we push the button again light flashes vacuum comes out heat exchanger is gonna kick out quality like the bubbles I do like the bubbles I love the bubbles actually okay we're about done here vacuum comes right off set that off gather second jar all of our alcohol back leg comes off back we have our oil move that off that it's thick just take a nice spatula here just clean off the bottom you can see how thick and that oil is let's just put it right in here and keep in mind this is hops oil but I can that smells delicious probably should have the smaller spatula but that's alright okay try to get the rest of this here if you got a better tool like a little bit smaller of a spatula it'll probably work a little bit easier that's good enough for now so the easiest way to clean this then is just add a little bit more alcohol back and just use your special and swish it around and pick up the oil and then just have a little side container of that oil that you can evaporate later so no waste you don't have to waste anything then so that's our pot this is our nice thick oil as you can see okay so assuming we cleaned out our chamber here got all the oil out of it and everything this is what you'll be able to do afterwards so you'll be able to slide on a pot or your pot and then we are going to have an additional this is what's going to allow you to breathe easy neato basically what you'll be able to do is hook up your secondary pump and your lid will have a gauge you don't have everything you need and you'll be able to turn this over to purge so this is where we have extract and then we have purge so we'll be able to move it down here to purge which purge will allow you to purge between I believe 96 and 110 so you can set it to wherever you'd like set in actually the temperatures will be 80 degrees to 110 but that don't get I'm sorry 96 is extract that's right so 80 to 110 you'll be able to hook up your secondary pump and vacuum this down to a full vacuum and then use purge as your heated chamber and you can use parchment paper you can use well who knows maybe we'll design something for you but you'll be able to just it you know purge out of here and control the muffin you know with your with your control there you will need the secondary pump and the lid that will provide additional so the machine won't come with it it'll be just for people that actually want that we assume that most people that are doing large extraction like this will probably have some of that equipment already but otherwise you know you can also get the lid in the pump later on but but that's basically you know in a nutshell so about three hours you to get you right around that 4 liter mark in three hours be able to purge it down purge after oil make your make whatever you want after that but throw it get anything a good demo all I got is good day a demo thanks for everybody for watching and if you've got any questions anything else you know where to get us at extract craft comm or get email at info and extract craft calm always happy to help give this call please so on the back of the machine there's an extra line that we've added or super tech-savvy it goes on the top all of this goes on top oh yeah Oh super tech-savvy no as the event site sorry guys or super tech-savvy or super tech-savvy okay anyways since we all have the right fitting we change that on us super tech-savvy", "QKaETKN8Qvc": "now to our new serious prescription free pain relief one in five Americans suffer from chronic pain many are now using CBD for relief google reports six and a half million searches for information in just one month and Becky Worley visited a CBD dispensary to take a closer look Melissa McCarthy reportedly uses it on her feet Gronk says it's changed his life for the first time in more than a decade I am pain free CBD lotions you rub on your skin to reduce pain the idea is that by rubbing it on it's absorbed through the skin and it could impact joint or muscle pain just ask athlete ally Stoddart I played rugby for 15 years I play soccer now I got a lot of pain Ally a cannabis health and wellness consultant says she prefers CBD the non psychoactive part of the cannabis plant to over-the-counter painkillers I weighed a couple of minutes and literally it just kind of eases away but amidst the endorsements and hype what are you actually buying and where you can buy CBD creams online but to be honest it's confusing the dosages are all over the place so I head to the havahart dispensary in Oakland California where they can explain what's being offered plus whether it's intentional or just ironic this legal marijuana dispensary is directly across the street from the Oakland Police Department co-owner Josh chase shows me the products they sell we pretty much offer every single type of CBD that one could find in any form what's really interesting to me is how few claims these products make and that may be because the FDA forbids medical claims for products we're rigorous studies haven't been done was really up to the consumers to up to the patients to educate themselves and make sure that the products that they're purchasing are of safe quality or from a reputable source but keep in mind if you do shop in a dispensary do you take credit cards so we make sure that we do everything by the book by the city and state's law and everything is cash so this is something you want to try do your homework and bring cash for Good Morning America Becky Worley Oakland California good thing to remember I thought I Thank You Becky dr. Jenn Ashton is here for more will do viewer questions today and the first one comes from Adria from New Jersey let's take a look hi dr. Ashton I've heard a lot of people using CBD oil for things like stress anxiety muscle soreness but I'm wondering how does it actually work could they be making it up Thanks great question that is a great question and right now it's really about what we know and what we don't know the bulk of the pain literature in peer-reviewed data comes out of Israel and Canada but everyone is researching this and I think it's based on this understanding George of this endocannabinoid system and if you look at the wall we have at least two receptors that are called cannabinoid receptors one heavily concentrated in the brain that's related to the perception of pain cb2 receptors located all over the body and the confusion here with respect to pain is that THC which is the psychoactive component of cannabis yes it fits into that cb1 receptor but khat CBD also fits in does not give you a psychoactive effect that is really important but it there is data that it can help you see a lot of the prices say no THC exactly okay we have another question coming in on Twitter this is from Susan she says I've seen 300 600 1200 and 2,000 milligrams how do I know what does to try and what do we know about the dosing here we see the different ones here yeah wild wild west George and here's the thing in in terms of official recommendations so far the only group that has guidelines out is the Arthritis Foundation their recommendation is to start with as few milligrams as possible under the tongue twice a day if you're not seeing an effect over days and weeks increase its slowly and if you're noticing any unwanted side effects obviously stop and talk to your provider the concept here is start low and go slow and it's a lot of trial and error it's not one side and this is not a beer question it's my question I guess is there any any concern about dependency there not as much dependency but you always have to take into account risks when you talk about pharmacology if you're getting a good effect you have to be on the lookout of any unwanted negative effects and right now those risks are low but as always talk to your provider if you are using any of these projects and

Brian Boyd reporting for Internet deputy in this investigative report we are going to expose a multi-billion dollar cannabis and hemp blunder Forbes magazine claims the cannabis and hemp industry is heading towards a 100 billion dollar business if we told you the CBD and canvas oil infrastructure is about to become obsolete would you believe it if this is true you can bet this report is going to get some serious resistance we're talking about companies worldwide who have invested millions into manufacturing equipment for the business of making cannabis and hemp extracts literally 100% of the medical cannabis and hemp industry is creating some form of an extract so what's the blunder most viewers watching this video are not aware of the following information that we are going to reveal in this report there are hundreds of CBD and THC oil companies seeking to help people however 100% of these companies who make teachers extracts isolates and concentrates are greatly destroying the healing properties of this amazing natural herb before we proceed with this report we would like to clearly acknowledge that CBD and THC oils have powerful healing properties and the extracted oils have helped thousands of people so if this is true why can this be a blunder it's helping people right but sadly there are seven major blunders that we are going to reveal in this report probably one of the greatest misconceptions about CBD and THC oil is potency the misconception about potency is the number one reason why CBD or THC oils are even made sellers of CBD and THC oils are pushing potency as some kind of medicinal advantage this claim is 100% false stronger or more concentrated oils do not have any benefit compared to a less potent oil so what does high-potency really mean it means it's more concentrated and it takes up less space take a look at this non extracted natural made products called hemp paste this product was made using the whole plant method again this is not an extracted or chemically processed product this one gram scoop equals 30 milligrams of CBD and this CBD oil here also contains 30 milligrams same potency yet the hemp pace was not chemically processed this extracted oil here actually has less medicinal benefits versus the hep paste which we will explain later in this report for example here are 2 500 milligram tablets of vitamin C and here is one 1000 milligram gelcap also of vitamin C both equal one thousand milligrams everybody knows that there is no difference other than having to take 2 tablets instead of one should you the consumer care if it's 30% or 99% potency of course not in the CBD THC oil world you will find companies bragging about having 99.9% pure CBD isolates the misconception when we hear the word pure we think it's a good thing but take note the pure means it contains nothing else but CBD no terpenes or other cannabinoids such as CB g cbn or THC are present there's no full spectrum when it's pure CBD to this day there is no evidence that extracts have any medicinal benefits over the non extracted flower or the whole plant in layman's terms there is no reason or medicinal benefit to extract the oil from the hemp and cannabis plant somehow people assume or ignorantly follow the notion that the natural state of the cannabis or hemp flower is useless unless it was extracted into an oil what confirms this misconception is the majority of cannabis strains contain over 27% THC and if you take one gram a bud and cook it properly you will have about 270 milligrams of active THC this is 27 times the amount that the state of Colorado recomm for a safe dosage anyone who says that you should extract cannabis or hemp is smoking way too much of their own product there are also strains of hemp that contain over 21% CBD ignorantly people are sold on the idea that the stronger the oil the better it works make note the more you concentrate the plan the more you damage the medicine there are seven major blunders that we are going to cover in this investigative report here's blender number one the cannabis extraction process was popularized in 2004 by canadian rick simpson between the phrase RSO or Rick Simpson oil mr. Simpson was the one that came up with the explosive idea of extracting oil from the cannabis plant by using 190 proof alcohol brick simpson's extraction method is to take a pound of marijuana bud and soak it in 190 proof alcohol in a bucket for an hour then straining out the plant bud and throwing the leftover plant matter into the trash leaving what looks like a brownish green tea rick would then put the alcohol mixture into a pan on a stove on high heat and evaporate all the alcohol out until it looks like this a black thick oil known as RSO this process is extremely flammable and dangerous to make and has caused many fires across the world what's ironic about the alcohol extraction method is that the RSO was meant to save lives and yet the explosions have killed people here's ponder number two the entire multibillion-dollar oil industry has since followed the RSO idea of extraction many of the major companies have switched from 190-proof alcohol to butane or co2 extraction are these new extraction methods the future are they safe to eat Troy Shermer a hemp and cannabis researcher contacted 14 different hemp and cannabis lab testing facilities such as analytical 360 in Washington and SC labs in California the main question that Troy asked was how much of the terpenes are lost during butane and co2 extraction the majority of lab testing facilities said that they would not give out that information s/he labs in California mentioned on a phone interview that if they shared such information it would damage their relationship with their clients only two companies answered all the questions and both lab testing companies stated that 99% of the terpenes are destroyed through butane and co2 extractions look at steep hill laboratories email response by the way steep hill laboratories was the most transparent in answering the questions the lab techs said the maximum terpenes destroyed up to 100% but most of the terpenes are lost through butane and co2 extraction co2 extraction is worse than butane destruction in this way he claimed he also made a statement about removing butane from the oil as butane leaves a chemical residue and many experts claim that it is toxic and has harsh synergists which means that it's cancerous if this were true why would L companies sell a product that has carcinogens to people who are fighting cancer blender number three did you know that the majority of CBD and THC oil companies are adding terpenes from fruits and trees to replace the terpenes that were destroyed by extraction these added terpenes are not natural turbines from the hemp or cannabis plant take this orange and the CBD oil if I drop some oil onto this orange am I getting terpenes yes I am they're not the real terpenes from hemp or cannabis what happened to natural did the CBD oil industry follow the footsteps of the pharmaceutical industry it's one hundred percent clear that they did and adding fake terpenes to a natural medicine is deceptive the oil industry will say it's for flavor so why are they really adding terpenes it is clear that the industry has started to recognize how critical the entourage effect is and they're trying to cover the damage done to their products by adding fake terpenes what is the entourage effect we'll cover that in the next segment but first our fake terpene safe even though they come from fruits and trees the Internet deputy has found the following news articles study finds that adding terpenes might make extracts toxic our terpenes enriched cannabis concentrates bad for your health adding terpenes to dads might be toxic blunder number four on taraj effect the CBD oil industry has been producing isolated CBD it's a white powder and it currently is a hot selling product if you look at the CBD isolate here it's 99% pure CBD what this means is that there is nothing left but CBD there is no full spectrum no terpenes no CBD aid nothing left but CBD how does this affect the entourage effect what is the entourage effect back in 2001 the British Journal of pharmacology refers to the entourage effect and synergistic relationship of terpenes in the article taming the THC since then there have been hundreds of articles about the entourage effect scientists and researchers have concluded long ago that the entourage effect or synergistic effects of all the terpenes and cannabinoids together is superior over isolating CBD just one cannabinoid type such as CBD will not have an entourage effect entourage or synergistic means things work together or enhance one another or even better yet they create a completely different set of medicinal benefits since pure CBD has no terpenes or other cannabinoids it is impossible to create an entourage effect it is important to understand the entourage effect and how many added medicinal values it does create when you google search cannabis entourage effect you will find some powerful articles on how important the entourage effect is when it comes to the healing properties in hemp and cannabis as you can see there are many articles on the entourage effect in short you will find evidence that the terpenes and all the cannabinoids work together and have a superior medicinal value so the question is why would the CBD oil industry isolate CBD when it prevents entourage effects and why would they destroy 99% of the terpenes blunder number five what does decarboxylated the hemp and cannabis plant mean heating the hemp and cannabis will remove the a or carbolic acid from CBD a or THC a this is called decarboxylated or activating the cannabinoids both CBD a and CBD are very medicinal in different ways one is raw and one is cooked the main difference is CBD will pass through the blood-brain barrier and will attach to cb1 receptors in your brain but the CBD a will not CBD a is recently gaining popularity in the news regarding its anti proliferative properties known for preventing bad cell growth as found in cancer it's also anti-inflammatory which greatly reduces seizures and pain in short the uncooked or raw state of the plant has major medicinal benefits the CBD and THC oil company's method is to completely cook or decarboxylate the plant as much as possible so that more milligrams of CBD or THC can be sold this destroys even more terpenes thus damaging the medicine let's look at a famous lab testing company called analytical 360 which does thousands of lab tests on CBD oil products click concentrates then sort them by high CBD and select one look at out dark that is the cbda is under 1% which means this product has been completely cooked to death to where it is basically zero CBD a it has been completely decarboxylated and has been processed several times remember CBD a is anti proliferative and anti inflammatory and because it's uncooked it contains over 18 times more terpenes wonder number six there are 118 different kinds of cannabinoids such as CBD and THC and the science is evolving the question is how did the remaining 116 cannabinoids work together what are they and what do they do what happens when we remove or isolate them the race is on to discover what these trace cannabinoids can do for our health let's look at cannabinoid number 17 otherwise known as 17 CA - 5 it is a trace cannabinoid which is difficult to detect under normal lab testing equipment yet researchers are finding that this trace cannabinoid is a precursor for CBD just like how CBD affects THC they work together as you know THC is very beneficial medically but unfortunately it is also illusion and genic CBD decreases the hallucinogenic effect of THC and this allows you to take a slightly higher percentage of THC without getting high thus creating a superior blend of medicine or full-spectrum medicine when co2 or butane extraction is used cannabinoid number-17 will evaporate and be lost again this is another reason why extraction destroys the entourage effect blunder number 7 cost to produce inferior CBD oil this process you are seeing is the standard method used when making CBD oil this appears high-tech and impressive but it's actually destroying the terpenes and many of the delicate 118 different types of cannabinoids it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for this processing equipment did you know it is impossible to extract all of the cannabinoid intervenes without damaging the medicine look at the CBD oil the flower was processed one time and the reason it's so nice and clear is because it was processed just once but a lot of the cannabinoids were still left in the plant which was thrown in the trash can CBD oil companies are literally throwing away the leftover plant matter that still contains up to 40% of the cannabinoids these numbers vary depending on the method and how many times you run the plant through the machine now let's look at what's being sold in today's market let's go back to analytical 360 scroll down and click on concentrates and choose any test see how black that is it has been repeatedly processed over and over trying to extract all the cannabinoids out of the plant less than 1% of the terpenes survived through this process and delicate trace cannabinoids are damaged so I buy all of this equipment only to destroy 99% of the terpenes and leave butane residue in the product it triples the cost to the consumer and greatly decreases the medicinal value of the product so what is the solution the solution is don't concentrate the plant Internet deputy found that the hemp pace and cannabis paste methods were the only methods in the world where 100% of the plant was consumed there is ZERO waste as nothing is thrown away the flower and leaves are ground up and cooked with a coconut type oil called MCT oil that hemp paste method preserves the terpenes and the cost to produce the hef paste is literally three hundred and thirty five times cheaper then the chemically processed oil this will make this amazing natural medicine affordable to the whole world and people who could not afford it before now can but the billion dollar question is will the world learn these seven blunders will you the consumer still buy CBD and THC oils or will you revert back to what is natural thank you and I hope that you enjoyed this investigative report this is Brian Boyd reporting for Internet demeaning", "bSV_YsUfnPA": "[Music] Wesley we need to pause oh you see leave the border directly into the purple", "8k7Xg0Y7NjU": "okay guys we're just going to go through the Assembly of the still for those that have already purchased the torch alchemist over the years the reason I've taken so long to to make this thing work is so for you guys that have already bought this to instill three inch and four inch his arm it can be used on this apparatus make sure that it can interact with what I'm doing now so here we go so this is the two inch alchemist for those that they're not familiar with with distilling quite easy you can boil a cup of tea you can do this the reason I chose the boiling pot to be this and it's because it's it's double insulated and and they're a great part book I'll bring one of these for a year and it's still going strong so look I'm just going to go through the assembly basically you know it will come happen like that you just want packets already assembled you know all the clamps and everything's going to be in there and it's going to be a materialistic you guys know what you're getting but you know things like this you know it's an infrared radar and you know just simple things you got all the power reducing here so when you're getting to your levels of bringing back the ethyl alcohol you can start turning it down so you don't get rid of all we took things and you know the flavors that you don't want to remove if you want to try and keep them intact that's really value okay so the steel this is the main body that still you're going to have a thermometer reading here basically what's happening is when the ethyl alcohol actually comes through the unit through here you've got a thermometer that's reading what's happening in here there's a dividing trade here and it's reading the temperature of the it's very important which we'll go through later then we have the final condenser which condenses the alcohol or the solvent leaving the tower and basically what this unit does is of course there is cold water running through this unit through the coil and then leaving as warm water uses very little water and basically what this unit is doing is cooling down the vapor so as you can see let's quickly explain while I'm putting this together is when the ethyl alcohol is leaving the pot it's leaving it around about you know the proof is up around about 95% alcohol it's leaving around about 71 to 72 point four degrees Fahrenheit and then what it's doing its when it's leaving here it's coming up through here hitting the coil it's reeking dancing the vapor to a liquid and they're coming up this way the reason I've got a liquid management tape here I will explain to you later on but that's when you are making your alcohol again you have to do this with the TTB Gulf company if you wish to do that but this week would management app just allows reflux so basically you're bringing up the purity and the strength of the ethyl alcohol from your wash your fermentation so that's it that's the still what we're going to do is this is the sugar leak that's in here we're going to be pouring into this one and we're going to be coming back up to this level so we know when we get close to it I can turn it down so first things first we put our gasket on here very simple guys okay like so grab your try clamp and again do this for two people and the great thing about this unit is our there's been lots of you know problems with people banning off their solvents and it's all quite dangerous because they're all flammable this is all in case there's no vapor exposed regardless of the the solvent that you use I hear a lot of people using our the butane and I've had some with people exploding like that basically mix a bit of solvent with that process if you do do that and put it in here to all in case basically it is stripping all those sold himself purging it and will leave you the the arisen in in the container and then you just pour that in the tray and and then purge the rest of it off with the very low temp anyway so temperature gauge here reads this we have another temperature gauge that actually reads inside the pot and you can set your timer with this sort of unit so you know how long you you know you've been doing your extraction it shows the temperature inside here so I usually set my temperature with the beeper so I know when it reaches a certain point or changes one degree Fahrenheit it allows me to know to check what's going on and it's so simple to check two guys again do this we've gloves because it's going to be quite warm just have someone hold the base and you're lifting it off here and you can check inside to see what's happening again if you can do this right away and it's still raining there's going to be a lot of vapor coming up don't do that wait to it settles down for about five minutes and then lift alone because you don't want that vapor coming up and then getting up your nose it's quite it's it's good so there we have it so again this is going to regulate the wattage going into here so this is around about 600 and 630 on once so you can bring this down pretty much the nothing so you can really manipulate the temperatures and again that's very important with some of the fine anyway so we'll get this fired up so simply it is you just plug one end into the wall it's a it's a 50 down and then the other one it's actually just going to be plugged into the back like so most important thing before you hook this up test your water that you do have water running so water going out very limited mana water yeah and you can do that by testing how warm the water is of course cold water going in here so that's it very simple to set up that's just still and that's really bad so I'm going to go to the next stage at which firing this up and start producing your product I'm going to get this one going as well so we have two stills right and then we'll render them down to the old resin that you'll see and then you you", "Q1tHFHQVDrY": "[Music] my name is Willie Christie and we're here at the pottery in Los Angeles today we're going to talk about cannabis sublinguals people like tinctures if they don't like to smoke anything if they prefer faster method of ingestion or faster activation compared to edibles and it's more direct than say a topical or anything like that it's still getting into your bloodstream and it's still you know if you're taking active THC it's gonna get into your bloodstream as an active cannabinoid a team shirts are good for places where you can't smoke maybe you can't even be seen smoking something just discrete easy to use one you would just take your dose is worth you know whether that's a drop or a full dropper full and you just put it you know open the dropper put it under your tongue and let it rest under your tongue for about 15 seconds it usually takes about 15 to 40 minutes to feel the effects but it could take up to two hours so don't double down until those two hours have passed so the first one I want to talk about is the love potion number seven from Humboldt apothecary this is just a strictly THC tincture technically a sublingual it's in MCT oil and it's got it also has damiana cinnamon kava kava I guess to get the blood pumping if you will considering this one's called love potion number seven that sounds good and then next I've got a CBD sublingual from prana this one there p5 is a non psychoactive or non intoxicating CBD only tincture and this one's got 400 milligrams CBD in it and nothing else besides ACDC terpenes which is your CBD strain so it's CBD flour whole plant cannabis derived terpenes and CBD but there is no trace THC in this this is just pure CBD in terms of cannabinoids this one is a normal eye dropper I just don't have it is childproof on the outside so I can't quite take it out to show you but rest assured it's gonna look like your typical eyedropper it's gonna look like an eye dropper but you in your mouth so the next one I've got a high CBD meta haze tincture from chemistry so this one is interesting because it has CBD a in it CBD a is the raw form of CBD so it still has an extra oxygen molecule but in this case we've got both it's got CBD and CBD a as well as THC and THC a so this is a really nice combination of the raw cannabinoids as well as active cannabinoids you will experience a little bit of psycho activity due to the THC the high CBD should help with any anxiety or paranoia again if you're not comfortable with THC this one's probably not for you if you are comfortable th see this would be a really great awake painkiller or anxiety reliever now we've got a 1 to 1 tincture that's THC to CBD strictly coconut oil cannabis oil nothing more nothing less in a 1 to 1 ratio which is the you know the optimum healing ratio it is going to be psychoactive but it's also going to be very effective for pain relief maybe help you sleep at night as well but this one will definitely have some psychoactive effect so up next we've got something from one of my favorite brands poppin barclays right ratio pack this is a new thing from them you've got a 30 to 1 CBD the THC tincture and a one to thirty th see the CBD tincture essentially what they want you to do with this is create your own ratios they're giving you the full CBD one with trace THC and the full THC one with trace CBD that way you can make your own ratios you can do a four to one or essentially they're giving you the power to find out what works best for you it's a really good product for somebody who wants to experiment maybe try a little bit more THC than they're used to or a little more CBD to see what that does so all in all I like to think that sublinguals and tinctures as opposed to something like a pill or a vape pen stays true to the spirit of cannabis and that sort of holistic natural wellness side of things where you know you'll take a team cheer for it as opposed to taking a pill or a battery vape pen or something it's a very natural way of dealing with things [Music]", "WMNFyC15q-Q": "hey y'all it's Cody from sleep populace and in this video I'm going to introduce you to my favorite CBD products for sleep now a lot of CBD goodies in the market promise to help folks slumber but in my opinion these four are the absolute best now what are they well you'll just have to keep on watching to find out all right first things first let's chat a little bit about what CBD is now if you haven't checked it out yet I highly recommend that you take a peek am i what is CBD video which I'm gonna put right there I think yeah and it goes over what CVD is how it feels the research that's been done into its side effects dosage all things like that basically like it's a full rundown of CBD as a compound but in case you don't have time right now or simply don't want to watch it I will give you a little bit of a breakdown right now but what CBD is so CBD or cannabidiol is a compound found on the flower of the cannabis plant it's one of more than a hundred different compounds or phyto cannabinoids contained on the flower and they range and feel and type but the two most popular ones are probably CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol or THC however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive and it doesn't trigger hallucinations or intoxication it's usually used in oils creams and pills to treat things like joint pain anxiety poor appetite and even poor sleep I should also mention that it's totally legal to buy and consume hemp derived CBD in all 50 states as long as the product doesn't contain more than 0.3 percent of THC alright now that we've gone over a little bit about what CBD is let's get into my picks for the best CBD products we're falling asleep and I want to start with my absolute favorite CBD product for spalling asleep fast which is the CBD PM tincture from CBD MD now this little baby contains both CBD and melatonin so it is literally designed to send you off to snooze town in a flash and when I tried it myself I found that it pretty much did that within five to ten minutes of taking it I felt totally relaxed and like I was drifting off to Dreamland with ease another thing I liked about this tincture was that I didn't really experience any next state grogginess which is pretty unusual for a melatonin based product so if you're looking to fall asleep super fast and need to get up and go the next day I think this could be a great product for you another good thing about it is that a 500 milligram bottle of the tincture only costs $45 which is pretty affordable when you compare it to other see many products on the market next up is what I find to be the most relaxing CBD oil and that's the American hemp oil from American hemp and I say most relaxing because I found that this oil had a really nice sort of like calming effect all across the body within 15 minutes of taking it I felt like tension in my shoulders was being alleviated my mind was quieted and so it helped me to fall asleep at night for sure but I also found that it was really just nice for lounging around the house reading a book watching TV and when compared to other products that I've tested I found that the effects lasted for a longer time around an hour and an hour and a half so if you're looking for a subtle CBD oil that'll sort of carry you through an afternoon or maybe carry you through your bedroom time routine I would highly recommend this one as I found to be very relaxing however it's like caveat is that a 2,500 milligram bottle of American hemp oil retails for $140 which makes it one of the more expensive ones I've tested next I want to share my favorite CBD oil for general use and that's the CBD premium oil from CBD MD now you'll recognize the brand from the first one I shared with you all for falling asleep fast but this one is different in that there is no melatonin here it is all CBD oil and I like it for general use because it helps me fall asleep at night but I also found that it had a really nice subtle relaxing effect during the day you know if it was like a weekend day and I was just hanging out I could take it go see friends go to the gym you know do errands and I found that it was just a really nice Zen tone I was highly recommended for general use and something else I really like about this oil is that you can choose your flavor so you go on the website and they have like four or five different options so you can choose the flavor that's best for you and something else I like about it is that a seven hundred milligram bottle of the CBD premium oil from CBD MD regionals for seventy dollars which puts it in a nice mid range between the least expensive ones the most expensive ones and finally my absolute favorite value buy has got to be the CBD oil from some soil now here as 600 milligram bottle retails for $30 and a 1200 milligram one retails for $60 so it's definitely more in a budget friendly zone for those of you who want to try CBD but maybe we don't want to fork over more than $100 to try it and even though it's less expensive than some of the option other options on this list I'd say that it's just as good it helps me to fall asleep fast and it made me feel really relaxed during the day so I think it's a great option the only thing I really don't like about the CBD oil from Sun soil are the flavor options and either comes in chocolate mint or cinnamon and personally those just aren't tastes that I like well folks that does it for my guide the best CBD products for sleep for more sleep related content and resources make sure to go to sleep obelisk calm and is subscribe to our YouTube channel until next time happy dreaming", "ppKvv2668OI": "[Music] when I was doing a bite here and today we're going to make some high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]", "aGz4COqSHsE": "[Music] well we obviously serve the cannabis industry by producing awesome phenomenal extraction equipment the equipment was designed for our internal purposes uh at a company called capital labs so in 2014 we started a capital labs we based the model as a toll processor so plant material in oil out customers happy no delays this is where we came from did you say it was initially designed for internal purposes correct uh toll processors right so we initially started on co2 technology and uh as a matter of fact capna it's a modified word of copnea which means co2 in latin so when we launched we're actually going to be a co2 toll processor and uh shortly after the inception of the company uh it became clear to us that we were just simply not able to turn around plant material fast enough in order to turn a profit so in your opinion you know what is its what is the differentiator for cabinet systems and other uh systems out there on the market um i i think what makes us unique is our ultra low process right so this is a patented technology we actually own the patent for the ultra-low extraction process right so what does that mean it's uh what we discovered is there's an ideal temperature range for ethanol which is a highly polar solvent if you cool it to that ideal temperature range you can lock out some of the undesirable constituents that co-extract during the extraction process so let's just say a co2 extraction system will typically yield about 30 fats and lipids uh in the overall crude extract which then in turn means you have to further refine it uh purify it to get to at least a you know 60 or 70 cannabinoid ratio in the crude what our machines do is you know once you contact the plant material to the solvent the machine upholds a particular temperature and when you evacuate and then you reduce through evaporation the crude oil is going to always be one it's going to be de-waxed for the better part it's going to be free of chlorophyll and you will have a cannabinoid yield of somewhere in the 72 to 75 percent uh we've seen as high as 82 percent and the overall cannabinoid range but if we're talking about thc uh above 70 is typical uh which i'm not sure how many other extraction systems can guarantee that right um so what are your who is your typical customer are people coming to you when they're just starting a new facility or are they looking to come in and kind of upgrade their equipment um it's both um we do have a lot of interest obviously from you know the the entrepreneurs the startups uh they definitely uh i think the the consumer base now the customer base is becoming a little bit more educated and ethanol is taking uh more of a front a front seat in the cannabis extraction space which wasn't true about two and a half three years ago likewise we have customers that are upgrading from let's say co2 extraction or hydrocarbon because uh they understand that you know even even hydrocarbon you still have to de-wax i think that's like the key word here is we can produce a fully de-waxed extract with our systems and uh neither hydrocarbon nor co2 can can do that currently so uh you said that people are you know more educated now than they have ever been before but like what are some of some of the myths or misconceptions out there that people still don't understand about uh ethanol processing at this point i don't think there's many okay you know if you would have asked me this question a year ago then you know obviously like the rick simpson hemp oil if anybody knows it what that's like that's a process where you just take some ethanol you wash the material in it but the end result the crude oil is it's always very heavy in all of the other constituents that you don't want it's a very black pasty kind of extract to where you know here now we can provide like a shatter quality extract using a super highly polar solvent everybody's getting keen on that there's there's enough stuff in you know obviously in the internet space competition is coming about there's a lot enough marketing happening around it that when people come to us they pretty much know exactly what what they're going to be looking at and what are the results that you know we're going to be able to produce for them what is a typical maintenance schedule like on the equipment for good manufacturing practices i would recommend you do it at the end of every shift but it's just you know cleanliness right so as far as maintenance on the mechanical parts we do a pretty good job at providing uh uh quality components so you know that hasn't really been an issue for us we don't really send out too many technicians out for repairs but as far as cleanliness goes you probably want to do it at the end of every shift yeah what is the what is a typical roi for somebody when they invest in your equipment this machine six days six days wow that's assuming that you could sell all of the oil that you produce okay so this is this is a this is a common misperception by the cannabis entrepreneur everybody does the math on how many grams they could output in a day and uh they completely overlook the fact that oh my god we have to sell it so my biggest advice would be you know before you do the math on how many grams you could output out of this machine do the math on where you're going to sell it um so when people kind of wind up in that predicament and they can't sell it are they just stuck or you know uh what are their options at that point uh sell at a discount um maybe be stuck uh develop your sales channels um you know it's it's something that happens we we typically always ask the right questions the the qualifying questions before we try to sell a system um people come in and they want to buy the biggest system because they're doing the math on the grams and output but you know after an interview process and we sit down and our sales team sits down with them we begin to understand and build a clearer picture of hey maybe you don't need this guy maybe you need something like that and grow into something like this what was it that brought you to the industry what was it that brought me to the industry you know a little bit of the wild wild west cowboy type of outlaw was there's some romance behind that you know what i mean i uh i kind of fell in love with with that part of it you know um i've been i've been in the industry since 2010 uh and i think that's that's that's what it it was trying to be outside of the law um you know obviously the financial rewards of the cannabis industry if you do it right you know you can you can earn so what's your outlook for the industry like within the next year and then over the next five years i think that processors if you are looking to get into the extraction industry uh i think it's very important to do the due diligence on you know your go to market strategy it's not about just having a facility and buying the equipment please do not do your math on the grams on output because the market is getting tighter we see that distillate prices are dropping we're also seeing that what used to be the heady market which is like the shatter the sauces you know the connoisseur product they're also they're kind of getting pushed out uh as recreational cannabis happened what it did is it opened up the doors to a lot of people that wouldn't typically smoke cannabis but now they're a little bit curious uh when they walk into a dispensary the mass of you know the bulk of the product now is vape cartridges you know or flour you'll see less and less of the connoisseur type of product so if you're one to kind of enter this industry today understand exactly what is the market you know what is it needing right now there's you know certain statistics that you could look up as to relative you know how much uh vape cartridges are sold relative to something like a shatter product do the research there because uh you might position yourself as a lab to produce one or the other product but that might not be a very profitable product for you or for your marketplace okay so then uh what's your prognosis on the cbd industry uh the cbd industry well what is our prognosis our prognosis is that the cbd industry is going to chew up these machines uh within a year obviously us as a company internally we're taking all of the necessary steps for modular scalability to where we can take one of these atlas machines and instead of replacing a machine for higher throughput what we can do is add components to it to get higher throughput because you know obviously with the cbd we're talking about you know hundreds of thousands of acres going live uh cbd is also it's a it's a less yielding molecule so you have to run more biomass to get the necessary yields that you're looking for and depending on i guess the markets and whether it's going to be isolated or distilled but for us as a company internally our goal is to make scalability something that is like a lego set can you uh describe sort of your approach to r d and how you continue to innovate while still bringing products to market sure um i think what really kind of makes us us and what you know what what the cabinet brand really means is efficiency right so everywhere that we look and everything that we do we always try to let's say uh combine processes right so instead of maybe having two steps to do something we have one step that does two things right so you know cooling heating this that we try to uh combine uh all of the energy inputs and outputs and find a a fine delta there ultimately for us you know we all we obviously want to make a machine that is uh quick to roi uh doesn't consume too much electricity yeah well i think if you nail those two uh you're already doing pretty good yeah and that's that's our goal that's what we try you", "iTHslIR7zp8": "if you've heard a CDN and want to know more about it you're in the right place in this video we talk about what this popular cannabinoid is how its formed and what you can expect from it what we share may surprise you keep watching [Music] Denise Reinhardt and I'm Angelus John ski and we are so excited you are here welcome the CBD Q&A where we answer your questions about CBD we are certified CBD coaches and the host of this show today we have something extra special plugin for you we are going to normally we talk about CBD which is a cannabinoid of the cannabis plant but today we're going to be discussing another cannabinoid and you this is I'm so excited about you two and so excited I can hardly wait hurry up okay so our question today that we are gonna be answering is what is cbn and if you've never heard of cbn you probably are really wondering what is cbn Angie what is CBN so CBN you know as we already said is a cannabinoid so you can find it in the hemp plant and the marijuana plant both it does there's a higher percentage on the marijuana side than the hip side it's just a very small amount but whenever we talk to you guys about the entourage effect and the whole effect of the entire plant whenever you use CBD cannabinoid it is just one of those mini cannabinoids that make up the full entourage effect and and help CBD to do its thing but when you isolate cbn or you at least bring it more to the surface to where there's a higher percentage yeah then then it's like wow so so we're I mean I know it's in the cannabis plant but like where where does it come from like so with with CBN it's you know as we mentioned there's a small percentage of the plant is actually CBN how small do you think it's like you know it can be like less than 1% and sometimes it can be on the marijuana side you can find it you know around sometimes even up to 13 or so percent but it is still a very small amount but however the cool thing is that THC actually turns into CBN so if you've ever bought like a marijuana bud and if you're a smoker of the marijuana plant and you have a bud or a flower that's sitting in a container that may have a a lot of light can get through that container or you know the caps not on it real tight so oxygen can get in there then that causes the THC to actually degrade into CBN because it begins to oxidize and so through that whole process is how CBN comes about so after so if you've ever like smoked to something that may be older or something and you just feel super chilled out and you want to go to sea yeah you want to go to sleep then it could be that you know now THC does have that effect on some people but you know fear one that tha doesn't typically have that effect it could be that there's higher amounts of CBN in there or that the THC has degraded and turned into CBN so you're you know feeling a lot more relaxed and just want to go to sleep which is why it is coined this sleepy cannabinoid as so what what would you say are some of the other benefits of CBN um there are quite a few benefits one thing I wanted to say just you know before we move on because a lot of people don't you know kind of teach he makes them nervous and they don't want that high feeling or anything if you get CBN even though THC CBN does come from degraded tea or tea see you're not going to get that high feeling so I'm personally very sensitive to THC so I can't take high amounts because I get anxious and paranoid and it's just not a pleasant experience but CBN doesn't do that it's not a non-psychoactive it doesn't make you feel weird in the head it doesn't make you feel high or anything like that or doesn't give you anxiety or anything that you can tend to get from THC it just it helps you go to sleep I mean that's what it does for me I don't feel anything else other than I can actually sleep but this is one of the which is one of the biggest benefits of CBN but there are so many other benefits from this cannabinoid yeah it you know can help if you have any discomfort in your body it helps you know so that you can you know feel better in that way it also is a really huge it has a lot of antioxidants to it and a lot of other anti is that we can't really say right heavy a won't let us we're keeping it on the low but if you can figure out what we're saying then great and it can also maintain and help your bones as well so it's just got a lot of really good benefits it helps if you have swelling in your body it helps to help with you know getting that back to normal a normal state and so it's it just yeah and it keeps me I had a pain-free state if you know if you'd like to be pain-free it'll help you to maintain that state yeah so there's so many good stuff that comes with it so you know with a lot of times I can you know kind of have some discomfort when I'm going to bed with autoimmune disease and then on top of that I'm trying to sleep and everything and it's just you know that along with CBD together is just like it's just like the perfect marriage so yeah so it's like half CBD half CBN put them together and magic happens now it's time for our question for you our question is have you ever tried CBN let us know in the comment section below we would love to connect with you there and others in this community sometimes have the best tips and suggestions and advice so be sure to connect it to the community in the comments thanks for checking out this video and definitely subscribe for more videos just like this if you have any CVD

lifetime to make a living. That's 40 seasons, 40 years. - This is where Charlotte's\nWeb began as hemp. These were our first greenhouses\nthat we came to in 2014, and right now we're surrounded by an estimated 100,000 clones. Every one of these clones is a replica of the mother plant that\nwe started with in 2013, and it's very important because it's the exact same\nphytochemical fingerprint or plant signature that we call it that makes the original formula, that makes one of\nCharlotte's Web products. And that product, so many people rely on so it's important here at this epicenter that we maintain that consistency and we're able to scale that plant to meet the demand of Charlotte's Web for people that rely on these products. (upbeat music) - We have a pretty extensive\nvetting program that we test and assess and vet out all of the places and all of our family farms that we grow our product to make sure that the soils are gonna be conducive of producing the best\nplants we possibly can. We do soil tests, we do water tests, we also work with the farmers and make sure it's gonna\nbe a good fit for them and their crop rotations, and once we all decide this\nis gonna benefit all of us, we put some plants in the ground. We monitor those plants from conception to the end of their growing cycle. So we can control the amendments that we're putting in the soil, the amount of water that\nwe're giving the soil, and we can monitor them phytochemically, genetically, phenotypically, and just make sure that\nthey're the same beautiful consistent strong plants\nthat they've always been. (upbeat music) - We are planting clones up on one of our fields up north of town. We're using a six row transplanter. It was custom build for us. We have workers out in the field with hoes and we do a lot hand weeding by hand until our plants can get tall enough where we can do mechanical cultivation with our tractor and cultivator. We do everything that we can out here on the farm to make sure that what we grow is safe and good for you. (upbeat music) - What makes a good hemp extract is everything that goes into it, which is, yes, the soil, the water, the plant, the region, the sun, all of these things determine all of the compounds and the assets within that plant. And they have to be in perfect balance. Cultivating in different\nregions really is different risk and we have to assess different\nplant varieties that grow, are acclimated well and grow well in those regions, and so what works in Colorado\ndoesn't work in Kentucky. (upbeat music) - This is a science, it's an art. We're not just going out there and saying, well, we hope it grows today. That's not what we're doing. We're taking the time, we're watching the weather patterns. We don't use synthetic chemicals, we don't use synthetic fertilizers, we don't use any of that stuff that some conventional farmers might use. - We test it just to ensure there is no chemical spray over\nfrom neighboring farms, we test it for aflatoxins,\nmoisture content, potency, a lot of there contaminating spores that could potentially get in our product and make sure that it's absolutely clean. We take a lot of care in\nour plants at the farm, and we wanna make sure that\nwe still take as much care and attention at the lab. So at the lab, it goes through\nanother series of testing. We do extractions in various ways depending on what product we're making to get the best\nfull-spectrum profile we can. (upbeat music) - The greatest thing about harvest is you get to see all of your whole year's hard work come to a fulfillment and be able to be thankful and happy that you're\nable to harvest a crop.

run switching over from that terpene run then doing a supercritical run with the rest of the Imperial with the terpene run you're gonna run your parameters 1200 psi 75 for your extractor 25 right here is the temperature that you have inside the separator the problem with that 25 is it's kind of freezer terpenes so you're going to be either wanting to run it a little bit hotter in order to be able to get to the 32 degrees or if you have a secondary cup that's going to help with the changeover process if not you're gonna be digging those terpenes out and it's gonna be a little a little bit longer so if you can keep that above 32 degrees you know at that point in time you're not going to freeze the terpenes that you're pulling out of the machine with the size vessel like this you're probably gonna run about 15 minutes on the machine 15 minutes should if you got a decent pro terpene profile on your plant material it shouldn't then get any oil carryover with a 20 liter vessel you're looking at about 45 minutes and obviously you're just doubling any of those if you have fuel vessels and everything on your system so right now like I said we've ran for 20-some odd minutes on our machine this is completely empty at this point so we're not completely similar simulating it but what we're gonna do from here is we're gonna come in and we're gonna hit service separator now this is going to pump down the separator side over here down to 100 psi we know that we're not going to have any carryover with this generally speaking because we're not doing any oil or anything like that so when we get done with our run instead of like we do with our oil runs and opening this just a little bit to make sure we don't have any carry-over going on we're just going to go ahead and open up valve 10 right here and go to a better mode so right now it says service separate separator mode activated pumping separator down please wait all right so now we're gonna open up valve 10 we're gonna bleed out the separators right here we're gonna keep valve 10 open because we don't want any if there was any residual ice buildup or anything like that we don't want that to been gas off and and I have a pressurized vessel that we're gonna be open enough so at this point in time we're going to take off for a thermocouple right here we're going to go ahead and start removing we're moving that the cap here we'll start with this one over here secondly we'll go with this one right here you do hear a little bit of ice buildup in there that's seeping off right now but again we have open area for there so it's not going to be a problem for this one we really only have to take this one off right here and loosen the separator to side so then we can just kind of move that out of the way so it's not in there in our way when we're removing this last we want to make sure we remove the blow-off valve right here take that off and when putting those back on you really only have to be hand tight with those because again it's only gonna release if it over pressurizes the vessel and at which point in time it's going to if it's hand tight it'll it'll drain out of there perfectly fine so no worries so what we would do from here is we take this cap off first then we would grab our plunger and we'd push all the terpenes down into the base of the cup after removing this here remove our seal set these off to the side you're gonna change we're gonna change our orifice here shortly but again what we would do is we take our plunger we'd move all the terpenes down to the cup right here we go ahead and bypass our cup at that point in time and even do these like this making sure that you're not going to get any drop out whatsoever at this time we remove our cup if we had a secondary cup we go ahead and put that one back on there or we would go ahead and remove our terpenes from the cup and then put this one back up on there okay once we got that back up on there we want to make sure that we go ahead and continue on that flow path correctly the way it's supposed to and not bypass in the cup so we connect all those make sure you'd be you kind of go a little quickly with that because there is a timing out of the the water flow switch right here that we have alright so at this point in time we're gonna switch over we're going to do a supercritical run so we want to change our orifice that we have on this one right here over to a 29 which is your supercritical orifice for a PD feat PC for system when changing out these orifices you want to make sure that you double wrench this right here the the orifice downspout right here is welded into a 45 degree angle and you don't want to change that angle on there so when you're putting these on and off you want to make sure that you always double wrench okay just right now we're putting on our super critical orifice so our super critical Oracle sign and for these again their compression fittings our compression fittings here so you don't necessarily need to you don't need to use any tough on tape but you do want to get a decent wrench on those for tightness now we're going to go ahead and put this one back up on here with the correct orifice on there for our supercritical run there [Music] in our collars [Music] [Music] again when we're putting this back on the relief out here we're just tightening hand tight because we're gonna be taking that on and off all the time and again there's no real reason to have it completely tight on there 90% of the way with your hands is perfectly fine we'll put this one on back here tighten that one down classy get our crossover pipe back on here from my separators again you should be able to get 90% away with the hands last 10% of the wrench in this case exactly it's a little cold right now too so it doesn't make it any any easier when you're trying to put it back on there you're expanding the middle I'll put that on there tighten this one back over here now if you're diligent about your extractions and removing the air from the are they oh - from the actual cylinders at this point in time you'd close valve ten come over here and pull a vacuum the evacuation valve down here down to that twenty to twenty-five inches of mercury in this case we're just gonna go ahead and simulate going through everything so at this point in time we have everything reassembled we've closed valve ten we've closed our evacuation valve we know that we're good right here we're gonna go ahead and leave our serve a separate rater mode it's gonna give a quick little push of pressure into there to make sure that we uh we don't have anything off right now right here if this if this transducer sees any downturn of pressure it's gonna say that you failed pressure check but again five five seconds at that point in time before we pass the leak check it's gonna continue I'm filling the system what we want to go now overdue since we have the supercritical orifice in there we don't go go ahead and dial in 1800 psi we also want to come back over here to our chiller and change our set point over to and it's somewhere around 105 degrees Fahrenheit again this chiller is only a vessel to create what we want for our our extractor temperature so when we go I overshot a little bit but when we when we do this it's really dependent on ambient temperature what are our final resting is going to be but we're just going to put it in the ballpark right there and then keep an eye on this number and making sure it's going up to that hundred and five hundred ten Fahrenheit for our our supercritical extraction and again right now you see that we're just putting in gas pulling it out with a compressor putting the gas flow Nell the compressor until we get up to those those parameters for our supercritical run my name is Jason Stanton and thank you for very much for watching this video", "DunzmKCDk0c": "hi my name is Amy from step extraction and in this video I'm going to show you how easy it is to use the step X 3000 co2 compressor and extraction machine the first thing we're going to do is load the reactor vessel with material we're going to put on a cap using special teflon tape to prevent galling you we use this tape to prevent galling mean that meaning that the cap would be welded to the pipe this just acts as a lubricant and it also helps with sealing we put the end cap on we put it on tight and we use a pipe wrench to make sure that it's very tight you'll notice that you need a vise in your shop to make this even simpler now we're going to load our reactor vessel with material today we are using lavender this is our point three liter reactor we will use a funnel and our material you can see that this material is very dry and we suggest that as well we use a jamming rod basically to get it all packed in there you can get as much material as you possibly can in there you will never be able to get it more compressed than the co2 is going to compress it later now that our reactor is filled with material we want to put on our sublimation valve on the other end we are going to put on the filter element and oh ringing screw on the sublimation valve very much the way we screw it on the other end again we will be using teflon tape to make a good lubricated connection it also prevents galling again using my vice and a pipe wrench we can get this on there pretty tight now that we have material in our reactor vessel it's time to mount it on the compressor hang it here and attach the hoses this stainless steel hose comes from the compressor into the reactor I can finger tighten it we lose a register tighten it up a little bit more then I go from the collection vessel to the sublimation valve in the same way now it's time to turn on the compressor the first thing I want to do is plug it in and as the computers booting up now it's ready to go now I'm going to set the compressor at 2200 psi and the sublimation pressure at 1800 psi and now I just hit run it's time to turn on the co2 we have two tanks here now from the reactor Photoshop black areas oil that's coming out of our lavender and is retaining more of the terpenes than it would you run I come over to compressor and I press stop I push reset to get the sublimator and the compressor back at zero I press run again now the compressor knows that is no longer making compression but it does get all the co2 out of the system sublimates everything else out through the reactor valve and into the collector I also want to turn off both of my co2 tanks so close all the way there is still some residual co2 on the system so I come around to the bleed valve I just let it go and also the power to the sublimation valve so I'm using a pipe wrench to remove the sublimation valve you can see the material in there is very dry and very loose you see the filter is very clear there's a go pipe wrench I remove the other end app as well my bucket with the jamming rod or a screwdriver I just remove the material from inside now it's time to open up the collection vessel to see what's inside I wipe up all the condensation to make sure that no water interacts with my material on the inside this is always a low-pressure vessel so it's panned tighten the ball you can see that this lavender oil that came directly out of machine had no post-processing none is required it's very clear there is no particulate matter in it it's in a liquid state and it's ready to use you", "TRkjumswNeM": "hey guys ladies and gentlemen welcome back I just wanted to do a quick video on harvesting your CBD and we were gonna do that by extracting it from the roots I just took about ten minutes time and worked out as much of that dirt as I could now I'm gonna go ahead and you know I'm gonna rinse it in nice cold water get the rest of that off there and then basically you guys you guys can make your own CBD temperatures at home you make your own CBD capsules you can do whatever you want with this yeah I just wanted to do a quick little clip on that yeah you just get all of that dirt on out of there get her nice and clean so there's no dirt at all whatsoever and I'm gonna jar it some of it I'm going to grind down and put it into a pot and I'll boil it will the roots and then I'll take that stuff and I'll put it into a cream I'll make a

al s alexei peshkov ski everyone [Applause] good afternoon and thanks for the opportunity to present for being here I'll be talking about what a compatible cannabis extract manner emulsions some people call them water soluble formulations I'll talk about their benefits and how to make them our business model is to enable our clients to make their own so you guys can do what you do best making the finished beverage products out of them there are many ways to deliver cannabis into the bloodstream everybody knows what those are we don't have to go through them but long story short you can eat it as an animal you can vape it dab it smoke it put it on your tongue in your eyes even rectal deliver exists you know all these different methods exist and perhaps a big reason for why these things coexist is that there's no clear winner so far where there hasn't been one every method has advantages and more importantly disadvantages so you kind of decide what you want to do but if you could just drink it like alcohol then why wouldn't you just do that nobody vapes alcohol nobody uses a rectal delivery for it you wouldn't put it under your tongue I mean I wouldn't put anything so with matter emotions you can basically do just that as most people by now already know so I agree with the previous speaker and others who basically think that it's gonna take over I also believe is going to take over there are some hurdles to overcome probably on the business side on the regulatory side but it's gonna happen and it's gonna take advantage of the entire culture so it's probably gonna be pretty big this is what a nano emulsion dosing looks like when it's properly made it's translucent so in this case it's 20 milligrams per milliliter cvd not a lot and you put it in water give it a swoosh it disappears into it it'll be stable it'll never separate it will not lose potency unless you expose it to UV light or something like that not an animal related stuff and then very importantly its translucent if you want it to be so you can make it that way you won't alter your beverage visually and it will give you the benefits by availability increase the onset time shortening and easy compatibility with beverages basically bringing it closer to what alcohol behaves like alcohol is fast it absorbs completely and everybody knows what to expect from it if you ate versus you didn't eat there is a difference but basically you know what a drink will feel like so narrow margins although they're not truly rigorously speaking water soluble formulations may be behaved as if they were so for all intents and purposes it's the same thing there are several types of water compatible formulations out there Macker emulsions are something that everybody knows about is when you use a basic surfactant phospholipids lecithin or something and use a basic mixer and just mix oil and water that way they make large drops they don't really give you all of these benefits maybe a little bit but they separate them so they don't really need to be considered it's not a product that you can really use micro motions are what the pharmaceutical industry used to use before they figure out nano modulus actually work better micro motions are it's an unfortunate choice of terminology Micro doesn't mean they're micron size they're actually nano sized and many people call them nano emulsions although it's incorrect the way they work is you need to use a lot of surfactant generally harsh surfactants so much that you change the properties of water and oil basically dissolves in that or you can create my cells which can swell with the oil going in in sight so it looks a bit like a nano motion but it just uses ten times more surfactant and the choice is limited so before there was an option to make nano emulsions the pharma industry used micro motions because it works but you have to be very careful with the surfactants and the regulations kick in and stuff like that now the difference between them and nano modulus the reason and our models can get away with using a lot less surfactant is that you will use mechanical energy some sort of on preferably an ultrasonic liquid processor that creates a lot of shear that will break the droplets apart mechanically and that doesn't stay in the product unlike the surfactants if you use the chemical action to do that right now in between the two there liposomes liposomes are great and many people call their formulation liposomal technically liposomes are for water in water formulations they have water on the inside you can see that there is a blue kind of interior that's water and outside there's also water and it has kind of like a biological cell it has a skin layer so the oils can go in there but the loading is low and so you can't really deliver a lot that way plus they're pretty difficult to make and the choice of surfactants also limited nano emulsions if you have the equipment basically let you avoid all of these drawbacks the amount of surfactants is a lot lower less than oil actually you can use very mild tasteless very compliant food grade surfactants to make them and they're not really difficult to make if you have the formulation so it is something we offer so if you go in in that direction no R&D is really required although I'll talk a little bit more about that basic components of nano motions are there's gonna be a carrier oil preferably about twice as much as your cannabis active that needs to be there for a number of reasons there is your bio active so Sheba DTC or whatever it doesn't even have to cannabis-related it just be a hydrophobic drug that you want to deliver you will need a surface active agent to stabilize it after it's made and aid in making it so those are surfactants most likely more than one we recommend using some preservatives for microbial stability something mild something food grade and a nano emulsion is there are many definitions of what is an animal and what's not a good one in my mind is the one that requires it to have medium draw the size distribution under 300 nanometers it turns out that at that level things become stable so nano emotions with let's say 250 nanometer g50 it's a common method of measuring the entire distribution that's the that means 50% of your material is in droplets below that size and 50 bar so when that is are about 200-250 the nano motions tend to be stable they don't separate anymore if you want them to be translucent then everything has to be below 100 nanometers it just so happens that at that level at that size they don't interfere with light so the light can travel unobstructed therefore you get progressive translucency and ideally for good level of translucency and complete transparency after dosing you want the formulation to be about 50 or below between 20 and 40 maybe 50 nanometers in d50 now we talked a little a little bit about this before it's worth mentioning that nano motions are not new the terminology might be new but nano emulsion formulations are very familiar the English breakfast tea is actually based on the distribution is exactly the same as what a good nano motion would be coffee McDonald's coffee is actually pretty nice and symmetric this is beer Corona beer it's it's kind of funny it's it has two nano Muslims and one it has really small droplets probably micelles of some sort surface active agent in a beer and then something around a hundred probably will extract so they have been around beyond that in order to bring nano Mullins in order to bring hydrophobic actives into your into your body into your bloodstream or any fats for that matter a body creates something called mixed micelles I'll mention them a little bit later mixed micelles are also kind of like a non emulsion of formulation internally produced by your body with the surfactants that are present in the small intestine phospholipids and bile salts so we are a carrier of manner modern technology even if we don't even if we don't know it this is what happens with the reduction of droplet sizes things become more translucent so when you're above a hundred nano motions our milky milk is a typical nano emulsion that is milky being milk then once you get under 100 you can see light going through it a little bit at 50 it's going through this is concentrated so once you dose it it'll be maybe slightly cloudy maybe not and then when you're below 50 things become practically transparent very quickly we have some samples another table 60 so I can show you how the dose it and what it looks like by availability so this is a huge question very important to answer it properly I'm not aware of any studies done specifically on cannabis that would demonstrate exactly what happens with the by availability as a function of droplet size but it has been done for many other bio actives for pharmaceutical agents and it seems that the the increase is roughly the same no matter what drug you are considering and that's probably because it's not about the drug it's about how you're going to deliver it so it's more of a property of the vehicle of delivery and in that sense we can make indirect assumptions about what it would be for the cannabis delivery so this is a very very good study they created a bunch of nano emulsions and measured the blood concentrations of our drug so it 400 nanometers you can see that you're about five times lower than you are at 25 nanometers so the bioavailability increase or at least the intensity increases about a factor of five compared to that but if you compare that with just straight oil it would probably be another increase of sorts so you can expect somewhere between five and seven some people claimed nine I think it's a bit ambitious I would stay with about five or roughly speaking the bioavailability increase compared to just straight oil as an arable for example delivery now a little bit about the mechanism we don't have to go through this whole thing but it it's important to talk about the the blue part I don't think I have a tweener the way I don't know anyway just look at where the the drops are the yellow drops and the blue background so when you consume an oil or fat it arrives in your small intestine as a big drop or maybe several big drops now at that point your body can't absorb it because it has to be at the wall of the small intestine but there is something called an stirred aqueous layer that goes along the walls so it has to be able to travel through water to get there and it can't because it's in the oil and it doesn't mix with water properly so your your body has a light basis basically enzymes that will digest the triglyceride oils making them able to travel but they have to have the surface to do so so what happens first is you have to emulsify it yourself in your small intestine before it can be properly digested so surfactants come in some phospholipids bile salts come in and there's some peristaltic motion of the small intestine which makes an emulsion as soon as that happens lipases can get in cleave the glycerine from the triglyceride or remove a couple of fatty acids so from triglycerides you'll be making free fatty acids and monoglycerides those get assembled with the surfactants into what's called mixed micelles and this is basically the whole point we don't have to go beyond that mixed micelles are small droplets of about 10 nanometers in size or so with some distribution that are water comparable they're not dissolved but they look like they are and they can travel through water and get to the absorption site get to the entire site cells after that they can get absorbed and then a couple of things can happen they can go into the lymphatic system or into the blood and we can get into that but I think for the purposes of today or at least for now this is all the explanation that we need the reason that edibles takes so long to kick in and after that they're so gradual and only build up to the highest intensity after four hours or so is that this process has to happen first and it's a very gradual and slow process and then for an hour there's nothing after that they start slowly coming in because some of the mixed micelles are made and they got to where they need to go more is being made so you are feeling it but more is coming in so it's not a flat it's not a jump it's not like having a beverage an alcoholic beverage and having the alcohol all come in at once it's gonna be very slowly coming in after an hour and a half two hours you probably think you've been taken up and you take another dose then you're probably in space you know following Apollo so and and if you don't then then you still have to kind of wait forever and you're never really comfortable because you pass your comfort level then it's too much and then it stays in you because the liver is getting rid of it but more is still in your small intestines still coming in so it's it's a mess but the beauty of the Nano emulsions are is that they are essentially mixed micelles once you drink that you don't have to do any post-processing internally they can just get absorbed which is what alcohol does kind of accept alcohol is even better it's really it doesn't need mixed micelles it's just the individual molecules traveling but it's close enough so you consume basically a predigested oil that's what it really comes down to so it acts really quickly and it goes in completely and all at once ten minutes one set or so depending on who you ask and if the eight or not and little things like that but maybe ten maybe five maybe fifteen or so goes up stays flat after three hours gone this is what we offer for people to be able to make these things themselves basically there are two pieces of the puzzle you need the high shear equipment to be able to create the droplets and you need the formulation with all the components that I mentioned before which we offer in this pre-mixed state which we call the Nano stabilizer it has the carrier oil and the surfactants everything is food grade everything is very compliant completely tasteless so if your extract has to taste we will not interfere with it we will not change it we will not remove it either so what you start with is what you get we don't do masking at this stage but you could so between these two things you don't really have to do any rnd it's it's a plug-and-play situation the system comes preassembled you don't really have to learn anything it's basically like a food processor you just have to know what to put and where and what ratios so we give you a description of what to do mana stabilizer removes the need to develop your own formulation but if you want to develop your information by all means we don't prevent you in any way from doing it we don't require you there's not a stabilizer it's just there for convenience and we suggest a ratio that we believe is a good ratio of nano stabilizer to your active ingredient to use but if you're willing to live with a slightly bigger droplet size a little bit more a little less translucency for many people it's okay depending on the dose and where it's going then you can use less nano stabilizer so you can play with costs and things like that but basically it's all done and we make it as easy as we can possibly make it for our customers to do it without them having to have any special background this is what a system looks like this is our medium system it can make up to 25,000 doses per hour so five liters of nano emulsion at 50 milligrams per milliliter if 10 mixes is your dose so that's 25,000 doses you can make in one hour that's not counting prep obviously and cleanup and all that just running time we have three levels of these systems so the the lab scale system LSP 500 that's for basic R&D it's not a production system then the medium scale system is been scaled production the one I mentioned our large scale system and we have some pieces of it here you can look at it make up to $100,000 an hour which is generally enough for even large companies this is what the process looks like basically the droplet size distribution evolution with time as you process so in this example 20 liters of nano emulsion at 20 milligrams per milliliter of CVD were made with the medium system the famous kill system and nano stabilizer and you can see that as the droplet size it starts above 100 and then it progresses all the way down to below 20 19 millimeters and you can see what happens with translucency it starts milky and as you go along it becomes translucent so in our system we incorporate a side glass so we recommend that you have one there that you can just watch what happens and while it's milky you need to keep going once your translucent to a certain degree you can stop otherwise if you were always milky you would have to use specialized equipment dynamic light scattering or something and that's pretty expensive with translucency luckily you can just see it you can also see if it's losing its stability I haven't seen a case where it would there's no reason why it should but if for some reason it did it would become cloudy because the droplets would grow so it's another kind of simple level of quality control obviously if you need real numbers then you have to measure it and we are now starting real bioavailability studies it's a slow process there's a lot of stuff to get through but we do have some volunteer data where they would just be reporting high how high they feel what would they feel based on four different formulations so the first two the red one and green one is basically inedible or similar to an arable it's MCT oil with 10 milligrams of THC consumed by five volunteers in a capsule so we make sure that it got swallowed properly and the difference between them is the fed versus fasted state so the red line is a fasted State so empty stomach and you can see that well there was a delay but it try go in just the intensity was really low so the red line kind of it wants to go up but then it just kind of doesn't on an empty stomach edibles don't really work very well edibles might because the edible itself will have the oil but if you just consumed cannabis in a capsule it for us we would just need a much bigger dose the bioavailability of doing it that way is extremely low so we allowed people to eat after two hours and you can see what happened it went up and then I was already going down and to nothing and then once they ate it actually kicked in and it became a normal edible on a full stomach the Green Line by the way is what happens on a full stomach there's a delay after two hours it starts really coming in at Peaks at four as expected so if you start it on an empty stomach at an eight it kind of goes into that and also so it's hanging out waiting for food it's trying to go in but it can't without the oils and fats now with nano amalgams not only do you get higher intensities although intensities are not really fair to compare here because it's just self-reported high it's really not a very solid number but you can judge the onset of action it's very quick and in in our experiments we were actually surprised to notice that it doesn't even really matter if you ate or not so the blue line is fasted it goes in very efficiently very quickly lasts for a couple hours and then is gone on a full stomach the onset time is just a little bit slower and it's probably due to gastric emptying so things don't really get absorbed through the stomach they just don't the alcohol does a little bit but oils don't they need to be in a small intestine so one if you ate the food is sitting there and waiting and starting to empty into the small intestine and it happens on stages so that probably creates a bit of a delay once it's there it goes in quickly but the reason that the lines are different and we're gonna study this in detail is probably because once if you are absorbed on an empty stomach you go into the blood and then the to deliver the bioavailability is probably a bit lower the area under the curve is clearly lower and that's because you first go into the liver what you see it's a little more complicated I mentioned this before because you make hydroxy eleven as a first metabolite and you liver and that has its own psychic activity so things get a little bit complicated but if you do have food in in in you first that creates something called chylomicrons in your entire site cells in the absorption cells in the small intestine and those channel cannabinoids into the lymphatic system that goes around the liver so there is just more cannabis available to you and it lasts longer and still after four hours approximately it's over so in that way it kind of mimics an alcoholic beverage except a bit in Reverse so alcoholic beverage replacement manufacturers should have that in mind take it into account because on an empty stomach alcohol hits you more and I don't know if it lasts longer but that I always feel like it does on a full stomach you don't feel it as much and it's kind of like more manageable and I think it lasts less with cannabis it's it's the opposite you're gonna need to know that and with this thank you for your attention and thank you you", "7GR-YJvg2L8": "so while it looks complicated it's actually pretty simple it's a closed-loop system as it's called which means that it starts and ends in the same place this is the

through all the materials soaking it and as soon as the solvent passes over it it's basically picking up all of those compounds along the way and by the time it passes through here all the weed is left behind with no more of the good stuff it then goes through another hose line into this column this comp's known as the d-wax column this is where you separate all of the fats or lipids from the

but I think it must be a scam because I don't understand a word in this book hi I'm Greg welcome to happy talk and today I want to talk about syringes and how to use them these syringes that we carry come in one gram 1 gram syringes and which is a thousand milligrams of hemp and that's pure hemp extract there's no carrier oils there's no MCT there's no other oils in it and other additives just pure hemp and we carry two kinds one is has 17% CBD one is 25 percent so 17 percent of a thousand milligrams this one has 170 milligrams this is the gold 25% formula so that means it has 250 milligrams per each syringe these syringes are marked by 1/10 of a gram and that's generally a dose 1/10 you might want to take half of one tenth or one twentieth of a gram in the morning another one twenty the night or just you know one 1/10 once a day and these are really easy to use all you have to do is take off the cap at the end and then push off your dose easiest thing is just put it on your finger and then put it between your gums and cheek or you can also put it off in a spoon push it down and spoon that is so they push out your dose put it between your cheeks and gums and that's it now the gold formula tastes like normal hemp wood like you expect it to taste and the green formula 7 the 17% definitely has more it has more plant materials so it's definitely a stronger taste but both are work excellent and excellent way to get your daily CBD and now if you'll excuse me I got some Einstein to study you", "uc0dGl--GmY": "so after the cbd is extracted uh it's called crude we then mix that crude with a solvent which allows the plant fats to separate off from the cbd stevia d attracts the solvent the plant fats separate off and then we use a filter to actually separate off the plant fats with the mixture which is then the solvent and the cbd from there we take that to the rotovap we heat this up to the evaporation temperature of our solvent that evaporates it off we recollect that and reuse that and then what you're left with here is a winterized crew fat free [Music]", "276F4SeyeXc": "how's it going today my name is JD I'm the Key Account Manager here at Sub Zero scientific I just want to say thank you for your purchase and in this video I'm going to show you the parts that your system comes with how to operate the machine safely so when you purchase your system your system will come with your recovery chamber and the collection dish you have your gas tank this up here is a siphon tube to transfer liquids these are our vapor ports to transfer our vapors our safety blow-off valves then you'll also have a psi gauge on both your recovery chamber and gas tank you'll get your material column and with the material column also comes the material column cap the preffer ated reducer the high-pressure clamps and all the Viton gaskets to hook the system up so we have two different types of pump packages we have a single pump package and a dual pump package our single pump package is a single TRS 21 a single MT 69 solvent condenser you'll also get a vacuum pump to remove the oxygen from the system and to scale for weighing out your solvents you also get all the hoses and quick disconnects to connect the system to the pump after we have our hoses hooked up to our pump we'll take our hose from our MT 69 and hook it up to our recovery chamber and then we'll take our vacuum hose and hook it up to our other quick-disconnect and now we'll turn our vacuum pump on and I'm going to open our safety ball valve underneath our quick disconnect that our vacuum pump is hooked up to to remove all the oxygen out of our recovery chamber once we removed all the oxygen from my recovery chamber I'll open my safety ball valve hooked up to my hose that connects up to my MT 69 all the way to the out port of our recovery pump so now we're going to close our safety ball valve to our quick disconnect that's connected to our MT 69 we're going to remove that hose after we've removed all the oxygen from our recovery pump our lines as well as our recovery chamber we're also going to remove the oxygen from our gas tank but before I do that I'm just going to put my gas tank on the scale and get the empty weight so that way when I have to add solvent later I have a tare weight that I can subtract from and with the purchase of your system you will also get an extra five foot hose with a male quick disconnect on each end so we have a six to one ratio so I'm running one pound today so I'm going to add two still six pounds of solvent if you have our two pounder you're going to distill 12 pounds of solvent our five pounder field is still 30 and if you have our 10 pounder you don't have to distill 60 pounds of solvent now I'm going to turn my scale on so that way it's tared with our tank and our hose hooked up now we'll open our valve to our solvent tank we're going to open our safety ball valve and once we get to six pounds of solvent our negative 6 pounds of solvent on our scale that I have now I've reached six pounds so this is a 2 micron phase separation paper this is going to trap all the fats lipids and waxes during our in line d waxing process I'm going to set my filter in my gasket set my gasket on our preferir and we'll set that on the bottom of our material column now we'll connect our reducer with our high-pressure clamps tighten your clamps down evenly if you tighten one side down all the way and then try and tighten the other side it won't seat right and that could cause a leak in your system so now we're going to pack our material column today we're going to run some go GOG trim so I'm going to pack it into a little ball and then we'll pack it from the top of our column and I'll add about two to three handfuls and then I'll pack it down you want to try and get as even and tied up a pack as you can so after I add about two to three handfuls I'll use my packing tool to pack down our our material the packing film filters are also included when you purchase a machine I was really good now we'll add our material column cap so we're going to add ice to our condensing coil this is going to help condense our vapor back into a liquid now the butane is evaporating going through our recovery pump is a vapor as it travels through our m269 it's going to convince back into a liquid before going into our gas tank leaving all the impurities that have a higher boiling point than butane left behind now all of our butane is transferred from our recovery chamber to our gas tank I'm going to close my safety ball valve and remove my hose I'm going to come over to my gas tank close my safety ball valve and remove my hose and then I'm going to turn my pump off now that I've reached negative ten in my recovery chamber we'll pull it out of our hot water bath now that I recover your chambers out of our hot water bath I'm going to go ahead and equalize the pressure and now we'll remove our collection dish now we're going to clean out our mystery oil with some 99% isopropyl alcohol so once we have our recovery chamber cleaned and assembled we're going to put our gasket on top of our ball valve and now we'll place our material column on top of our recovery chamber now we're going to vacuum out all the oxygen from our recovery chamber and our material column you want to make sure that your ball valve on your recovery chambers opens that way we're removing the oxygen from our material column at the same time is our recovery chamber it's very important to remove the oxygen butane isn't flammable and less mixed with the ratio of 1.8% oxygen so we're going to remove all the oxygen to eliminate that factor now that our system is vacuumed I'm going to close my safety ball valve underneath our quick disconnect remove my vacuum line and turn off my pump now I'll add our dry ice and isopropyl alcohol now that we have our dry ice in our sleeve I fill it up to about an inch to two inches from the top and then we'll add our isopropyl alcohol you want to be sure to kind of add it slow otherwise it will get really violent and boil over the edge now we're going to hook up our hose to our siphon tube into the top of our material column and we'll open our safety ball valve under our quick disconnect on our siphon tube as well as on top of our material column now we're transferring liquid from our siphon tube up our hose and into the top of our material column flooding our column from the top now we're going to put our gas tank in our hot water bath the pressure inside the gas tank will push the liquid up the siphon tube into the top of our material column at a faster rate so now as we flood our column I'm going to crack our ball valve just a little bit and let just a little bit of solvent through and then shut it just to make sure that there are no voided pockets or areas that any of the butane might have missed now that our column is flooded this is where most people can use their own judgement and experiment with different soak times ourselves we're going to actually do a 30 minute soak time on this material so we'll check back in with you guys in 30 minutes now that all my gauges read the same when I go ahead and remove my hose from my siphon tube and my material column now I'll hook up my hose that's connected to the import of my recovery pump to my recovery chamber and my hose that's connected to our MT 69 to our gas tank and then we'll open our safety ball valves under our quick disconnects and turn our pump on so this step is called our dry recovery so we started our recovery process without having any hot temperatures to our recovery chamber because we don't want to build any pressure we actually want to reduce the amount of pressure creating a vacuum that way all the solvent that's trapped in our material column will be collected in our recovery chamber now that our dry recovery is over I'll go ahead and shut our ball valve and remove our material column so now we'll put our safety cap on and place our recovery chamber and our hot water back so we'll use our sight glass as well as check our gaze on our psi I like to let it get down to about negative five before I'll pull it out now that our recovery chamber is out of our hot water bath we're going to make sure to dry it off and then we're going to remove our collection dish and pour it right onto our parchment paper so we're going to open our valve and remove our collection dish so this is going to turn out to be a very stable product you", "3P9Dz3G-nIo": "it's a great day to talk cbd creams and oils for topical pain relief i'm dr donald fabio cbd from hemp oil is what we're going to be talking about today and how it's used as a topical pain relieving liniment it's very common it's available everywhere just about all 50 states right now i believe over the counter and again it's a hemp oil extract which means there's very little thc in there there's no psychoactive effect so let's be clear about that we're not talking about the medicinal marijuana we're talking about hemp oil extracts cbd so how can you tell if it's going to be a beneficial for you well you got to read the ingredients and once you read the ingredients you can determine if it's going to be a good product you look at the concentration you look at what's in there and you look at what your goals are so right now our goals are pain relief that's what we're talking about so i just have a couple of creams randomly chosen cbd plus oil gold formula full spectrum hemp extract which is what we talked about so that's good it has the ingredients 100 milligrams of cbd we don't know how much per serving but the jar is 100 milligrams and it's got sweet almond oil beeswax and glycerol stearate and a bunch of other ingredients on the bottom here but no artificial dyes or scents so that's good no artificial dyes or scents it's got a lot of emollience a lot of things that are going to soften your skin with cbd which means it's going to set on your skin probably really good for someone who has a skin lesion like psoriasis or eczema something like that i don't think it'll be really good for pain control because it's not going to penetrate through the skin beeswax sweet almond oil those are oils hemp oil it's an oil it's going to sit on the skin so might be good for skin types of things where you want moisturizing and healing but i don't think it's good for pain control cbd clinic pain relief ointment oh now we're going right after pain they're claiming this relieves pain let's look at their ingredients cbd hemp oil good so we know it's it's there it's safe 400 milligrams so um this is 1.55 ounces this is 1.3 ounces so there's a lot more cbd in here um there's peppermint oil tea tree oil eucalyptus oil clove oil so lots of good oils in here um we look at the label however under active ingredients and it lists camphor 11 and menthol 16 wow that's really high so you're going to get a lot of icy hot you're going to get a lot of counter irritants menthol will give you a cooling effect camphor kind of gives you that cooling heating effect so it's an icy hot 17 percent icy hot is very very strong so this will give you a counter irritant effect i don't know if it's going to decrease the inflammation but it doesn't really address the pain directly it dresses it into correctly because it irritates the skin with the menthol in the camphor and then therefore the brain doesn't sense the pain in the area so it doesn't go after the cause but very strong stuff the next one we have is phytozol transdermal phytocannabinoid complex serum uh what are their active ingredients well it's a 100 milligrams of micro encapsulated time released photocannabinoid complex cbd so the cbd here is encapsulated well and what it's encapsulated in dgme which is a transfer agent so here um there is no menthol there is no camphor there is no methyl solicitolate it's just cbd which is an oil which is encapsulated surrounded in dgme which allows it to get through the skin into the deeper tissues um i do know this does not get into the blood by the way i did research that it doesn't say it on the label it just stays in the in the superficial tissues so this will actually penetrate through the skin it won't sit on the skin so if you're in the cbd gets into the skin through the skin and once it penetrates then it can become an active ingredient at the deeper levels and it binds with the endocannabinoid receptors in your body going after the cause of your problem and suppressing the pain and inflammation that way so a transdermal agent that goes through the skin and doesn't sit on the skin so the active ingredient goes through the skin only company i know that has that whether it's cbd or not cbd that just sits on the skin with emollients cbd with counter irritants so you feel the icy hot so you know something's working but you don't know if the cbd is working so the bottom line is what are you looking for do you want to go after the pain and inflammation or do you just want to do a counter irritant if you just want to do a counter irritant i would say skip the cbd and just go to a really high concentration methyl salicylate menthol camphor formula that you can buy anywhere as well if you want to use the cbd it makes sense to do the phytozol because then you're going to be able to get an ingredient that penetrates through the skin scientifically proven to go six times deeper than other companies penetrate there's the information now you know i'm dr donald fabio thanks for tuning in", "lLz2m5zzM8U": "1914 you guys find it useful and if you find it useful then do like share and subscribe to study couch thanks for watching and have a good day", "z6dfCwaYWfI": "the super flower tower clean pure extraction method we're gonna start first with a strainer grain alcohol a measuring cup and a jar that can be shaken we're gonna first start by unlatching the locking springs removing the condensing unit the gasket the strainer basket and reclamation cup and we're going to use our favorite herb to extract topical properties of fibers resins and/or oils that could be on the top of a lot of different herbs win a place approximately an ounce and a half of herb in the jar that's going to be shaken we're gonna take the measuring cup and add one and a half cups of grain alcohol in doing so ready to add it to the jar for the shaking method seal the alcohol bottle for safety measures now pour the grain alcohol into the jar that's gonna be sealed for shaking this is going to last approximately 10 minutes you're going to be removing all the topical properties from the herb after shaking for 10 minutes we're gonna place a strainer in the reservoir and a filter to strain the alcohol from the herb now the topical properties that have been washed off of the herb and are gonna be draining through the filter to the bottom of the reservoir once this is accomplished you're going to want to find a piece of cheesecloth or a very clean rag that you can actually put around the coffee filter to put a nice kungfu grip on it and squeeze the rest of the remaining alcohol from the herb once this has been accomplished you can discard that herb because the washing method is Finca bleeded it's that easy they're gonna remove the strainer I'm gonna show you what the alcohol oil looks like before you start the reclamation process we're gonna place the strainer basket back into the reservoir in a reclamation cup in the strainer basket we're going to replace the seal the condensing unit we're going to latch the locking springs to the unit securely plug in the unit and turn the unit on to five and start the process this should last approximately four to five hours you can check it after four let's start from there now this can start to cleanup of the process you'll clean up and wait next we're going to turn it off unplug the unit and let it cool for approximately thirty minutes after its cooled remove the locking springs the condensing tower the seal and carefully remove the reclamation cup containing the alcohol this alcohol needs to be cool for easy handling you can reuse the alcohol on your next run this is one of our best points on our extractor to super flower tower when handling the alcohol we recommend using a small funnel to pour back in the original container and cap it to be safe this unit is all about safety and the comfort of your home or garage just remember to use it in a well-ventilated area because alcohol is flammable after capping the bottle we're gonna plug it unit back in this is what's in the reservoir you have a combination of alcohol and your sensual this is this a residue so we're gonna turn the unit on to approximately five five and a half and we're gonna watch the alcohol slowly leave the oil essential oil this takes some time and this is where you're gonna better yourself with the procedure to make a perfect product it takes a little time you just watch you'll notice it's getting thicker the alcohol there's just a little bit left until the oil is essentially thick to your consistency that you're used to using and that's how simple it is with the super flower Tower", "G7GklIFSSAU": "Delta time THC there's now a huge thread regarding that and don't live when we had a fun little for it for take a little for a layman's background so so depending it specifically yeah everybody's different and I'll all have their own special ways of a festival but depending on where or how the different pieces of the molecule are laid out you you know the difference between THC delta 9 and T and C a is th EA has a carbolic acid molecule in its tail and no boxer group carboxyl group and in another thing there's Delta 88 C which has gotten really popular with the water clear trend and people would you know they would throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and stuff into their boiling flask and then they'd start distilling it and it's coming out beautiful water clear they sent test results or they'd sent testing labs and then it's yeah like very low percentage of Delta 9 THC eventually we started they got standards for Delta 88 C then started quantifying that there's more THC in us that there is but then there's still a little missing piece that like you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent cannabinoids and this water clear stuff that you know it's all cannabinoids and there's plenty of isomers and stereo isomers of THC and these are things that happen through different reaction their reactions that happen through heating and the presence of acids and bases and given the different environmental things or what was sprayed on those so that that can actually be a big indicator what's happening into the reactions as well so so good all that distillation method we're like you put stuff in a pot it boils at different temperatures and all that well throw catalyst in that pot that you don't know is there like you know people spray put sulfur on their plants or people you know certain things get sprayed on plants and when you concentrate that thing in a hot flask under vacuum where fires and fire attack there's a whole bunch of ways you could do that but to go back to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown type of THC that until recently was it is yes in different income in different ways they affect all three of those can affect a single person completely different no they've been discovered but they're only being mass-produced yeah they yeah macula vanilla and knows about him and he has and we are just now mass producing them because we have the freedom of the market to start and start playing and then we also have the competition in the market to try to make the clearest most beautiful looking oil which you know well it used to be Delta 8 th DW I mean I we can I know use I'm saying historically historically when they first started getting this perfectly clear bottle of oil it was Delta eight and they would do this refluxing carbon acids and but but but yeah and that was it then they would use a catalyst in the flask that they were boiling in one we're talking about people who appreciate the clarity that clear net the secret is that the consumer is that an expert consumers okay and what's your opinion on consumers have been led to believe that the clear the oil is well and and and that clear could come from a lot of different things it can be cut with another clear oil that it makes you know just diffuses what color is in there there's a lot of things that can clarity is definitely an indicator of purity though it was an indicator but the a slight yellow amber tint the these are little little atomic level refractions that are happening with chromophores that hold into the the tail end of the molecule these these are what a chromophore is uncle mela these they're they're basically like atomically small things that will refract light at a different color so you have so by breaking that bond you you like that's when people distill with certain things on the flask you can break that at that chromophore bond and it you can also break that bond by through chromatography as well which people eventually developed a method for Delta 9 THC does anyone clear water clear yeah and it that was just a method of taking a single pass distillate and then passing it through a series of usually magnesium silicate or floor so actually and then but different color remediating adsorbents that were also being used to remediate past asides and they still are used to remediate pesticides and it just happened that you make water clear delta 9 after remediating pesticides properly as sometimes depending on the oil and what kind of colors and that the condition THC 8 and 10 have been known for and their-their prevalent in the same way that THC is in Canada like there is it kind of like a is it a totally different cannabinoid that is in very low percentages in well zombie health of ours not so much on the cultivar it's a reaction through processing so you're not gonna have those you're not gonna have a bunch of Delta eight or delta10 any in your flowers you're gonna have it in a kind of a crazy their isomers correct and it was the one thing everything we're talking about is like the ability to narrow the bands of what you're capturing well if you cuz you're right it's it's these little slices but the only way that's possible is that we've now created these massive machine that will process a lot so we get bigger trends you know we we see information come out of plant material from farms all over California grown differently going different ways different yields different strengths different compounds or the makeup of the cannabinoids in that specific strain like it's really interesting we get to see a lot of those so at the same time as we're narrowing the focus and really like getting to chop down into you know now we're we just picked up a machine that will separate out individual cannabinoids so you can collect them individually it's a centrifugal partitioning chromatography this company called rodeo cron they catch it you guys okay yeah sorry THC eight and ten are kind of like mine or like other cannabinoids that we've known about it but haven't been able to isolate so on the market are we gonna eventually see like THC eight tinctures and THC ten tinctures in the same way that we see other kind of my hair cannabinoid totally and we've been seeing mostly we've been seeing a lot of THC eight cart hay in cartridges and there is subsequently a decent amount of Delta ten THC that's in there well no they're just calling it if you're buying a card off the traditional market you they're saying it's one thing but who knows what really is in that cartridge right so but because you can take garbage oil and by attorney by doing this process to convert it to Delta eight clean it up to make it look clear a lot of guys do that ii buy a really cheap oil get a little bit of a fraction of that off and this really nice-looking oil and then it's just cheaper the way that that's produced then I like water clear Delta nine it takes extremely expensive absorbance and a process to do it with the Delta eight you throw some activated carbon in their flask and if you distill right here you can get water clear I mean there's a few other a few other parameters to change but you just dump a bunch of garbage in your flask and then just mix it with your oil and your oil is coming out nicely that was what a bunch of people were doing to fix their dark oil especially in the early day when people really weren't distilling very well", "Y87yxZsDQTs": "hello everybody and welcome back your burger canvas and this week's video I'm gonna teach you how we make CBD oil here on the farm but first if you're new here to the channel please hit that subscribe button if you've already subscribed thank you very much so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil here on the farm so obviously first thing you're gonna need is CBD hemp flour now we grew this all year and this is about 3 and 1/2 ounces now they recommend magic butter machine which is what we're going to use they recommend 7 to 14 grams per cup of oil your choice of oil but the oil that I like to use here is MCT oil now this is fractured coconut oil to pretty much just have no coconut flavor and mono saturated fats what's cling on to CBD so those are pretty much the two ingredients in our CBD oil the next thing you're gonna want to do is after you weigh out your flour and you figured out how many cups of oil you want to use now typically I do two cup run and I will use about 12 grams of flour per cup I just like that ratio seems to work really well so you weigh it out on your scale and then you decarboxylate it now magic butter machine has its own decarboxylated flow and I put it in the oven at 250 degrees to 230 degrees really depends on where you want it how fast you want it low and slow I like to go with my D carb and you're gonna want to do it for twenty to thirty minutes so that's what we're gonna start off with so let's get right into how we make our CBD oil okay guys so now we're going to turn on the oven so first thing we're gonna do for our oven here is we're gonna hit the bake button we're gonna bring it down to 230 degrees Fahrenheit then we're just gonna hit start and now while it's preheating I'm gonna weigh out my flour and put it on this aluminum Flo so I'll be right back okay now that we've made our little container for our flour and today we'll be using our by ox flour that we grew this summer the next thing I'm going to do now that this is all good I'm gonna cover it up and more aluminum foil so you want to make sure that it's nice and covered because you want to keep all of those proteins in there and you really don't want to lose a lot of that flavor so to speak from the bud and then once we do that I'll take a knife it's almost like making a pie you know you're gonna want to cut a couple holes in it and that will let out any kind of moisture so now we're going to stick it in the oven for about 25 minutes okay so now we have decarboxylated our CBD hemp flour which is right here so this is pretty much what it looks like it just gets a little bit darker nothing crazy but it activates that CBD a and then what we're gonna do is I'm gonna get all that in here so that was approximately 24 grams of CBD hemp flour now what we're gonna do is we're going to add two cups of her MC tu Oh now the reason why I prefer MCT will is because it's just the best carrier for this CBD you can use coconut oil and you can use olive oil and a bunch of other oils but MCT really holds it the best and it has the most mono saturated fats per serving so there is our two cups of MCT oil we're just going to add it right into the machine get that all in there okay and that's it guys with the magic cutter machine it's a set it and forget it so now we're going to go ahead we're going to walk this thing on we're going to plug it in okay now if you can see the buttons here and I'll try to pull it up a little closer to the camera you're going to be able to see these flashing buttons first you're gonna want to go to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit and I like to do it for four hours because this is an oil tincture and that's it now it's good to go and you'll see the light starting this is starting the process of making the CBD oil and the great thing is guys there's no food processor there's no mess you can do this a whole bunch of other ways but I really love my magic butter machine because this is a no mess set it and forget it thing so we'll see you in four hours and you'll be able to see the final product alright everybody so the CBD oil is complete now I didn't catch it in time but the whole thing illuminates like blue and red and pink and once it's done it'll start flashing so this thing is ready to take out so now we're going to go through the process of extracting our oil from the material in the magic butter machine so as you can see it is all over the place in here and so what you should have is a spatula of some sort I just have a silicone one which is what a lot of people use I guess for this machine I don't think it's necessary but what you're going to do is you're just going to try to get all this material off the butter machine as best you can you know you can drive yourself crazy trying to get it all off but you want to get the majority of it a lot gets up underneath it so that's pretty good for me then what you're gonna do is you're going to kind of like scoop the sides you're gonna want to get it all in there okay so we are probably going to get less than two cups so I'm gonna get my bigger because you're gonna have to take this now magic butter gives you they call the love glove and the micron bag this is to extract all the plant material so you want to carefully get all that will in there now you use spatula again get as much of it in there as you can you can see down in there there's still quite a bit so that's what I'm trying to get out right now it smells awesome you guys alright that'll be good enough for now so next thing you're gonna do is gonna want to get your your silicone glove on your dominant hand so for me I'm a right-handed person you need to pick it up and you're gonna squeeze that bag this is the best you can you don't want to extract all that oil out of there if you can see it still coming out of there okay and that's it there's your CBD oil and I'll show you the finished product here so that is MC t CBD oil now what I'll do after this is I will put it in a bottle like this food-grade you can buy these at Walmart or Dollar Tree for for less than a dollar and then I will use it to fill these cvd vials so that's it for today's video if you like the video please don't forget to give it a thumbs up and if you haven't subscribed yet please do I would really appreciate it you can

extracts as well as going ahead and turning some into cartridges as well so stay tuned we're going to check this out say hi eric hi eric all right so we're here in the test kitchen the first thing you're going to want to do when it comes to making an ethanol extraction is get both of your ethanol and your material that you're going to process in this case some cbd bud and trim as cold as possible in order to do that we go ahead and we pick up some dry ice we put it in the cooler and we put both the bud and the alcohol separately in different jars in the cooler for anywhere between 8 and 24 hours you want to be able to see temperatures below negative 20 degrees fahrenheit in order to process properly using this method all right so once all of the material and the alcohol has actually been frozen for at least eight hours preferably 24 or more we go ahead and take the ethanol and the material and mix them together in the same jars give them a quick shake and put them right back into the dry ice for another 30 to 45 minutes as of right now we've had our products sitting on dry ice for about 45 minutes with the ethanol so we're going to get ready to go ahead and take it out and go ahead and get it filtered all right so now that we have all of our extracted material ready to go through our filter we're going to do this process as quickly as we possibly can we're going to take the lid right off the top here and we're going to swish it out with a mesh coarse strainer lid this strainer is going to help keep the flour material from getting into our next jar it's going to help prevent the chlorophyll and fatty lipids from getting there as the alcohol begins to warm up and it's going to allow us to have an easier time getting this process through the actual buffner funnel in just a few moments all right so we've got our buckner funnel here and we're going to go ahead and take a filter disc this is about 25 microns we're going to take this filter disk put it right in the bottom of our buckle funnel our buckner funnel is a funnel that has perforations in the bottom of it that you then hook up a vacuum pump to so that you can pull your liquid through at a faster rate than you otherwise would have in the event that you don't have access to a buffer funnel you can do this process using just your mason jars and a coffee filter over the mason jar end but that process does take considerably longer so we're going to take a little bit of ethanol here and we're going to squirt it right around on the top of the filter disc and we're just going to smooth it around with our hands a little bit just to make sure that it gets a nice seal we're going to go ahead and turn on the vacuum pump and we got a little help today from eric here at campbell gamer so you want to turn on that pump for us and now we've gone ahead and just uh moved our fingers around the outer edges and make sure that there's a nice full seal on the actual disc once we've done the process using the 25 micron disc we're going to do the process again using a 10 a micron as well as a 4 micron to help get out all of the remaining nasties and additional fats and lipids out of the material anything that otherwise would cause our final product to be less uh pure so we'll go ahead and wash the strain here you'll notice it's actually draining out pretty fast this should only take about 45 seconds or so to complete the process in its entirety and then i'm going to show you guys what the filter disc looks like when we're done here method variations hot soaking your material as opposed to using frozen material is a great way to obtain a higher medicinal value for use in capsules and tinctures however we don't usually recommend this method for dabbing or vaping as it does pull a considerable more undesirable material into your final product extract craft products are a great way to extract ethanol for your material however using a double boiler or a rotovap will also work long soaking your material is going to provide you a higher medicinal value but is also going to pull more chlorophyll and undesirables into your end product doing a short soak is much more desirable when working with dabbing or vaping purging is absolutely necessary when dabbing or vaping your final product as you need to ensure that you've removed all the ethanol and you're not vaping it if you're not vaping or dabbing the product and are instead using it for topicals edibles or capsules purging the ethanol is not always necessary so you'll see our funnel is now done draining we'll go ahead and turn off the vacuum pump and we received all of this extra sediment through this filter we're going to process these again like i said through a 10 micron as well as a 4 micron filter to see what else we can get out of this but as of right now we'll go ahead and take this disc and set it off to dry when this is all done we like to collect this and go ahead and use it in edibles it doesn't have many cannabinoids left in it but it will provide a little bit of a medicinal effect for you all right so now we're going to take our filter material and we're going to go ahead and pour it right into our ito pro here we're going to be careful not to let any splash around because if you get any of this on the floor the ethanol is going to dry up and it's going to leave you a nice sticky mess that you're not going to be able to enjoy once we got ahead and put all the material into the container we go ahead and slap on the lid here we're going to hold down our hand on the lid as well as over on top of this jar here while we give it a start switching it back i forgot to turn on the switch in the back though so i should probably do that first i did eric forgot to do the switch in the back there you go one of us forgot to do the switch in the back but now it should be ready to go let's go ahead and hold these for about five seconds as long as this light stays green and doesn't start flashing on us we're pretty good to go and we can go ahead and uh let go we've already got some ethanol pulling through the system uh some of which is going to be some residual leftover one last time the machine was run but either way it's all going to be a usable reclaimed ethanol that can then be used in the next batch we're going to let this run for about 90 minutes to two hours we're going to come back and check on it every 45 minutes or so for the first hour and a half and then we'll check on it consistently every few minutes just to ensure that we don't end up going too far past the point of uh removing the extract from the system otherwise the chance having the material stick to the sides of the container and also run into issues with decarboxylation soaking time soaking for less than 30 minutes creates a honey-colored chlorophyll-free extraction soaking for longer pulls more cannabinoids into the final extraction but also has a green or dark appearance and a taste of chlorophyll the purge as mentioned previously purging is not necessary when using the extraction in edibles capsules or tinctures purge your material under full vacuum at 95 to 100 degrees heat until the bubbling stops it is best not to exceed 105 degrees to help retain terpenes and prevent decarboxylation however if not using a vacuum you can heat to 175 degrees and stir constantly over several minutes for a quick purge dabbing once purged the remaining concentrate can be dabbed in a rig or vaped in a concentrated vape pen alternatively the concentrate can be mixed with coconut oil or another carrier and used in tinctures edibles topicals and capsules magnetic mixing plates a heated magnetic mixing plate is great for purging when no vacuum pump is available the mixing plate makes combining extracts with carriers and terpenes extremely simple and easy terpenes terpenes can be added to your extract to thin the concentrate and make it readily usable in vape cartridges use sparingly though as terpenes can be very strong in flavor for cartridges use roughly one to two drops per gram of material thanks for tuning in to grower's guide hopefully now you have a general understanding of how to create an ethanol extraction if you have any questions or concerns regarding today's segment or would like to set up a consultation appointment please reach out to us at

today we're going to talk about a demonstration on our 2005 of the series extraction systems get started on discussing that about the 2005 LD versus our desktop unit versus our 5000 psi series the 2000 series refers to the back depression of its system will run so this system will run between 900 and 1,900 PSI whereas our 5000 series will run between nine hundred and forty nine hundred psi the 5l team versus 20 LD refers to the size of the extraction vessel the amount of material the machine can hold so this is a five liter vessel and we make 20 liter vessels as well you can do any combination of a five or a twenty liter vessel we'll start with a five liter vessel and then later on if they decide they need more processing capacity well add another five or add a twenty leader vessel right here we already have the bolt holes inside it's a really simple install we'll come out and install them additional vessel whenever you're ready let's get started the 2000 series system just like any other system comes with three components you have your system itself for the extraction where your material going in and where the extraction will take place you have a chiller which maintains temperature throughout the system all these vessels are jacketed so we have water running through every single one of these vessels that's what these blue lines are for so water will leave the chiller it controls and monitors the temperature in the extraction vessel down here we have a remote probe that's connected to the chiller so our temperatures in here are monitored and controlled to set our extraction parameters the rest of the water lines are going to places like our pump over here our diaphragm compressor or our separation vessels just to maintain temperatures throughout the system so nothing's overheating or nothing's getting too cold um that's what the chiller is used for then we have our compressor it's either this system uses it's an electric 220 volt diaphragm compressor very deficient it's extremely low maintenance system and the way it all works is that you over here when you're ready all right so before we hit start I'm going to discuss how everything works and then we will actually see it happen what happens that units start is the co2 dance from your co2 bottles goes to the pump the pump then sends that co2 compresses it over here in our extraction vessel in here or our plant materials out we'll have a liquid or supercritical co2 flowing across that plant material acting as a solvent will then bring that liquid co2 over endure separation vessel inside here we have amorphous ballast expansion technology it's this little tiny hole right here so that liquid co2 comes in and shoots through this little tiny hole if this orphis which is holding back 1200 psi or 4,000 psi co2 in maintaining 300 to 400 psi gas to co2 in here co2 is a gas in here your oil then falls out into the collection cup down here then we send our - through one more make sure we have all the oil out of it then we send the gas back to the pump and then cycle continues over and over it's a continuous flow and it will last anywhere from one hour at the 48 hours depending on how much material you're trying to process so when you buy a system and it arises at your facility because you get three boxes three crates this comes all in one crate the compressor will come in a crate and then the children's come in the crate all you have to do to connect the three pieces is connect the water lines and a couple of gas lines and I'm gonna discuss electrical real quick on this system our 1500 psi 1 liter system our desktop version that you see on the price list is all 110 single-phase electricity this system our 2000 series systems or you have an option between single or three-phase electricity and if you choose single-phase were out we have a 220 volt chiller 110 volt system in a 220 volt scene plays compressor our 5000 psi series are all three-phase they require a 220 volt chiller 110 volt system and three-phase electricity for the large air compressor so now I'm going to discuss starting this thing up so what we do is before we hit start we'll come over here to our extraction vessel open it up our plant material in here I have a grinding video that shows me actually loading an extraction vessel if you'd like to see that video it's also on youtube you we recommend coffee ground sized dried plant material go in here after we load our material in here after we load our material in here and on our new system to meet some recent design changes all you do is go and pull this down now I'm gonna come over here we just hit start and it walks us through everything so first and asks us in our target pressure between 999 or psi right up here I've got 1,400 psi entered I'm gonna change that down to 1200 psi for this run and I acknowledge tells us the inner a number of run hours number of run hours is determined by how much plant material you put in your extraction vessel and what pressures and temperatures you're running if you're running at higher pressures and temperatures typically these systems will process about a pound per hour if you decide to run into lower pressures and temperatures the system processes about a pound every two to three hours so since this is just a demonstration I'm just going to put one hour in check chiller set point so it's reminding us to set a temperature over here on our chiller right now we have it in Fahrenheit we're going to turn the power on about seventy-five degrees Fahrenheit if you're running lower pressures and lower temperatures 55 to 75 is good temperature range if you decide to run higher pressures higher temperatures we recommend around 100 degrees Fahrenheit on the chiller after we've set our set point we're gonna acknowledge now it's reminding us just to check everything so it's telling us verify our separator vessels are secure that these are our separator vessels we're just checking each one of these clamps make sure they're all tight there should be about 8th to 16th inch spacing in between these two these trad clamps we're also just gonna check real quick make sure the fittings up here are secure which they are full acknowledge it's reminding us to make sure our extractor is secure which we already tighten earlier we'll acknowledge it's telling us to close valve 10 so the only manual valve on this system is right here this will be opened at the end of every run to prevent the remaining pressure stuck in the system then we close it right before we start a run close that we're here acknowledged it's not telling us to open our co2 bottles open these up this is gas fed food-grade co2 we do not recommend using liquid down to co2 bottles now when I acknowledge it the system is going to take off and do its thing so now as you see up here it's shown that it's filling the extractor here's our extractor pressure this corresponds to this extractor over here we have our separator pressure this corresponds to both our separators two things are tied together then up here we have separator temperature this is corresponding to the temperature inside of our separator what's happening now as you see it's filling the extractor so once this pressure reaches our set point it will then go in the forward or reverse flow mode all that means is that the co2 is either entering the top of the extraction vessel leaving the bottom or entering the bottom leaving the top every run that flow direction changes reversing attacks it's not there yet his assistants not in flow mode but there'll be an option for reversing the direction plus you can actually control with your flowing top to bottom or bottom to top so it's still filling and it says so we'll let it keep filling I'm going to show you real quick what these do over here we have a logo screen so you ever just want to keep your extraction parameters private you'll come over here it just shows a logo screen code entry screen so if we decide to finance a machine every month you have to enter a code keep the machine running we have a valve control screen this is just used for debugging and troubleshooting alarm screen this is to track anything that has happened on the machine we also have the message select screens these are all the text messages or emails you can have sent to your phone so you're gonna simply track the entire run via email or your phone or if there's an issue it'll notify you that's what they Ethernet cable over here on the sides of machines for plug straight into the Internet this also gives us the ability to save your software updates so you can send those software updates to you free of charge as long as you're plugged into the Internet get the maintenance screen this is to keep track of hours on everything we have for resettable functions you can keep checking your pump hours or cleaning hours on becomes assistance started and then we also have its master hours of minutes after that the manual screen I'll come back to that in just a minute we have the i/o screen and it's also just a troubleshooting or debug screen let you know what's going on at that moment most of these other screens over here you hardly ever use the manual screen though is pretty important in this screen at any point we can change co2 bottles if the system notices the co2 bottles are low a yellow box will come up here and remind you to change the co2 bottles you'll acknowledge that box and then you'll swap out your models or you can manually do it so right now I can hit change co2 bottle and at any point come over here right now I'd close these I take these off you know as you see the system's still running so it doesn't stop the flow this is but it does isolate these models so you can take these off and put new bottles on hook them back up once you got your new bottles connected just says when bottle change is complete press here to resume normal operation we also have to recover co2 to any point and stop the run early or simply cover co2 it puts our co2 from the system back into the co2 bottles a lot of people want to know how much co2 it recovers their recovers up to about 90 percent of the co2 you can also wheel into the clockwork this function this function is called either a I showed you this little tiny hole usually on the very first run there might be a little piece of debris for manufacturing they can clog this so instead of having to shut down the entire system you can hit clear clogged orphis which I'll go ahead and do you hit clear fog orphis what happens as you notice down here on these gauges these gauges will pump down and then once they reach 100 psi will vent it and then it allows you to get in here and clean this out if there is a clog other most common reason people use the clear fog or dysfunction is to harvest oil in run so say you wanted to run machine at a lower pressure lower temperature let it run for an hour to get clear fog or mist come down here harvest your oil out of your collection cotton so that first hour and a lower pressure lower signature is gonna be your turn beans and lighter oils go harvest those off put your collection cut back on resume normal operation I'm just going to go ahead and leave pause or dispose an ounce back to normal operation do to resume normal operation and at that point you can come in here and change your pressures and temperatures at any time during the run so I can crank this up to you know 1,900 PSI raise my temperatures on my chiller and then get more of a thorough extraction a lot of people will do that they'll do a real short run low pressure low temperature get their terpenes off or their lighter oils off then they'll free install their collection cup crank up pressures and temperatures and to get max yield Luther now the system's just going to run you see here are separators for between 250 and 350 s where we want them to be and it's just going to sit here and continue to run as I described earlier we have liquid co2 it's liquid at this pressure and temperature in our extractor Network right now is flowing over our plant material and then we're bringing that over here in our oil you know separating out of the co2 collection cup take away in the machine once it reaches its right now in our selected so once it reaches its power point it'll go into recovery mode at that point it takes up 30 minutes or so to recover all the co2 back in the co2 bottle and then you can shut it down properly which we will discuss in a minute so we don't have such long and NASA fights right there recovery pull everything down about 100 psi so the longer these kids are at the board leftover Dasom in the system you're kind of wasted always asking a participant of the room the other component machine I didn't discuss earlier was this small air compressor what it does err through these pink lines so it's actually controlling all of our bowels in the system so in here all of our controls are allen-bradley all this is done in-house in Ohio everything here we assemble in Ohio we do all of our own programming everything in here is extremely Universal a lot of people are familiar with allen-bradley components every single one of these cards are going to be here for a long time so in five years from now if something in here goes wrong it's all extremely Universal and all extremely replaceable so now our system to be given to our Park a little message box came up they said recovery of co2 is a gun touch here to acknowledge even if you're not here you don't need to touch here to acknowledge but if you are here go ahead and touch what's happening it's pulling down co2 it's slowly putting everything back into the bottles the reason the co2 recovery process takes up to 30 minutes is because we don't want to take our liquid co2 out of our extraction vessel and send it straight to our bottles there could potentially still be oil in that mint we like blood all that the quiz through our separators turn it back to the gas then we send that gas so that process is the most votes getting it all for that yes I we know it's a gas in here then things go really fast that co2 from here will go through the three o'clock so this is what'll happen if you're not here and you walk back in after a few hours after a recovery had finished you'll see that there's still some pressure stuck in your separators no big deal everything's turned off systems not running the compressor over there's not running your chiller will continue to be on it's not a big deal so let's turn that off then you'll come over here and do exactly what it says so recovery complete closed co2 bottles we're gonna open valve 10 so this is that vent valve down at the bottom all remaining pressure will then be 0 so that's it that's the end of the run you would now come over here take this off suck out all your dry pipe material we would recommend a shop back and coming in from the top you could take off the bottom and let it fall out it just cumbersome and we recommend just doing everything from the top it reminds you on the screen cycle maintenance required all that's referring to is just you know check a couple of these lines make sure you didn't have oil carryover make sure you harvested oil putting new plant material in then you acknowledge and it's ready to start again so after you load new plant material in here take out your oil from here you might have some stuff on the walls you'll scrape off we have sin this is used small one a big one for cleaning these vessels if you ever do get stuff on the walls some people who were talking earlier about high pressure and high temperature low pressure low temperature some people prefer to run lower pressures lower temperatures because you get a lot of THC a 99% pure to see a buildup on these walls if you run a higher pressure temperature everything's gonna go down the bottom but with those lower temperatures you get that build up on the walls we recommend keeping that separate from your oil in the cup you take this off get out the oil and you use this hard scraper tool to break off at thca on the walls and that can be used to make 99% pure Declassified nonstick shatter so now we're going to show you how you would collect your oil out of this collection cup and how you would get the hard stuff off the walls you'll come right down here you have these blue water lines with quick connects so we want to disconnect this cup from the rest of the system for okay disconnect it they're disconnected here so now this cup separated we use our 5/8 ratcheting wrench that we send with every system to take off these try clamps before we start undoing this we want to make sure valve 10 is open and that our pressure is zero which it is and you can also severe it by up on the screen saw this process between runs people always ask how long does it take to pull out your old material load new material harvest your oil and reattach everything and it typically takes about 30 minutes between runs just enough and our cup comes off and this is where our oil would be we just did empty runs there's not much in there you see a little residual oil on the bottom so then you would take this cup over to we have tools like these spatulas that would help us get out our heavy thick oil we put into a pyrex dish or a beaker then we could take it to go do post processing on it there's the collection cup so you get the hard stuff now we're going to take off this top piece this would be if we have hard stuff to lift up on the walls we'd want to get in there and scrape it off we'll disconnect our thermocouple undo these two lines so now take this off and now if you're talked about earlier that little orifice so here's the orifice on this one you look down in there and see inside the separation vessel we've done a run and we kept separator temperatures low enough around 20 degrees Fahrenheit we would have a lot of hard stuff built up on these walls there's a lot of pictures you can look at on my Instagram account or even on the apex website that shows that hard stuff and even we even talked about the process of converting that hard 99% pure THC a into glass like shatter at this point we'd use our hearts paper tool and we scrape off that hard stuff we put a little stool area tear pyrex dish scrape that hard stuff into that dish and clean it out if we the same material over and over it's not necessary to clean this thorough every time if you are running different strains or different botanicals then you would want to spend a little extra time and get this spotless on the inside we said we said a small bottle like this did we recommend using acetone or alcohol and you just get this spray it down the walls have a dish down at the bottom to collect it and then you wipe it off and dry it out on the inside typically there's not going to be any oil over here reason we would know if there was oil is if we opened valve 10 at the end of the run oil was blowing out we would know then we had oil carryover at that point we would take the time to take this apart check in here and get it all clean but typically this only gets open maybe once a week just to check and see if it's dirty or not the maintenance I was discussing earlier talks about these lines here we would look in it if it looks real oily in here we might take this line off run a lot of crawl through it and we would also take the time to take this line off and run alcohol through here I have a great video I made earlier it shows me cleaning this line and you know proper maintenance on the machine so I'm not gonna go too deep in the maintenance right now so now it's time to reassemble everything put these clamps these clamps have a notch in them we're gonna put the notches opposite of each other you can see on this one over here little bolt on the side and a bolt on this side do that we're gonna put this stuff back together then we're gonna reattach our collection cup we'll reattach these lines put our thermal couple back in here and then we're essentially done and then we would reload our material tighten this up and hit start for the next run if you have any questions about what I just talked about or anything regarding post-processing feel free to email me at craig h at apex supercritical comm and I can further answer any questions we also offer live demonstrations here in our Denver shop it's by appointment only so you'll contact Tina at Tina H at Apex supercritical comm to set up demonstrations thank you very much", "MxojD-3iVMs": "why pure cbd oil triple

video i want to be showing you how i infuse our gummy recipe but first if you wouldn't mind if you are new here to the channel please consider subscribing and if you've already subscribed thank you very much I appreciate the support and if you wouldn't mind give the video a big thumbs up so folks today I'm gonna be running through a lot of the ways you can infuse our gummy recipe that which we just posted at the same time as this video now the reason being is I want to make sure that that gummy recipe stays by itself and that I'll show you where along the line you could infuse that with that being said guys there are so many different ways to infuse this gummy recipe so I'm gonna take you through my favorite way and then bring you all the way to my least favorite way and I'll kind of explain why one is better than the other at least in my eyes so let's get right into it let me show you how I infuse our gummy recipe alright folks so now we're gonna talk about how I infuse our gummy recipe so first and foremost a couple of the things that I will be using you can find on Amazon and I'll leave all that information in the description below so hopefully you can check it out if you guys are interested in any type of flour or Keith don't forget you can always email me and that will be in the description below also so today folks we're going to talk about my favorite way to add CBD to our Gumby recipe and that is with Keef now this is a premium product for the cannabis plant you have to extract it whether it's dry extraction you can wet extract it although it's a lot more time consuming but you can go ahead and check out our video on how to extract Keef but this is by far my favorite way to add Keef to that gummy recipe now it has to be d carved and typically what I like to do is use 1 to 2 grams depending on how potent you want it and UD kharbut for approximately 15 minutes on two hundred and fifty degrees in your oven now the one downside to using Keith in the raw form and just adding it to the gummy recipe is that it will float to the surface and it kind of creates a weird surface on the gummy it's nothing you can't taste it really but it does create that weird textured surface only on one side of the gum the other side is perfectly fine and of course guys when I talk about infusing the recipe I'm gonna tell you exactly when to infuse it now this goes for everything that I'm going to show you today but the number one time the best time to infuse the gummy recipe is after the blooming stage so you were looking at our gummy recipe it's it's at room temperature for approximately 10 minutes and then we start to heat it up during that heating up process that is when you would add the key for any of these other things that I'm gonna go over so one of the ways I found that you could get rid of that texture in the gummy recipe if you use Keith is you can use sunflower lecithin or vegetable glycerin now when it comes to using these two things it doesn't really affect the recipe too much but it will dissolve the kief and the way you do it is you use about two tablespoons you put it in a little bowl like this you add all your ingredients you add your one to two grams of d carb Keith you mix it around as best you can try to dissolve it and then again you add that during the heating up process on the stove and you let it mix in and you continue to continuously mix it so this is by far my favorite way just adding raw keef I like to keep it on natural the texture does not bother me but if you want it like a store-bought gummy you're gonna have to use one of these two things I actually prefer the glycerin for the gummy recipe over the lesson but the lesson is well known for absorption so either one of these will work guys it's just your personal preference and what you like I know some people have a little bit of an allergy to vegetable glycerin not a lot of them but some do and so they go with less certain I I do not like the soil a certain I go with the liquid sunflower less it's in you can get granular but I don't really see the point in the granular for this process so definitely get the liquid less certain so that's that and using Keef and how and how I use Keef in the recipe the next thing I'm going to show you is an efficient way to add CBD to our recipe but it is not my favorite way by any means it gives a harsh flavor and honestly guys it's a little dangerous and you got to know what you're doing with this stuff and if you guys haven't checked it out yet go ahead and please do so on our how to make a CBD tincture recipe you can find that in the description below but here folks is our alcohol tincture now for this you will use a half a cup and you will cook it down on the stove and when you're cooking it down on the stove it becomes kind of pasty towards the end what you're doing is you're cooking off the alcohol because you don't want to really be making alcohol gummies and so once you do that you again you add it during the heating up process when making those gummies now when you add either is the key for the alcohol tincture when you're heating up that gelatin you want to really mix it in just really mix it in get it three to four or five minutes whatever it takes there's no rush just make sure you don't burn the gelatin keep it at a medium low temperature and just make sure that it's getting mixed in but I'm not even going to show you this today guys because I just do not like using this I did it at home I do not recommend it it's not my favorite way to do this at all so I will refer you to our friends over at the magical butter machine if you want to learn how to cook down your tincture but again guys you need a pan need on low temperature on a stovetop preferably electric folks and if you can do it outside it's best to do it outside the fumes are rough on the smell and it's just a really harsh way to do it but this is an efficient way to add CBD to our gummie recipe now these are the two ways that I really do not like it changes the entire texture of the gummy and it changes the flavor of the gummy and it gives it like this weird oily flavor and so folks you can use MCT or olive oil that's been infused already with CBD or you can use coconut oil and you're also adding about two to three tablespoons of coconut oil or MCT oil to the gelatin recipe you can add more if you want again that really depends on what you like and how strong you want it now here's the problem with using oil it changes the entire texture of the gummy it tends to float around and make it weird it also comes with a very similar harsh taste that the alcohol tincture has not as harsh and definitely a lot safer to use but the gummy itself it just doesn't look good and it doesn't really taste that good it's just not a great way to add it but however you can do it but it's just not the way I recommend it and again I'm gonna go back to D carb Keef and the lesson or glycerin if you want the nice looking gummy but you can just add straight Keith it's just the safest way to go folks and again if you are interested in Keith or flour to make your own at home feel free to email me that information will be in the description below but that is how I infuse my gummy recipe that is on our youtube channel and that link will be in the description below also I hope you guys liked this recipe and how we infuse our gummies if you guys have any questions feel free to send me an email leave a comment below and I'll get to you guys an answer them to the best of my ability again I'm not an expert at this but this is what I found works for me at my home and I hope it works for you guys too and that's all I have for today folks I hope you enjoyed today's video and as always take care and I will see you in another video", "AVOk7obYja4": "thank you for tuning in to a moment is in presented by Gibbs n I'm Kyle here today to talk about the high THC capsule the high THC capsules manufactured using full-spectrum cannabis oil it's also known as fille co RSO or Rick Simpson oil so for those people looking for Rick Simpson oil if the high THC is that capsule if the relaxed n is my two glasses of wine the high THC is like three shots the 25 milligrams of THC is a therapeutic dose for treating chronic pain management autoimmune disorders and we've had a lot of success with HIV and cancer patients as well this capsule definitely comes with the buzz and the munchies and that being said is our number one adult use of recreational capsule but it also has a lot of therapeutic medicinal value as well Rick Simpson was a pioneer in the industry and his work teaching people how to extract cannabis oil from the marijuana plant was instrumental and you know it can't be understated how valuable he has been contributing to the legalization of marijuana that being said he was using some pretty gnarly solvents and I'd like to thank him for lighting the torch but I think we can take it from here kids n uses ethanol as a solvent for extracting the cannabis oil from the plant we find that ethanol pulls the most complete cannabinoid profile and terpene profile from the plant co2 and butane do a great job of capturing THC CBD and terpenes but there's a lot more to the plant than just those two compounds most of our oil is 65% THC and the other 35% is really where the magic happens THC and CBD are where most of the dosing is based on in this industry but all the other compounds play an important role to the true magic and power of the cannabis plant based medicine you can also get more information at Gibbs NC a calm thanks for tuning in [Music]", "sJY_0sv1apg": "I like I saw this in the corner and it looks like this really insane crock-pot

know it could be a great thing for vermont and the farmers here", "0G39Yuzmqig": "hey what's up I'm here with Patrick from genius extractions and he's here to tell us about this awesome awesome what my girlfriend would probably call a cake maker but it doesn't make cakes it makes something much more much more expensive amazing and potent tell us a little bit about it Patrick this is an alcohol distillation plant right here for the most part what we have here is a rotary evaporator and what we're taking is for all raw plant material can be put in right to the end right there where we had Jimmy's head earlier and from there you could take a raw plant material and dip it into an alcohol-based we could take that frozen plant material because it's in a negative 30 degree alcohol at this point and we're gonna run it through our distillation plant here we're gonna extract all the oils leaving them behind in our rotary evaporator leaving behind an alcohol that you could take there and then rerun it with your system what you are producing here is a very high potency oil free and clear of any kind of be a chose free and clear of any kind of co2 it's a 100 percent ethanol based helpful and healthy kind of product from there what you want to do with that product is on you you want to throw it into a consumable and you're Lauren welcome to well we also have what you can't see here is a secondary process machine where you could take any kind of alcohol or oil-based material at this point and run it through a secondary process turning up to 90 95 percent THC levels so we do have something very very high-tech here and it's been proven to do what we have seen which is 95 98% pure oil without any additives that you can throw right into a pen that's right well I guess everyone's been talking about winterization lately so what we see here is part of a winterization process if you look over here that is our 30 30 chiller it's a 30 liter negative 30 degrees Celsius chiller that could bring your alcohol down to negative 30 degrees right in here you could take your product in a tea bag and dunk it with that dunk you're going to extract all the essential oils and then from there we're going to run our system through the system you're going to be able to separate that oil from the alcohol and you can go take that oil and reuse it again so it's a full circulating system the oils we're producing here we're ranging anywhere from 50 percent to about 80 95 percent THC levels so really high tech system here thank you guys so much that is one hell of a top yield 95 percent potential yielding ray I can't even think of anything higher thank you so much Patrick for your time and we'll be seeing you soon look out for these Ben they're big on the scene

co-founder here at joy organics my wife joy and my son Jared and I started this company that has been a great experience we love helping people whether they're consumers of our products or our partners like you that want to begin to offer CBD products to your clientele your family your friends and so on this video I'm gonna share with you the top 10 steps to starting your own CBD business and I'm gonna do this in sequence and so you know I'm an entrepreneur so I kind of do everything in sequence so let me encourage you to make some notes as you watch this video the first thing that you need to do in starting your own CBD business is that you need to determine what name you're going to call your business now I've got a separate video that you can watch on selecting the right name but in general my advice to you is to select a name that does not include CBD hemp or cannabis because that just creates red flags for your bank it's going to create all kinds of problems for you that are completely unnecessary in addition to that you don't know where your business is going to be five years from now right now we're testing special strains that are high in CBN we may be selling CBN products there is a lot of research being done into other plant extracts right now less than 5% of the plants worldwide have been tested for their medicinal benefits and so your business may evolve over the next several years where you're not just selling CBD you're selling other products and so you don't want a name that is going to limit you the other thing I recommend and selecting a name is that it's an easy name to remember and an easy name to spell imagine one of your customers telling their friend about your brand you want to make sure that when they tell their friend about your brand that it's a name their friend can remember a name that their friend can easily spell I recommend that your name not include more than two words you can see joy organics and and there's a lot of different ways that you can go about selecting a name you can kind of brainstorm with your family your friends but once you kind of narrow down some of your top names what I recommend to do is to go to go daddy.com make sure that if you're gonna have a name you need to own the com for your name so type into GoDaddy the name that you're thinking of see if it's available if it's not available go to that website see if there's a website up and if there's not a website up you can go to the bottom of GoDaddy to the Whois link and you can go and find out who owns that name and then you can either email them call them to see if they're willing to sell their name in our case joy organics was not available we paid $7,500 for it so we reached out the person who owned it we bought it for $7,500 so make sure you select a name that's easy to remember that's easy to spell a name that you can build a business around more than just a CBD business the second tip I can share with you or the second thing that you'd want to do in sequence is to set up your business entity now you've got your name you've got your URL now you want to go and set up your business entity what we did we went to legalzoom.com and you can go there you can set up your LLC which is what we used a limited liability company and I set up the LLC for joy organics in less than 15 minutes really simple really easy a lot better than calling your local attorney and spending you know three times as much money setting up your entity my advice on setting up in Indy is to use your name so for us our entity is joy organics LLC a lot of people set up different names and then they do it doing business as just unnecessary complication that you don't need so once you've got your name set up your LLC under your same name and then you don't have additional paperwork the third thing is to design your logo so now you've got your paperwork going you're waiting for your employee identification number that you're gonna need to open your bank account some of the other things I'm going to share with you here so what do you do now what you do now is you've got your name now you want to get a logo designed I recommend that you go to a company called 90 nine Designs dot-com I believe their rate is like $295 and they have thousands of designers around the world and so you go in there you indicate the logo that you want you give them your name if there's any special colors any special design requests that you have and then all these designers around the world start to design your logo and then also you start looking to all these different logo designs and then you can say I like this one and I like this one and so you indicate you like this one this one well that tells all the other designers you like this one in this one then they all begin to hone in on that and after a few days you'll have a great logo far less expensive than hiring a designer and plus when you hire a designer to design your logo you're just getting one designers idea if you use 99 design you get hundreds of ideas and it's a far better way to get a logo in a lot less money so that is the third thing you need to do the fourth thing you need to do is you need to open a bank account so hopefully by now you've got your logo design you've got your your LLC being set up your operating agreement and hopefully by now you get your EIN number which is your employee identification number you then go to your bank just let them know you're in the health and nutrition business don't volunteer any extra information go ahead and get your bank account set up the next thing is once you have your bank account set up is to then apply for your merchant account so you have to have a bank account set up you have to have your employee identification number before you can apply for a merchant account below this video I'll also put the name of the person that I would recommend for your merchant account you want to make sure that you have a special CBD merchant processor I have a separate video on this page that you can watch to learn more about merchant processing but you want to make sure that you get your merchant processor with what with a company that does or a bank that does CBD processing and more than likely it is not your bank so don't be asking your bank about merchant processing because if they find out what business you're in you're also going to have to take your bank account somewhere else so make sure you're careful there number six is to select a good partner to provide your CBD oil and obviously this is we come into play if you're starting your own CVD business you want to make sure that you're offering a line of CVD products that result in a high reorder rate because if not you're going to have all kinds of problems if you're not selling a high-quality CBD product you're gonna have people returning the product you're gonna have disputes with your merchant processor and the way that you can get shut down in this business and end your experience is if you're chargebacks hit one percent you do not want to have a high charge back rate or your merchant processor will shut you down and when they shut you down nobody else will accept you as a as a client so you want to make sure that you're doing everything you can to offer a high quality product that is not going to result in returns disputes and charge backs i also have a video on this page on how you can reduce your charge back something that i would encourage all of you to watch so that you can make sure you're taking the steps necessary to prevent chargebacks because truthfully that is your greatest risk you get shut down by your merchant processor you're out of business so in selecting a partner let me just tell you and there's videos that you can watch on this YouTube channel that talk more about what makes us unique and different why our CBD oils are best in class best in the marketplace but I think there's nothing that speaks higher volumes of the quality product we sell than our reorder rate here in our store after just now what we've been open for four to five months over 50% of everybody that comes in here buy CBD our return customers does the next highest percentage of people in here are referrals referrals from doctors chiropractors massage therapists you know personal trainers everybody out there is referring people to us because they know we have the highest quality CBD products in the marketplace so do your research learn more about what makes our products unique and different but you need to make sure you select a partner understand cheapest cheap if you're gonna be in the CBD business you don't want cheap cheap results and returns the results in disputes it results in chargebacks it results in a nightmare of a business that you don't want to have next number seven is now you've got your entity set up you got your logo designed you've selected your partner now you need to get your website going and I recommend for most people just to get a website template you can type in website templates into Google we got a website template our websites a template I mean I think we paid $40 for our website and the great thing about a template is that you can pull it up on your your computer and it all looks good you can pull it up on your phone it looks good you can pull it up on a tablet it looks good it's all size then all you do is you just plug in your pictures that you want to have in there and we provide renderings of your products so that you've got all the images that you need it's a standard service that we provide and then you just need to get your content written you can certainly use some of the content from our site we just encourage you to regurgitate it if you were to copy content off our site and put on your site Google views that as duplicate content as stealing content they'll penalize you and nobody will find your website so you're welcome to use our content just regurgitate it so that it's your own content and and that'll work great for you so the setting up the website should be fairly simple we recommend that you use woo commerce for your shopping cart Shopify which is the most popular shopping cart out there does not do CBD processing at this time so you'd want to use WooCommerce the eighth step in starting your own business is to now secure the social sites so for us here at joy organics what we did is we got joy organics calm we got our entity set up we got our logo designed and then we started to go out and secure the different social sites such as Facebook calm slash joy organics and so you know the more that you can secure the domain names of the social sites that you feel that you're going to be actively using to promote your business make sure that you make it a priority to secure your name with those social sites this ninth tip to getting started or the ninth step to starting your own CBD business is to find a fulfillment company so again if your marketing the joy organics brand it makes it easy because we'll ship the product to you and you can then distribute it however it is that when you distributor if you're going to develop your own line of branded products with joy organics then you would need to find a fulfillment company that can ship those products and so you can either ship from your home and I've got a separate video here that talks about your fulfillment options or you can find a fulfillment company to ship your products the tenth step to starting your business is to put together your marketing strategy and the number one question I get from people when I'm talking to my on the phone is hey Todd what do you recommend that I do how can i market my products and the thing I share with them is that there are thousands of ideas a lot of different ways and the great thing right now in the CBD space is all of them are wide open it's not like well I can't go down this channel because it's pretty saturated I can't do this let me try to find some unique niche no everything is wide open so it's all up to you it boils down to you being creative and the thing I encourage you to do is to make a list of 20 different ways that you can market your CBD products and of course at the top of the list you're gonna make a list of all the most common things that everybody's thinking about but when you get to 16 17 18 19 oh my gosh you're gonna be trying to wrack your brain thinking of ideas and that's when you're gonna think of your best ideas so challenge yourself be creative look at all the different possibilities in ways that you can market your business and if you do that you're gonna find some great ones test them out see what works find what you enjoy doing find that area that you really want to be great in remember you can be great at anything but you can't be great at everything so pick the area that you're gonna focus on and become the best in the market in that area good luck [Music] you [Music]", "4ZVYUeBOmtM": "I'm scaling up because of the extra deployment in other words this pop right here is 35 to $3,700 control about peristaltic you can't really get any smaller and make it any less expensive so I can make it smaller but the price tag doesn't go down that much I can make it bigger in the price tag goes up a lot all we see is people to say I need extra throughput I say my mom machine people say I want to go smaller I say maybe by a different design a lot of you know I mean it but the way I see and I try to tell my son is thousand dollars cash every month whether you like it or not that cash and we're talking extra cash because what happens is with this machine people all the time say hey listen I've got thousands of pounds of him I can't get a producer before I think about hemp farmers have no place to go with their help they can't get a process as soon as they cut it down where do they go you can't button co2 guys away to swamp roundabouts guys forget about it what about boil everything is all connected there's one continuous system it just keeps going back and forth I use the same alcohol is over here the only thing I ever do is I add alcohol to the system for what residual in the material itself and I typically lose about 10 milliliters for every pound in the milk add alcohol I literally never have to replace it I'm using the same alcohol for over here every time I run it through I read care for it every single time if there's a little water someone said I put my coca-cola in there giving birth to the Machine I'll separate that aren't no problem Oh miss I'm gonna drop competing in and that's okay right here we'll separate that [ __ ] I mean the point is the Machine knows what it's doing and we've designed all the stuff into the machine all you have to do is push a button literally that's absurd right here people say oh my god there's three valves on it I'm really scared what will happen if I over the mouth the machine knows what it's doing those battles for the moment I change him make something change but it doesn't do anything to the end product it doesn't damage it it doesn't hurt it it doesn't cause any problems it doesn't make it so it's dangerous out here I mean literally the first machine I sold this lady was running was I'm really scared", "JGTAYNjlI6s": "hello my name is David McGee I'm the owner of two museum extractors Inc I created the first pump based butane extractor in 2001 evolving later into a pump free system if you are using an extractor are looking for more information about extractors than this intro to how they evolved in what they can do was created for you most of the extractors you see being sold by dozens of companies are called closed loop extractors there are extractors and then there are closed loop extractors there are also pump driven versions of these extractors and pump free versions called passive extractors after creating the pump based closed-loop process I later evolved away from it because it was riddled with problems I evolved into a pump free process after discovering greater performance and a safer way to manage the flammable solvents required to efficiently extract nonpolar oils and polar chemicals from plants safety pushed me into that direction but higher performance kept me there so if you are asking how much controller performance do I have to trade for safety you don't have to worry about sacrificing anything on the contrary you gain everything including control performance and safety a pump based looping process eliminates these controls and should have never been allowed in the first place the only benefit at pump based of looping process gives us to the manufacturer three benefits to be precise one they purchase small volume tanks that do not hold an adequate amount of solvent which is what forces the operator to recover in the solvent through the plant matter countless times in an effort to completely extract everything from the plant looping takes time adds unnecessary components and hazards instead of customizing a system perform well they choose to purchase less expensive off-the-shelf narrow tanks that don't evaporate solvent fast enough to make solvent recovery possible without a recovery pump the added time and slower evaporation leave them with little option but to add this pump to speed process and finally to reduce cost even further the tanks are clamped together with gasket seals rather than welded these three reductions in cost and limitations define a pump based closed-loop extractor and we're great during development but only unsuspecting new extraction companies we purchase them and that is just what is happening in today's fast-growing extraction industry why do they do this because it costs more and requires much more complex knowledge to build high-performance pump free systems reducing cost is the only way to compete with a superior process a visible reference on what to build combined with a lack of experience in building extractors allowed them a luxury you cannot afford in the end you pay the price and never-ending maintenance and equipment cost combined with a lack of speed performance and safety there is also another limitation involving safety these less expensive parts use a different type of seal that will hold up to the solvents and pressures used in a lab this type of seal was made for dairy and other consumable liquids it is in the seal design where the seal fails not the material the repeated failure of those seals created the single most important reason that led us away from these off-the-shelf parts this forced us to begin building custom systems over a decade ago if we had to change the seal to make it safe we may as well customize the whole system to reduce cost be safe pump free and far more controllable what we were not sure of was if the customers were willing to pay more for safety higher performance and more control was there even a market out there we were the first and that carried some concern for our success on the other hand we knew what the process did for our extraction business we have been selling and using this process for 15 years now and with thousands of systems sold and 100% customer satisfaction I think the answer is yes we have a saying at - museum our happiest customers are the ones that have experience using any other extractor well now that we got who is who out of the way let's get into what and why please join me in our next video in a series of videos titled what you need to know before buying an extractor until then please contact us by email phone or visit our website to learn more [Music] [Music]", "q5k0bftNBp0": "hey good afternoon everyone jason here again frontier hemp co-founder uh really appreciate you guys taking the time to watch our videos we're here to help we're here to teach you a little bit more about the cannabis plant and how we can all benefit from her wonderful healing powers that she has to offer us and really quickly i wanted to just go over a question that we get quite often because a lot of people don't understand is what does full spectrum mean and what does an isolate or thc free mean and i'll try to touch on them as quick as i can when it when you're looking at choosing products whether that product is something that's going to go into your drink or something that's going to be a tincture that goes into your mouth or a capsule that has great absorption your deliverable is going to be dependent upon what works best for you and what we're finding is different deliverables work better for different people so outside of what way you want to take your cannabinoids you have a more important question is do i want to take a full spectrum product versus a thc free or an isolate based product so a thc free and isolate based product is a very simple way to say that everything from the cannabis plant has been extracted out of it and the only remainder is a pure cbd molecule that molecules in a form of a very white crystalline powder um and it's it's 99.9 pure cbd so there are no additional plant molecules there are no flavonoids there are no terpenes there are no other cannabinoids that or other ingredients in addition to the cbd purely cbd so why would you take this versus any other product since this cbd isolate based thc free product doesn't have thc what you get is the opportunity to experience cbd without the risk of drug testing people are still taking drug tests for all sorts of different things and cbd isolate is a way that you can experience products without having the concern of a drug test so if you don't have any concern with drug tests um especially dealing with a hemp based product i would say go full spectrum because with full spectrum you're going to get a larger profile of cannabinoids that have their own healing properties you may get terpenes you may get flavonoids you may get some different plant material that's also very chlorophyll that's very good for your body and the way we look at it is the more of the plant that you can consume the better so when choosing a full spectrum product you're going to get a little bit of thc in that and so thc sometimes provides a little bit of a sedative effect it's relaxing if you take multiple droppers you actually might feel it but it's always under the legal limit for hemp based products of 0.3 percent thc which basically means less than one half of one percent a third of a percent is all the thc that's allowed to go into any hemp-based products to be legal and compliant so uh you have a couple of different options when choosing products from our website a cbd isolate base which is just purely cbd and nothing else and then a full spectrum product or a full profile full plant product easiest way to remember full profile full spectrum isolate one isolated cannabinoid so i hope that clears up a little bit of why you might choose one or the other and we look forward to hearing your experiences from taking both because we're hearing feedback that both are very helpful all right so let us know if you have any questions shoot me an email give me a call all you most of you have all my direct number from our direct communication so let us know if there's anything that we can do to straighten it up or if you have any other questions let us know all right until next time", "fvnv4EP8rfQ": "hey guys welcome back to my channel my name is Brittany and if you're new here feel free to subscribe if you'd like in today's video I'm gonna be sharing with you about the Charlotte's Web CBD gummies I bought these a week and a half ago at Bailey's gym I seen that they sell these I thought cool I've been wanting to try to show this web for a while I've never gotten the courage to actually purchase it because they're a little bit pricey but this is a lemon-lime flavor it is 10 milligrams per gummy so the serving size recommends too so that's 20 milligrams it's hemp extract infused gummies it has 25 calories 6 grams of carbs total sugar 3 grams sodium 10 milligrams it has lemon balm L thenen and the hemp extracts these come in a variation this is calm I use these for anxiety they also have post gym recovery and for sleep so I have tried these and I'm gonna share with you what I like about on what I don't really like about them and if I'm gonna continue using these and if they help me what I like about these is they actually taste like candy which is kind of well it's kind of scary but it's pretty cool they taste like sweet tarts if you ever have sweet tarts are very bitter and sour they look like these yes it's like little candies it's cut they're cute squishy they're like gummy bears what I also like is there portioned really well so you're not gonna go over or under if you're doing those drops those drops like you can easily take a little bit more take a bit less and say well I don't feel good today you might have not taken enough or so have you so these are portioned really well you could tell if they're working for you based on the recommended serving size because you know you're getting the exact amount I also like how it gives a very leveled calm it's very leveled you don't feel really hard and you don't feel really anxious you're just kinda in the middle I use these and I go to the gym I go out and about it makes me kind of want to like go do something and I'm a little more chatty on them I'll talk more I like that about them what I don't like about these well for one I don't like their price this is $54 I got these for much cheaper because they were on sale but you know this is why I didn't buy them from the get-go online because of their price so honestly I think they should be cheaper that's just me another thing is they don't they don't help on a bed and anxiety day when I'm really anxious they don't do much I don't know if it's just because I'm not taking enough milligrams maybe I need to take more but personally I wanted to go based on the serving size that they recommended and even stuff I don't see a very big change I would say but that's just me I mean everybody is different who knows you know it might work for one person but for me it's kind of just a little boost a little boost it's not enough for me to be like wow these gummies are perfect for me they're not they are not unfortunately they're great like if I'm having a pretty good day and not really anxious I just want to get out and need a little pick-me-up or something just want to feel calm just relax nothing's really bothering me this helps relax you a little bit but for me these are not strong enough and I just don't want to run through these because they're not cheap so why would I want to take more than what would last me maybe a month so it's definitely hard because CVV is not cheap it is pretty pricey and there's so many CBD companies to choose from I just want to give you my honest take on how I feel about these so that you don't go out and get it for the sole purpose of severe anxiety and stuff like that because for me on my bad anxiety days these do not cut it on a good day these are great because I still have energy I want to talk I want to like get up and get out but are these my favorite no they are not my favorite but to each their own please subscribe and like my videos thank you for watching today in the future I will be posting more CBD videos I've been trying a bunch out lately so stay tuned but till next time bye guys", "eqSJoOmCi8s": "alright let's get started first things first you're going to need some THC distill it I'm gonna need some coconut oil you're gonna need a shot glass you're gonna need a dropper finally you're gonna need a pot with some water in it so the first step in this process of making cannabis capsules is going to be to weigh out your THC distill it so we're gonna weigh up one gram here just put your shot glass on top of your scale tear it out so it's at zero get all that distill it in there we're now gonna follow it up with three milliliters or three grams of coconut oil this is gonna give you a nice dye Lucien you're gonna have about 23 milligrams per dropper on this dropper here which is 0.25 ml dropper so you might have 10 ml per notch on your syringe so next we're gonna tear the scale again we're gonna get our coconut oil I'm gonna add 3 grams or 3 mm now the next step is to take your coconut oil and THC distill a mixture place it in top of the pot of water on top of the stove allow it to blend evenly when it's completely mixed it will be ready to fill into your cannabis capsules so it's been about five minutes with both the oils over medium heat on the stove and as you can see they're completely blended into a beautiful clear liquid the stirring definitely helps now this is what's going to fill your cannabis capsules alright now we're off to the final step which is filling up your capsules you're gonna need some capsules here we've already took in the time to split them up we got the big end small end these are very easy to find you can find them at your local health store they're just empty gelatin capsules size zero zero super easy to find great for making cannabis capsules of any kind so what you're gonna do here is take your cannabinoid rich oil suck it up into your syringe or your dropper we're using an eye dropper here it's easier for filling up the as I find and you're gonna take out your dough sighs so what you're gonna do is you're gonna figure out how much concentrates you used how much oil you use and do the math ml mark and since we're making 40 ml capsules we're gonna suck it just up to here the 50 mark on our eye dropper take the top of one of the capsules pop it on and you've got yourself a cannabis capsule if you're making these for personal it doesn't matter if you don't use gloves if you're making these for somebody else please use gloves cuz it does get messy and your fingers gonna be all over these things unless you have a capsule machine there you go there's your first cannabis capsule this is a 40 milligram pure THC distill it cup so again hook it up to the 15 portion get it in the capsule get a top one there pop it on it's another cannabis cap so we got two there", "X5tMiybynP4": "what's up guys today we're going to show you how to make thc infused oil we used about 19 different pucks from 3.5 and 7 gram bags first let's add 50 milliliters of mct oil to our beaker throw it on your hot plate and turn it up to 120 degrees fahrenheit you're gonna want to let your pucks cook for about five minutes to seven minutes at most extract each puck individually and strain it by squeezing it to release any of the liquid that could be trapped inside you're going to want to repeat these steps until you run out of pucks [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] next we're gonna start the d card process turn your plate up to 240 degrees fahrenheit you're going to want to continue cooking your oil until you don't see any more bubbles rise up to the top don't panic if your oil darkens it just means that the d card process is working for our final step take a nug smasher 37 micron bag and strain your oil through the bag

about CBD and THC which are two important chemicals found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now legal in Canada we created a new series called stoned science where we make comedians get high and try to explain complex science concepts our first

"w2aKImGBdo0": "okay just stop just to show you the clarity of that that one we just did which is this here I'm still dripping you're gonna see yeah you're gonna see our very very clean material and this will just go to show y'all if the extraction really hasn't taken any of the chlorophyll so I don't know if you can see the clarity of that but uh it's actually quite good you know there's a lot of particles flooding there but that can be done with the filtrations and one night you know again that's what I'm John just showing you the basics here so basically that's the first style of extraction if if you have some really good plant material again that's still dripping you could probably do this once twice again and extract a lot more out of it but we're not doing that now so that's that one done so what we're going to do is we're going to go to the next one okay so actually I'll just leave it there like so and extraction there we have it I guess good and now screams in the water and as you see this is gotta well there's actually pretty focus one so what we're going to do is just take this yeah we're just going to be pouring this alcohol through the plan and we have it you can see it running through again yeah it's good to have more than one person it'd be safer again doing any solvent extraction cold will not call no naked flames anywhere no one's smoking just just be sensible static electricity of all all things like that can be a problem so we have it's coming out quite clear and how much do it do I put through this well again because I don't lose any of my recovery I'm just about recovered everything that I use so it can be very liberal on on the solvent that you use and of course this one being ethanol this one's still going both sigh I'm actually gonna pull a bit in this as well I hate to waste the waste anything here still coming out very clear which is great and then after this we're going to our to extract all the material and stop you want to do that but anyway these things happen do the know school here so the amount of alcohol abuse was probably about a gallon and a half I think we'll work it out probably because I'm two of these a gallon maybe a gallon my heart Loosli so there we have it everything's pre chill we're not getting any powerful coming through again filtration is a definite you can do that with different ways of doing it either using your coffee filters or whatever it may be Oh filter this one at a later stage I'm just going to have this running right through this refill today I'm spinning and wasting your guys time yeah so we're just going to pour this through and we'll filter a below stage since it's coming out of extremely different color that aside and what we're going to do after we finish these guys off like I said you there's two other extractions which is dealing with temperature change which is going to the 172 plus because we're heating up the ethyl alcohol to a vapor running through the plant material and this will extract all this material out of here which I'll show you guys and then your third which would be you know people call the rigsum Samoa it looks very dark in color because it carries a lot of the waxes and the coracles through that and you can use that for your ointment and whatnot so you don't waste any plant mature to extract everything and again like I'm saying using ethyl alcohol you're reclaiming everything I'll show you that anyway so as you can see this is uh the cold extraction two different methods and before I turn the video off I'm going to show you the color of this one you understand so as you can see the color difference now between the bond and the sugar leaf well there's a little difference there today we have it that's our second extraction the Bob which is B two things is a very small amount of oil or is it in this and this is concentrate so there we have it so this is two styles of extractions there's probably many more so what I'll do now is we'll get these ready to start to render which I'll show you and then the last one we show you the weak Simpson off and then and then I'll reclaim it and show you what we've reclaimed so you know that's all you're reclaiming 98 99 percent of our as you can see two different styles here one being the bar we may had a bit of contamination here because it looks like a little chlorophyll may have got in there but anyway we'll find out ah yes so this is the bud the reason I put the tape on here so I just shows me my recovery and it's just to show you as well because once we take out most of the ethyl alcohol to leave the risen behind regardless of what plant material may be I'm going to show you how much we actually catch which cruising everything and again this is the sugar leaf if you see the difference in color and again I was very a lot more liberal with this with the alcohol that I use because there's a lot more flora a lot more arm of the trichomes that I want to I want to remove with the body but there you go so they're the two different ones basically what I would what I will do is just pull that straight in like so you can wait today get to room temperature because they are quite cold again that's totally up to you so we have that one ready to go and and then we pull this one like so and I'll run both of these was quicker than the other and then that's it so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to start heating these guys up once they're starting to heat up I'm going to show you the Assembly of the steel and", "1ibCUuOJBEA": "[Music] hey this is ashton with d

exclusive discounts on our organic cbd chocolates edibles oils and other products at our website [Music]", "hf6nPZjOTXo": "all right I thought today we talked a little bit about the technique of rotary evaporation and how that applies to the organic chemistry lab and how it works so let's start by pointing out that organic chemists often need to remove solvent from solute to collect their products so let's say that we have a reaction mixture and the solute of course is of interest to us but the solvent once it served its purpose we'd like to get rid of that so that we can go on with our analysis so we need to do this when we use liquid liquid extraction techniques there's also a need when we're dealing with chromatography fractions and as I've already mentioned reaction mixtures sometimes we want to get rid of that solvent and leave behind the non-volatile materials so that we can continue our work so the question today is how do we separate non-volatile solutes from volatile solvents and the answer is rotary evaporation which is basically a fancy type of distillation so let's think a little bit about what a rotary evaporator is and how it works and then we'll watch one in action at the very end today okay so let's begin to familiarize ourselves with the rotary evaporator I've shown a schematic here of a typical rotary evaporation unit and I'm going to place this rotary evaporator next to a very familiar glassware apparatus from our labs and that's the simple distillation apparatus now while they may look quite different there are regions of each which serve similar purposes for example they both have a boiling flask in which heat will be applied to try to drive volatile materials into the vapor phase there'll be a condenser which is an actively cooled region of glassware intended to condense that vapor back into a liquid and then a receiving flask a separate area of the apparatus where that condensed liquid accumulates to keep it separate from the original sample so now that we've looked at some similarities here let's go all the way through this rotary evaporator and identify all of the essential parts and what they do I'll be referring to the round bottom containing your sample solution as a boiling flask there's also a rotational unit which is basically just a motor that spins that stem of the boiling flask right along the axis that goes through the opening and we'll talk about why we do that in a little bit there's also an elevation rail that allows you to slide the entire system up and down to put it into or raise it out of the bath so we're just about to talk about now there's a dimmer off condenser and a dimmer on condenser refers to that really cool spiral condenser that's inside of the glassware and what that spiral cooling column does is creates a really large amount of cold surface area so it's a very efficient condenser and we need that for rotary evaporation to work there's always a port for attaching a vacuum line and of course ports for water lines as well so that we can cool the condenser what would be the receiving flask in a distillation is often referred to as the solvent trap implying that we're catching the solvent and trapping it away from what we're really interested in which is the residual non-volatile material in the boiling flask there's a warm water bath used to encourage evaporation in the boiling flask and an ice bath which is used to discourage evaporation once the solvent has begun accumulating in the trap and of course there are controls for rotation and temperature now in other schematics you may see something called a bump trap which is located between the boiling flask and the stem of the rotation unit and the purpose of a bump trap is that if your sample does flash boil and goes up into the stem it will now become contaminated of course with all the other junk that all the previous students have left in that stem and the bump trap is a small bubble of glass designed to catch that liquid so it doesn't drain back into your flask and contaminate the material that you're trying to isolate what's not optional though is you're going to need some cat clips to be sure that you hold the solvent trap and boiling flask in place you'll notice that in this particular diagram without the clips shown it's basically just a battle between gravity and the friction of those ground glass joints and if your sample is heavy enough he's going to win you'll hear a splash and you'll be starting over again because your boiling flask is now in the water bath so be sure that you have the clips on hand to properly secure both of these flasks to the system so now that we're really familiar with the rotary evaporator let's talk about how we're going to use it let's take a quick run through what it looks like to have a rotary evaporation take place vacuum and water lines are commonly pre-attached most rotary evaporators are very large and you don't move them around very much and therefore they tend to have dedicated vacuum in water lines but if not you'll need to apply those yourself now before we start anything we're going to inspect all the glassware that will be using including the condenser the solvent trap the boiling flask and the stem of the rotation unit if there are any irregularities like cracks stars or chips any defect in the glass which goes beyond just the surface into the matrix of the glass then the rotary evaporator needs to be taken out of service because there's a significant risk of implosion if there is a weak point in any of the glassware that's being used so once we've done our pre check and we're ready to go we run cold water to the dimmer off condenser so this creates a zone of cooling in the condenser we can also add some ice to a bath around the solvent trap if we want to be sure that we accumulate as much solvent as possible in the liquid phase I'm not allowed to vaporize back into the system the next step would be to clip the boiling flask in place with your sample in it so I've shown the sample inside of the flask but I haven't explicitly shown the clip it should be understood that it's there holding that flask in place this way I can let go of that flask with my hand and begin the rotation rotation serves two purposes first it spreads some of the solvent out along the interior walls of the flask promoting evaporation second it adds the sample slightly which reduces the risk of bumping or flash boiling which can cause solvent contamination or otherwise adversely affect your rotary evaporation in the next step we'll slowly evacuate the system by opening the vacuum line and as we do that you can see that the sample is now being agitated and it's now under reduced pressure which means that the boiling points of all the volatile materials have reduced finally we're going to apply heat to that round bottom flask so now we have our sample being agitated to prevent bumping drawn on to the walls of the flask to encourage evaporation evacuated which encourages evaporation and being heated which encourages evaporation so we've done everything possible to get all the volatile material to go into the vapor phase so let's watch what happens when that actually takes place as you can see the volatile solvent materials are vaporizing moving up the stem condensing on the dim Roth condenser from there the liquid drains into the solvent trap until we've exhausted all the solvent from our sample at this point I've successfully isolated the volatile material from the non-volatile material in my solution I can simply reverse the process of starting the rotary evaporation as a means of shutting it down and once I'm done in the vacuum is quenched I can remove my flask and begin working with my non-volatile material so this is how rotary evaporation works good luck with that in the lab and we'll see you next time we talk about a cool lab technique", "qunWKDLqGA8": "[Music] hey thanks for checking out my video freighter Chris here from the YouTube channel serosa today I wanted to talk about the art of distillation this will be the first video in a three-part series here in the first video I'm going to go over setting up fractional setting up a fractional distillation apparatus we're going to talk about the concepts of simple distillation fractional distillation short path distillation and vacuum distillation so we'll discuss these concepts from both a chemistry and an alchemical perspective in the second video we will actually perform our distillation and we'll talk about how to keep good notes and how to use a pressure temperature nominal graph to calculate the actual temperature of our distillation I'll show you what that chart looks like and we'll also talk about the concept of molecular distillation or separating out different molecules based on their different boiling points in the third video we'll remove our distillate and we'll transfer it from our receiving flask here on our distillation apparatus we'll transfer it into some labeled canning jars and we'll clean up all the other glassware and we'll get it ready for our next distillation so the third video will be about removing the distillate and doing the cleanup so to begin the first video I'm going to disassemble my still here and I will have the pieces laid out on the counter and then I will go through with you the reassembling and we'll discuss we'll discuss each piece and its function we'll put the vacuum grease on all the joints and some teflon tape on on the smaller joints here and and we'll fill up our chiller bucket here with some ice and some water and we'll also put some dry ice in our cold trap around the bottom of our cold trap here in the first video I'm going to discuss the art of distillation as it relates to alchemy and to chemistry where it falls in where it falls into the alchemical process of transmutation the seven stages of alchemy we'll go over a simple distillation and how that differs from fractional distillation we'll talk about the concept of short path distillation where the where the the distillate just travels a very short distance and we'll also talk about vacuum distillation and how the how you can use much lower temperatures when you're using vacuum distillation and by using lower temperatures then you'll be degrading your your your distantly lesser you'll be degrading or material less less damage is done to the material so we'll get this completely sit up setup and then video number two we'll begin with loading our material into our flask and that'll take us through the entire process so the purpose of this video is to help aspiring chemists and alchemists to help familiarize themselves with these concepts and equipment and another purpose for this video will be to get some feedback from more experienced chemists and alchemists on how I can improve my distillation technique I've literally watched a hundred videos at least about short path distillation vacuum distillation and and I've noticed that in the comments that there's there's a lot of name-calling and ego tripping so I just wanted to remind everybody before you leave a comment let's remember to be kind to each other and keep your comments on the level so I'm going to go ahead and disassemble my still set up here and then we'll reassemble it together we'll go through all the names of the different pieces and how they work together and and that'll be the first video and then on the second video will actually run our material so thanks again for checking out my video and let's get started to begin our setup we'll start with our large round bottom flask so in this case we'll be using a 2-liter round bottom flask from steam roller extractions to to clean the glassware clean I like to use a 99% isopropyl alcohol and you can find this at your local hardware store I just pour a little bit in a clean spray bottle and I used my spray bottle to spray out each of the pieces as we go so we're gonna make sure that all the glassware is clean and we're also going to make sure that all the all the joints are properly lubricated with our high vacuum grease so we can just grab our round bottom flasks you want to be very careful with your glassware not to not to do anything dangerous and just start spraying some alcohol in here and the reason for the 99% alcohol is to it will dry 100% clear so man just spray a little bit of that in there and they'll clean this guy up and we'll set or we'll set our round bottom flask into our heating mantle next piece we'll add is going to be our distillation column or condenser and this guy will sit right in here like this it's important that you keep track of where of where your other input is you may wish to use a funnel as your material and depending on which material you run you may decide that you want to add your material first if it's a liquid you probably want to add the material first before you build your before you build your apparatus if it's if it's a oil or something more thick that you might be using a heat gun and a funnel then you probably don't need to probably don't need to put the liquid material in here first so to put our distillation head on here we're going to get some of this dowel Corning high vacuum grease and we're going to we're going to put a little bit of this on each of our joints this says good lubricating and sealing ability low volatility excellent resistance to water chemicals high and low temperatures so this is one of the best products that you can use for this and it's it's not cheap but it's a very high quality product you really don't need a whole lot so I just smear a little bit around like this you don't want you just wanted to do thee you just want to use the very top of the joint you don't need to we don't need to lubricate the whole joint just the top area and then as we place this joint in there we'll turn it a couple of times and watch it make a seal pull out my phone here and we'll take our distillation head as you put a little pressure and you turn it a couple of times you'll be able to see that sealed right there now you've created that seal the next thing we'll do is clip that piece together this is called a Keck clip and these are 24 or 40 connections this is a 24 40 tech clip so I take my cat clip and I'll put it right here and I want to make sure that I've got enough room for this guy over here so when it comes time to add the material I'm ready to go the next piece that we'll add will be what's called a receiving towel and this is our receiving cow here the three receiving flats are going to attach here and our vacuum line is going to attach here so again the same thing we're going to take the mail connection which is this guy here he's already got some it's already got some lubrication on him and again you can see that you can see that seal as you as you push and you turn you can see that that seal is become clear through there and you know that you have a good seal and then we'll take another one of our pet clips now we'll take some of our vacuum grease and we'll put a little bit on each of these Mayo connections for our cow and these are where our collection flask would attach we'll attach these connection class flasks with the with a ket click just like we did the distillation head there are different schools of thought about about the way that lubricant is used some people prefer to use a different name brand of lubricant than the dow corning I just stick with that because that's the best review that I've seen these don't need to sit on here in any specific direction just so long as they're long as they're round they're snug and you've created a good seal there will be three collection flats so when we're when we're doing our distillation we're going to have a head a body and the tail the head is going to be those molecules that evaporate at lower temperatures the body is going to be a light colored oil and the tail is going to be when the light color and the oil starts to starts to turn a darker color so now we've got this set up the next piece that we'll add will be this guy and this will help us just to keep this from keep this from falling over this is a flats colder here and that looks good there so here is our next piece that we're going to revert to add this piece is called a boss head and this is a retort clamp so we'll take this clamp we're going to clamp it on the right here and again you want to just be nice and slow and careful if it takes you a couple of times to set this up your first time don't feel bad or feel like you need to be in a rush of any kind it's the important thing is that you do a good job and be safe and don't do any damage to yourself or you to your equipment you don't want to read on this nice and tight [Music] [Music] and sometimes it takes a little practice to finagling each piece exactly where it needs to be in before we actually start our process we'll make sure that this cow has a nice free swing that it can swing back and forth you you'll begin with your first reception flask going to your body and then to your tail here so we want to we want to make sure that this this apparatus has the ability to swing back and forth and these are 250 milliliter collection flats here and when we're setting this up we want to make sure that want make sure that this column is straight up and down so the next piece that we can add will be our which arm the torque here and we've got another one of these deposits this guy and use it to use it to hold our cold trap so the next piece I'm going to connect this one to my cold trap here's my culture here this connection goes to my vacuum pump and this connection will go to our distillation apparatus so we're going to turn this guy like so and this will end up going here and this little metal dish is to hold our dry ice so we're going to we're going to take that little metal dish we're going to fill it up full of dry ice and this little stand just helps to keep it up keep it up where it needs to be at the correct height I'll just show you what this looks like so this is the inner part of our cold trap and basically the the vacuum will come out of our distillation set will come down this tube and any liquids that might go into your pump and damage your pump are going to are going to stick to the walls of this guy I'm going to stick to the walls of your cold trap as condensation and and you're going to be pulling cold fresh air from up here on top so the the colder that your pump runs the more efficient that your pump is going to run so again we'll take our we'll take our dow corning vacuum grease and we'll just put a little bit here and make sure that we've got a nice good seal on there it really doesn't have to be perfect and I just take the I just take the vacuum grease and just do about the top half of the male connection I I never put my back in grease on the female connection that you're looking for a big mess that way so I'll just gently lower this guy into here turn it back and forth a couple times and you can see that it gets this clear look to it we're all set there then we'll be able to then we'll be able to connect our vacuum line here I like to use a little bit of teflon tape on the connections not so much on the water connections that come in and out here the what the cold water is going to come in here and come out here but for the before our at the very top here we're going to put a thermometer and I'd like to use a little bit of teflon tape on those threads and right here this is a vacuum connection and I like to use a little bit of teflon tape the reason why is because we don't want any of our joints to be leaking we want to get as as strong of a pressure as we can from our vacuum pump so I wrap this connection here with my teflon tape when you're using the teflon tape you want to wrap it in the opposite direction that the threads ago now that I've got my teflon tape on here I want to very carefully take my vacuum line and we're going to tighten this guy up as tight as we can without cross threading it or without damaging that okay and once you get it tight you want to give it just a little eighth of a turn to see all that and here's my thermometer adapter and you can see that I've just I've wrapped the top of that with the teflon tape making sure that the tip on tape out of the hole there we're going to be using we're going to be using this with our thermometer probe so we'll start by screwing this cap on partway and we'll take our thermometer probe just gently push this in here and this this probe is going to go all the way down into our material and this is going to give us a digital readout of what our actual temperature is and this goes down in this here and this connects around the back we're going to want to use our Dow Corning vacuum brace again every time that we have these glass one glass we want to use the we want to use our vacuum grease if you don't use the vacuum grease what happens is that you run a risk of the the joints seizing together it's also a good idea to it's also a good idea to separate these joints at least you know crack them open a little bit while our apparatus is still hot so while we get done running our material we're going to we're going to loosen up these connections before we allow the whole apparatus to cool off so we've got our got a vacuum crease and we've got our kick clip and that will hold this out down where we want it we don't have a lot of material this round so I'm going to put this one almost to the bottom here there we go nice tight seal alright so we have one more piece to go and that will be our thermometer and our thermometer is going to go up top here so the same thing I'm just going to wrap these threads with a little bit of teflon tape and the next thing we'll do is get some get some cold water and some ice in our bucket here and lo will be almost ready to get started so I wrapped some teflon tape around this top connection here and now we're going to add our glass thermometer 12-inch thermometer and we'll just put this guy in here and we want to I'll show you when I get done screwing this on here real quick we want the we want the tip of our thermometer to be right here right where the right where the two pieces come together and we're going to be recording the temperature right there and that's and so that's the reason why we're using the long thermometer there we want it to be exactly where these two pieces of glass meet and I want to make sure it's nice and tough nice and snug on here so that we I can get a good backing see how this illustrates a little bit better what I'm saying and about having art and you want to make sure it sits where you can read it also as you put this in and out you want to do it from here and not from back here so that you don't accidentally break your thermometer so in my pot here I've got a pump this pump is going to pump the water into our cool water condenser it's going to come into this connection and out of this connection and that's just a that's just a used fish pump that I found at the at the local pet store super cheap I think maybe ten dollars then take our ice and pour it into here and put some water and it's important that you put the ice in the water before you plug in the pump if you plug in the pump dry it will die so you want to be careful with that there's about seven pounds of ice and if I need some more ice throughout the procedure I can add some more now I'll begin adding some water this is a two-liter Erlenmeyer flask and we don't need filtered water or anything like that just regular water will be great that the water is not actually touching our material the water is simply going to be to cool this area and I'll probably I'll probably add between four and six liters of water into my into my stainless steel bucket here so I've got my my top plugged in and I can see that it is it is this one that is pumping out I've got the one that's pumping out and this guy will connect here and you always want the water in to start down at the bottom like the water out to be up here at the top all the diagrams that you'll see that's the proper setup you don't need to refine these and it's okay if you get a little air bubbles because again all we're doing here is cooling we're going to our steam is going to our material is going to come up through the through the distillation apparatus as a steam and once it reaches the top this this cold chamber is going to cool it back into a liquid and that will be able to separate it into two different classes are different different molecules based on their on their temperatures at which they evaporate or boil I've raised my cold trap up off my dish here got a bag with some ice in it here and I'm going to I'm going to put the dry ice in here and then snuggle this guy down into the dry ice okay I've got my dry ice in my dish here I'm loosening up this cold trap over it down in there just right [Music] doesn't need to be tight just just enough to hold it in place and that will allow our that will allow any moisture to condensate within the within the cold trap and that will keep us from damaging our pump and you can see that the line coming off of the cold trap is going to go to our pump and so I'll show you where our pump is it's down here in our cupboard this is for a couple reasons the first reason is to kind of keep it quiet a little bit and the second reason is if God forbid were to explode it would not hurt me or my distillation set so we keep that in the cupboard with the door just a crack open and that's where our vacuum pump is I'm using a rocker vacuum pump a single-stage 250 before we actually run our material there's one more thing that we need to check and then I wanted to go over with you just some of the concepts and ideas I wanted to read from a couple of chemistry books that I have an explanation of the different types of distillation but before we can begin our distillation we need to make sure that our cattle here this is called our cow and these are our receiving flats we want to make sure that this apparatus is able to turn freely but it's not going to get caught up on anything that's something that we need to establish now instead of later when it's all under vacuum pressure so we're going to begin with this first to begin with this first ball here and we just want to make sure that it's got a free swing so that throughout our process here we thought we can swing this back and forth those need to be this guy up here nice and straight loosen this one bring this guy up and this will be our collection flask for our heads for the beginning of our material this will be our body and this will be our tables just like just like distilling alcohol there's a head of body and the tails or a head a mane and a tail so we should be all ready to go I'm next the next thing I'm going to do is put a funnel here and I'm going to start fumbling in my materials so first we'll go over a couple of these a couple of these scientific explanations the different types of distillation and when we're done going over that then we'll be ready to start running our material so before we move on to part two of our video I just wanted to go over real quick some of the some of the different terminology and some of the different concepts not only from a organic chemistry perspective but also from an alchemical perspective I just want to go over here distillation basics this is a really good really good explanation of distillation it says the vaporization of a liquid and condensation of the resulting vapor is the basis of distillation organic liquids containing small amounts of impurities or non-volatile substances are easily purified by simple distillation as our liquid mixtures were the difference in boiling points of the compounds is greater than 70 degrees Celsius fractional distillation is more useful for separating mixtures of liquids where the boiling point of the components differ by less than 70 degrees Celsius a typical simple distillation setup is shown in this figure here it consists of a flask containing a liquid to be distilled an adapter to hold the thermometer and to connect the flask to a water cooled condenser and a flask to hold the content the condensed liquid or the distillate here's our here's our receiving adapter and our receiving flask so that that goes over simple distillation and fractional distillation [Music] continue on with fractional distillation the apparatus for a fractional distillation is similar to that for a simple distillation except that an extension is added to the flask in order to increase the distance travel by the vapor and the surface area available for condensation the extension is named a fractioning column and may be open such as the columns used here we're loosely packed within inert substance such as glass beads the purpose of the packing if present is to further increase the surface area which the vapor contacts the length of the column and the type of packing our large factor in determining the degree of separation that could be achieved with the fractional distillation another factor in determining the degree of separation that can be achieved with a fractional distillation is the rate at which the distillation is carried out the best separations are achieved using a slow steady distillation rate a slow distillation rate maximizes the number of vaporizations and condensations in the fractioning column a really good website to check out or people interested in in doing doing vacuum distillation fractional distillation is best value VAX com they they sell distillation equipment so so here it talks about a vacuum pump when doing a distillation process it is imperative that you have a chemically resistant vacuum pump that connects that can achieve extreme depth the pump should be able to achieve at least 50 micron but the deeper the better the preferred type of pump for distillation is a rotary vane oil pump rotary vane pumps offer the best vacuum depth compared to other types of pumps specialty pumps such as diffusion pumps will be discussed later short path distillation can be very chemically abrasive to your vacuum pump for this reason is recommended that you change your oil before every distillation this will allow the best depth and keep your vacuum pump running at peak performance then it talks about a cold trap the cold trap plays the important role of catching any vapors that pass through the condenser this protects and prolongs the lifespan of your vacuum systems just like we talked about in our just when we were setting up we talked about how the cold trap will catch any vapors and and condense them to the side of the cold trap and this will protect your pump from overheating and the colder that your pump runs the more efficient that your pump is going to run so the short path system is made up of four major glass components and the heating mantle these components are the boiling flask the short path head the receiving cow and the receiving flask the heating mantle is similar to a heat bath on the road of APE this is how you will heat the mixture inside the boiling flask the head is the key to distillation inside the head there are small indentations called vigor row these contain contact points for the vapors to bump as they travel up in the head they create sia reticle plates needed for distillation where the vapors will become purified before entering the condenser path the head also encompasses the condenser where the vapors will be pulled to rican dents into that beautiful golden color we all want to see the three receiving flask correspond to the three main fractions so when we we talk about molecular separation molecular distillation for an example here I have some phyto cannabinoid boiling points and these are these are different these are different molecules that are found within within a cannabis crude oil so starting with THC you can see that the boiling point is a hundred and fifty seven degrees and then the next one is CBD from 160 to 180 degrees and as you get down the line these different molecules will all have a different boiling point or a different different distillation rate and so it that's how we're able to separate these separate these different molecules this is a great book that I picked up at Powell's bookstore Organic laboratory techniques and they're on chapter 7 talks about vacuum distillation the principle difference between a vacuum and an atmospheric distillation setup is that in a vacuum distillation the system must be airtight and able to hold a vacuum a vacuum adapter rather than a bent adapter must be used since this adapter has a standard taper joint connection for a round bottom flask and the tubing connection for a vacuum source the glassware must be able to withstand the vacuum for example large thin walled Erlenmeyer flasks cannot be used use vacuum grease to seal all glass to glass connections stopcock grease flows too easily under heat to hold a vacuum use only heavy walled vacuum tubing tighten all rubber tubing connections including the rubber thermometer adapter by wrapping a wire around the rubber and twisting it with pliers assembling the apparatus completely in test for air leaks by applying the vacuum before placing any liquid in the distillation flask so when we set up our when we set up our distillation apparatus one thing that we do before we add our material is we check for any air leaks vacuum fraction collectors if a vacuum adapter and round bottom flask are used the forerun cannot be separated from the main fraction without your stopping the distillation and disassembling the apparatus therefore if more than one fraction is to be collected a vacuum fraction collectors should be used two types of vacuum fraction collectors are shown in Figure 7.3 so here it shows what a cow looks like vacuum adapters and receivers that allow the collection of more than one fraction during the course of a distillation so in this case we don't have to turn off the whole the whole distillation in order to be able to just swing this cow to the next receiving flask and and this kind of goes on in a little more detail but but that's the basic gist of it and finally I wanted to talk about distillation from an alchemical perspective so this is a book by freighter Dennis William Howe FRC and here he talks about the distillation process from me from a Rosicrucian and from a chemical perspective distillation is the boiling and condensing of a solution to increase its concentration and purity the alchemists believed that distillation released the pure essence or spirit of a substance in the evaporating vapors for example one can obtain the pure alcohol spirit of wine by distilling a solution of fermented grapes the essence could be concentrating using a process known as rectification and here he gives a definition of rectification rectification is the process of refining or purifying a substance by repeated distillation the evaporated distillate is returned to the boiling vessel to be distilled again continued cycles of distillation eventually produce a thick and extremely concentrated solution the alchemist called the mother of the stone a typical distillation apparatus consists of a lower boiling vessel or the cucurbit and an upper steel head or the Alembic which is a hooded vessel that collects the rising vapors the hot vapors are cooled and a long condenser and the purified condensed liquid or the distillate is directed by a tube or funnel into a receiving vessel a popular medieval distillation device was nicknamed the Pelican it was a glass retort a type of container with two tubes connecting the neck of the vessel with the lower body distillation is the most important operation in practical alchemy and some alchemists spent months distilling the same solution over and over distillation is described in the Emerald Tablet in these words it rises from the earth to heaven and descends again to earth thereby containing within itself the powers of both the above and the below the alchemists chose the astrological earth sign of Virgo as the cipher to signify distillation the Egyptians associated the alchemical goddess Isis with this sign the cypher for the operation of sublimation was Libra an astrological air sign the Egyptians associated with the divine child as well as Maud the goddess of truth two-headed creatures are shown rising into the air on wings and then returning to the earth and drawings depicting the distillation process the repeated circulation between the spiritual forces above and the material forces below eventually led to a concentration and purification of the essences of the substance at hand and here we see this rebus and this is a this is an illustration like a like a woodcut illustration from an ancient alchemical texts and this basically speaks to the above and the below this this this alchemical concept from thee from the Emerald Tablet of Hermes where where Hermes talks about as above so below it is very important hermetic axiom so these are some of the different explanations and concepts associated with with our project for today and our next video we're going to get into the actual process of distillation I've got some crude oil material that we're going to be running and so please check back with me soon thanks again for checking out the video if you want to like share and subscribe that'd be really great and stay tuned we'll have part two we're gonna run our material and we'll do part three where we're going to do a final cleanup so thanks again for watching peace profound and lvx [Music] [Music]", "hwyhxIThFmg": "hey guys Nick with precision here and today we're gonna be talking about terpenes so we want to understand these compounds what they are how they occur in nature how we're extracting and isolating them so the first thing that I'd like to bring up is terpenes are actually a variety of organic compounds and these organic compounds are naturally occurring in all sorts of areas of nature the main things that you will find terpenes are in is cannabis conifer plants like pine trees spruce things like that are one of the most abundant sources as well as a variety of insects and even some mammals now it's it's interesting these compounds because they serve a variety of different purposes so in plants they're mainly signaling it's signaling for a predator to stay away or for a sweet you know delicious smell to be eaten by a certain mammal and there's kind of this underlying communication standard with these terpenes amongst everything in nature and in the universe and if you start looking at these compounds and where they're placed and what they do it's it's quite amazing the the matrix of what's there with that all being said you have other terpenes that are produced by insects that are produced by by mammals and these are actually produced in some cases biosynthetic aliso in many cases humans produce terpenes biosynthetic Lee meaning within our own body they come endogenously produced and our signaling receptors not only are they signaling mechanisms but they're also biosynthetic building blocks so a good example of this would be squalene and the steroids that are derived from that and things like that you can look into that but it's very very interesting so understanding these molecules and what they do is very very important to understanding why they're valuable to an extraction process and why they're valuable to the cannabis plant and with understanding all of this it's really important to know that they are anti microbials they're anti virals to help keep your body into a homeostasis into that balanced state that we've spoken about before so in many many cases there actually have a lot of similar properties that they exhibit on humans the same way cannabinoids do and the key to all this is that you get this entourage type effect and it's almost like nature's produced and packaged to this perfect little plant and this perfect little combination of terpenes and cannabinoids in order to aid a variety of medical conditions and bring your body back into balance now what we do at precision is we're highly focused around the extraction and isolation of these terpenes the extraction of isolation of these terpenes is a very special process because the molecules in and of themselves whether they're monoterpenes or sesqui terpenes or triterpene there's a bunch of different types of these terpenes but in general they're all very delicate when I say they're very delicate they're very prone to degradation they're very prone to really being diminished or their molecular structure being changed with any sort of heat any sort of excessive stress will say to that molecule without getting into overly technical terms so what we're trying to do from an extraction process is extract these very very gently extract them in a very low temperature and and do that in a manner that is going to actually render that molecule unadulterated in that extract well we commonly end up with as a process for extracting cannabis and extracting these terpenes that uses a very light hydrocarbon mainly butane or propane but most cases moving more towards a propane dominant blend not only we do do we do do that but we also actually take the plant and harvest the plant when it has peak terpene content and the peak terpene content ultimately is extracted with these very light hydrocarbons and we get this soupy sort of saucy type mixture and the key to this is being able to remove that solvent because that solvent is a very light hydrocarbon for example propane can boil off at negative 41 degrees and what we'll actually do is we'll just apply a very light heat so it'll be enough heat to remove the solvent but not enough heat to disturb or degrade any of those terpenes ultimately we can centrifuge those terpenes and separate them from the cannabinoids because the the two layers obviously separate able by the centrifugal force and we have a purified terpene compound and there can obviously be further from chromatography purification steps and things like that but isolating and extracting these cannabis-based terpenes are a key value stream and it's interesting to know that you can isolate these terpenes from many different types of plants now one of the things I said when we when we started out was conifer trees were one of the most abundant sources of terpenoids or terpenes in the in the world right now that that we know of and basically you get very high levels of Alpha and Beta Pi Neen that's why a pine tree alpha and beta piney and you can obviously put that one together but they also have things in there like limonene and lena law and these other different terpenes that kind of make this perfect package and turpentine ironically is mainly alpha and beta pining and it's used as an in cleaning a cleaning agent antiviral antibacterial and insecticide and for a variety of other uses works really well as a solvent in addition so the question is why can't we just isolate these terpenes from these high concentrated areas like say conifer trees and combine them back into cannabis well the answer is is that many state laws actually restrict the use of outside terpenes or non cannabis derived terpenes to be entered back into a cannabis based product so for example in states where we have like a metric system that has a traceability throughout the entire we'll call it seed to sale of the of the cannabis value stream they want those terpenes to be extracted isolated from the original cannabis crop and them to be re-used and re-entered into ultimately that suite of products that's going to be sold so understanding terpenes what they are what they do this level of science how to extract them isolate them refine them very very important to an extraction business it's very very relevant particularly in the cannabis space because most states don't allow for the use of outside terpenes to be reconstituted into a cannabis based product for traceability purposes so with that all being said I really hope you enjoyed our short talk today on terpenes hope you have a better understanding of what they are how they're relevant how they can aid in human health and conditions and how they are specifically relevant to the cannabis industry and how we use them within canvas thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video", "0MDzKuwbwgI": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and this one is for you for the few team that to increase the temperature this is same for a distillation part this was a fabrication and you can see here it's a meteor - Meier how much yeah taking tight firm are you you can see normally that all you should be in iran's of the to get but now it's too much okay bye and then here is the temperature sensor still it's a good one who you do back on the hair here is to reduce iron and if you want to reduce the air you can turn eyes and this car is the window to say how much it touches in the time after the NACA window they say the the platform from the people encanta to the evaporation time and the media for the appearance okay and the basic accumbens presently live for the water [Music] eliminated this father is dead for like - with a large [Music] and in Spain as similar with evaporating hand and then here's outline here to unite with the material here from the Eli and the province from here here it's worth oil separator which one can help you fly to some and since your oil from Earth it's too late in time and this part is to recycle to fly to the solvent for recycle will disturbance and this

check the path the sobriety of the path as you same with the other hand here's the arrow the variety of the palms you'll be seen with the arrow if different they we have to switch p1 and p2 on a panel and ok everything is ready we can turn on the machine for the it touch me it's for a party and a side with temperature and tonight and we should make here on this pipeline is closed under this pipeline it's over this pipeline should be closed and also here should be closed here I'm here to be open and here instantly I went away but sorry for this one for this one no needed - OH and that I know [Music] and maybe two hours three hours also depend on you allocate finish we can clothe them [Applause] [Music] we want you to a cheeky PL salon what is it sweet about I think 29 okay after distillation we can we should close this pipeline for the lip balm and a close this valve and outreach well for the condenser and also flow this valve for the re what are your separator and also close it back after closing this valve which would stop solve the distillation and then turn on the evaporating hater and also we shielded turn on the vacuum ha this this table should turn on this one and on the vacuum and press the start button also if you make sure the outer light hit rock bottom and with you turn on the bath and the exciting will be transferred from this with clean hands the filter

no funny Dan hundred mice no chanting again and this system also for energy feeling after evaporating avenues to on to use your head sauce we can open this valve and a lot of your head start to the pixelation pathogen and the to reduce the paper and okay at this system it's energy-saving after evaluating yes hey Vsauce feel like a user evaporating time we want to use it with other big Baba and

ensure that it's t free or thc free and extremely low if it's not t free the law states that anything above 0.3 percent by content with thc is an illegal product so if there is thc listed on the label you want to be sure that it's within those legal limits", "LbmX26chNp0": "hi my name's Greg with apex supercritical and today I'm going to give you a demonstration on 1500 psi 1 liter desktop supercritical extraction machine as another machine that discussed is we have three components we have our system this is where our material goes in and our track shall take place this is real oil amount we also have our chiller down here which maintains temperature control throughout the entire system all these vessels are jacketed that's what these blue water lines are for then we have our pump this controls flow and build up our pressure where we need them and also assist with recovery at the end of the line we'll put co2 back in the bottle this systems run parameters are set to run a very popular low pressure low temperature parameters for a lot of people even on the larger machines still prefer to run with the same parameters that this machine is dialed on for they often buy back on all our apex machines so a lot of people will start with this machine develop a product and develop their processes and then they'll turn this machine back in towards a larger machine in the future another benefit to this machine but a lot of people like is that it's all 110 electricity um this is one 1083 separate like the bottle is 110 for this 110 for the chiller in 110 third we recommend that the pump and the children are not on the same electrical circuit but we've recently made some design changes to this system just to get more thorough extraction and to reduce the amount maintenance people having to do to it we now have a flow switch installed on the system so if your user air commits people from leaving their children off and causing all this to freeze over which then fills the pump flow oil so that can no longer happen we've also made some changes with our purpose in here it is permanent it's a compression fitting now or bringing teflon tape on it very simple and there's no verb remembering you don't have to remember to orientate office anymore it's a permanent fixed orientation we also our biggest improvement lately on this pump the seals used to only get about 50 hours now we've seen about 120 hours on seals still replacements we have a great video on that and we also have step-by-step instructions in the manual so all maintenance on this system is fairly easy takes maybe 20 minutes between runs and then every 100 hours an additional 20 minutes to place those sails alright so now we're talking about filling this machine and performing an extraction you want come on over here I'll show you the inside look it's a fairly small vessel it'll hold like I said 1/2 to 3/4 pound material there's a remote probe sticking up in the bottom of it that is connected to our chiller down below so that we can properly monitor and control the temperatures of our extraction we provide this funnel for filling here so we would load the extraction or load the extraction vessel we recommend grinding drying and grinding your plant material grind it down the coffee ground consistency may be a little finer then we applied this funnel to fill the extraction vessel you can also pack some your material in there to achieve that 3/4 to a hole pattern or the material then load it in now we're going to install the bolt we recommend can tidy them all first then we've provided our impact with the system for getting these always tight so now that we got these hand tight all of them are hand tight we'll use our impact to tighten these in a star pattern just like we would type in the will in our car look you don't have to hold it it's real quick taps that's secure let's step back over here nonetheless secure so we've got this full apply material now we flows so right here we have four different valves right now they're all open this controls flow direction in our traction vessel so each run wheel changes so for one run we will flow in the top of the extractor vessel out the bottom into our separator then the next run will flow in the bottom of our extraction vessel at the top the reason we do this is because there's filters at the top and bottom of this extraction vessel that we don't want to get clogged if you switch the flow every other run it keeps them clean and maintains good flow then we have two vents here so I pick my my flow I'm going to go and flow bottom to top for this run now we have two vents one here one here that we're going to close these will be opened at the end of the run to prevent the remaining pressure in the system now that those are closed you can open our seal bottle we've already secured this you want to make sure all these are closed our separator lines or triangles they are to pipe a lot of lines are properly connected one with design upgrades I was discussing won't allow the system start all the water lines are connected so even if you've grabbed the particular odds the worries systems is not going to start over here each other you Chargers turn on or like I was just saying the system time to start up 70 degrees Fahrenheit 65 sending experiments a good low-pressure room temperature setting for this system so all is open and is tight bowser bright on display screen over here press Start reset tap a long time it says system ready we'll start beginning notice you're pushing all this is going to fill up come in a little closer all these games are slowly rising here in a second this pump kick on and we're essentially done we're just going to watch the gauges make sure everything gets up a pressure make sure to chiller gets the temperature we want it and we're good to go it's probably going to take about 15-20 minutes or if you notice down here this chiller temperature is rising that's because we've got that remote probe inside the extraction vessel all that compressing co2 in there is creating a lot of heat so this is going to go up in temperature but we've got our setpoint 772 12:08 it's going to take 15 preventing our exit 2012 picking psi right now you can see it's only about eight hundred nine hundred psi so it's still climbing once it reaches steady state should be between that thousand and twelve fifty our separator we will maintain between 400 and 420 psi we do that over here this little green knob you'll play with this to dial in our pressure over here no once we get this dialed in very rarely the beginning - professor is right now so while this is going to get pressure for three steady state the disgusting probably right give gas the Oh about 12 psi in our tracks vessel all the materials at Fulton yes verify that hope liquid co2 running waxes over in New York some inside are some pressure vessel with small markets here this small orifice is little tiny hole at the end of this down to is what's holding back 1200 psi in our traction vessel and maintaining about 400 psi inside of our separation vessel at which pressure co2 as a gas so that liquid co juice coming through at the oil it's flashing into a gas the gas is being sent back to the pump to be recompressed and the oil is falling out into our collection cup so at the end of every run after all the co2 is recovered we'll take this cup off to harvest our oil systems been running about 20 or 30 minutes and as you can see temperatures right down here in your set 2017 our pressures and our extractors about 1150 almost 1200 and our separator pressures around 420 so it's running right now everything's flowing we had plant material in here right now there'd be extraction taking place it's going to continue to do this for the next four to eight hours then I'm all set over here we have hours from now so now we're back recovering as you can see see how our pressures starting to drop everywhere our temperature down here is going to get cold as I said in the beginning that compressing co2 in here is going to create a lot of heat decompressing all that co2 is we put it back at the bottle it's going to get extremely cold in there so it's normal for these chiller temperatures to drop extremely low so we're going to give it another 30 minutes and our memories should be complete so now our recovery is complete as you can see all the gauges sitting around around 190 close to 200 so that's as far down as this pump is going to pull down up at co2 so now that we'll do children still are down here this is exactly how you walk in in the garage we'll turn our chiller off we'll come over here closer co2 bottle will open up our two minutes here fit out this Romanian pressure going over all valves if they're all pressures real easy to system everything ones reading zero and now we can take this off use this and so essentially the runs done now we're going to take this off we're going to use a shopback to suck out our dry client material from here then we're going to take this off on harvest oil so here's the impact so now we get shot back suck out and you drive pipe material that is in here we'll come over here harvest our oil just connect this water line we're just disconnecting the water lines so we can separate this collection cup from the rest of the separator flexing cut off in here obviously it's empty right now but this is where our oil would be built up you see there's a little bit of residual oil in there right now there could also be hard stuff 99% pure THC a buildup on the walls because we do keep this system and low pressure and low temperature so at that point if we want to get that hard stuff off the walls we would use a little scraper tool that's provided with machine and put a glass dish here and we scrape that hard stuff off the walls we keep that separate from oil and wax that's in here we can make shadow with that hard 99% pure THC a buildup that is on the walls so we would take this now over in our little workstation and harvest olive oil into a beaker or a glass dish of some kind then what we do however it's clean we've come back over here reassemble everything reload plant material and go back through a startup give any questions regarding what I just discussed our doing demonstration on any of our systems we offer live demonstrations here in our Denver office you can contact me Craig Peterson at Craig H at named Peck supercritical comm or you can schedule your demo at t28 and the effects of the critical calm thank you very much", "3kOjHV7vSoc": "hey guys just want to talk to you about CBD oil my experience with it try to make this really quick just to help you guys decide which hemp bombed CBD oil would be better for you I've tried maybe six different brands other than hemp bombs and I gotta say hemp bombs is definitely the best or you know maybe tied with one other you know really good brand up tribe but I'm not gonna get no other brands I just want to talk about that have bombs and specifically I want to talk about these two oils the $2,000 gram and the 4000 milligram now they're both really expensive you know the four thousand milligrams I'm not sure the retail I got a discount on it it's probably about $220 per 1 ounce and the two thousand is probably 120 hundred forty an ounce I got him discounted at a gas station cuz the guy just gave up on trying to get rid of him because nobody wanted to buy them they were there for months so I bought both of them and I bought others to about 600 milligrams thousand milligram 2000 milligram 4000 milligram now I tried the 600 first then I tried the thousand then I tried the 4000 then I tried the 2000 so the only way I can describe it the feeling is you know when I pinch it I shoot it through the back of my throat to run down my esophagus I feel a greater effect when I do that rather than put it under my tongue so when I do that immediately I'll feel a nomina fact on especially a stronger effect with the 4000 milligram I've only seen people do reviews on the thousand and you know this is 2,000 I've tried the thousand and it really didn't do much for me but I got to say that the 4000 really helps me with my pain my pain specifically being my right shoulder shoulder blade my ribs under here they get swollen you know I'll get um stressed out about things anxiety it'll take away a headache you know stomachache it does a lot it really does but for me it mainly takes away likes or tight muscles arthritis pain in my chest that I feel sometimes on my right shoulder just from past things that have happened but it takes about ten minutes for me to really feel the effect whether it was the 2000 / the 4000 and even the thousand I felt it a little bit I'll admit it but just not that much especially compared to the two and the four and comparing the two to the 4000 I didn't feel that significant of a difference but I did feel a difference nonetheless the 4000 was more numbing effect on the back of my throat when when I shot it in the back of my throat and the 2,000 does similar but not quite the strength so you know just from the experience of it I could tell the 4000 was stronger you know like it claims to be you can feel that it is and it definitely has a slight stronger effect on pain you know once it cycles through your blood for a few minutes so I would definitely recommend this stuff to anybody that's in severe pain the 4000 it's worth it it's you know you're not gonna you know not feel anything when you take this you're gonna feel some relief no matter what's wrong with you I believe and it helps with many you know mental weaknesses like a DVD HD anxiety all that I'm sure you guys know about it but you really feel the effects when you take the 4000 especially if you take it on an empty stomach and really feel it you don't feel it as much if you eat something really unhealthy you know fill your stomach up gorge yourself and then you know take a shot of this because you have swelling in your body from you the lack of nutrition and unhealthy food you just said which I'm guilty of that too I've done this Rob eating unhealthy and then try to make myself feel better take some of this and yeah it does work but not like if you take it on an empty stomach I gotta say like if you have pain on a full moon they're just weird seasons if you have metal rods in your body um this stuff is excellent if you have the money grab it uh it is really good stuff this 4,000 milligram and the mm is really good too I'd recommend that to anybody as well even if you have extreme pain you don't have as much money to get this mm but as far as people with extreme pain I wouldn't recommend anything below the mm for sure the thousand just it didn't do much for me and I'm not an extreme pain I'm just in moderate pain sometimes the people in extreme pain definitely need you know the 4000 and I haven't seen any reviews on the two or the four so I just want to let you guys know that it's both good if you decide to buy these um you don't have to question it so thank you for watching I hope this helps you guys bye", "gID2apDDdPU": "with the time in today's video I'm gonna give simple yet detailed explanation on how THC CBD and CBC form within cannabis and what leads up to their production starting with CB GA CVG a stands for canna garlic acid which is one of the precursor cannabinoids it creates THC a CBD a and CB CA and a few other ones which of course in turn break down to THC CBD and CBC we will also talk about what it takes for the precursors to change or catalyze so let's get started so now we know that CBG a is the precursor but what comes before that to create CBG a to chemicals named geranyl pyrophosphate and all of taluk acid come together to create cv GA you can see those here below now that CBG a is created the effects are gaba inhibitors anti-anxiety antidepressant antifungal and possible properties like helping regulate bladder anti-tumor and stimulate bone growth also CBG a is not psychoactive so there is usually not a high concentration in Flour unless it's manually modified but that's because of enzymes and we'll talk about that here a little bit actually we'll talk about that right now so how does CB g a turn into THC a CB da and CB c a well during plant growth enzymes from within the plant which allocate the certain number or amount of CB g a to be split up into THC a CB da and CB c a and enzymes are basically something that makes something else produce quicker so the equation looks something like this and we can see the CB GA plus the o2 are being turned into the THC a and h2o 2 which is just hydrogen peroxide now that we have th CA CB da and si they all do have their own properties some of them which I listed below a good thing to note though is that THC a CBD 8 nor CBC a are psychoactive turning these into THC CBD and CBC only takes one final step in is an extremely simple one it can happen with direct heat and/or time this process is called decarboxylation which really is just removing carbon dioxide but it's important to understand how it works you can see th CA here and in the red circle I have outlined a 2 oxygen and one carbon this co2 is what makes th CA an acid so when we remove it with D carving it becomes THC a simple equation for this is that THC a is 87% THC but let's take it one step further to find out why so hopefully I won't have to explain it again it's all due to the molecular weight of the molecules THC a and THC we look at the periodic table and we can find the weight of each element then multiply the weight of each element times the number that comes after it in the name for example the C 22 is carbon which is 12.011 x 22 age 30 which is hydrogen 1.008 x 30 and then we have Oh 4 which would be oxygen or 15.99 x 4 if you do this for both THC and THC a the numbers come out to 3 14 point 47 and 350 eight point four eight when you divide 3 fourteen point four seven by three fifty eight point four eight you get point eight seven seven which relates back to what we said earlier and proofs our equation true something to note is that if THC is left to in direct exposure to air for a long enough time CBN will form instead of THC and with that being said that's all the time we have for today but thank you so much for tuning in and watching and we'll see you next time", "VnPzjN43SAk": "have you ever tried CBD check this video out and learn all about CBD and how it can be beneficial to you your body and your family in this video I'm going to show you 19 benefits and uses and side-effects of CBD oil cannabidiol is a popular natural remedy used for many common ailments it's better known as CBD and is one of the hundred and four chemical compounds known as Kappa noids found in cannabis or the marijuana plant THC is the main psychoactive cab enoyed found in cannabis and causes the sensation of getting high it's often associated with marijuana however unlike THC CBD is not psychoactive this quality makes CBD an appealing option for those who are looking for relief from pain and other symptoms without the mind-altering effects of marijuana or certain pharmaceutical drugs CBD oil is made by extracting CBD from the cannabis plant then diluting it with a carrier oil like coconut or hemp seed oil it's gaining momentum in the health and wellness world with some scientific studies confirming it may help to treat a variety of ailments like chronic pain and anxiety here are 19 health benefits of CBD oil they are backed by scientific evidence number one it can reduce acne acne is a common skin condition it affects more than 9% of the population it is thought it's caused by a number of factors such as genetics bacteria and underlying inflammation and overproduction of sebum an oily secretion made by the sebaceous glands in the skin CBD oil may help to treat acne due to its anti-inflammatory properties and its ability to reduce sebum production one test-tube study found that CBD oil prevented sebaceous gland cells from secreting excessive sebum and this has been backed up by other studies number two a natural pain reliever among the top uses of CBD is to manage chronic pain diseases like arthritis over-the-counter painkillers have harmful side effects that is liver damage and lessen suitable for prolonged use this is why many chronic pain patients are opting to shift to alternative medicine for hope the compounds in this natural oil evoke effects thus providing quick relief from inflammation in pain number three can reduce anxiety and depression according to the anxiety and depression Association of America depression affects about 6% and anxiety affects about 80 percent of the u.s. population each year research shows that CBD oil can help with both CBD has been shown to reduce levels of stress and anxiety in those suffering from conditions such as PTSD social anxiety disorder an obsessive-compulsive disorder number four it can help fight cancer CBD oils role in cancer treatment still needs more research but what is available is looking promising according to the American Cancer Society CBD oil can slow the growth and spread of some of the kinds of cancer because it fights stress and inflammation which both are linked to cancer it makes sense that CBD oil could help to fight cancer cells number five it can improve heart health a healthy diet and lifestyle is a top priority for heart health but CBD oil can also help according to research CBD oil can reduce artery blockage reduce stress induce cardiovascular response I can reduce blood pressure it may also help cholesterol number six it can promote bone health and healing in the past study on rats rats with daily CBD intake healed up to 40 percent faster than those which didn't get it another study relating to the effects of CBD on bone health concluded legions found in CBD oil regulated bone mass number seven CBD may lower diabetes risk although marijuana use is known to increase appetite in calorie intake it has been linked to lower BMI less obesity and Jews chance of diabetes in one study of nearly 5,000 adult men and women past and current marijuana users had lower fasting glucose in insulin levels by 16% lower waistline circumference and BMI and lower insulin resistance by 18 percent in higher HDL all these factors are connected to the onset of diabetes so marijuana seems to offer some protection number 8 multiple sclerosis symptoms CBD may relieve symptoms of multiple sclerosis in a study of 66 patients with MS and chronic pain a combination of CBD and THC reduce pain over two years the patients determine the dosage themselves taking in as much as they felt was needed to alleviate the pain a combination of CBD and THC helped with muscle tightness pain sleep disturbances and bladder control in 189 people with multiple sclerosis over 6 weeks number nine it can calm childhood epilepsy CBD has anti-seizure properties that have been shown to successfully treat drug resistant children who have epilepsy with no side effects in one study published in the New England Journal of Medicine CBD decreased frequency of seizures by 23 percent more than those taking a placebo number 10 inflammation public information is a huge problem in our society that contributes to many non infectious diseases including heart disease cancer Alzheimer's autoimmune disease and more and that's according to the National Center of biotechnology information research has shown that CBD oil can reduce chronic inflammation that leads to these diseases number 11 it can improve skin conditions CBD oil can be topically used to treat skin conditions studies show that CBD can help treat conditions like eczema by encouraging abnormal cell death it can also help regulate the skins oil production thus reducing acne CBD contains many nutrients like vitamin E that helps improve and protect the skin number 12 increased consciousness another benefit of using CBD is its ability to regulate dopamine levels to keep you focused on a daily chore the answers being conscious of surroundings and reduces physical pain reception a daily dose will help to keep one focus throughout the day additionally it boosts cognitive ability so that the brain is working in optimal conditions avoiding mood swings trauma and anxiety number 13 CBD can potentially benefit schizophrenia unlike its cousin THC CBD may be beneficial for preventing psychosis and reducing symptoms in schizophrenia whilst the psychoactive THC in cannabis seems to trigger psychotic episodes especially in those with schizophrenia CBD has the opposite antipsychotic effect more and more studies are pointing to CBD as a natural alternative to antipsychotic drugs but with far fewer side-effects number 14 CBD may protect against bacteria CBD showed in a recent study it can kill bacteria and mrs a which is often tricky and difficult to treat in hospital conditions number 15 it has an anti-aging effect our skin is mostly made up of cells and healthy skin relies on our body's ability to discard dead cells and replace them with new ones a study in the journal of investigative dermatology found that CBD can help this process and keep the skin looking youthful it is a powerful antioxidant helping skin to keep its elasticity number 16 it can help you quit smoking the use of CBD oil is still fairly new but a study in the u.s. National Library of Medicine found that it can help people quit smoking smokers were given an inhaler with the oil and instructed to use it for one week whenever they had the urge to smoke what they found was those who used the inhalers had a significantly reduced urge to smoke and longer had a strong craving for nicotine number-17 increases sleep longevity if you suffer from constant anxiety during the nighttime hours or suffer from insomnia or struggle from getting a restful undisturbed sleep and cannabis oil may be the solution for you the cannabis oil works by releasing the mind and body and generating a lower energy level it will be easier for you to get your heart rate down and clear your mind to allow a long in restful sleep number 18 it can relieve nausea cannabis has been used for centuries for the suppression of nausea and vomiting researchers revealed that among the more eighty CBD compounds found in marijuana both the intoxicant THC and the morning toxicant CBD helps to get rid of nausea vomitting in animal studies number 19 CBD for pets there are a plethora of benefits for pets but specifically for cats and dogs they are all similar to medical marijuana there is strong research to suggest that it can help stop seizures in animals most people utilize CBD oil for dogs to help with anxiety problems and pain relief is CBD oil safe CBD oil is generally safe and even chronic use at high doses is shown to be well tolerated by humans however you may experience some mild side effects including tiredness diarrhea dry mouth low blood pressure lightheadedness nausea although this may be due to the carrier oil used and changes in appetite and weight there may also be potential interaction with other medicines so be sure to discuss with your doctor the use of CBD oil alongside any prescription medications", "DCRihDH7vGY": "[Music] so in the cbd arena there are a lot of questions about validity of product or what's in a product so on and so forth uh one of the the best way not one of the best way but the best way is to see what the products coa is or certificate of analysis any product that you buy should have a qr code on the bottom of it this qr code simply is a reference that takes you back to the coa how do you get there if you have an iphone you can just simply just take a picture or put your uh phone over the top of the coa

you're buying it make sure that you've got a safe product you know what's in it you're looking at the qr code for the coa", "3bZb10ZxpBk": "this is not marketing prepare for learning the inside story of cannabidiol a couple of years ago a remarkable thing happened when CBD became legal in all 50 of the US states if you remove CBD from the THC coming from the cannabis plant or the hemp plant CBD is now legal to use as a nutritional supplement since that time of course the market has exploded with interest and this conversation today is about the physiological effects of CBD on the human body truly CBD is not just another nutritional supplement this short conversation is going to accurately describe the intense scientific research that's going on around the world but in simple language so that everyone in the stands of why CBD is so important for human physiology in order to comprehend the significance of CBD to our health we first have to ask the simple question what exactly is our health is it just the absence of disease if you don't have symptoms you must be healthy well it's actually far more important question and a deeper question than just that how does human physiology actually work how is it designed in general every aspect of human physiology is based on the balance between polar opposites between the yin and the yang this creates homeostasis when we look at specific parts of our physiology like the immune system the yin and the yang the opposites would be anti inflammation and inflammation the negative and the positive when those two things are imbalanced your immune system is functioning properly if we're talking about our nervous system then we're talking about the forces of excitation and the forces of inhibition or relaxation when we're talking about our endocrine system or our hormone system we have the forces of breaking down tissue or the catabolic hormones and we have the anabolic hormones we build up tissue when those two forces are in balance we have homeostasis of our endocrine our hormone system if we're talking about oxidation we have forces of antioxidant and forces of oxidation most people think that you have to just take buckets full of antioxidants all the time as if oxidation is bad not true if you didn't have oxidation and the forces of oxidation in your bodies you couldn't survive even one minute those two things have to be in balance they have to be in homeostasis all of our physiological systems have to be in this constant state of homeostasis a dynamic balance the stronger your physiologies ability to stay in homeostasis is there were more robust your capacity to be in homeostasis is the healthier you are next question what exactly is dynamic balance this is kind of difficult to understand and the best way is a model a model of a mobile so here we go we're looking at a mobile you've probably played with this when you were a kid perhaps you even have some of these in your home right now we have all of these horizontal elements with little strings hanging down from them and we have these stars hanging at the bottom in this particular model the stars represent signaling molecules if this is a model of your neurology the stars that are hanging would be the neurotransmitters if this was a mobile of your endocrine system your hormone system then the hanging stars would be hormones and if this was your immune system the hanging stars would be cytokines or lymphokines these are the signaling molecules that make your immune system work now what makes us a dynamic balance is as you know if you change anything in this mobile it affects everything in this mobile let's say for example that the star down here at the bottom that's now big and swollen and red gets weighted down as if you took a paper clip or some weight and attached it to the mobile hanging in your home that star is going to pull down and everything in the mobile is going to you can't change any one element without affecting every element and a mobile what's interesting however is that initially the mobile is going to go through these oscillations where things are bouncing up and down and shifting up and down until the oscillations slowly quiet and the mobile finds a new point of homeostasis a new point of balance now everything is shifted in the mobile the stars are all in different locations now and many of the sticks are no longer horizontal they're kind of twisted at one angle or another but our physiologies are so smart that they will find a new point of balance during the shifting and the oscillation is when you feel sick when you have symptoms but our body our physiology will compensate and the new balance will be found and you can continue to function now let me explain how modern medicine with pharmaceutical drugs interacts with this system let's say you have another one of these stars another one of these elements that goes a little bit haywire this star over here on the left so you're feeling lousy and you go to the doctor and the doctor does some kind of test and decides okay we need to give you a drug and so you take a drug some kind of pharmaceutical drug to deal with this one element over here on the left that's now gone somewhat haywire and the drug is designed to clamp down on those symptoms notice that the drug is designed to deal with exactly that one star not the entire system with a mobile but that one star and the symptoms that it's creating however we know that pharmaceutical drugs have many many unintended side effects and so because of the drug you're taking now another star goes haywire and you have more symptoms and now you have to take a drug to counteract the symptoms on their first drug and so you clamp down on that star as well and then a third one goes haywire and so you clamp down on that one as well and let's say now you seem to be stable you seem to be functioning and everything is copasetic well is it really everything seems to be stable here because the mobile isn't shifting anymore but let's take a closer look at your system this is what's actually happening you now have all sorts of artificial weights attached to your physiology to your mobile you can see that your physiology is under a lot of stress the weight of all these different drugs and these overexpressed stars are pulling down heavily on this mobile and you can see that some of those bars are now bent because they're under so much tension one more little thing going wrong with your physiology perhaps it's something as simple as a cold or a little virus or some kind of drug interaction that you didn't anticipate and now something breaks this system is under so much tension in somewhat stress that the oscillations would be huge and you might find yourself in the ICU under life support so in a nutshell pharmaceutical drugs work at the level of the symptoms not the systems which causes enormous strain on your human physiology so I've showed you this in order to point out to highlight the differences between how pharmaceutical drugs work at the level of the stars and how CBD works CBD instead of working at the level of the stars works at the level of the system of balance at the Nexus of balance that would be in these crystalline green orbs where the where the string attaches to the stick that's where the system knows if it's in balance or out of balance it can't tell what's happening at the level of the star but it knows what's happening right there in that green crystal and orb where balance is maintained and established so in the model that we are using the mobile to highlight how our physiology works that's where CBD works now in our actual physiology where does CBD work let's take a closer look here we go we're gonna travel into our physiology right into our central nervous system and we're going to see at the level of in cells that the cell surface is covered with these green receptors these are receptors for CBD and when the CBD binds to that receptor it sends a message into the cell which travels all the way down into the nucleus of the cell where the intelligence of our entire physiology is contained within our chromosomes so here a chromosome is going to unwind and you're going to see the actual DNA that contains the codes for everything that our body does this is like the software that runs our physiology genes are the codes for every protein that our bodies make including all the signaling molecules that run our physiology such as our neurotransmitters that run our nervous system our hormones that run our endocrine system and our cytokines that run our immune system so imagine for instance that these are cells in your pancreas making insulin this is happening in a million cells let's say all producing huge amounts of insulin to keep your blood Sugar's in proper balance again your insulin is a hormone which is a protein so we see that throughout our physiology we have receptors specifically designed to bind with CBD and CBD has its effect on the nucleus of our cells where proteins are being made so which proteins are being made from the influence of CBD CBD modulates the transcriptions of over 1,100 genes that make the signaling molecules that naturally reduce inflammation in our central nervous system and throughout our immune system restoring homeostasis to both our immune and to our central nervous systems so as you can see on the left side of the slide CBD up regulates the genes that create anti-inflammatory bio chemicals for our immune system and up regulates the GABA system in our central nervous system which brings calmness to our central nervous and on the right side of the slide we can see that CBD down regulates the genes that create the inflammatory bio chemicals in our immune system and also down regulates the glutamate system in our central nervous system which causes over excitation so now let's go back to the model of our physiology and see how CBD affects it we go back to our one star that's out of whack and now we introduce CBD and voila we see a cascade going through all the points of balance in our system and the mobile comes back to homeostasis to its original stable beautiful balance now our physiological systems are far more complex in a simple mobile that I've been showing you here with only 12 stars for instance our immune system has 350 different signaling molecules on it so it's an enormous mobile which also explains why there's so many unintended drug interactions because if you affect any one of those little stars it's going to shift all 350 of those other stars and who could possibly figure that out so in fact here's what our immune system actually looks like and of course when you introduce CBD to our amazingly complex physiology in the immune system the Cascade of homeostasis trickles down through all 350 of those stars it's a beautiful thing bottom line CBD causes a cascade of homeostasis through our entire central nervous system in our entire immune system so why is this happening because as I mentioned before we have receptors in our physiology for CBD this is called the endocannabinoid system back in medical school we didn't even know about the endocannabinoid system it was only discovered in the 1990s by dr. raphaela shulam from the Hebrew University in Israel where an amazing amount of incredible biomedical nology and innovations are coming from that tiny little country so the endocannabinoid system is a network of cells throughout our body that have receptors for CBD in fact there are more receptors for CBD in our body than any other kind of receptor so the endocannabinoid system is truly the largest network of its kind throughout our entire physiology among other things dr. McCollum also discovered that we make our own cannabinoids in our body this is an and amide and two AG an and amide is something that we create when we're meditating hence it's called the Bliss molecule and two AG as well as an and amide are released in mother's milk when a child is breastfeeding so no wonder that child is so calm and happy when they're breastfeeding those two compounds are also associated with a runner's high you know that point when you're running and suddenly you're in bliss you kind of break through the wall and now you just feel wonderful those two are natural cannabinoids that our own bodies make and bind to our CBD receptors so here we have our CBD receptors in our central nervous system and in our cardiovascular system we're immune cells are constantly circulating of course in our bone marrow where the cells are actually manufactured and of course in our immune organs our major moving organs are the intestines the spleen and the bladder and last but not least the lymph system so our bodies are filled with CBD receptors so what now you know the story why is this important why is this matter why is this important to you or me or if you're interested in the business of distributing CPD why is this important to humanity if you live in urban America or urban anywhere in the world you are inflamed your central nervous system is inflamed as well as your immune system is inflamed and nobody is exempt because our physiological systems are under assault assault from environmental toxins such as herbicide insecticides and heavy metals chronic biological infection such as bacteria viruses fungus and molds and last but not least are inflammatory diets which are very poor usually way too much sugar which causes leaky gut and inflamed gut that allows certain bacterial infections to occur that gets into our blood into our systems so what kind of symptoms what kind of stress do all these things cause to us if your immune system is inflamed you might be suffering from autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis inflamed bowel disease lupus and thyroid or fibromyalgia or even MS and your skin psoriasis and eczema and all sorts of other chronic infections do you realize many of these things didn't even exist a hundred 150 years ago incidents of these kind of diseases is growing throughout the last century because of the environmental load of toxins that we are now absorbing into our systems now let's take a look at your central nervous system if it is inflamed what kind of things might you be suffering from brain fog migraines epilepsy anxiety and PTSD ad D ADHD autism and insomnia again a hundred or 150 years ago these kind of symptoms these kind of diseases were really rare and over the last hundred and fifty years because of the insult the ongoing insult to our systems these kind of things are more more prevalent with every single year so if you are suffering from any of these conditions any of these symptoms CBD might provide you with tremendous healing tremendous relief right through your own natural endocannabinoid system that brings homeostasis both to your immune system and to your central nervous system so in conclusion what have we learned from this conversation that health is achieved through physiological homeostasis right through our natural endocannabinoid systems and therefore

selecting hemp cbd products and determining dosing there are many variables to consider because everyone's body chemistry is different our best suggestion is to start with a small dose or micro dose and work your way up to preferred results individuals can discover what works for them through titration and experimentation journals are an excellent way for you to track experiences through documentation of what has worked well titration is a great way for a person like yourself to find your optimal dose titration means to start small and gradually increase your dosage over time if you think your body size or weight is a factor when taking cbd you would be mistaken the sensations or tangible benefits found from using cbd is affected more or less by the sensitivity of your receptors if you don't feel results overnight be patient your body may benefit from accumulated use it can take up to three to four weeks for your body to adjust and integrate into your endocannabinoid system

mainly made up of cbd but also you'll find trace amounts of cbg cbc cb and so on and so forth you'll also find typically terpenes and flavonoids that are added into the whole cocktail to make kind of a bouquet if you will then the full spectrum product is if you would take that same bouquet of molecules and then add it to its uh some delta nine thc federally the product can't contain more than

health food store they sell these capsules and they also sell this press right here so the capsules cost like a dollar you got like 200 oh and this cost about $10 money well spent let me tell you so all you're gonna do is you take your capsules okay your tops you put your bottoms in this really can't get any easier and the best part about this is these friggin things work you you can make your oil as strong as you want and then you can really really hone in on how strong is my caps and you you can really master this so you get it all filled out and it'll come back in a set but say if you don't have one of these fancy presses which isn't that fancy or expensive but you just you know you're not gonna spend the money it's just you don't you don't see the point so you could what you could do is get a bowl of sugar and say you take your tops put your tops to the side and then you just stick the bottoms into the sugar or the salt and it works pretty perfectly you'll lose say if you do about a hundred you're probably gonna lose a good 15 in falling and just not just whatever but that's not that bad and on the other half you're gonna put your tops so what's gonna happen is we're gonna put or oil and then we're gonna spread it around it's gonna fill up the caps perfectly and then we're gonna put this top on and then squeeze and then when you squeeze they all perfectly become capsules it's amazing and the best part is you give it to one of your friends or or a different medical patient they're gonna look at you like you're just how did you do that so before you go any further you really want to make sure that each one has a capsule in it because if you miss I'm just gonna have oil everywhere and you get a waste of money and you're gonna be pissed so next you take your card so I'm gonna take it I'm gonna pour it in a center round a little square and it'll disperse around and the best part about this thing is if you do too much oil you just pour it right back into your glass so you just spread it around so a little excess oil that I got all right so now I'm gonna take my tops and I'm gonna sit it on top and this is where you really got to be focused when I say really got you focused I mean not really but just squeezed evenly is really what I'm trying to tell you so you're gonna take it and give it a nice squeeze make sure it's all in then boom got canvas castles oh now you can go to work boom boom boom you know no big deal and now ain't no big deal but they work they look great and this is exactly what we're going we're not going for half-assed you know edibles that kind of work like we want stuff that's gonna work so give me a little close-up well thanks guys for watching like how easy was that get yourself out there instead of making cookies or being boring with your oil do something different make some capsules and and you're gonna find that you love these things because I know I did but if you liked what you saw today don't forget to check me out on Instagram at the NJ chef and as always smoke [Music]", "627VyVGmXis": "hello one and all um welcome to this presentation that i'm doing on behalf of acm global laboratories i'm mira doig from um abs laboratories and i'm the by analytical technical director right today i'm actually going to cover some of the areas that i think are very important and that is the risks of the lack of regulation of using cannabidiol in vaping devices and how we at acm global laboratories can help you increase the information you have about these products both in efficacy and safety of this route of administration i will then overview the experience we have quantifying a range of cannabinoids in biological fluids and finally i will tell you about acm capabilities of supporting any clinical trial worldwide and they have been doing this since 1975. right to go into my hobby horse cannabidiol and vaping and the reason for my hobby horse is because we have supported a lot of work on nicotine and e-cigarettes and e-cigarette devices as we all know there are many historical reports indicating that cannabis based extracts containing a whole host of cannabinoids inc including cbd have therapeutic properties but to date the only registered medicine is epidialx now epidiolex is an oral solution for severe epilepsy in children and unfortunately the bioavailability of cbd via this oral route is only about six percent over the years recreational use has indicated that cbd is safe and likely to have many therapeutic uses and we also know the pharmacological effects of the psychoactive ingredient in cannabis base extracts tetrahydrocannabinol or thc is also highly bioavailable when smoking and it increases the bioavailability of cannabinoids at least to 30 percent unfortunately to date there's no records or reports in the literature of any bioavailability or clinical studies using vaping devices but there is a whole host of cbd e-liquids commercially available worldwide and also people are using any sort of vaping device to administer these cbd liquids and these are normally developed for nicotine administration rather than cbd so as i've just said there is a whole host of commercial interest in preparing cbd vaping fluids but there's very little or no regulations covering the production of these fluids what solvents you're allowed to add to these fluids or their associated develop delivery devices in contrast the food standards agency has just given cbd companies a deadline of the end of march to have a validated novel food applications submitted for each of their products if they've added cbd to foods or drinks after this date only products that have been thoroughly tested and applied for this application will be allowed to remain on the market and i'm sure very soon that um vaping fluids will have similar sort of regulations now why is this well basically cannabidiol is very unstable and is prone to oxidation even in alcoholic solutions the red molecules on the structure associated on this slide is hydroxyl groups and these are where they're oxidated both for light and temperature sensitivity and in some solutions especially if there's any aqueous present cbd can break down to a myriad of compounds in a matter of days and also what's the stability like when you've added all these additives that people are adding to these e fluids such as vitamin e acetate and various flavors etc one group in italy looked at the cbd content in 13 commercially available e-liquids what they did was they examined how the content matched the label and also they did an experiment of the stability of cbd in the solvent the main solvent they said of all these products was propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin but unfortunately they didn't mention in this publication what other additives were added to these e-fluids the cbd concentration in the individual fluids ranged from 10 to 100 milligram per ml and here are some of the results where they assayed the cbd content in these 13 e fluids unfortunately five of the samples were underestimated for their cbd content and it ranged from 11 to 92 percent five of the samples were within plus or minus ten percent and another three were overestimated for the cbd content by 13 to 17 now at the moment what you should have in labels is that the concentration matches the actual content of the material within plus or minus two percent so basically 30 all 13 products did not meet these regulatory guidelines then they conducted their stability experiment looking at stability either refrigerated room temperature or at 37 degrees and you can see the data on this slide that really refrigerated storage was the best way of storing these e-fluids as the cbd content within a month only decreased by about five percent whereas the decrease of cbd content increased with increasing temperature in addition light instability was demonstrated yet on any of these e-fluids there was no recommendation on the label to store refrigerated or in the dark they were even given expiry dates of 12 months but goodness knows what the content of cbd or the other materials in these e-fluids was like at the end of that 12 months i'm sure there was no formal stability data done on that and the vials that some of these are prepared in not only are they clear glass rather than brown glass they don't recommend storing in the dark so as i've mentioned before there really is a whole host of lack of regulation of these fluids even though they're commercially available there's also a lack of control of the vaping devices to deliver these fluids and how this affects the health of the users there's no published data on the bioavailability of cbd with differing vaping temperatures or devices people just seem to be using nicotine vaping devices and i know our experience with measuring the bioavailability of nicotine that it can be affected with various designs of vaping temperatures and devices no one's actually demonstrated medical efficacy using vaping devices either and none of the devices are registered as a medical device to deliver cbd increasingly over the last year there have been lots of deaths registered and lung damage in people vaping with cannabinoids and this appears to be far higher than any of the nicotine e-liquids so again this is all evidence that we must start to regulate cbd vaping fluids now how can partnering with acm help you with getting a strategic advantage of getting some data on the bioavailability and safety of your vaping solutions or developing a vaping delight device specifically for cbd first of all we can support your bioavailability studies so that you can generate a device that is designed to efficiently develop deliver cbd and then after you've done that you can conduct clinical studies to obtain both safety and efficacy data for cbd or any of the other cannabinoids as well so this is what we call adding value to your cannabinoid containing product abs is the division of acm global laboratories and we have experience assaying a variety of cannabinoids such as cbd cbdv and thcv now the structure on this side is actually of thc and thcv is actually the c3 hydrocarbon rather than the c5 hydrocarbon shown on this structure we also have an off the shelf say to our say cbd thc and 11 hydroxy thc in plasma to support regulatory pre-clinical and clinical studies and we have the experience of supporting various cutting-edge therapeutics such as sativets through the whole r d process other areas that we have supported in the past and can support in the future is looking at cannabinoids in food drinks cosmetics and other topical products as i've mentioned before we have this off the shelf assay for cbd thc and the pharmacologically active metabolite of thc 11 hydroxy thc initially the assay was using gas chromatography mass spectrometry but as the technology advanced we have now transferred this assay to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry using the latest mass spectrometer from a b science we have a method that's validated from 50 picograms to 100 nanogram per mil now many people ask me well what does that mean in real situation and why do you need this high the sophisticated equipment to measure these levels well basically one nanogram per ml is equivalent to two bottles of wine in all the world's oceans which is why it's really looking for a needle in a haystack when you're quantifying these low levels in biological fluids hence you need this technology and sophisticated mothers methods to actually measure these compounds we've also got stability so we can advise you on how to collect the samples store the samples and ship them for analysis other assays that we've got are for measuring the major metabolite in urine of thc which is 11-carboxy thc and we've supported quite a bit of research into comparing cannabinoid administration to the known endocannabinoids in our plasma it is thought that in several illnesses and things our endocannabinoid levels decrease which is why things like cbd help so um we have assays for anandamide and 2ag these are the endocannabinoids that are known to be effective in our body right so all i've got on this slide is really a case study of how we supported sativex for gw pharmaceuticals now sativex is another cannabinoid that is registered on the market it was registered by the european medical agency in 2010 for the help in multiple cirrhosis for spasticity i.e the the tightening of muscles that happens in multiple sclerosis and also for using cancer pain so as you can see from this slide we have supported multiple pre-clinical and clinical studies all the way through to registration of this medicine so with all this experience how can we support vaping studies while our chemists are dedicated in providing exceptional services and information and assurances we have reliable cannabinoid assays that are validated to fda and ema guidance we can also give you guidance regarding sample collection as it's easy to contaminate the samples especially when you're doing inhalation or topical administration studies and once we've got the samples and we've associated them we can give you the results and interpret the data for you in addition what we can do is give you the whole service of supplying you with sample collection kits logistics and central laboratory services in the next few slides i'm going to go into more detail of how we can support the whole clinical study for you as i've just mentioned we have complete central laboratory services from sample draw sample receipt to sample analysis results reporting and storage of samples and what can we do with these samples what when we've got them well as i've mentioned before we can analyze the cannabinoids and we've got a lot of pka by analysis experience over the last 20 years in our pk lab which is good laboratory practice and good clinical practice accredited so we've actually analyzed all sorts of different pharmaceutical products in this laboratory in addition if you're looking at how efficacious a cannabinoid is in a particular area such as pain or inflammation for example cbd is thought to be anti-inflammatory so what you can do with your samples is we can look at the levels of inflammatory cytokines in these samples both before and after administration of cbd so you've actually got some physical data to back up what you think it is good for in this slide i've also summarized our experience in nicotine and smoking and why we really feel that the time has come that people must look at more regulation and analysis around cbd and vaping and in the last column i've also summarized what our central laboratory can do for you as far as safety testing so here is just a slide showing the company history acm was actually formed in 1975 and has gradually expanded both geographically as well as functionally by strategic acquisition over the years and the pk laboratory abs was actually acquired in june 2018 this slide just shows you the global footprint of acm global laboratories you can see we have worldwide coverage but the two main laboratory facilities are actually in york in the uk and in rochester new york state in the u.s and we have other facilities in india singapore and china and this is our values our corporate values that are called epic basically we want to get things right first time every time and people are our priority whether they be patients customers partners or our own team members we try and be high in integrity and transparency when we're talking with everybody so that we can build trust with our customers and give you confidence in working with us and like i've done today we like to challenge the status quo and hopefully educate and innovate for the good of clinical development so my little presentation has come to the end hopefully i've highlighted to you the lack of pharmacokinetic information for cbd especially when it's administered by the vaping route so if you feel that you want any more information please ask me now or do not hesitate to go to our booth and speak to our colleagues and i'd like to thank you for your attention thank you", "JgXKo8O-7BI": "[Music] hello everyone today we will be uncrating and installing the aries FF II [Music] as soon as you receive your crate inspect the crate check the shock watch and the tip and tell if the shock watch indicates read please contact capita immediately if the tip until has blue beads in the arrow please contact captain immediately start by undoing the screws from the front face of the crate work your way around the whole front face you will need a ladder make sure someone is supporting the ladder for you be sure to have the person who is supporting you hold the face of the crate while you are under Lee [Music] [Music] after you and drill the front side of the crate using two people take off the front wall [Music] once the crate is opened up start underling the black shipping clamps [Music] once all the shipping claps are undrilled remove them from the frame of the area [Music] you may now remove the boxes using a forklift you will now Center the forks in the middle of the machine to take it out it is recommended to use a blanket or some type of cloth to avoid any scratches on the frame of the Aries lift up then pull the system out [Music] [Music] once you get the areas out of the crate move the crate away as you will now begin the installation process [Music] the first thing to do is leveling the system use a level and put it on top of the pressure clamp on the heat exchanger if the system is not level using a wrench turn the leg levelers clockwise recommended a half turn to a full turn on each way [Music] [Music] after you complete the turns expect the level loop if it is not level continue to adjust until the system is fully level [Music] after the system is leveled take your diaphragm pumped out of the box take off the two white caps and attach on the 3/8 inch nipples for the exhaust and the connection [Music] place the pump on the vacuum stand located the Rebbe to the west of the steam generator be sure to have the power cord connection of the pump on the back side of the pump stand plug the power cord into the pump take your 25 gallon internal tank that comes with the system and place it in front of the vacuum [Music] using your 3/8 inch silicone tubing connect one tube into the bottom of the FMO receiving side glass [Music] take the other end of the hose and connect it onto the 3-inch barb we'll get on the 25 gallon tank directly underneath the ball down with your second piece of silicon tubing attach one end to the half-inch nipple that is attached to the 3/4 inch tri clamp on the 25 gallon tank using the other end of the silicon tubing attached it to the 3/8 inch in the barb on the right side of the fun [Music] you will now attach the feet hose take the feed filter and attach it onto the quarter-inch breda tube using the other ends attach it onto the backside of the flow meter connection [Music] using a flathead screwdriver open the control panel once you open the control panel it would turn on the proper breakers in the panel to provide power to the system you will turn on the top right breaker the top left breakers and then the bottom three breakers labeled as steam system vacuum pump and feed inlet close the panel back up and lock it with the ginger [Music] connect your three quarter-inch F NPT connections into the water lines in the back of the system tighten them down with the wrench [Music] the water inlet is the left input and the water outlet is the right input [Music] [Music] using soft sand water both add a tank up 90% you can use the sight glass on the left side of the tank for a visual once the tank is filled up attached a 3-inch lid and try clamp it back on [Music] [Music] thank you for watching if you have any questions please visit our cap and a website and welcome to the Kappa family [Music]", "8H9zrtU3r2w": "hey everyone my name is jenna i'm coming in here to talk to you guys about anxiety today now personally this is something i've struggled with since i've been a small child and i'm sure everyone watching this video has dealt with it at some point in life whether it's you know chronic and you deal with it every day or it's something that comes up that's situational especially with all the changes that are going on on in the world i thought it'd be really kind of beneficial to chat about it and kind of give some tools and tips that have helped me my kids my clients um and all that stuff so let me dive right into it now if you're dealing with kind of anxiety that's right in the moment like you're really hyped up it's really stressful your panic and all that stuff it's really important kind of break that energy in which when you're in that moment in that mindset it's really really hard to do so something that i really focus on that helps me and you know i've given and helped my children with and all that stuff is working with your five senses so your sight your smell your hair your taste and your touch now for me um smell is really something that i go to so it's either either i'm opening up the front door and breathing in that fresh air or kind of working with an essential oil my favorite go-to is vanilla because for me it's just really calming lots of people like to use lavender but again everyone's different with what tool and tip works for them um also listening to something you know you know it could be chanting meditation or even hip-hop and your you know your favorite song that you just want to kind of break it down to and kind of like just get out of that anxious state and that focus where your mind's at um taste is also a really good one either it's um something healthy or something really comforting to you to kind of just instead of focusing on the anxious energy and thoughts going to your senses whatever is working for you also touch is a really good thing for me it's something always soft some people use kind of a hard texture or a rough texture to kind of break up that anxious energy to something else but you know i always say use what works for you everyone's different everyone has different you know stressors and anxiety and situational you know things that come up that bring it to you so it's really important that you kind of fill your toolbox with what works for you now if you're dealing with anxiety like every day whether it's you know kind of not not you're not in panic mode but it's more kind of baseline there and it just it's just what your your system is it's really important to kind of get out of that funk or that you know cycle is going back to the basics and when i say basics is really self-care basics now for me you know that's working on my my sleep working on my healthy intake hydration mindset and a few things that you can do with that is like when you're going to have a shower simple things not complicated and all that stuff but simple things when you're going to have a shower visualize that shower the water coming down is cleansing it cleansing your mind body soul and just really kind of washing away that stressful energy and just kind of letting it you know rinse cleanse all that stuff another thing is listening to meditations when you're you're when you're trying to sleep at night and your your mind's racing put on a meditation i always say guided meditation um because then you're not sitting there trying to think of what think or what not to think about guided meditation kind of makes you focus on their voice and what they're visualizing for me at night time i love somatic drumming that really and the guided meditation behind it it really kind of suits my soul also with hydration make sure you're drinking enough water that is easy to stay but you know it's really hard sometimes for people some people don't like the taste of water and then you can infuse your water with fresh fruits if you don't like that go to a pure juice and kind of infuse your water with that um what else healthy eating you know you don't have to dive in and be like clear out everything and go full hard in but you know have a smoothie in the morning if you don't like smoothies have a salad but just something basic to try to get your system back on a healthier path because living with that anxious energy all the time is really really hard on your system and your mindset um something that's really helped me throughout the year is this personal development listening to podcasts or um or audiobooks i'm not really like i can't really sit there and read a book i'm a mom of three kids can't i don't have time to do that but listening to an audiobook or a podcast while i'm going throughout my day really is helpful you know it kind of really takes me on a different path and it's also very healing um also you know exercise if you can't go out and you know lift weights at the gym or whatever put on a youtube go stretch it out put on music and just dance something to really elevate um your vibrations and kind of shift that energy anxious energy into something that anxious energy wants to move it doesn't really want to sit there too much if you're during the day um it wants to move so it's either dancing cleaning something like that um also really working on your environment if you're in a cluttered environment you know your system is going to kind of react to that if you have a calm clear clean environment your system is going to automatically feel a little bit calmer so again don't fully overwhelm yourself just take baby steps little baby steps because if you think of a ladder right i always give this analogy if you think of a ladder letters have little kind of baby steps to get up if you take those baby steps out of the ladder you're going to have a really hard time to get up there and it's not going to be stable and safe so take those little baby steps and appreciate acknowledge them appreciate them put your blinders on to other people and what they're doing and really focus on your journey and celebrate your baby steps um now one thing for me that's really helped when i was in a really anxious stressed out kind of i'd say dark moment in life um i was really looking for something to help soothe me you know i've tried lots of things and and it just wasn't working so i did turn to cbd oil and the reason why i picked thought cloud basically because there's so many cbd oils on the market right like you could feel overwhelmed of what to pick what's good what's not the reason why i picked um thought cloud is because right away you know i'm a researcher i went and looked on their website and right away um i saw it was reconfused now for me you know someone who is going to get um and going on my reiki journey and becoming a reiki master i saw the recant fuse i'm like whoa you know alignment okay let me look into this company and then i saw you know their reports and how pure and amazing their product is another thing that really kind of got me in there is the owner of the company leo he would go on on live on his instagram or make videos and talk about his day talk about things that he's struggled with and how he's overcome them um and it was really kind of i really enjoyed you know look i looked forward watching his videos every day and kind of connecting with him you know when you look at somebody in the eyes you connect to their soul and their energy and i just i felt like all of those things kind of aligned for me and that was the right company to go go with and i'm so glad i did because three years later i'm still using their products now the main reason why i'm using their products on top of those things are their products are good they work so it's kind of like you know a no-brainer there all those things that made me think okay let me try this company and then you know three years deep and i'm still going hard with them because it's something that i include in my daily practice with nighttime i take their nighttime series that really help kind of calm me and help me sleep so yeah i hope those tips were helpful um if you want to connect and reach out to me i'm on instagram my instagram is optimal journey i also have another instagram that's skin care beauty diy and also if you're looking into you know getting some thought cloud products and testing them out my discount code um for you to save money is discount code skin really simple skin that's it um and yeah so hopefully this video was helpful for you i'm looking forward to whoever wants to connect and reach out and just you know wishing you all the best and namaste thank you you"}
