{"GikNE5vlWlc": "hey coffee lovers mark and aj here from whole latte love today we want to show you four of our favorite coffees um so we'll talk about we got i have two that are very much at opposite ends of the spectrum yours are maybe a little closer probably a little closer yeah and you know as we go through the video here we'll talk a little bit about growing altitude and how that affects coffee uh talk about blends and origins and and all that kind of stuff we did put up a couple we've got we and we also got kind of opposite ends of the spectrum as far as machines here just to kind of you know uh you know what coffee you might start with on this and what coffee you might want to use over here although you can get great results uh on either side if you know what you're doing and we certainly can help you with that so aj let's start with you so what do you have over here your two favorites for today so i'll start here this is the carraro tatsudoro and we actually so we put out a full video of the the carraro line about a month ago and i'll put a link down in the description to that but this was my favorite of the bunch by far and i've been drinking it every day since then making americana with it i've also had it in milk drinks and it's to me it's kind of like the all-around crowd pleaser it's going to taste great to someone who's coming for more of an italian style bean blend but also someone who's used to specialty coffees that has that kind of brightness up front um but then mellows out into a more rounded rounded uh taste in the end so this one for me is great for for everyone for everyone yeah and i'm gonna go with my crowd pleaser now if you okay you've been watching my videos at all you know i've loved this coffee for years i drink a lot of uh classic style italian bean blends and this is just my favorite i always recommend it you know if you're starting out in espresso and you want to have great easy results and great flavor um maroma's orphia that's that's the one so it's great like if you're starting out on a machine like the gaggia classic but you could certainly throw it on the synchronicity there's no reason you can't um it makes a lot of cremate it's got the classic uh you know the classic flavors in it you know it's got that chocolate it's got awesome reviews hundreds and hundreds of reviews i'm not the only one who likes this stuff no hundreds of reviews rates 4.5 out of 5 stars one of our top selling coffees and if you haven't ever tried this and you like that classic italian style bean blend this is a great one to try it's not bitter at all it really comes out real nice so those are kind of and those these are coffees these two on the ends here are ones that don't really have to be super fresh right yeah yeah i mean you can you can drink these for they're designed as being blended as their preparation and storage methods to have a longer shelf life and sit on your shelf for a month or longer if necessary yeah many months really yeah and the best place in our opinion to store these kinds of coffees is right where they come yep yeah the roasters bag if you've got a one-way valve on there and you seal it up nicely that's going to work fine if you want to take it a step farther we do sell coffee vacs or other airtight containers that'll really you can keep the uv light out you can keep the air out and they'll last for for a long time so you're you're higher-end coffee and you use this you did a really cool video tell us about that yes coffee speaking of storage methods i actually did an experiment using the fuego ethiopia where i tracked its extraction fresh from roast five days after roast for 30 days looking at how extraction time and taste and appearance changed and then also comparing it to the different storage methods if you want to check out that video i'll also put a link in the description to that but it definitely had some some interesting results and this is a high altitude coffee and you know just a little bit about growing altitudes right and coffee it's just kind of generalizing here but does he go up right it's going to be a little bit cooler so the coffee's going to grow in a cooler environment it's going to grow more slowly and concentrate the idea is so usually in some of these high altitude cops you can see smaller beans in there because they're growing more slowly and concentrating more flavor in each bean yeah that's how that works and this type of bean like we said the others were kind of the all-around crowd pleaser these are going to be more for the kind of coffee specialist the people that are used to the the kind of higher end single origin type things it'll be brighter maybe a little sour a little acidity some fruit flavor fruit forward flavors maybe a little lighter you won't necessarily get the thick gobby crema in your cup um it'll be a little thinner coming out as you extract it but for those people that have a refined taste these are really the way to go so let me talk about mine right so i've got the shirt on this is from joe bean roasters now we work together on joe bean uh on this espresso blend um over a number of months did a lot of tasting and and and really refined what we uh what we wanted in this coffee and we're really pleased with the results um again these two are specialty coffees yes we're talking you know in 10 11 a pound on these and these are probably double that yeah but worth a try right so um what one thing i like here so this one it all comes from our side of the world it's central america columbia coffee um what i like on this now you don't have to stick to this but on this blend so you're going to see the roaster here what they've done is kind of tell you know what you can expect flavor-wise but what i like is they suggest they give you a starting point at least for an extraction here so 18 grams of coffee 200 degree fahrenheit brew water um a 40 second extraction going to talk about that in a second and 42 grams out so they're giving you a brew ratio so this is a little beyond you know the typical starting point one to two ratio of of coffee to expresso out um but that 40 second extraction right we're always talking about dialing in a coffee and you know we're in that 25 30 second range when you're dialing in and the roaster here says they like this extracted at about 40 seconds at that ratio now that doesn't mean you have to do it there right and in fact we did some more tasting with this this morning and what was your opinion yeah so we tried it with the manufacturer's recommendations and it was great and you could really taste that that's what they intended for but then just to experiment we tried a little bit uh coarser grind and a little bit faster extraction so we did more of a standard one to two ratio got 18 in 36 out in around 30 seconds instead of 40. and that brightened it up a lot so you could taste that kind of a hit of a little bit sour but a little bit bright up front which i preferred but it's nice that they give that recommendation to a starting point for that and they did say cherry and peach yeah flavors which we definitely got yeah but you know a lot of if you're newer to coffee really you got cherries in there and right i'll tell you i've had yoga chefs and this is a nice one i've had some that are just like bursting with blueberries it's just amazing so yeah i get like grapefruit from this grapefruit from this one yeah so again those two of our favorites very much at the opposite end of the spectrum um again highly reviewed or orphea coffee one of my favorites easy to work with not bitter it's a great classic italian style bean blend then uh you know the espresso blend here a specialty one it's gonna be higher altitude coffee it's gonna be much lighter again and these you know you're not gonna get the goopy gobs of crema and that kind of thing out of those so and wrap up yours for us one more time yeah so the caro tatsudoro all around great coffee great as espresso great as americano great as latte a little cheaper than some of the higher end stuff and then you go up to the fuego ethiopia for the kind of mature espresso taste i don't i probably wouldn't put in a latte i'm sure some people do but i like it more kind of straight to really let those flavors uh come out oh and one more thing you know a lot again if you're newer to coffee i just want to talk because some people think there are espresso beans there's not right you can take any of these coffees and use any methods you want to brew them now they might do better for you and one or the other i mean i love the orpheus a long coffee or as an espresso and it really works well in milk and i do americanos with these a lot and i do it with this too so it doesn't have to be espresso right so all right guys thanks for checking out some of our favorite coffees do give them a try um aj thank you for yours i'm mark from whole lotte love if you love this stuff do subscribe to the channel and we hope you come back soon for more of the best on everything coffee brought to you by whole latte love you", "5uT5_IWWb00": "We're going to cut straight to the chase. Should you store your\ncoffee in the freezer? Maybe, let's get into this\nin a little bit more detail. Talk about when it's\ngood to use the freezer to store coffee, and really when it's not. To start with let's talk about why you might\nwant to store your coffee in the freezer. Very cold temperatures are great at slowing certain\nkinds of reactions involved in things going stale. Freezer temperatures slow down oxidation, they prevent the loss of\nvolatile aromatic compounds. They just generally slow\nat the staling process. Now, most domestic freezers\ndon't go cold enough to completely stop that process. I think the research done by a sort of famed coffee\nscientist, engineer, roaster builder, Mike , said that you needed to\nstore coffee at minus 40. That magical temperature where it doesn't matter what\nunits you're talking about. Anyway, most domestic freezers live at about minus 20 degrees Celsius. That's good enough to help slow the process\nquite dramatically. Freezers, however, have a problem. They are incredibly dry places. And those kinds of temperatures, moisture can't stay in the air. It comes out of the air\nand forms ice crystals. If you've ever owned a freezer, you'll have seen that happen and you'll know that\nfreezers need deicing. All of that ice, all of that\nbuildup has come from the air. Now, how does that affect coffee? Well, in an ideal world, we could put coffee in our freezer and it would slow down the staling and that would be great. What we want to do, however, is really limit the interaction between the coffee beans that are now minus 20 degrees\nCelsius and any kind of air. What you don't want to do, is this. You don't want to go\nand buy a big Kilo bag and put the whole bag in the freezer, and then every morning get the bag out, get your coffee out, put the bag back in the freezer. Because all you're gonna do is introduce lots of fresh\nhumid air into this beans. You're going to get crystallization\nof ice on that coffee. That's just bad in every\nsingle way possible. So here's your best practice. If you've bought a kilo of coffee, if you've bought a couple\nof pounds, three, five if you've bought more coffee than you need in the next week or two, then what you want to do is parcel it out into one to\ntwo week sort of quantities and freeze those. You want to get rid of as much air in whatever you're freezing\nin as possible, ideally. Now some people go as\nfar as vacuum packing it, that's a little extreme and I'm a little uncomfortable\nwith the amount of wastage that comes from that. There are certain things that\nrequire the vacuum packaging and I'm okay with that, but I think vacuum packaging coffee just the waste is a little bit ugh for me. But it is probably the\nbest possible way to do it, but I wouldn't go so far as to vacuum seal individual portions unless you had a coffee that\nwas incredibly expensive and you were running a very,\nvery, very cold freezer. So, you've bought that kilo, you want to parcel it out to say 250 gram, 300 gram, 350 gram, whatever you prefer into\nthose kinds of parcels. You can use freezer\nproved sort of Mason jars, if you want to do that. You could obviously use\nfreezer bags if you want to. Those things are reusable\nand that thing is good, or you can just buy three or four individual normal sized retail bags and put all but one in the freezer. And then what you want to do is take out portion the\nnight before you need it, do not open it and let\nit defrost overnight. That'll do fine just on\nthe counter overnight. You don't want to open it\nwhen the beans are that cold cause you will get some\ncondensation forming on them, and broadly speaking that's just not particularly\ngood for coffee. You don't really want to do that. If you've just bought a\nregular sized retail bag it's just not worth you\nfreezing that, it's not. Just use it over the next couple of weeks and you'll be completely fine. You're not going to do much to really change the state of that coffee. If the coffee is stale\nout of date to begin with there's no point freezing it, nothing good will happen there. Nothing bad will happen, but\nnothing good will happen, So why bother? In summary, if you've got\nmore fresh roasted coffee than you need in the next couple of weeks, take the excess and portion it into one\nto two week portions, seal them air tight. Get rid of as much air as\nyou can and freeze them. And then the night\nbefore you need a portion take it out of the freezer, let it defrost sealed on the counter. The next morning grind, drink, enjoy. One more piece of business, right now in every video\nwe're doing a giveaway. It's pretty simple.

are up to relative to the epoxy they float a little bit not enough to rise above the epoxy completely but i will have to cut off the first half inch or so to get down to where the epoxy is more dense [Applause] the beans on the bottom are full of tiny air bubbles as i kind of expected what i'm going to do is resaw the top and bottom off so i can get to the cross sections of the [Music] beans [Music] on this side i blew out all the dust and on this side all the sanding dust is still in all the little holes of the coffee beans the uh the coffee beans i'm using are from my buddy's coffee company copper coffee and i'm going to be giving this guitar to them actually so the goal on this build is to use coffee beans obviously and as much copper or copper color as i can so what i'm going to do is try filling in all these little divots with copper colored epoxy to start off another thing i want to try doing is inlaying their logo on this ebony fretboard i'm going to start off by tracing out their logo with an x-acto knife and then i'll use a tiny chisel to carve it out got a little tape dam set up here and i'm gonna try filling in all these little holes with copper epoxy [Music] this is just copper colored epoxy mixed with silica powder which is gonna make it easier to sand down and uh so now i'll just fill in the carved out portions looks like an absolute mess right now but i'm gonna let it cure and then i'll sand it back and we'll see how it looks [Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so so i routed out this little edge along the sides so i can fit this flat copper wire in as a binding it's not actually copper it's a copper painted aluminum i'm just sanding the back side of it so that it will stick better when i glue it on the thing is since it's aluminum when i sand the top flush it's exposing that aluminum color on top it's not ideal but there's really nothing i can do about that this however is some real copper sheeting uh my buddies had it in the garage for a while like just collecting cobwebs so i'm gonna cut off a piece of it and try using it as a headstock veneer [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] looks slick just going to finish off the neck with some true oil [Music] i mentioned at the beginning of the video that this guitar was built from coffee beans from my buddy's company copper coffee so i want to thank him for sending those over for this build and i will be sending this guitar over to them so they can put it up in their shop we've been friends since like preschool so i felt this was kind of a cool opportunity for both of us i put a link to their website in the description i drink a lot of coffee and i can honestly say that copper coffee is some of the best tasting coffee i've ever had so if you're interested give it a try it will also help support what i do here in my shop so i would hugely appreciate that as far as the guitar goes i think it came out looking pretty awesome the shape is like a modified explorer look one thing i'm sure a lot of you are wondering is why i didn't flood coat the top and bottom of the guitar to give it a perfect finish and i gave it some consideration but it's not every day that i build a guitar that smells this good if you're within like 10 feet of this guitar you can smell it it was also kind of nice just building it because the shop smelled like coffee all the time but i wanted to keep that aspect of this guitar and i also think that the contrast of polished epoxy and dull coffee beans adds an interesting kind of textured look to the body so i decided to go that route although on the back side you'll see here this portion never got cut when i resawed it so some of those beans are still completely submerged but it adds an interesting look i guess and also according to my research ticket for what it is the coffee beans should not decompose or rot over time they should stay relatively the same as they are right now but that's just another thing that you know time will tell i tried a lot of new things on this build which is pretty fun the metal binding was a bit of a hassle to get seated down properly but i think it turned out looking pretty good epoxy inlays also look pretty good so i think that might be something i'll mess around with more in the future um and the copper veneer on the headstock turned out really good although it's sort of developed some like markings on it and they don't really buff out initially when i finished the headstock it looked perfect there was no blemishes or anything but after a few days of handling it it's got some of these marks on it and if i were to guess it's some kind of oxidization going on uh maybe from where my hands have touched it copper doesn't rest to my knowledge so i'm kind of anxious just to see what it looks like in a month or so um or even like 10 years down the road um but it you know it could have been worth putting a clear coat on we'll see one of the goals was to use as much copper on this guitar as possible and so the hardware is all shallower aged copper not too much else to say so i will get to the demo as always you can follow my work on instagram bros art [Music] [Music] oh [Music] back [Music] you", "W75yEE4DKVQ": "hey there welcome back to our channel today we're going to show you how to roast your own coffee i wanted to try this when i was looking into how roasting coffee works and i learned that's actually best consumed within about two weeks of when it was roasted i love coffee and i think the best cup i ever had was in the dominican republic i was at a resort and on the first day i sat down for breakfast they gave me a cup i wasn't expecting anything different so when i took a sip my eyes lit up i don't know maybe it was because i was on vacation and everything was just so great anyways but i could not believe how rich smooth and satisfying that cup of coffee tasted i've been searching that high ever since i've bought beans from the dominican republic kona coffee from hawaii ethiopian coffee vietnamese coffee italian and many of them were truly amazing however none of them had that combination of smoothness and richness as that cup so i'm on a mission to find that perfect cup of coffee one of the things i wanted to see is if really fresh roasted coffee was better than just beans that you buy and grind at home so what you can actually do is buy unroasted coffee beans or what they call green beans depending on where you live there may be coffee shops in your area that sell them i bought mine on amazon and these are colombian green beans from a single source the first step is to get a pan on your cooktop i use the medium setting on mine which is a five out of 9. your cooktops medium may be hotter or cooler than mine but going with medium is a good place to start when you're roasting coffee it's a slow process and the whole thing may take about 20 to 40 minutes what you're trying to is slowly roast them but not burn them you want the beans to have a dark brown look when they're done so if you see them smoke you'll want to drop the temperature down a bit however because you're roasting them the beans will give off a strong aroma so you will want to turn on your overhead exhaust so after about 12 minutes this is what the beans look like they're starting to take on a bit of color as you can see you will need to constantly stir them so that they get roasted evenly you want to make sure the beans gets roasted throughout the bean and not just at the surface now we're about halfway through and 18 minutes in you can see a bit more color developing you will also start hearing the beans pop like popcorn at this point so this is 33 minutes in and we're almost done as you roast you may need to start increasing or decreasing the temperature as you go along if you feel you're not getting enough color just increase the temperature slightly and it's starting to smoke too much drop it down just make sure you don't burn the beans at 37 minutes we're pretty much done i'm happy with the color and the aroma i could have roasted it a bit further but actually beans that are more roasted and darker although they have a stronger taste actually contain less caffeine and i personally do drink coffee for the bit of that caffeine boost so i wanted a balance of flavor without reducing the caffeine too much i also wanted a balanced flavor rather than something that was very bold after roasting you should let the beans sit outside for at least 12 hours before storing then you should wait at least one to two days before you use them that'll let the carbon dioxide from the beans dissipate a bit and result in a better brew so here's my coffee from the roasted beans i brewed it americana style in my espresso machine i found this is actually much better than most beans i've ever bought the taste was richer more intense without being necessarily bold and still smooth i'm not sure if it's as good as the cup i had in the dominican but i would say this is a very very good cup of coffee some notes this ended up taking me 37 minutes of roasting from my research that is longer than other people have said it takes to roast their coffee of course they could have been using a different method or equipment to roast their coffee i think i could have roasted them a bit faster but to be honest i'm not sure i could have done it without risking uh burning the beans i was trying to balance getting color and also not burning the beans throughout the process i'm definitely not an expert roaster so there may be a better way of doing this at home having said that the beans turned out really well anyways as you can see i didn't roast all the beans i had at once i just roasted the amount i thought i would use in two weeks i hope you enjoyed this video please hit that like button and subscribe to our channel with notifications on so that you can see our future videos thanks and we'll see you next time", "nzDxgsS6KIg": "today we're going to talk about what kind of binge you should use for espresso should you use dark or light roast or single origin or blend all those things we're going to cover today so stay tuned hello and welcome to the channel i'm elsa from the coffee chronicler i'm a cube raider and coffee writer and it's my goal to help you for really good coffee at home today we're going to talk about espresso more specifically we're going to talk about the beans that you can use for espresso espresso is special many of the things that we take as self-evident truths in other areas of coffee aren't really applicable here to understand why espresso is so special first we have to look at the concentration for that reason i brought these two cups to illustrate the huge difference between for example something like pure over and espresso as you can tell one cup is a lot smaller than the other typically espresso is brewed at a one to two ratio whereas a pure coffee can be brewed at anything from one to fifteen to one to eighteen the amount of total dissolved solids is eight to twelve percent in espresso and in pure coffee it's usually around one point two to one point three so espresso is often eight to ten times stronger than pure over the time that it takes to brew these two kinds of coffee is also very different according to the ancient prescriptions espresso is brewed under pressure and it should take around 30 seconds to pull a shot pool or coffee on the other hand takes a lot longer typically it will be something like three to four minutes another key difference between these two kinds of coffee is that espresso is often the base of a milk drink now in front of me i have some quite dark roast coffee that would be ideal to use for espresso if i were to brew this in an aeropress a puro it would be probably kind of boring the cup would lag structure there wouldn't be any perceptible acidity and it would probably taste kind of ashy and a little bit roasty however when they're brewed at that much more intense espresso ratio the acidity is just right the sweetness really comes out and overall the balance is just a lot better so this kind of goes to show that the rules are pretty different when it comes to espresso now next up we have a medium roast this bean works well as an espresso you will probably have to grind finer and adjust the water temperature to get a little bit more sweetness out of the coffee and you can also drink it as a poor french press and it will still taste good if we go back just 10 and 20 years it wasn't that common to use a coffee roasted this light for espresso but today it's getting more and more popular [Applause] now this bean here is a light roast egg yolk and coffee this is the kind of coffee that all modern specialty coffee geeks are crazy about it has a very floral and fruity aroma and tastes really good as a v60 however if you were to try and brew this as an espresso it would just be horrible it would probably taste like straight lemon juice or even battery acid coffee that is roasted this light isn't very soluble which makes it very difficult to extract the sweetness of the cup the first compounds that i extracted when you brew coffee are the acids and since espresso is just brewed in 30 seconds it doesn't extract that much sweetness so if you try to brew ultra light roast then you don't get very sweet cups you tend to get a lot of acid you might meet some roasters who will tell you that this is how espresso is supposed to taste but trust me it's not let's talk a little bit about what i call the espresso paradox now the egyptian beans i have here are grown under very specific circumstances and that's what gives them the unique flavor so when it comes to specialty coffee we typically value coffee that is grown at a higher altitude because that results in a more dense bean and more flavor this flavor is very easy to appreciate when you brew it at a 1 to 15 1 to 16 ratio it's easy to taste in cupping pure aeropress all these kind of standard brewing methods when it comes to espresso it's like all these characteristics are less important as we mentioned before especially is typically 8 to 10 times stronger more concentrated than normal coffee so you don't need that much acidity you don't need that much floral character because the brewing method will amplify it all so in that sense you can actually get away with using what is normally considered lower quality coffee and espresso so it's kind of interesting that we have a lot of rules that we tend to follow when it comes to specialty coffee we care a lot about single origin coffee and special lots when it comes to espresso a lot of these things aren't that important so for instance lower altitude coffees are more common blends a lot more common so i think it's interesting that this brewing method somehow improves coffees that are seen as inferior lower scoring coffees and it tends to mute the interesting characteristics of the really good coffees this is especially a paradox because espresso equipment is so expensive it can be 100 times more expensive than regular coffee gear blends have been a part of the espresso almost since the beginning this is just a tradition this is how coffee started before specialty coffee started there wasn't really that much interest in single origin and blends offer some advantages for the companies but also for the customers for instance if you have a cheap low altitude brazilian coffee you can mix in a little bit of robusta to add some crema and some caffeine and you can add a little bit of a high altitude colombian coffee to give it a little bit of that acidity that way you can keep the price of the coffee down and you can have a consistent flavor of your brand from year to year i've been drinking this particular blend for a couple of weeks and been enjoying it even though it's a little bit on the dark side you can see that this coffee here is almost shining it has some booster blended in as well and if i were to drink this as regular coffee it would just be horrible but as an espresso at that super concentrated ratio again it completely changes the game and i quite enjoy it and i can tell you if you wanted to make a cappuccino a latte with this it would also work perfect so what kind of coffee beans are the best for espresso well i think it's up to personal taste but i will have to say that a lot of the rules that we normally talk about when it comes to coffee they don't really apply to espresso personally i wouldn't roast my expensive beans from panama for espresso for example i would probably just use a cheaper brazilian coffee but what do you think do you have any favorite roasters or brands let me know down in the comment section if you like this video then hit the thumbs up and if you want more content like this then consider subscribing and i'll see you soon in another video you", "TgFLfj6MFPw": "- Hey guys, it's Ale\u0161\nfrom European Coffee Trip and in this video we'll talk\nabout coffee freshness again. In the previous video, Gwilym talked to the professional baristas, but now Petra will share how\nto keep coffee fresh at home. So let's get started. (upbeat music) - I do a lot of trainings for home users and the most common question\nwhich I get really often is about freshness, about the\nfact that the coffee at home they make that a lot of times the espresso doesn't have crema, that\nis it is very watery, and the filter coffee for\nexample, that it tastes empty. So what is the reason\nfor all those things? And every time when I\nask them what they do, at the end it leads to the freshness and how to store the coffee. So this is the topic what\nwe will talk about now. If you want to have a\nreally good coffee at home, it's really easy. And first what you should do\nis where you buy your coffee. I recommend to buy your\ncoffee in roastery or online, but it needs to be fresh, or\nin your local coffee shop, because the beans, this is the core for the rest of your work. So buy your coffee fresh,\nthe roastery is the best. Each coffee bag has\nusually a roast date on it. And the roasters, they recommend to use the coffee within six weeks. What I recommend from my experience is to use the coffee a little bit earlier. It depends if you will work with espresso or with filter coffee. For espresso is the best to use the coffee between two to four weeks. For filter coffee you can\nuse it a little bit earlier, and a little bit faster, I\nwould say one to three weeks. So this is our Columbian coffee. It calls Los Mangos and it's been processed by a wash process. It is roasted actually two\nweeks ago, which is perfect. So I can already use it for\nfilter coffee definitely, and it's just right the time\nto try it for espresso as well. When the coffee is roasted it\nhas a lot of gasses inside. So when the roasteries bag the coffee, they put it in special bags\nwhich have a little valve on it. This valve is there for the gasses, that the gasses can actually\nescape the packaging. If the bag doesn't have the valve, the bag can get swollen\nand it can even pop. So it's really good if\nthe bag has the valve so the gasses can leave. The disadvantage of the\nvalve is actually the fact that with the gasses, the\naroma is leaving as well. So this is the reason why we cannot wait for half a year or a year\nafter the coffee is roasted. Once you open the bag,\nthe air can go inside. So it's really important if you use the beans as fast as possible. At home if you will use it\nbetween five to seven days, it's still okay, the coffee\nwill still taste really good. But I would say after one week\nthen it's getting too long. The beans will lose their freshness. It will lose the aroma. The espresso will not have so much crema. Filter coffee will be really empty. So use the beans after you open\nthe bag as soon as possible. Maximum one week. When you prepare espresso\nyou will pour your beans in the hopper of the grinder. I recommend to pour a little bit more so there's a little bit weight\nfrom the top on the blade, and once you make espresso, and once you're completely\nfinished with the preparation, what is really, really\nimportant is not to leave any coffee beans in the\nhopper or between the blades. Remove everything, don't\nleave any leftovers. With filter coffee it's much easier because with filter\ncoffee you can pre-dose, pre-weigh your weight and you can put that in your hand grinder and just use it. So once you will put it in the grinder, don't forget any beans because\nif you leave it inside, what will happen that not just\nthe air can get to the beans, but also the light, the UV is\nnot good for the coffee beans. If you leave it a bit for longer in the hopper of the grinder, it can get rancid and\nthen the coffee of course doesn't taste well, and\nit will lose the aroma. It will lose all the flavors. So every time use the coffee\nstraight from the bag. Once you grind the coffee, then you have to use it immediately. There's no time that you\ncan leave it for later because the coffee is the\nmost sensitive when grinded. So even when it's for\nespresso or filter coffee, use it straightaway once you grind it. Store the coffee as easiest as possible. Leave it in the original bag\nbecause if you would remove the coffee beans and\npour them in a glass jar or some other jar, the\nbeans will lose a little bit of their aroma which is\nin the original packaging. So leave it in the original\nbag, that's the best. Once you open the packet with the coffee, remove all the air from\ninside with your hands. Nowadays a lot of the packets, they have like a special zipper. So you can close it with the zipper. If it doesn't have a zipper, use a simple clip or a pack for example. I have also a lot of\nquestions from my customers if they should use the\nspecial vacuum containers for storing the coffee. In general I have to say\nthat I don't really have a good experience with them\nbecause together with the air, you suck out the good stuff\nfrom the beans as well. So if you want to put the\ncoffee to a different container or for to the vacuum one,\ntake the original packaging, put it inside, maybe suck a\nlittle bit of the air outside, but not completely everything. And the last important thing\nwhere to store your coffee, Have it at a place which is dry. That's the most important\nand where is not too hot. Not by your fridge or\nother electric equipment, where it's really warm around it. Just have it somewhere in your kitchen in a shelf where it's dry. I see three most common\nmistakes while storing or by buying the coffee beans. The first is definitely the one that a lot of customers,\nthey buy too big bag. They buy a bag which is like\none kilo, maybe even bigger. And then they have it at\nhome maybe for one month or maybe even longer,\nand it takes them time to use the coffee, so that's\nthe problem with the freshness. And this is the reason why I\nrecommend to buy small packets, 200, 250 grams and you can\nbuy like three, four of them, and then use it within a month. So, every week you will\nopen a new coffee bag, that's the best. The second most common mistake\nis that the people pour all the coffee beans straight into\nthe hopper of the grinder. The whole packet. So, the coffee beans, they stay there. And they are exposed to air. Very often they are exposed to the light, so they are losing the\nfreshness very fast. So, don't leave your coffee beans in the hopper of the grinder. The third most common mistake is the fact that a lot of people put\ntheir coffee in the fridge. The problem is not the fridge on its own, but the moment when you remove\nthe beans out of the fridge because then the beans get wet and that is not good for the beans. All the information I gave you, it might have sound\nreally strict and harsh, but all these little tiny details will make your coffee at\nhome much, much better. So, if you want to have a\nreally good cup of coffee, this is the way how to do it. (upbeat music)", "yXCboVCDHLw": "[Music] welcome to episode 2 of weird coffee science and today I'm gonna try and convince you to go and put some coffee beans in the microwave let me explain now this all started with the v60 video actually where I noticed that brewed temperature and sort of flow rate in the sort of drawdown phase were kind of connected that the cooler a brew was the slower flowed and I wondered well what did ground coffee temperature due to flow rate in espresso I set up a little experiment I took my niche grinder and I dialed it in with just room temperature coffee and then I took some coffee beans and I heated them up in a microwave to about 60 degrees Celsius i ground those and I pulled a shot and that shot ran way faster like seven eight seconds faster which was surprising now to rule something out i ground some beans that were room temperature and then i heated the grounds up to sixty and i brewed those to see what the impact was of of the puck was it that the puck was hotter or something else well that shot brewed at a normal kind of brew time so clearly hotter beans were grinding differently now to attest the opposite I made some coffee beans very cold in the freezer those shots pulled way slower but interestingly when I when I ground some room-temperature beans and I made those freezing cold that shot also ran slower but not as slow so clearly a very cold puck does influence brew temperature but very cold beans influence grind profile even more just for summary here's a kind of quick matrix of the experiments that I did just so you can see bean temperatures and then brew times as a result this is not an entirely new iya idea in 2015 in the world Barista Championships from the finalists Don Chan from Hong Kong was heating his beans up before grinding using a water bath he'd said I think that he got another percentage point of extraction which is which is kind of a lot to go from say 90 percent to 20 percent is a big jump in extraction so clearly he noticed something - what I also think about though is that loads of people I know like to freeze samples of roasted coffee beans to sort of preserve them for as long as possible but if they're grinding them frozen they they are likely producing more fines now you may have seen a paper saying that frozen beans produce less fines but as I recall they were using way way away lower temperatures than the typical - 15 - 20 degrees Celsius you would see in a domestic freezer this all led me to one final key experiment one thing that I think you might be interested in - but before that I just need to tell you about this video sponsor which is Squarespace now if you need to build a beautiful website I would strongly recommend Squarespace in fact I needed to build a website I needed to build a new place to explain what it is that I do for a living as well as tap a home for weird coffee science and it was so easy to take one of their templates and then just to make it mine it was quick to build out a rich and detailed site full of information and what I love about it is that there's nothing more to patch or a grade or install I don't have to worry about maintenance of it over the next few years if you want to build a website or you want to just pick up your own domain then use the link in my description and my discount code to get 10% off your first purchase with Squarespace so onto the key experiment is being able to grow and finer potentially through using hotter coffee beans well is they useful is that good does that make better tasting espresso so we set up an experiment we've dialed in a regular room temperature coffee and then we dialed in against it coffee beans that were 60 degrees Celsius now one interesting note here is that taking a 60 degree Celsius coffee and grinding it immediately brought the temperature down to about 45 degrees Celsius clearly that contact with that large piece of metal that was room temperature that grinder pulled a load of heat out of the ground and that was certainly interesting but anyway we let them both equilibria in temperature which is why they were ground at the same time and pulled shots and thanks to Gareth's from square mile for pulling the shots so that I could taste these blind now this was really really interesting the differences were quite distinct every time we tasted it though we never really quite managed to nail exactly the same flow rates for the shots however the beans that were hotter when they were ground did stand out in the tests we did I'm not sure really how much aroma we might be losing I'm not sure if we lost some crema through the excess degassing I don't really know that but but I did prefer the shots that were from the hotter coffee beans and it might be just that they were more extracted their texture was noticeably different a little bit richer softer rounder you can try this at home if you have a microwave and you have a grinder that can grind through a single dose there very easily got a hand grinder or something like the niche that kind of grinds to order then you can try this too one thing I'd recommend don't brew straight away right like that the ground coffee does need to come down in temperature to 3035 for it to taste good when the grounds were at sort of forty five-plus they didn't taste great right I think the shot equilibrates and temperature much quicker like everything reaches brew temperature much sooner and that doesn't taste great it has a kind of muddiness a kind of over extraction that I don't particularly enjoy because of that kind of cooling phase I'm not sure how you could commercialize this and I do think about that that may be the positive impact of of a heating element in something like the mythos one way or maybe like those shots quite a lot I don't know I don't know I'd love your thoughts and your feedback now there is a dedicated page and a weird coffee science for this topic on my website I'll leave a link to it down below I'm gonna try and centralize any discussion there post any links to other relevant resources you can leave a comment here on youtube too if you want I would love to hear your thoughts thank you so much for watching I'll try a centralized stuff there but obviously feel free to you train", "Gj43sd9Jnxw": "if you brew coffee at home you are definitely thinking about this question a lot what's the best way to store coffee beans to keep them fresh for longer is it zip back enough or should i invest and buy a vacuum container hey guys it's alex from european coffee trip and in this video we'll share results of eight weeks long study done by our polish friend christophe barabosh that will answer this exact question [Music] let me shortly introduce you a person behind this project crystal barabosh is a head roaster at hard beans in opolo poland he loves numbers and coffee he's a field tester of commandant grinder member of sca poland and overall one of the biggest coffee geeks we know for this project he also teamed up with scientist francesco velasquez who helped him to translate all collected data into a meaningful graphs and outcomes definitely go and check them both on instagram now if you are not interested in numbers and details of the experiment so i will let kristof to share the main takeaways in about a minute but if you are interested in the experiment details what was measured was the taste difference between coffee store and zip bags and vacuum containers or how badly coffee tasted if stored on a tray so then don't stop there and enjoy the rest of the video if you buy a bag of coffee like for example 200 to 150 grams of coffee and if you are keeping it in a zip pack with like ziploc and you seal it properly and you store it in a like quite stable conditions like for example room temperature around 20 and no big jumps and humidity then first two weeks you cannot feel the difference between this vacuum and zipline you see slightly differences the pattern is showing up in terms of taste but i don't think it's worth to repack it and put it in the vacuum but if you plan to keep it longer then vacuuming it's working better [Music] what was the motivation for you to actually uh start this project and and research to find out what's the best way to store coffee beans roasted coffee beans right so it started i think three months ago a company who's producing vacuum sealed containers asked me if i'm like keen on testing it and i said yeah let's let's make it proper way so let's use instrument like professional instrument and really measure the chemical and physical uh structure of the of the beans i decided to uh first of all roast a cookie and measure everything and the next day it was the 21st of may my birthday that's why what yeah i i decided to pack it in few different sample packs so six samples were packed in the regular ziplex so that's this plastic and aluminium inside zip pack with wall so here's the valve in the back and then six vacuum sealer sealed containers and on the copper tray from like the last sample and the most interesting one was like just left on the tray first of all like the the whole idea was to check it if opening daily opening every three days opening every week every two weeks is like making change in taste and the readouts from water activity and voice content and that's why so many samples i had 13 samples because one vac just was opened every day so opened measured closed and vacuum other sample was like every three days other simple weekly and so on and so on the last one so the last sample sample hashtag six was sealed on 21st of may and opened today morning so both zip pack was sealed and closed and the vacuum was sealed and closed for two months and nobody was touching it it was like sitting on the shelf and waiting uh for the results for the measurements moisture content i was using the sinar bin pro 6070 instrument for water activity i was using the rot running water activity matter also i was doing and using the colored four for the last readout of color and after two weeks after four weeks after six weeks and after eight weeks we did a blind cupping so we were assessing the dry aroma where talon flavor aftertaste acidity body balance the best in terms of ceiling package is the regular detail okay because like uh when we when i packed the coffees on the 21st of may the water activity level was 0.165 and in the two months sample the average reader from the zip pack was 0.186 and from the vacuum was 0.349 so it's like twice as big but still on a capping table you can see the pattern which is promoting vacuum the coffee from zip tax had higher acidity vibrant acidity the cups were fading away more quickly the sweetness was slower and after taste was like dryish a little bit bitter and on the other side the the pattern for vacuum was that the acidity was slower but because it was more balanced more sweet more round the aftertaste was more clean and longer lasting the coffee wasn't fading so fast so you can feel the degradation of the aromas up on time so from week to week but still it's more roundy more sweet more balanced cup than the zip pack his impact was like highlighting the acidity but the acidity wasn't supporting the sweetness in the cup and what's more interesting and the best results we got from a sample which was closed vacuum opened and closed vacuumed open daily really so not like in this vacuum which was closed on the thursday and opened after two months but on the vacuum which was like daily open close only open close and daily vacuumed we were super curious about the like two months closed bags and when the coffee was hot and an aroma assessment so dry aroma and wet aroma the highest score was from the zip back from the two months close seatback but when the coffee was cooling down and it was like collapsing in the tapes so okay it was fading away and becoming unbalanced and bitter and harsh on the opposite side the vacuum pack after two months wasn't uh so like intense in terms of the aroma wasn't so like fruity i was more mild more like round but better they balanced so the speed spot was there the roundiness was there and the aftertaste was very clean so even now today after two months the coffee both from a zip tie and from a vacuum container was scoring higher than the coffee from a tray after two weeks so for now the most important conclusion from the study is to keep the coffee in a sealed bag no matter what kind of seal bag but it needs to be sealed and if you plan to consume the coffee longer than two weeks you can think about the vacuum container because vacuum container will like keep the coffee more round and more balanced in terms of capping scores but still the differences are 0.5 0.75 points on the copying spreadsheet so maybe somebody who had no idea where is the capping score and this point so is it the way how you can translate what what would this difference mean for the roster or for for them what can they think of in terms of how like if the difference is like not so huge so 1.2.3 points from the reference point of view you just probably lost the intensity complexity you can still assess the descriptors so you can still say that the coffee is hornish this coffee is yellow fruits but the yellow fruits for example are not so pronounced they are there but they are like for example covered by other flavors or they are like fading away so you feel them but the the intensity the the complexity is muted the huge difference was on the tray so if you don't keep any kind of package the coffee because then you have this kind of off flavors so flavors which are not connected with the cup profile which are connected to like this kind of contamination because probably this coffee was contaminated and by degradating of the lipids volatile compounds the the loss of co2 which is kind of one of the bridge to to to showcase the aromas in the copic in the cup do you expect like the big differences between the different vacuum containers or it will be you expect this to be more or less similar i believe that as long as the the container has kind of indicator that what's inside is vacuumed i don't believe there is a there will be a huge difference between between brands okay let me do a final summary for you two weeks time is sort of a threshold that justifies the investment in vacuum sealed containers if you buy and consume coffee beans within two weeks and store them in zip bags then there is only tiny difference between flavors in these two after two weeks you start to recognize difference surprisingly the best results were measured for coffee beans stored in a vacuum container that was open daily so if you brew coffee every day every morning for month or more then the vacuum container make a meaningful difference for your brewing at home also there is an option of freezing coffee beans it wasn't tested in this experiment because it was already scientifically proven that it slows down the aging process of coffee thank you guys for watching i hope that you learned something new today there are also two more videos that we made recently about coffee freshness that i think you will like one is more for professional baristas and coffee shops and another is for

and what you need to know to make a good cup of coffee so to begin with I have a confession to make and that is that even though I've been in the business for over 35 years still when I travel on airlines hotels restaurants I often add cream and sugar to my coffee because otherwise it's simply undrinkable and the main reason why it is is that the coffee is simply unripe imagine going to the supermarket and getting a peach and it's hard as a baseball and putting your teeth into that and just imagine the flavor most coffee tastes like that happily specialty coffee has been growing by leaps and bounds and is really blossoming in the last seven years approximately now really getting into single farm coffees for the first time in an exciting way and just like with wine the greatest coffees are from single farms and the reason is very simple that's where you get down to craftspeople who really love what they're doing otherwise you're mixing different coffees from different people and you're getting this okay or very good but not great coffee it's like Bordeaux versus a single farm if you will so always look for that so but as specialty has blossomed and and really matured we have a problem when you the consumer go to a store you are assaulted with a huge variety of choices to make and so it seems extremely difficult and indeed it really can be so that's what I'm going to try to clarify some some key points for you so when you're looking at a label you're going to find a lot of potentially a lot of things on that label and the first thing you're going to look for is the country of origin followed by the region that it's in just like again it would be Napa or Sonoma or somewhere in Washington and so you have ma Muto you have then which is the farm you have the region kitten Yaga then the next you would have the grade and the grade simply refers to the size of the bean nothing more so the most common names that you'll see that way is double-a four Kenyans and supremo four Colombians these are larger beans that tend to be more ripe if you will and then are better processed the next grade for instance in Kenya would be a B's and in Colombia Excel cells sometimes you'll see this great sometimes you won't the next one could be altitude that you have and that's really an important concept in specialty coffee if you start at the coffee that's really fine quality starts at about 3,000 3,500 feet and goes up to about 6 maybe at the tippy-top 7,000 feet as you go from 3500 you're getting at those altitudes earthier coffees good chocolate flavors and nuts that sort of thing and as you go up in altitude the liveliness of the coffee which we call acidity and which is a good term just like it is in wine it's the pizzazz that the coffee has as you go up the acidity increases and the other thing that happens is that you start to get more fruit flavors and even floral notes as you go higher in altitude so it's something to note there is always exceptions to the rules Hawaiian Kona is grown in much lower altitudes because it's so far north from the equator but very fine coffees can be grown there still that is a major exception so then the next thing that you might see is the variety of the coffee being grown again just like with wine Pinot Noir Cabernet Sauvignon you have the same thing with coffee beans and this is something that's going to take a long time to familiarize oneself with a specialty because it's just being born in a lot of respects is only now exploring the different varieties so we're nowhere near as far along that road as the wine industry is but we are catching up each variety does affect the flavor of the coffee there are some from Ethiopia a very famous variety called geisha very rare and very expensive gives you a flavor of lemon candy and apricot and it's clears about very different than say a cateura or bourbon so these are things to familiarize yourself as you go along then finally what's the roast it could be a light roast it could be a dark roast and if you look here you can you can see that this is a whole a whole scale of roasting the raw green coffee once it's out of the cherry which by the way that's about the size and the look of a coffee cherry and inside are two seeds like this very little fruit as you can see and then in three minutes it starts to look like this it's dehydrating basically six minutes nine minutes you get this really still unpalatable coffee twelve minutes now you are starting to get a full roast the lightest of the roast and then at about fourteen fifteen minutes you're starting to see oils bleed to the surface and the darker roast like French roast for instance and some of the darker Roasters that are very well-known like Starbucks and Peet's so that's the scale and you want to know that because each person has a preference regarding roast most Roasters in specialty who are focusing on Estate coffees really prefer and recommend lighter roasts for those coffees and the reason is that as you go into the darker spectrum you are adding more and more caramel flavor from the actual roasting process itself not anything inherent in the bean it is common to all coffee beans and so as this this happens you're it's like adding more and more sauce to the coffee so if I'm buying a great bean for a much higher price that's really very special in shows terroir the place that it was grown and it really is expressing that terroir is like earth tierra d'etre so if that's what it's expressing then I wanted to go light with a sauce so that you can actually taste what's inside the coffee bean itself so really critical that that you are aware of what you're getting that way and then finally the vintage at the bottom and that is basically when was the coffee actually harvested in general coffee is harvested right uh it's it's harvested and then it is available over the next three to six months if you're really aiming at quality and you will see Roasters specialty Roasters talk about seasonality because that coffee in the raw green form is aging with every day every week every month an extreme example is right here this coffee is new and it has that nice green green blue color this is very very old and you can see where it's going it's headed this way and with every month that happens the coffee gets Whittier and Whittier this is before it's been roasted so this is a concept of freshness that has only become recent we at the George Howell company are one of the very few roses and we're the innovators of that we're actually taking the green coffee vacuum sealing it and freezing it and that freezing procedure keeps it immune from the seasonality problem so we do have vintages and you will see on on some bags and I think in the future with other companies as well where you might see ma Muto from kenya2008 and that might be a much better vintage than 2009 or 2010 and we can actually bring that out so again coffee is headed in the long range towards like a more wine like product what else could you be offered when you go into specialty stores and that could be regions like instead of seeing a single farm you might see just Costa Rica or Costa Rican terasu and that's a region and it will be like seeing Bordeaux or burgundy or Napa Valley that sort of thing the next one but again you're not going to get a great coffee not that within a state you're guaranteed in a great a great coffee because it could be a good estate and it could be a lousy one but at least you know it's it's going to a wider angle if you will blends blends always is the concept of taking lesser coffees normally typically although you will have some some specialty Roasters who will take their great beans and blend them something I don't I think you kind of lose the purity that way imagine taking Bordeaux and a nap and putting them in one wine glass right so they take lesser coffees that are still very good but less expensive and then they will blend them different ways if you will typically they'll roast each one separately then blend them together and so this will give you very good coffee with different flavors but they will not have the spectrum in my opinion that the estate's would have but again very good easy drinking coffee should be what you're aiming for with a blend with special flavors body and so on that give it their character that you might really like and then finally you get certifications organic Fairtrade direct trade and on and on just very briefly three will go over a fair trade is really something which works only with cooperatives not with farmers on any level so it's very restricted in the way it goes and I have to say with so much bombarding us all the time in the news and so on that calls out to our conscience it's easy to want to take our conscience and park it on a shelf and and so you see Fairtrade and it sounds really fair and honest and in fact it really is but often Fairtrade does not mean high quality it just simply means that those people working in the farms and whatever are receiving a good price that is definitely allowing them to be sustainable is putting money as well into their education sometimes into medical benefits and so on so you know that money is working well and that's a good cause direct trade really I think in many ways goes further than that and it's a more recent phenomenon and it's in reaction to Fairtrade and that is that direct trade we go directly to the farmers and we know exactly what they're being paid and we can pay multiples sometimes of what fair trade base and there we are incentivizing the farmer to really go out and produce a very high-quality product and to keep improving and we work with that farmer to do so we visit the farmer that sort of thing and again they can get far higher prices with it so you can go either way with that another one is organic and where we need to go with organic is towards better flavors a lot of organic coffee is sold and purchased because it's organic and not because it has great flavor we are slowly coming out of that and there are organic coffees that can absolutely be exquisite and the top end but just because it has the label organic doesn't mean that is really great same thing with bird friendly and on and on these are labels that give you some idea of what's going on but it's not enough in itself if you really want to get pleasure from what you're drinking so I hope that's been helpful to giving you some ideas of how to steer your way through this forest of information that's available to you for getting great coffee thank you", "Wly6tZeH_JY": "[Music] what's up everyone its Prometheus and today I'm coming at you with the three most common mistakes in espresso preparation so these are all things that I see done either by new briefs does that sometimes veteran briefs as if they're just in a rush and they're trying to knock out shots as fast as possible all these things need to be done properly or you're gonna end up with an uneven shot or just a general a bad shot so the first thing is no distribution before tamping now let's say you're grinding into your portafilter and you're filling up the portafilter and not paying much attention to distributing as you grind so we're looking at this basket we see that the right side has a lot more grinds than the left side if we were to just tamp that as is that left side and the right side are going to be flat but the right side is going to be far denser and as you see we're going to tamp it right now and I'll show you what it looks like as far as you can tell everything's flat you can't really tell that the right side has far more density than the left side so when we're pulling that shot we're seeing that as it pulls so the left side of the spout is running freely the right side is obviously running a lot slower next on the list is excessive polishing or flair so a lot of us were taught to polish our pucks after our tamp and so that's just a little spin all that's doing is adding the potential of unseating your puck especially if you're adding pressure as you spin you could be just twisting the puck and opening it up or if you're just spinning freely so you'll see on the left and unseeded puck on the right a seated puck these are from polishing and properly or polishing at all so let's just abolish the polish last but not least we've got portafilter at handling so this is a really easy one to fix all that I ask is that you just act like you have a little SPRO be on board and you are going to just be very gentle you don't have to be slow but you need to be deliberate when you're moving your portafilter around with a puck in it you don't want to shake it you don't want to bang it against the group you want to be nice clean movements very deliberate very smooth you might damage the puck banging it around or moving it like that and just by doing these few things let's take a look at what the puck look like after this so with this close-up you can see I just pointed out for obvious cracks those are going to end up being channels it's gonna end up being an uneven extraction it's gonna end up being you know maybe an okay shot but it could have been a great shot so let's just be a little more deliberate a little more slow and just you know handle that puck like it's aspro be on board thanks for watching if this video helped you out drop me a like and a subscribe you can follow me on Instagram as Prometheus my blog it's prometheus comm new videos

coffee beans for your new brew method have you noticed that you can buy coffee beans or espresso beans what if i told you they are not the same thing many are unaware of what sets them apart and when one must be chosen over the other time to clear up the fog [Music] first let's take a quick look at the roasting process the roasting process is every bit a part of your resulting coffee as it affects what your brewed coffee will ultimately taste like you start with fresh green coffee beans and by that we mean the green ones from the cherries of the coffee plants by itself the green beans cannot be used for brewing it is the roasting process that actually unlocks the oils and sugars within the bean which in turn gives the coffee that distinct aroma and flavor the beans are subject to high temperature and the length of time that they go through the process determines the light to dark roast profiles the general rule is that a light roast works best with a slower extraction method such as a filter coffee and a darker roast with a quick method such as espresso but at the end of the day all these roasted beans are just coffee beans that may be used for just about any brew method okay now what is espresso isn't espresso that little drink you get when you need a quick and effective wake up sip well yes and no an espresso shot is the result of brewing coffee through the fast and high pressure espresso method the fine ground coffee used must be packed tight in a basket inside a portafilter which is then placed into your espresso machine it must be tamped into the portafilter with 30 to 40 pounds of pressure the espresso method then makes use of hot water pushed through a machine at high pressure at least nine bars within about 25 to 30 seconds the resulting shot is a thick full flavored brew with just the right amount of espresso crema this shot is often used as a base for other drinks like the macchiato and cappuccino so what is espresso crema crema is often mentioned with reverence in relation to espresso it refers to the light-colored layer that forms on the surface of brewed coffee during the extraction stage while brewing espresso carbon dioxide coming off the compacted fresh grounds meeting with hot pressurized water causes the trademark bubbles to form so espresso beans versus coffee beans which one now that we know more about the roasting process and the espresso method let's try to answer that mysterious question what's the difference between espresso coffee beans and regular old coffee beans the brew method coffee beans refer to any bean roasted and readied for brewing light roasted beans do not have an oily sheen and are best for white coffee and non-pressure brew styles like pour over coffee or cold brew coffee medium roasted beans result in a different flavor profile and based on the bean origin can be used for many styles of brewing dark roasted beans on the other hand stand out for their dark brown color and shiny oily surface most of the time they are used for espresso brewing espresso coffee beans usually belong to that dark roast category as this is the stage in which the beans offer the least acidity with a fuller body you will still be able to get slight hints of the bean flavor as well the dark roast of espresso beans are richest in coffee's natural oils evidence in the oily sheen you can see on the beans emulsification of these oils along with other compounds and coffee proved helpful in producing the so-called espresso crema using regular beans to make espresso may not produce the kind of brew you expect in a perfect shot no matter how good they are some varieties are too light others may be too charred or dark making a good cup of espresso is not rocket science but it's not exactly just about throwing ground coffee and hot water into the espresso machine here's why you must use the right beans for good espresso espresso coffee beans will give you the consistency body and flavor you want in your shot they help in achieving a rich crema which enhances the whole drink regular coffee beans are great for a variety of brewing methods but espresso coffee beans hold up best with high pressure methods so if you don't know now you know next time someone asks you espresso beans versus coffee beans is there a difference you'll be sure to put them in their place after all you're fast becoming an espresso

it in the refrigerator or the freezer or neither of them well today we are going to answer that question definitively i'm eric this is the mug life and then choose the mug life mug life chose me [Music] one of the questions we always get at the shop is how should i store my coffee should i put it in the refrigerator should i put it in the freezer should i just leave it in a bag in the in the cabinet well that's great question we are going to do some very scientific testing today to figure out what's the best way to store your coffee and what's going to taste best what we've got here in front of us are some of you may have remembered back in september we had a workshop series this is our costa rica anaerobic process coffee we have some of it that was kept out at room temperature we have a sample that was kept in the refrigerator we have a sample that was kept in the freezer we've brought them up to room temperature and in a little bit we are going to cut the coffees by we i mean me gonna cut the coffees and see if there's any flavor difference one thing i will say as i'm just making observations here uh there is not much of a difference in look in in visually for any of the coffees they all seem to be about the same i kind of half expected to see some more oils on the ones that were in the freezer just as it uh because of the way things changed and expanding and contracting i expected more oils to be on the surface of the beans and less to be on the surface of the beans in the uh room temperature ones but they're not uh as another note these were bagged roasted and bagged on september 3rd it is now october 27th so we are just shy of eight weeks we'll call it seven weeks that we have been having these sit in the freezer or refrigerator or on the countertops so let's get to it cup some coffee and see if we notice any flavor difference between three of them all right we're back we've cupped our coffee or we're getting ready to cup our coffee one thing i should tell you is that we're cupping this blind i've got little markers on the bottom of the cups so i don't know which one is which anymore uh they were in order before i can guarantee you they are not in order anymore so let's get to tasting shall we they're not bad there's a little bit of brightness to them um they're not nearly what i can what i remember them to be from two months ago i can guarantee you that there are some notable differences on there this last one i think has really started to fall flat this one here has the least amount of interest to it they all um these uh the first one there's a little bit of a woody note it's not bad there's some brightness to it some juiciness it's definitely got some interest this second one is um kind of dull and uninteresting not a lot happening there where we've definitely got a fruity note to it this one's been more closer to what i remember this costa rican coffee to be and this third one definitely falls flat there's not a lot of brightness to that not a lot of excitement going on with that one at all so if i had my choice i'd say this one here would be the most well preserved coffee of all of them and then i would go one two three kind of in the order that it's in here now let's hope that it's not in the original order which would be really kind of awkward um so interestingly enough this one here is the one that was kept in the freezer no i'm sorry this one was the freezer one and this one here is the one that was kept out at room temperature and that means this one here yep that would be the case was the one that's the refrigerator so the refrigerator one is actually the worst one but uh definitely flavor-wise the one that was kept at room temperature has stayed the best i would say let me just yeah definitely the freezer one's got some off woody notes to it the one that was in the refrigerator um definitely the worst i don't know why that would be i would expect the refrig the freezer one if there's gonna be one would be the worst one but the refrigerator one is the worst the freezer one is second but without a doubt here uh the one that was kept at room temperature has definitely stayed the best flavor-wise and that's over almost two months of just sitting out so there you have it i definitely would recommend keeping your coffee at room temperature in a sealed bag and you'll have the best flavor over a long period of time that's all i've got for today keep serving coffee people love you", "sr2zFK2xhW0": "hey coffee lovers mark and aj here from whole latte love today we're going to take you through our tasting of six different maromas coffees uh we did all the tasting and stuff we'll tell you at the end we'll talk about three our three favorites doesn't mean they have to be yours we'll talk about why that is uh but aj take us through the process of how we do our tasting here yes we've got six different beans from uh maromas here and we dialed them all in individually on the chiato e37 sd grinder we chose to single those so that we could have them all kind of isolated without any impacts of previous beans in the chamber things like that and then we pulled shots on the bedzera matrix mn it's the manual extraction version and split the shot so we could each try it and and dialed them all into a a one to two ratio 18 grams in 36 grams out roughly 25 to 30 seconds on each of them uh just as kind of like our baseline standard for that in the matrix we're wearing the bedzera swag here right yeah it's a nice nice dual boiler machine it's got the really cool color changing panels if you're into that sort of thing um i've got that snake logo you've got the lever machine the classic lever you know about zero one of the oldest manufacturers in fact probably the oldest manufacturer of espresso machine started way back in 1901 um and before we get into tasting we got a little moroma swag too right we've got we've got the uh frothing pitcher here nice 20 ounce frothing pitcher kind of understated but a nice finish on that got a tamper and little rubber tamper stand and then i really think this is cool you know if you got a coffee somebody's really into espresso the little portafilter bottomless portafilter keychain over here and then over on this bag here we've got the aroma's bag clip because we often talk about one of the best ways to store your coffee is just in the bag but that's assuming you can seal it with a clip or some of them have ziploc kind of seal on it but yeah this bag clip brand your coffee bag with a branded clip and then we have one more so we've got a little special guest we're gonna have austin come in we've got the very cool maromas barista apron i think you're gonna have to get right over here give us a little model right ladies and gentlemen this is real leather you got a pockets to put your rags put your brushes and it's comfortable too thanks really nice cool barista apron there now he's going back behind the camera because he's also running the show behind the scenes okay so we're going to go right down the line here we'll talk about the coffees now i've been watching my videos we're going to start out with one of my all-time favorites maroma's orpheus i know this is not your favorite of the bunch here nope nope i like it a lot but it's not my number one so uh you know i do talk about this coffee loud it's got it's very very chocolatey incredibly easy to work with you know not expensive at all it's like 10 bucks a pound um i've been drinking it for years not just as espresso but it's long coffees i like it in milk drinks because of the chocolatey stuff you don't so much but we'll talk about that right well yeah let's why why is it that maybe for you because you do the latte art right yeah orphea makes a ton of crema and it's it looks awesome it tastes great but for latte art sometimes for me it's a little too thick to pour into so if i'm drinking as espresso great if i'm making americano great but if i'm doing a latte art on a latte i'll generally go with a different bean and i mean this is a i call it buckets of crema is what it makes a lot of people really like that in fact this is a coffee you dial this in 18 and 36 out and i get this question all the time about volumes and people trying to compare weights and volumes because this coffee when you do 36 grams out you're probably gonna get if it's dialed in right you're probably gonna get over two ounces over 60 milliliters of volume including that crumb in the cup right and for some other beans even the same 36 grams the same weight will be an ounce and a half or even less depending on how dense that foam is and then the nature of the coffee so just goes to show you how different a coffee can be now so you know what i what else i'll tell you about this again one of my favorites incredibly easy to work with very chocolatey very smooth never i really never get any bitterness out of this which is you sometimes get with some some of the classic the darker roasts especially most all these are kind of what i'd consider more in the medium range yeah yeah but anyhow so let's let's move on down let you start with the uh we're going to take a look at the arabia here yeah so this is the maroma's arabia uh the taste we took tasty notes on all these as we went so we can remember but my notes on it was it was smoky chocolatey a little bit of sweetness to it uh soft mild acidity and kind of a medium body how about you i mean that's kind of where i was i noted maybe just some hints of winey flavors in there a little bit but sweet and smoky so a smoky whiny sort of thing um i to me it was a little you know it had a nice clean finish and thin in the aftertaste area um and i consider the body maybe just a little bit lighter than than you may have but uh all in all oh and another thing so we as we dial these all in remember grind sizes never set and forget because we were changing grind size throughout all of these to get them dialed in in fact it was a relatively large change from the orpheum to the arabia which isn't surprising being this is a bit of a arabica robusta blonde blend excuse me uh really nice reboost in here that gives it to all those qualities this this 100 arabica is totally different so you're really changing grind size yeah and this even though it is 100 arabica it didn't have some of the the attributes that i normally associate with it wasn't super bright up front it wasn't um it definitely wasn't sour it wasn't bitter but it was kind of right in the middle there which i normally get a little more out of a blend than a 100 arabica but a very but a very different coffee than say the mafia yep totally all right so moving on um we well we're not going to reveal what we like so much yet but the uh the the maroma's gold here uh tell me what you thought about this one uh this one i liked a lot and it may end up in my top three just a little spoiler it kind of had some floral fruity notes up front but the taste the taste was rich and clean and smooth you still got a little bit of that fruitiness it tasted fresh and and just delicious and it's 100 arabica again right and yeah the grind wasn't we it wasn't a huge grind size change between these two which not incredibly surprising that it wasn't given that they're kind of the same variety really but diff beans um for me i you know i said it was very it had a nice smooth acidity a medium body so it had more body than some of the other coffees we were doing nothing not close to the orpheum but is that one you think you could you could use for for latte art yeah i would say this one probably is the most versatile of the bunch you could use it for anything i mean the cremo was there and it was it was nice and formed but it wasn't thick like the maromas was i could you could definitely pour into that okay and then next up you know if you're into the you know the more the social responsibility sort of thing the fair trade the organic stuff this is a new coffee from maromas or at least for us from aromas it's uh organic and fair trade um certified um tell me your thoughts on this guy so this one the the body was a little bit lighter almost thin um flavor-wise right when you took us if you said it was woody and i got that as well it was woody cedary almost leathery but in a good way um yeah it had that just kind of like that tangible wood taste to it yeah and you know what i think that brings up a good point right is that you know i have i have my taste there's some like some really high-end yoga chefs that are super berry you know just bursting with berries and then more chocolatey coffee like this and and i like i like each but you know i'm not totally married to to one right but i think really the only way that you can discover what you are really into is to try things that are completely different so always be trying new coffee i mean no problem having your favorites right i know of course you have other favorites as well but it always helps to try other things so you'll know what you like and on that note too the way we're standardizing this with the 18 and 36 out isn't necessarily the best recipe for all of these coffees too i mean we're doing that just so we have a baseline yeah but there are you could take any of these and tweak them based on that starting point and make them better and better as you go um what may be best for the orpheum may not be best for one of the other ones that that's a really good point and right along with that different brew methods too yeah yeah there are no espresso beans there are beans a roaster may put together and kind of intend that they get used as espresso but you can you can brew an espresso with any bean and you can brew a long coffee or you know whatever you want with any sort of bean so all right so moving on we're up to the marmia yeah what'd you think of this one um so this one you know i got it had more of an earthy flavor to it for me um a lot some tobacco in there very again this one was very different than you know my my kind of orphea kind of thing um and had a nice medium body to it yeah uh for this one again yeah that earthiness it definitely tasted a little bit darker um i had i had hints of chocolate almost tobacco smoky and i probably wouldn't drink this one that much as espresso but i could see it being really good in a milk-based drink and that's just my own taste preference for this kind of bean and i mean that's something you know if you do a lot of milk drinks you're going to find that some some coffees are going to do better in milk than other and it's you know like if you're doing a latte art especially you wouldn't use your feel though right i would love it in a milk drink it tastes like chocolate because it tastes really good it's just hard to do art on yeah yeah i think this one would taste really good and the sweetness of the milk would really bring out the flavors in the coffee as well that that is that's a great point let's go down to the platinia and tell me what you thought here uh this one uh was probably the brightest of the bunch it it tastes it was a i had that it uh had like a berryish whiny fruit like flavor to it a little bit of acidity up front kind of tangy and then the aftertaste i had clean rounded and whiny i did i got a little spicy out of it um definitely got some of those fruit flavors not surprising it's 100 arabica uh coffee so so that's good it had just a slight acidity you know if you get some of those really really super fresh you know high altitude coffees that's the acidity is going to go way uh right you know and really bites you off the top um didn't have that at all like this and just you know i got a little bit of the the chocolate out of this not not as much as orphea um but i really like this coffee and now we did say we're gonna tell you about our three favorites right yep so you want to go first sure okay uh so number three coming in was uh orphea for me we've had it around for ever and it's it's it's in my top three it's number three number two i had the gold and then number one i had the platinia and now it's interesting we came up with the same top three but in different orders um so my my number three was the gold um like that a lot the platinia i that was my number two and you know if you hadn't guessed already the way i talk about it it was your fear but i really do you know i owe it to myself you owe it to yourself to really try some some other coffees and and find out if there you know isn't something else that appea you know if you stick with the same thing all the time and i don't drink orphea 100 um but if you stick with the same thing all the time you're never going to know you know it's kind of like wine right right you know some people like a super sweet red or something and i mean you know i like a super dry white wine so you know and you you don't have to like what i like i don't have to like what you like you know you got to find what you like right yeah but we both like those top three so if you're going to try them that's a good place to start yeah and i thought you know and i think i think the other ones are definitely worth a go and i think you know if you really want to try something completely different um or if you're into the fair trade in organic stuff you want to you know support the farmers and you want to do organic um definitely the fair trade and organic is worth a try and again you know if you want to go opposite ends of the spectrum you know maybe the platinia or the orpheus against the marmia something like that yeah um in a good middle road you know we both really like the gold a lot um so there you go yeah now as always if you have any questions about these coffees or anything coffee of course aj we're always down in those comments we're more than happy to give you opinions or assistance on anything any last thoughts on these before we leave no i'm just excited to try them all with different preparation methods different brew methods and then milk drinks and kind of experiment with tweaking all of them to make them as good as they can be yeah i mean we do have to i mean we gotta have that that base and compare apples to apples a little bit so we do prep them all the same and that's really you know maybe they shouldn't be and you can tune them up a little bit change your brew temperatures or ratios that kind of thing and maybe get something more out of each so well we really thank you guys for joining us if you haven't subscribed to the channel uh we do invite you to do that i'm mark and i'm aj and we'll see you back here soon for more of the best on everything coffee brought to you by whole latte love you", "6TMkDe1XtIM": "if you talk to most coffee experts they'll tell you that the age of your beans has a huge effect on the end product in your cup but how important is it really to use fresh beans hi everyone aj here from whole latte love and i'm running an experiment to test the effects of time and different storage methods on coffee beans when being used for espresso here i have a fresh five pound bag of fuego coffee roasters ethiopia only five days from roast this is a high altitude yurga chef coffee grown at meters starting today i'm going to see how these beans age over the next 30 days when left in this bag stored in an airtight container or put in the freezer i'll be evaluating how this time period changes extraction time appearance and taste so let's get started on day one of the experiment i opened the bag and immediately set aside some of the beans in an airtight container with a release valve to allow gases to escape this would stay sealed for the duration of the 30 days and serve as a control for the experiment i also measured out 15 individual doses of 18 grams each and put them in the freezer the rest of my beans would stay in the original roasters bag this is not ideal storage in the real world but for the sake of this testing i was hoping it would highlight or even expedite the effects of aging the goal here is consistency i chose all of my equipment with that in mind in order to minimize variables and extraction by single dosing with the chiato e37 sd grinder i would ensure there were no leftover grounds from the previous day affecting my results using also coffees the jack leveler would provide consistent distribution and compression without inconsistencies in tamping pressure or technique i chose to use an ecm synchronico with pid temperature control again to ensure consistency from shot to shot shots would be pulled in a temperature controlled room at the same time of day hoping to minimize even slight variation in humidity or other factors that may affect the results to check the retention on my grinder i measured 18 grams of whole beans using an acai pearl scale added one small squirt of water with my rdt sprayer to moisten the beans and control static then grind it i measured my output at 18 grams essentially zero retention i repeated this a few times always with plus or minus 0.1 gram which is an acceptable tolerance for these tests i used a nakaya lunar scale on my drip tray set to start a timer when it registered the first drops of liquid i wanted to dial in a two to one brew ratio of 18 grams in 36 grams out in 25 seconds from first drip my first shot was way too fast i adjusted my grind finer and pulled another one closer but now a little too slow after a couple more shots and adjustments everything checked out i stirred my glass took a sip and noted the dose time and taste in my extraction log this would serve as my reference point for the rest of the experiment so i pulled two more shots just to make sure i was right on with my grind size lastly i taped off my quick set gear knob so i wouldn't accidentally change it at any point my past experience has led me to believe that as beings age and when keeping the same dose you generally have to grind finer to get the same extraction time because i wanted to quantify this change i decided to leave my grinder untouched at this initial grind setting for the duration of the experiment and measure the difference in time it takes to get that 18 grams in 36 grams out or as close to 36 as i could eyeball while manually shutting off the pump to make this more clear i'll freeze frame each shot right at 36 grams every day for the month i pulled a shot with the same technique after each shot i noted the time and taste right off the bat the results were not what i expected i anticipated the extraction would get faster and faster as the days went on instead the first few days were wildly inconsistent first 25 seconds then 41 then 26 then 53 for the next week the time actually increased indicating that my grind was too fine even though i hadn't changed anything at this point i started to worry that i was going to choke the machine and ruin the entire experiment but after day 10 things started to turn a corner and my extraction times began steadily decreasing again you may notice that on day 15 my background starts looking different with the kovid 19 pandemic ramping up in the middle of filming this video i took my entire setup out of the office and recreated it at home for the next week shot times were faster falling between 30 and 35 seconds and the large inconsistent swings i experienced early on stabilized the last nine days of testing resulted in a steady consistent decrease in extraction time essentially what i had expected from the start this graph shows the extraction time versus b and age based on my results you can clearly see that the first half of the month was much less consistent than the second there was a clear point when my extraction time turned a corner and started decreasing at which point variances shrunk and shots became more consistent for the rest of the month as for appearance nothing earth-shattering to report here's a photo of all 30 shots for comparison small variations throughout the month were likely due in large part to the differences in extraction rather than the age having a direct impact on the appearance that said here's days 1 in 30 side by side the crema on the first shot has noticeably more depth and color compared to the older beans this makes sense considering that fresh roasted beans retain a large amount of co2 before continuing to degas as time goes on the last thing i noted throughout my experiment was taste these results should be taken with a huge grain of salt for several reasons most importantly shots that are so improperly dialed in such as the days i was pulling minute plus extractions are going to taste wildly different than if those same beans had been extracted properly additionally different roasts and batches will behave differently so these results only relate to my specific test on day one of the experiment the espresso was very bright acidic and sour almost overpowering which is to be expected from beans that fresh as the first week went on some of that sourness started to fade away and was replaced by tastes of sweet fruity and tangy on day 10 i noted my first hints of bitterness though this ended up also being my longest shot so i'll attribute that largely to over extraction as my extraction time started to come back down that sourness started returning in the form of sharp tart flavors on day 16 i wrote down best shot yet great balance of brightness and full-bodied flavor as my extractions continued to stabilize some of the early flavors returned bright tangy grapefruit over the next week the acidity toned down and i felt like i was drinking a more balanced and enjoyable less overpowering version of those first few days come day 28 the fruit flavor faded a bit and remained that way for the last three days of tasting in summary the taste varied widely throughout the month but seemed to be tied more to the extraction time than the age of the beans from a subjective standpoint my favorite shots were pulled in days 21-27 the flavor profiles these days seemed the most mature and balanced without being overwhelming in this experiment with these particular beans one month was not long enough to make the espresso taste old or stale even when stored in the original paper bag so what about those other storage methods i revisited the beans i had set aside in the beginning which had remained sealed or frozen for the last 30 days i first wanted to see how without adjusting my grinder their extraction time compared to my bagged beans that evening i took my frozen beans out to thaw but left the bag sealed i left two bags still in the freezer to test grinding them while still frozen the next morning i started with my frozen and thawed beans with all other factors identical to the rest of the experiment i pulled two shots both in 36 seconds keeping in mind my paper bagged beans were at 27 seconds the day before something was definitely different looking back at the graph this informal test potentially places the beans at the same level as around either days 2 to 4 day 16 or day 22 regardless it appears that the freezer did something to slow the aging i stirred and sipped noting that the taste was very sour reminiscent of the first few days of the experiment which led me to believe that they were closer to those early intersection points next up was the still frozen beans some people claim that grinding frozen beans allows the beans to shatter in a way that results in more consistent particle size and distribution in your portafilter i don't know how much i buy into that but i pulled two shots of frozen beans anyway the extractions came in at 36 and 32 seconds and tasted identical to the frozen and thawed shots lastly the airtight container two more shots 36 seconds and 37 seconds essentially the same time as the frozen and thawed beans the taste was similar but better balanced than the frozen with acidity toned down to a tolerable level the very last part of the experiment was to stop comparing apples to oranges when it came to taste for the first time in a month i changed my grinder adjustment knob i dialed in my three different storage type samples back to my ideal brew ratio and time and compared the taste of all three this much more closely resembles a real world scenario of keeping your grind dialed in for your current beans and conditions and where the taste could be accurately compared the bagged beans tasted about the same as at the end of the experiment which makes sense considering the tests ended with a 27 second extraction time only two seconds slower the beans from the airtight container tasted incredible rich balanced i could really taste those sweet tropical fruit flavors that i've come to expect from this coffee and it was clearly the best shot i had the entire month last up was the frozen and thawed beans while it didn't taste vastly different from the previous shot it was still a bit too bright for my liking advocates of freezing coffee note that the cold temperatures slow the rate of co2 degassing and oxidation within the beans while this may be helpful for storage that's much longer than my month experiment it didn't do much for me in this test one reason for this may have been that i put my beans in the freezer too early before they had a chance to sufficiently degas so they got locked in at that premature overly sour stage before flavors could fully develop to sum this entire thing up in very broad terms here are a few key takeaways number one keep dialing in your grind don't just set it and forget it especially with fresher coffees the variation from day to day or even within a single day is enough to throw off your entire extraction and flavor the chemistry of the beans is changing dramatically as they degas and stabilize in the first couple weeks during this time you may experience more fluctuation than normal and go through more coffee dialing into your specific parameters if you're using slightly older beans this may not be as much of an issue you'll just have to keep an eye on your shot time and make micro adjustments to your grinder as you go likely toward a finer setting number two age isn't everything even with a specialty coffee from a micro roaster that's intended to be used fresh the best shot i had was a properly dialed in extraction 31 days from roast compare that to a bean blend from a commercial roaster and those sealed bags can typically stay good for many months without going stale number three don't stress over storage the biggest enemies of coffee are air moisture heat and light while i wouldn't leave my beans out in an open bag for an extended period of time you're generally going to be fine keeping smaller quantities sealed in a roaster's bag with a one-way valve in a controlled environment if you want to be a little more thorough get an airtight container and store the beans in a cool dark place for long-term storage more than a couple months the freezer may be your best bet however i would personally let the beans rest for a few days to a week after the roast date before putting them in the freezer this will allow them to degas and lock in their flavor closer to their peak number four taste is subjective there's no one-size-fits-all answer to coffee while i prefer the espresso shots that i pulled in the third week of my experiment somebody else would surely prefer those in the first week or even the fourth each palette is unique and there's no right or wrong when it comes to taste preference get to know your equipment your roasts and your own taste preferences and find a storage and brewing method that suits you this may take some time and experimentation of your own but isn't that part of the fun of home brewing this process answered some questions but also leaves the door open for more experiments such as longer time periods or different roasts if you have an idea for something you'd like to see us test out leave

"HgvGMegCwr8": "hi everyone it's kath from best coffee today i'm going to talk to you about buying coffee beans and what to look for [Music] it can be hard to buy coffee beans if you don't buy a lot of coffee and you don't know where to start so here are my tips for you have a look at the information that's available if you're buying in a store have a look at the bag see what's printed on the label if you're buying online see what information is available for you to view and look at things like the origin of the coffee what does it say about that it's not enough for us to just know that coffee is from colombia or brazil or ethiopia we should really know more specifics about where that coffee is coming from does it give you a specific area a specific farm a producer a meal that's the kind of information that we're looking for another thing you can look at is variety so it's not enough just to say oh this coffee is 100 arabica beans or this coffee is robusta because arabica coffee and robusta coffee are two completely different species of coffee we should know more we should know what variety of arabica coffee this coffee is so have a look to see if that's listed and if it is that's a good step the next thing to look at is the processing method so the way the coffee is processed can have a profound impact on how the coffee tastes so have a look to see if it mentions if it's washed if it's natural if it's honey processed or another process because you might find that you start to have a preference for maybe a washed coffee over time a really important thing to look for is the roast date of your coffee so once coffee is roasted it starts to oxidize and it will eventually go stale and won't be good to drink anymore usually around three months is the optimum time to drink coffee so have a look if you've got the bag have a look to see if they've got a roast date printed on the bag if you're buying coffee online have a look at the roasters notes they usually say what days they're roasting coffee and it will give you an indication of how fresh that coffee will be when it arrives to your house and if it doesn't have a roast date don't buy that coffee you have no idea how old it is another really important thing is buying whole beans i really really recommend investing in a grinder so that you can grind coffee fresh if you're buying pre-ground coffee you are accelerating the oxidation process and you just can't get the best out of those beans there's no way that you will be able to make a great tasting cup of coffee so think about investing in a grinder if you don't already have one and then buy whole beans trust me it's worth it finally have a look at the tasting notes of the coffee the roaster will have written down what the flavor characteristics of that coffee is and it's there to help you decide whether or not you might like it so read the notes decide what coffee you want to buy and enjoy it one other thing is if you're buying coffee to make filter coffee at home try and get a single origin coffee if you're making espresso at home feel free to get a blend of coffees or you can get a single origin as well so there are my tips on how to buy coffee beans look for information look for details on the origin the variety the processing method the tasting notes the roast date and try and buy whole beans if you can happy brewing [Music] [Music] you", "Cc2Og4oYaVk": "she needs to caffeinate up before we make more coffee wow that was a lot how you doing great now that i've had my coffee in today's video we're preparing coffee in different ways i don't know about you but i am obsessed with coffee coffee shops coffee cold brew different processes on how to make my coffee i was psyched when you brought up this idea yeah in 2006 there was a scientific study done where they cooled their beans down to minus 321 degrees with dry ice which we have and liquid nitrogen i'm sorry what temperature negative 321 degrees fahrenheit negative 321 degrees fahrenheit that is like it's really cold like really really cold yeah so we've got access to some special things here like the liquid nitrogen the dry ice and then we have a freeze dryer too here's the basic idea we have dry ice liquid nitrogen and we are going to freeze dry our coffee beans and see if we can get a sweet flavor instead of more of an acidic flavor out of our coffee once we brew it so nick juhass did this with liquid nitrogen and then tested it against just a regular hot brew coffee and the idea comes from the 2017 united states barista championships his name was kyle ramage and he used dry ice and liquid nitrogen to cool down his beans and then he ground them up and he won first place he had the best tasting coffee how do you become a judge for this because i think i'm highly qualified i taste many coffees this coffee is bitter this coffee is sweet i'm very intrigued by this process me being the coffee person that i am i know that the difference between cold brew and brewing your coffee in a coffee maker your coffee in a coffee maker is much more acidic because when you warm up that bean after it's been ground up you're releasing that acidic flavor into the coffee versus a cold brew where you're basically just pulling the sweetness from the bean itself you're not pulling that acidic flavor you're not pulling that bitterness so i'm very interested to see if these coffees are going to be sweeter when we do all these different cold processes and the colder we can get those temperatures i think the sweeter our coffee blend is going to be so we went shopping and we just saw this coffee it's called a death wish and it's called the world's strongest coffee like we gotta do it caffeinated i'm gonna put out a couple coffee beans here so they're fragile so you know if you push down with your thumb they're supposed to crack which it does so here we go cracks into a bunch of little pieces here and when you bring a coffee bean below 58 degrees fahrenheit it gets extremely more fragile enough to the point where the breakage is consistent so that's what we're doing by cooling down our coffee beans is so that it's going to be a more consistent ground coffee when we put them in the food processor we got all of our different types here so the dry ice and the liquid nitrogen we'll put the caps on these to seal them because we're actually going to grind them tomorrow after we freeze-dried a batch because it does take a little bit longer for us to do this process because we are freeze-drying one of our batches so we're gonna have that process happen and then first thing tomorrow morning we're gonna have some beautiful beautiful coffee it's gonna be a good breakfast such a good breakfast all right guys so it is the next morning we've taken out our freeze-dried coffee beans so something i didn't mention yesterday is so the freeze dryer cools them down to about negative 50 degrees fahrenheit but then it warms it back up so it freezes it and then that drying process pulls a vacuum heats it up to like over 100 degrees fahrenheit so they're not going to be the same as our cooled beans with liquid nitrogen and the dry ice that we're going to be grinding while they're cold so these got cold and then they warmed back up so it'll be interesting to see how the taste is different from the cold ones and then our control i'm interested because as we talked about before taking those temperatures really far down and then when you heat a coffee bean back up you're releasing that acidic taste so i will be interested to see if these are going to taste a little bit more acidic than our ones that we are cooling to super low temperatures all right so let's cap this off and then let's get freezing on the liquid nitrogen and the dry ice and have some fun we did measure out the coffee beans and it's going to give us eight cups of coffee per pot so i've pre-filled just my coffee cup here or my coffee pot with eight cups and the way i did that calculation was i did every two teaspoons so we had 18 teaspoons and so we actually need nine cups but i just rounded down to eight so our coffee's gonna be a little bit strong we already have death wish coffee i figured we might as well not dilute it and take away its death wish because i mean we need the caffeine this morning so i'm gonna go ahead and give this a we'll start the timer and then we're gonna start grinding this up i'm gonna do them both at the same time oh wow nice success dude perfect let's see you do that because i'm good so we decided to pause it at 30 seconds to take a look at it and see how we're feeling with the consistency um because we're not making expresso espresso has really really fine fine ground a french press will have more coarse grounds and then our mr coffee machine here is somewhere in between i think we can get a little finer i think our speed drive is too high so i think we do 30 seconds high and then we do maybe like 15 seconds okay [Music] we get that brewing so we're gonna do the dry ice so we got a hammer we got a glove because it's cold okay now we got our liquid nitrogen as you can see these guys hang out over here yes yes we're gonna put beans in liquid nitrogen so before we put the beans in let's look at the temperature as well so we're saying liquid nitrogen is normally at negative 321 i don't think this thermometer goes down that much put it in here and it just says low blow it has broken you broke the thermometer it's too low nice check this out poured a little bit of liquid nitrogen onto our beans here and look they're they're white right there get down the temperature little friends [Music] look at them in there they're getting [Applause] cold now this is the test i wanted to do right i'm going to take a coffee bean put it out here squish it with my thumb oh wow oh that was super fragile very fragile broke very easily one more super fragile pull it out with the thumb [Applause] listen that snap crackle and pop it is breaking easier i won't say it's breaking into smaller finer grounds yet but it's definitely more brittle for sure this is a definitely a tedious process but it works [Music] [Music] our coffees are all ready [Music] i'm so excited to taste them cheers that's a good it's a good cup of coffee oh i would drink this every single day of the week yeah sure for sure 10 out of 10. so definitely definitely good definitely a good bold flavor so i'm interested to see because that was very acidic i don't know if you thought that but i felt like it was very very acidic still feel it on my tongue yeah next up freeze dry it is sweeter it feels lighter much much less lighter than this one not nearly as acidic not watered down but lighter it has that sweet like aftertaste where the control had like a very bitter flavor that sat on your tongue it's a smooth finish very very smooth yeah so that one is better i will say yep next up liquid nitrogen cup i think it looks lighter i think it's going to be much smoother all right you ready yes cheers [Music] it's what's it not i don't know if i want to use the word folder but it's like thicker than the freeze drive with still the smooth so it's like a bold smooth so smooth if i had to choose one to do as of right now liquid nitrogen i would freeze all of my beans and take them down to that temperature this is just a really full body without the acidity which i really like it is a little bit lighter so obviously with the color but in the taste it isn't a punch full of flavor but it's a good flavor so right now i have them up in my order of preferred secondary and third in terms of good flavor so if we've done it right like the barista championships they got it down to 321 that was liquid nitrogen the dry ice isn't supposed to get that cold so it should fit in here in terms of flavor profile which might be the perfect like blend we'll find out cheers it's like a lighter bitter yeah it's like watered down better well if we're putting it in terms of like what i want to drink this is actually going over here i would prefer liquid nitrogen freeze-dried like that gave me chills it was just so like oh she's got the goosebumps bitter um i think this one for me and preferred that's hard because i really like a strong coffee but if i were like to pick one of these i would definitely pick the liquid nitrogen i'm really digging the liquid nitrogen one i'm just really fascinated by this dry ice it just like didn't do it for me dry ice didn't work but i still am just wanting to drink it drink it okay it's early and i'm still not she needs more coffee so we got our monday morning coffee with the control we got our weekend casual coffee this is like a nice gin this is like the hotel coffee that you burned oh that's why mine's way over there yeah definitely so i think we have the same order of preference here like in terms of flavor we're talking about bitterness the smell color nitrogen freeze-dried control dry ice any final words nothing just if you are interested in taking your own coffee beans down to that temperature highly recommend that to get that bold but smooth flavor if there's anything else you want to see us do with these coffee beans or coffee maker or different types of coffee please let us know in the comments below we would be more than happy and i would be more than happy to experiment with coffee every day of the week so until then we're just going to sit here and sip on our coffee

beans really include caffeine to kill predatory insects let's find out coffee beans are dried and roasted seeds of coffee fruits which grow on coffee trees coffee plants have presumably evolved caffeine-rich fruits through natural selection in the wild it helps to keep insects away from eating the plants thanks to its pesticidal nature and ability to brutally overload the creature's nervous systems ever wondered how the caffeine got there well the latest research published in the journal science discusses the logic behind it caffeine appears as a compound called xanthescene this xanthocene reacts with four different enzymes which add on a cluster of atoms to it these building enzymes are group enzymes called n-methyltransferases but does caffeine in all plants evolve from the same group of enzymes at university of buffalo a team found that the group of building block enzymes did not evolve from the same ancestors for example they studied that in cacao plants the building enzymes ancestors were different than those in coffee in other words the building enzymes in cacao and coffee evolved differently the team discovered that when the gene for an n-methyltransferase mutated accidental copies of these mutated genes were created in the plants thus an evolution of genes progressed leading to caffeinated fruits the plants with the caffeine producing gene were less susceptible to insect attacks and could reproduce at a greater rate than those strains of the plant that did not have the gene through natural selection caffeinated coffee beans have become dominant how are these coffee plants insect repellent one way is that insects have taste receptors that help them avoid ingesting toxic and caffeine-containing food another way is that the coffee plant has nectar in its flowers which contain caffeine in low doses the creepy crawlies become addicted to these flowers and revisit them again and again to ingest nectar thus becoming overdosed and dying the caffeine acts as a powerful stimulant to the nervous system in reasonable doses in humans it acts as a handy pick-me-up but when insects ingest significant doses they're effectively shocked into destruction coffee plants also don't allow small plants and herbs to grow nearby the coffee plants grow dry caffeine-filled leaves which fall to the ground and make it impossible for any other seeds to germinate meaning the coffee plants have all the soils nutrients and sunlight to themselves how effective the caffeine pesticide in coffee plants actually is in the wild is highly debated some experts have publicly shunned the myth saying that caffeine has nothing to do with killing insects and that it is just a natural chemical produced in the coffee seeds other experts have argued that the caffeine was advantageous for the coffee plant for the mentioned reasons maybe coffee beans are just a lot more sinister than we thought if you enjoyed this video go ahead and subscribe to 26

to us and we wanted to give them a shot try them all individually and let you know what we thought based on our tasting notes of each of these coffees as espresso so we dialed in shots right drank a lot and it was only a few hours ago really so yeah so a little hoppy you know that's fine we did a lot of tasting but tell us how you know the process we went through and how we made sure we're getting good clean shots and that sure so we took each bag opened it fresh dialed it in on the chiato e37 sd single dose grinder we used the single doser so that we could dial in that specific coffee and not have any remnants of the the previous beans in the chamber kind of affecting our taste so we could get the cleanest and purest taste we we could on it from there we went to the rocket r chinguan toto and pulled shots get them dialed in we were using a one to two brew ratio 18 grams in 36 grams out trying to get it around 25 seconds and taste it from there and so to keep everything equal we kept we wanted to ratio on everything and you know normal time so certainly as your work lease coffees you could do a little something different if you wanted to if that worked out but we have notes yes we drank lots of espresso um so let's go through so first it was the crema intenso what did you think so this one i got kind of like a creamy taste to it it was it was relatively full body definitely not not bright or acidic or anything somewhat smooth but like a little hint of spice to it what did what did you think so i thought you know it came on fast i mean and which isn't surprising with you know more of an italian classic italian style coffee i did get i what did i write down here i said uh spice brisk creamy body um so you know i it was nice it was a nice italian style bean blend you know something you'd be normally pretty used to um oh and by the way we're gonna tell say what our favorites were of the five right we get through here okay and next up we have the this was the kimbo aroma intensa um what did you think of this one so here i got again a little light spice i got some some woodiness had a nice clean finish i like the finish on this one got a little smoky flavor to it um you know it you you knew what was there when when you drank it right and it had a nice it's it finished clean and smooth for me how about you yep this this is a medium roast and i it tasted like a medium roast too it uh it had nutty kind of smoky earthy flavors to it a nice nutty aroma the deep kind of the flavor of kind of like a medium dark roast but with like a deep complex flavor throughout full body and like you said a clean aftertaste and then we went on to the dolce crema this one i really liked uh this is the light roast it's the lightest of the bunch and kimbo refers to it as a light roast as well and uh this one was a little brighter it had a little acidity to it kind of like a mild acidity but it was balanced by the rest of the flavors um i noted caramel and a light spice to it with kind of a medium body i think yeah when we were tasting we both said hey you know a nice light spice there now i was kind of surprised because we're going to look at 100 arabica in a second i was a little surprised that this is the lightest of the bunch and i'm almost 100 certain there's some robusta in here too as well um and i you know if i when i go for those classic talent style bean blends i tend to like more of a medium roast which is kind of where we are here you can tell there's a little bit of difference in the roast level and some of the beans in that in that blend but uh i think we have some good things to say about that one yeah this one was good and it had a little sweetness to it too which i didn't taste in the other ones they definitely tasted a little darker smokier earthier and this one had a little sweetness to it all right and then next up we are over to the aroma gold this is 100 arabica yep 100 arabica medium roast um and what what did you think about this one well you know when i when we open the bag so 100 arabica you know before i even open the bag i'm thinking okay that's probably going to be probably done in a little bit lighter roast and what i did notice on the beans was there is a little bit of visible surface oils which doesn't surprise me for a neapolitan style coffee um so what i got out of this um you know just that i was surprised at the at the at the roast level um a little honestly for my taste so a little a little dark and i started to taste more of the roast now a lot of people like that and it's and i kind of you know said that it you know could go into a milk drink and cut through well there it had some uh smoky fruit i thought at the beginning that could go well with milk how about you yeah one thing i thought was interesting when we were dialing this one in uh we had to grind much much coarser for this one than the previous one oh that's right being 100 arabica and being a little bit darker we i mean we were cranking the e37 sd like six full turns on the worm gear to get it dialed in for this so that was interesting but as far as taste i mean that was the biggest grind size change that we had yeah oh yeah and that brings up a good point right because we're always people are always asking about what grind size to use right and here we did five coffees and the grind was not the same for any of them to dial them in so we did work it was usually three two or three yeah maybe four on that one yeah this one was a little more but the rest they were kind of close but i definitely would make adjustments for each one okay but as far as the the taste this this was an interesting mix to me it was probably the most complex of them because you had that kind of like you had that arabic taste to it a little bit of brightness up front but it also had the dark roast even though it's a medium roast it had the attributes of a dark roast to it so it's kind of different ends of the spectrum mixed into one to make a nice complex espresso yeah i said and look i don't drink a lot of starbucks coffee honestly but i i think that's kind of more in that that neighborhood yeah something more like you'd get at a star a classic starbucks sort of taste out of that definitely and then last up we had the kimbo espresso napolitano yup um what do you think here uh this one as far as aroma right off the bat i was getting kind of a rich chocolatey smoky and that held through to the flavor as well it was definitely this is their medium dark roast and you could taste that that roast difference it was noticeably kind of chocolatey cocoa a little thicker body that kind of stuff yeah so my notes were yeah it's pretty bold with a roast and again some people like that that can combine well with milk and if you're the sort that puts sugar in um you know that would could help balance that out a little bit um you know darkest of all those and they call it they call a medium dark yeah kind of in the middle it's just plain dark yeah um but you know we we do a lot of different coffees but that's not surprising for an italian roaster to to label it that because they will even go darker than that um i i said you know real thick body a smooth acidity in that one though but if you like tasting a little bit of roast you know that's that's the place to go to again kind of more along lines of what you might get in a cloud you know from a starbucks yeah i'm excited to try this one we did it all as espresso but i'm excited to try this in a latte or a milk based beverage or even grind a little coarser and do it as a pour over a long coffee i think that that flavor would would hold up nicely in that preparation so we promised to tell you what our favorites were and i think it was a unanimous decision right as far as number one yes let me put these in order we we have our tasting notes but uh let me order them in my rankings and so i'll give you my my uh top five from not least favorite but less preferred to my favorite sure that would be the the kimbo crema intensa the aroma intenso the espresso napolitano the aroma gold and my favorite was the dolce crema so i my favorite too so we were unanimous here right this was our favorite um you know so we like i said we drink a lot of different coffees and this is probably more similar to this many of the styles that that we're doing um so so that was my favorite i'm going to go first to last so uh so this this was my first um over here it was number one was the uh crema intensive that was second third fourth and fifth and so that that's that's where i was with that again you know it really depends on your taste if you're you know doing uh single origin specialty coffees that cost a lot more than these you know uh you're doing something completely different than some of these classic style italian bean blends yeah if you're used to kind of the specialty type stuff this one may be a good place to start if you want to kind of transition or give these a try if you're used to the starbucks type the the darker roast start down at this end and go from there but a lot a lot of difference here and again i was i was really surprised that the at the roast level of the arabica compared the hundred percent arabica compared to the one that was our favorite yeah but we did like that so um as we say if you have any questions about this or anything coffee we love to get involved in the comments and and we'll do that any parting words aj any recommendations here no again i'm just excited to try them as different drinks and in different preparation methods all right all right guys well thanks for watching we we do appreciate you and of course we'll get involved in the comments with you if you have

stay tuned start out by preheating your oven to 460 degrees there's lots of different ways to roast coffee this is the way that i like to do it if you want to attempt to do this yourself the first thing you'll need is some green coffee beans so these are unroasted preferably organic and they'll have them at local coffee shops that do their own roasting if you call around you'll find them you'll also need some kind of a pan any pan will work but over the years i've had the most success with this guy one of these pizza pans with little holes in it it roasts more evenly and i don't have to stir it part way through a bowl with a strainer a colander or a mesh strainer if it's a coarse mesh this is to sift off the skin that comes off the beans called the chaff and we'll get to that later a good quality oven mitt or of glove to handle the hot tray and beans and then something to store the beans in that's not airtight start by spreading your beans out into a single layer on your tray how many beans you do depends this is about half a pound and that will last me for four or five days so i do this less than once a week after that spread them into an even layer using your hand i like this donut shape because it ensures that the beans in the center roast as quickly as the ones around the edges flatten it out and just push in all of the stray beans so they don't burn place this in your preheated 460 degree oven it takes about 10 to 12 minutes when i roast coffee in this oven but that can vary quite a bit it's more about listening for the sounds that cue you the first thing you're listening for is called first crack it sounds like this kind of like the sound of popcorn kernels popping loud sporadic pops to start and then as time moves on the pops will get a little bit more consistent like this so that is first crack and you'll hear that happen and then all of a sudden it'll start to die down the cracks will fade away it'll get quiet for a little while and then it'll move on to the second thing you're listening for which is second crack and this sounds a little bit different it sounds like a fire crackling in the fireplace so there are much fainter crackles happening more consistently and it sounds like this once i hear the second crack starting i will tend to stay near the oven the timer will usually go off around this time this is about 10 or 11 minutes in and then i will stick by the oven and watch the beans what i'm looking for in the end is how shiny the beans get when it's at light roast you will just barely start to see a little bit of sheen coming to some of the beans they'll mostly be matte and light in color medium roast some beans will be darker and shiny and a dark roast coffee all of the beans will be dark and really oily and shiny looking this can all happen very quickly that's why i said to keep an eye on the beans the difference between a light and dark roast can be less than a minute in some cases so we've reached the biggest downside to roasting your own coffee and that is the amount of smoke that is about to pour out of this oven when i open it you do not want to open your oven multiple times turn your hood fan up to full blast this is the unavoidable side effect of roasting coffee in your oven at home don't say i didn't warn you about this i've been doing this for a while and all i know to do is just turn my hood fan on get a tea towel and fan my smoke detector so it only goes off for a moment and then i'm ready to move on from there give the tray a shake to loosen the beans i do this while they're still warm you can wait for them to cool if you want to transfer the roasted beans into your colander or your strainer as the beans have roasted they expand a little bit and the skin on them or the chaff dries out and gets really light and flaky so what i'm doing here is just kind of gently massaging the beans to break up those pieces of chaff so that they're not all over the beans as you can see this is what it looks like [Music] i will then sift off all of this excess chap this is also kind of a pain you can do this while they're warm or after they've cooled and just be patient for this part it takes maybe a minute or two sifting back and forth this colander is the best one that i've ever found the bigger the holes the better as long as the beans are not going to fall through the holes and you'll just sift that until you get all of that light airy chaff off of your beans and there you have it foodies your own fresh roasted coffee made at home this is something that's really fun to try out you need some special tools and yes you will smoke out your kitchen yes there's a good chance that you'll set off your smoke detector and there'll be chaff all over the stove but if you consider yourself a coffee snob this is definitely a must try fun if nothing else to roast your own coffee comment below let me know how it turned out reach out with any questions in the comment section subscribe to the channel like the video check out my patreon all that's in the description i will see you soon", "E8G9uzUCUjE": "i thought it was about time we did a video about coffee roasting so in this video we're going to talk about the color changes that occur when we roast coffee [Music] before we dive into the color change i thought i'd give you a quick introduction to the coffee roaster that we use to roast our coffee it's a kilogram probate coffee roaster made in germany this one's about 18 months old now and you'll see the very top it's got a hopper and in there we place up to 25 kilograms of green or unroasted coffee and then below it there is a drum and this drum rotates there are fins inside and as it rotates the coffee beans are thrown up and lifted up away from the edge of the drum where all the heat is into the airflow and it's this that roasts the coffee the drum has got a burner underneath so we'll heat the drum to our charge temperature much like you will preheat an oven and then we're ready we will release all the beans through a little sliding trap door at the top into the drum and the process of coffee roasting is really about managing and manipulating heat energy right the way throughout the roast to get the desired effect at the end of the roast there's a door on the front that can open and all the beads will drop into a cooling tray and here we can move them around but we can also drive cold air through them to call them as quickly as possible and stop that roasting and eventually there's a second little trapdoor in the cooling tray that drops the beans into a container ready for packing so i've picked one of our coffees i've picked one of the components from espresso blend and we're going to look at the color change that happens throughout the roast and the coffee begins life as a green coffee bean although as you can see it's kind of a blue green hue to it and these are the seeds of a coffee cherry now everything we know about that cherry where it came from its moisture contents its density its how it was processed we all need this information to understand how best to roast that coffee if you look carefully you should be able to see some kind of silver skin around the outside of the each of those beans and throughout the roast the coffee is going to start to expand and it's going to shed that silver skin and we collect that in a separate container it's called chaff and from our point of view we send it off to a local garden who use it to help compost their vegetables and the plants that they grow so we'll start the roast off and for the first few minutes very little will happen this next sample i've pulled off is at three minutes and the beans are still green although a slightly different green tone a bit brighter and more olive in color so for the first few minutes we're having to get rid of a lot of the moisture content in the bean you won't get rid of it all but most of it will go right at the start and it's the same as if you're trying to brown something at home until you shed the moisture and got the moisture out of that product it won't brown so we'll work through here we're going to be really careful we're trying to apply enough heat and enough energy to start to begin to penetrate that beam without going so quick that we don't get a nice consistent drying phase the first real color change we're going to see is what we call early yellow and here the beans have lost all that green and they're about to start the process of browning now it's a really important phase because the key reaction we're going to see now is what we call the mayad reaction and it's a complex chemical reaction that we associate with roasting and baking and grilling and frying whether we're doing we're cooking meats or baking bread and cakes whether we're grilling or roasting you're going to see that browning of a product and it adds sweetness and adds complexity and that's really important in our coffee roasting this next sample has been taken at seven minutes in and you can see a nice tan color to the coffee and this is the part of the roast around about here where caramelization starts to happen and caramelization is going to be the breaking down of sugars into again more complex flavors but it's going to slowly start to impart some bitterness into the coffee as well so we're eight and a half minutes in here nearly three quarters of the way through the roast and it's the first time the coffees generally start to look brown if you look very close they haven't expanded that much there's been a little bit of expansion but that silver skin in the main is still there and the coffees have got a very muscled look to their surface they haven't expanded and smoothed out now inside these beams the chemical reactions taking place are creating carbon dioxide gases and water vapor and it's trapped inside the bean it can't get out the bean itself is too dense however we're about to enter a phase where that buildup of gas pressure inside the bean is about to be released we're just shy of nine minutes and first crack is about to start this is all those gases that were previously held inside actually forcing the way out of the beam and you hear a popping sound a continuous popping sound sometimes from inside the coffee roaster it starts off quite quiet and slow and it gets ever faster as we go for this next period it's quite an important period because at this point we need to make sure we've got that roast under control any failure to this point in time means the roast can either run away with itself or it can stall so the coffee roast has got to be very careful about everything they're doing to make sure they manage the roast through this next phase we're halfway through first crack now about nine and a half minutes in and the beans have definitely expanded their brown ring color and most of that silver skin has been shed i've done a little recording of first crack so you can appreciate the kind of sound it has so we'll play that for a moment so you can get a sense of what i'm talking about so this last sample was taken from the cooling tree itself these beans have just come out of the roaster they have had 11 minutes and 13 seconds in the roaster and they have puffed out a lot more and that seam has started to open it hasn't opened fully there's still a bit of that yellow chaff inside but it's definitely opened out and that's the kind of things we look for towards the end of the roast we don't just go on kind of figures and feedback from the roaster itself we're looking to see how the beans look are we happy with how they look and we can kind of combine that with information from inside the roaster before we drop the beans these beans now drop into the cooling tray we'll call them as quickly as we can and then we'll get them bagged up ready for shipping out so there we go the color changes that happen throughout the roast if you've got any thoughts comments or questions please feel free to get in touch thanks for watching and your likes and shares are really welcome", "KwJhC_U70qo": "[Music] this is Ken Lisa from coffee crafters and welcome to another episode of the Friday show today we're here to talk about blending coffee beans and we get a ton of questions on how to blend what do i blend first and and one of the things that we probably should talk about first is why we blend which kind of surprises a lot of new Roasters the number one reason people blend coffee beans is for an economic reason it's actually cheaper that will mix a lower quality bean not necessarily lower quality taste wise but a cheaper bean like a Brazilian with a higher quality bean and that becomes a blend so you know just to throw out a couple numbers that are that really happened in the coffee world you can get a Brazilian bean for a couple bucks a pound sometimes during the year and you might blend it in with something that is four dollars a pound so right away if you do a 50/50 blend you've reduced your raw material cost by 25% and if you're into coffee roasting for a business that's a big deal the number two reason is a supply reason if you've watched some of our earlier episodes you might remember the episode on comparing Arabica coffee with robusta in 1954 when they had the big Brazilian freeze and it decimated the aerobic of coffee they were scrambling to figure out some other coffee to mix in so that you know they would be able to supply and they mixed in the robusta and which led you know Maxwell Health Maxwell House coffee actually led the charge on that and over the course of the the next few decades they took that up to about 70 percent that they were mixing in and they found out that that supply issue actually turned into a big economic issue for them because it was so much cheaper to to make that blend and that's that's one was one of the earlier stories I'm blending now I may not have turned out exactly like they wanted because they didn't anticipate that the double caffeine content in those robusta beans they were putting in would make American coffee drinkers go to from three cups of day to two cups a day so somebody probably had an interesting conversation in the board room over that the last reason which a lot of our Roasters consider must have been the first reason which were quality and every roaster wants to differentiate themselves from the other roaster so they'll kind of come up with some proprietary blend and you know everybody wants an edge when it comes to coffee roasting and so they'll they'll want to blend those coffee beans and come up with something and one of the things about blending is it really is part of the fun of coffee roasting you know just blending it cupping it trying it out so another another thing that confuses people is just how they get started on blending and what some of those basic issues are now there's a lot of resources on site online and we're going to give you a link to a really nice article for people getting started blending but the number one question that we get about blending is do you blend the beans before or after roasting and there are reasons for both one of the reasons why you'd want to blend the beans after roasting is that coffee beans can be vastly different sizes so if you're blending in a robusta being maybe that 15% you're putting in your espresso blender but much smaller bean you wouldn't want to roast them you know with a larger Brazilian bean as an example and the other thing is being density you'll get a lot of different densities and coffee beans as you're roasting them so so that's some of the reasons why you would want to blend after now for most coffees they are roasted together so there'll be a close enough size profile and density profile that you can roast them together it really helps helps to mix them up and one other thing just as a general roasting thing to throw in here because it comes up when blending you know not all coffee beans out of the bag even single origin roasts all to the same color profile we've had customers call and say hey there's one bean you know Mike the cop the roaster is not working on this one bean and it's really a matter of density and size and not especially when you get into some of the organ that are graded differently where you get a lot of smaller beans with large ones they won't roast the same so something that you might want to do for an experiment when you first start roasting is come up with your own espresso blend one of the base coffees that is very common for espresso blend is a Brazilian coffee so Brazilian is probably used as a base more than any other bean now why is that Brazil makes up 1/3 of the coffee production on the planet so it's more common to find that Brazilian bean which is actually a lower cost so it's also an economic issue right than anything else so a very common blend for this first blend you might try would be 70% brazilian 15% Central American and it doesn't matter which Central American is what watt Amala Costa Rica whatever whatever is your favorite blend that in and then maybe even 15% robusta and you can leave that in or put it in you know remember that when we were talking about espresso they will put 10 15% robusta beans in there to boost the crema on the coffee so that is is definitely something that you can try now we found I found only some years ago on sweet Maria's about blending coffees I thought was excellent because it talks about some of why you blend coffee and then gives you some real examples on percentages that you can try and here's a link to that article right here that will go directly there you can it can read about that if you're a coffee roaster and you have some blends that you'd like to share with our our members of our Facebook page or our customers please send them in and we will post those for you and we'll even roast some up and try them if you'd like to do that so this is kin length of coffee crafters we've been talking about blending coffee we hope you found that informative thanks for watching [Music]", "I7Z5Oh-hl7g": "Hi everyone! many of you asked me to make more coffee videos,\nso I'm going to roast some green coffee today. Peru Machu Picchu coffee beans are still my favorite so far. I just keep drinking this. I'm picking the bad beans out. I usually don't throw away many beans. I only pick out the beans with mould inside. Okay! This coffee beans are always good quality. I only picked out about 10 beans out of 200g of beans. This room would be completely white with smoke if I didn't roast under the fan. I think you can hear this sound, it's the sound of a first crack. I just turned the fire off. The roasting is a little bit uneven but it's okay for me. I have to clean all the chaff up after roasting. with a vacuum cleaner. It's better to leave the coffee beans at least for a day after roasting, but let's try it out now. Itadakimasu ;) I've been consuming this coffee beans over a few years already. Because this is my favorite. That's why I keep drinking this. If you know any good green coffee that I can buy in Japan, please let me know in the comment below! This butch is the last coffee I have. Please let me know :) Bye!", "XePJBDU_svQ": "so you have your new super automatic coffee machine and you're excited to load it up with some of your favorite beans push a button and enjoy an excellent coffee espresso or milk-based beverage hey coffee lovers mark here from whole latte love calm today how to select good beans for your machine what to look for and beans to stay away from along the way I'll have a pro tip go over how to adjust your grinder for best flavor and have some specific bean recommendations now selecting good beans is about flavor of course but it's also very important for proper machine operation there are two types of beans that can cause problems dark roasted beans with an oily surface Sheen and beans with added flavoring so do not use beans with shiny oily surfaces or added flavoring beans that look like this produce ground coffee that's well kind of gummy or sticky over time it can clog the coffee grounds shoot between your machines grinder and brew unit a couple of well-known brands are not picking on anybody in particular here to stay away from are the very dark roast from Starbucks Kirkland and Pete's now lighter rose from those brands with no oily surface shine those are absolutely fine to use so if you like dark roast here are some alternatives that get that flavor and are fine for use in super automatic machines we like Phila Cory gran crema Forte le dark roast gimme coffees dark roast and Marella's Platini a-- if dark roast aren't your thing or you're looking to go beyond the typical and try something new stick around for the end of the video for some recommended medium roast as well as our favorite beans for milk based drink Sam here's a protip beans are often over roasted to cover up flavor defects in inferior low-quality coffees so always be just a little suspicious of those very dark roasted beans if they have an oily surface seen in many cases that's the flavor be it bad or good that's been roasted right out of the beam now here's a flavored coffee I picked up at a local school market when I say flavored I'm talking about oils and aromatics added after roasting and not flavor that was naturally in the beam notice the shine and the rather dark roast flavored whole beans should not be used in super automatic machines if you really like flavored coffee you can use it in pre ground form through the bypass doser of your machine so your machine has a grinder but what grind settings should use the two things to consider here are the type of coffee you are making and the roast level of your beans what you want to do is tend toward a finer grind for shorter coffees like espresso and set coarser for you know like a regular longer coffee for roast level tend toward a finer grind for lighter roast and coarser grind for a darker roast in the end we suggest giving more weights in determining your grind setting to the length of coffee over the roast level now a couple things to keep in mind when changing a grind setting first it's typically okay to a just a grind coarser multiple steps all at once but when adjusting finer adjust just one notch at a time brew and adjust again if needed if you can adjust the grinder while it is grinding you can adjust multiple steps finer in one go but again only make multi-step finer adjustments with the grinder actually running now be aware it may take a number of brewing cycles to get the full effect of grind size adjustments in your cup this is because most machines have adapted brewing systems that adjust the coffee dose after making a grind size adjustment now to finish up as promised here are some medium roast coffees that we really like from Parisi artisan check out their 24th Street blend Sumatra single origin and certified organic Bolivian all those are great choices as stepping-stones two more exotic coffees for espresso lovers one of our favorites is Guinea coffees leftist espresso blend it's made up of shade-grown beans it's balanced from

could be more than ten years old lisa guerrero found out it is all in the beans yuck ever have a really really bad cup of coffee there's a good chance it's because of the beans most coffee is brewed from fresh flavorful beans like these and they're usually just a few months old but you'll probably be surprised to learn that you may be drinking coffee that's made from beans that are old and I mean really old maybe eight or nine years old sometimes as old as a decade to find out how old your coffee beans may be Inside Edition producer Larry Posner went undercover posing as a coffee buyer interested in purchasing a shipment of cheap coffee during their conversation the coffee broker who sells beans of various qualities dropped quite a bombshell Lola's coffee I sold was a couple years ago there was a 1997 crop Oh 15 16 years old yeah we should point out that there's nothing illegal or improper about selling old coffee beans and it's perfectly safe to drink but Phil good laxen owner of Corbis coffee a specialty roaster in Denver says he never buys beans older than six months how importance are beans to the coffee beans are everything good lacson says he only buys premium beans at about five to six dollars a pound these cheaper beans sell for ninety cents a pound it's 90 cents for the stinky old stuff yeah drastically cheaper these beans are seven years old surprisingly easy to get really really old coffee the older the coffee gets the more it turns a brownish color and loses flavor oh wow that smells really bad really bad and you don't have to be a coffee snob to taste the difference it tastes pretty bad to me but could these coffee drinkers pick the cup made from old beans to find out we did a taste test this cup had the beans brewed from the seven-year-old coffee which sample do you think comes from beings that are 7 years old definitely this one Phil is she right yes most had no problem figuring it out it's like cereal or like stinky feet so who's buying these beans people who just want to flavor coffee you can mask the taste with a nice flavor and blend in a little bit of something else for a crop just to just a little more so where does the cheap coffee wind up mainly at large institutions like hospitals nursing homes or even vending machines so the next time you have a really bad cup of coffee you'll know why the National Coffee Association says there is a wide range of coffees available today all of which are safe for consumption they added that they are not aware of any beans on the market that are over a decade old [Music] you [Music]", "anT15cZc_4k": "welcome back to another episode of Dippet this week we'll be dipping coffee beans there was a post on the Instagram for Bob Claggett of I like to make stuff and he posted a coffee bean countertop and it got linked back to me it was encased in resin and while I don't quite have the revenue to buy that many gallons of resin I think I can do something small with it so let's give it a shot when molds are usually just made on the fly because I don't make the same thing over and over again so I don't know it doesn't seem to make any sense to me to keep the mold all right so let's pour our first layer and we're just going to pour in our first layer and again this is only 2 ounces oh is there something in there it's an eyelash I'm losing oil I pour helps to break the bubble as you see with the white on white on white but um there are definitely some bubbles there so I'm going to go ahead and it's like crazy hard to see I'll come back out a couple hours after that set and we'll move on to the next step got myself some coffee super cheap coffee and somebody mentioned on Twitter the oil in here will mess up the cast I said just douse them in a little denatured alcohol that'll help cut the oil alright so it's been about an hour since I soaked the beans and they all feel dry so we're going to go ahead and dip them in epoxy I'm going to pour a little bed down and I'm going to layer the coffee beans right in the middle here so I just want these little fellows in the middle the previous layer is actually still a little sticky so I'm kind of shoving them into it a little bit some it's actually not very attractive right now it's been a day I was stuff good in the way and I didn't get a chance to come back out and do the final pour yesterday I'm just going to fill it all the way up to the top looking pretty good definitely going to have some bubble issues here there's by far my favorite part I will let this set up and see what it looks like now I understand that making a cut on aluminum on the band side is not a huge deal but the truth is I've never done it before so I'm a little nervous about the process know if there's a tool that's going to work on aluminum in my shop this is going to be the one so here's my blank fresh out of the mold a little trouble getting out of the mold know what it is with me and molds well the point here is to take a really light pass and try to remove as many ridges as you can got one right there and then just got a catch down it's just as just no fixing that it's just totally loose now all right so let's jump forward two weeks so here's my second blank that just happened to magically appear at the same stage it is held firmly with the Chuck and let's go from there all right and I've got a nice handle shape that I like and what I would do is I drill for mounting it and then I can reverse it and clean up the end I'm not sure what happened but the resins kind of gummy hasn't didn't quite harden up perfectly so the threads aren't cutting in it so I cut off the top on the bandsaw and rough sanded it on the belt sander and I've just got it here mounted on a dowel that is not holding at all feeling four ridges with my thumb mr. my best which is not an ideal situation here it's going to look really neat when it's done no I'll keep at it all right so it came out pretty good look one of the very first projects I ever made was actually a coffee tamper so I've had one in my house made out of walnut since 2009 and I use it at least once a week if not multiple times details on this there's some that came through and so you've got this cool effect in the front here you can buy tamper bases and they're usually stainless steel but I don't like the tools to work stainless steel and I really wanted to make my own so I'm going with aluminum and it was fairly easy to cut with regular old woodworking tools and my scraper so yeah I would definitely work with aluminum again it was pretty fun I get comments all the time and I just wanted to give an update on the bacon handle vegetable peeler and it's holding up really well I honestly can't tell any difference from the first day it was cast I got to imagine it will be in there for a very long time so I will keep doing the difference for as long as people are interested in them if you liked it please share that'll actually helped us out a lot oh and now my next project it's going to be a little different I'm going to make something out of wood I know I know we will all get through it just trust me on this", "a8bul5_mQS0": "hey this is

getting a five-star review if the end coffee drinker just didn't like our flavor profile because that will happen we don't roast dark there are dark roaster drinkers out there i get it but in this case the three star review we received was for dry beans that's it nothing else in the review except for dry beans and the reason i am it just doesn't sit with me right is because i think there is a misconception behind dry beans or oily beans a lot of people perceive oily beans as being fresh and this is true with dark roast only there are two cracks in the roasting process when you roast coffee there's a certain level in which that unroasted coffee reaches in the temperature curve on the roasting curve where there is a rapid expulsion of gases mostly co2 and it creates an audible crack in the roasting process and this is important because this is the first point in the roasting process where you can grind and brew coffee beans when you continue to roast there is a second crack as well another expulsion of gases and this is where you get into the dark roast territory beans that are roasted past second crack are beans that are oily i think you may see where this is going so if you see oily coffee beans this means this is fresh roasted dark roast if you see dry beans that means it was roasted in between first and second crack all of our coffees are roasted in between first and second crack and so none of our coffee beans are going to be oily so i think there are people out there that think and this is fair because we've been marketed by some of the larger companies with this message for years is that the oil means it's fresh this is true for dark roast it is not true for lighter roasted coffee in fact i think when you see oily coffee beans there is a higher risk that these beans are going to be bitter burnt dry because dark roasted coffees run that risk there are many companies that buy cheaper coffee beans and roasted dark to cover up the imperfections in that coffee we want to bring out the true natural flavor of the high-end beans that we're sourcing so we only roast just past first crack to bring out these natural flavors so the short of the long is oil on the coffee beans occurs after second crack in the roast beans that are roasted past second crack in the roast are in my opinion dark roast there are some companies that will have oily coffee beans that are a medium roast i think anything past second crack is definitely a dark roasted coffee beans that do not show oil are either one not fresh dark roasts but that's not gonna be us or roasted in between first and second crack this is us so when people get our coffee beans they open the bag and see that there's not that oil there's not that shine there's not that sheen for us it's still fresh roasted i don't know how to explain it any further than that that's all i can think to say on that because it's a recurring theme and i wanted to address it and it's a common question so next time you go to the store if you're looking at the bulk bins and you see like the bins with oily coffees that means that they're freshly roasted dark coffees if you open any of our coffee bags any of our folly coffees they are not going to be oily because they are lighter roasted to bring out that natural flavor without the bitterness except for our darkest day roast available through the end of october let's end this episode on a shameless plug that's your folly coffee quick hit or have a nice day [Music]", "r7EDg2qOd1A": "hello and welcome back if you're just joining me my name is what my channel is all about making better coffee at home surpassed a year and a half I've been using Brit Express as my daily coffee machine and if you guys are thinking about buying one or if you have one please if you're new to this channel join my channel I have plenty of videos related least Express number one question from you guys is the pressure how a lot of comments that how come I never got the right pressure right pressure means if you're looking at the gauge between like around 12 o'clock maybe between 11:00 and 1:00 o'clock those the range there and so this morning I'm going to focus on their get the right pressure or whenever you guys bring the shot so this morning I have let me show you I have three different kinds beans okay so this is the that's espresso blend from Starbucks Cosco serozha it's about two month old so this is one of my favorite that's a good brothers coffee this is two weeks old okay so this is a optimal to drink right now and then this is a smart for my body just roast it for me two days ago so this is fresh as yeah so I'm going to put the three different shots and see that the shot quality and we are talking about the pressure so so if you guys saw me on my previous video I always start with number eight as my grinder setting on this side here and then my internal burr it's called tapper I already said at number five okay not in me that's a factory set so I don't mess with that until I really have to so let's so I I have a separate out 17 gram for each beans here and then I'm going to pull the shot so this morning I'm gonna be using I'm going to use couple tours okay I'm going to be using 3d printed do a sync funnel this is really handy by the way I'm gonna shout out to Jonathan making this tool for me this is great I'm gonna put the link down below as well this is awesome and also you guys see me with you know this senior level or distribution tool I'm gonna be using that so I'm gonna start with 17 gram of our Kirkland brand so again my setting is number eight I'm gonna put a shot at exact same setting r8 and interneural at number five so first shot by the way I already cleaned out grinder as well so this is all clean and I'm gonna give it a quick tip I'm gonna do that with all the beans get the consistency with these shots I'm not gonna worry about the ratio because this is same thing Ramin not gonna pour 34 like 1 to 2 1 to 3 ratio I'm not gonna worry about that I'm just gonna use the factory setting for that just sick of the easy to measure it so here we go so this is the 17 gram and two-month-old beans here so you see that or even that we have a good pressure but you already saw star copies pulling out I mean during the pre-infusion as well I mean looks good I mean pressure wise but as you can see there's no crema it's nothing I mean smells bad too maybe I should try this so this is the two-month-old even though this is freshly ground beans but I know it's gonna be bad Cheers yeah this is terrible okay terrible terrible beans Plus this is also dark roasted as well so yeah I mean if you guys like to you know what I'm gonna move on to good brothers okay so by the way so whenever using there's old sterile beans here's what usually happen all the puck is stuck okay let's see here if you see there or the stuck dark so let's move on to the brothers coffee so this is about two weeks old so last one was but maybe two month old could be two and a half month old so this is only two weeks old so be if I'm going to do it I'm going to put some little bit of beans in it to flush out the organs out because the bristow Express has a gap there so whatever you put the new beans in the old beans the left on the bottom so I like to put some little bit of beans in it flush it out [Applause] so now I'm going to use 17 grand I have good brothers okay so first of all the dis beans are so much fluffier than one before smells really good as well as a lot more fluffier and get a color too so this is shot number two again the settings are all the same the eight for the grinder setting and number five for the internal burg so pressure is or one one o'clock they're slightly just past 12 o'clock as you can see got lots lots crema coming out there are crema by the way as you can see there's lots cream out coming sis so this means only two weeks or so this is like the prime to drink and it looks wonderful I'm gonna try this it's called India India monsoon Cheers oh yeah very rich earthy hint of spice there as well this is definitely much more enjoyable so good okay so next thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do the two days old smart wrap and see what's the difference in pressure while two days old smart Ram I'm just gonna hem for our beans and flush out on the top rounder okay so this is another 17 gram here we go so as you can see there on the pressure is more like when up to maybe like one o'clock almost 12 o'clock and come down to right on the 12 o'clock range again you see lots less beautiful Kramer it was really rich dark Kramer there and again that looks really good too so I'm gonna try it's much rough today I think two days it's little I prefer like between one and two weeks but two is a little too early to drink but mercy Cheers yeah I mean little it's good don't get me wrong but it's really fresh taste still sweet my Sumatra is my personal favor but two days all these yeah even if I wait a few more days it's going to be awesome again so do you notice that my first shot was a couple months old Starbuck beans so whatever you see in the future just start flowing out the coffee in the shot of coffee there and then go after the right pressure around them but again that's the quality of shot is not that great and the compared to two other beans was great by the way that's all fresh so I know we talked about the grand or setting a lot but I think it's more so you need to have the right beans some reason the Britax press likes the medium roast rather than darker roast I mean so what about the darker roast I don't get I don't get as good as a resort from like medium roast so I hope this answer your question about pressure because again I'm some reason for my machine I always start with the number 8 and all depend on the pressure I go up or down and then my internal burr I mean that's my default setting I've been using for a year and a half now so I haven't messed with the internal the upper burr yet so sooner or later I have to adjust it but until then I'm just gonna live with a stick with number 5 but again the site the grander setting I know some of you play around maybe 2 or 3 that's really fine so which means you might want to adjust the upper burr to your 5 to maybe 2 or 3 I'm sorry maybe maybe 4 or 3 just play with that as well I have a video on that too so anyway I hope this video helps I do have Instagram page so check it out as well I'm gonna put the link below and see you guys next time", "vthEl3FQBfU": "Every year, McDonald's produces more\nthan 62 million pounds of coffee chaff. That's the unused dried skin\nthat comes off of coffee beans during the roasting process. And that 62 million pounds used\nto go straight to landfills. But now, Ford is taking\nthat chaff from McDonald's and turning it into car parts. Almost 140 million tons of solid waste was sent to US landfills in 2017. And when that waste hits a landfill, it creates a pile of trash that\nis impossible to take back. And incinerating the waste\ncreates carbon dioxide and other greenhouse-gas emissions that are harmful to the environment. But some materials don't\nhave to end up in landfills, like coffee chaff. McDonald's partnered with\nFord's research team, which was already using\nagave, wheat, tomatoes, and even denim byproducts\nto make car parts. The team discovered that\nchaff could also be used to make car parts, especially ones that need to\nwithstand high temperatures, like headlights and car battery covers. When the coffee chaff is\nheated to high temperatures and mixed with plastic\nand other additives, it turns into a material\nthat can be formed into various shapes. Not only will less waste go to landfills, but using the chaff actually\nbenefits Ford vehicles. Its headlights were made\nup of plastic and talc, a mineral that has to be mined. But now, the coffee chaff\nreplaces some of the talc, making the car part 20% lighter. Molding the coffee chaff\nalso uses 25% less energy than the previous material combination. The chaff component meets all durability and performance requirements, and it can withstand high temperatures much better than talc. So, how is Ford turning coffee\nbean skins into headlights? It all starts where the coffee beans are grown - South America. The beans are collected and\nthen shipped to the roasters. When the roasters roast the\nbeans, the skin comes off. The coffee chaff is collected and shipped to Competitive Green Technologies, a biotechnology company\nin Ontario, Canada. This is where the coffee\nchaff and plastic are mixed. The mixed material is then shipped to a company called Varroc, which molds and assembles the headlights. The company uses a process\ncalled injection molding. Pellets made from plastic and chaff are combined in the machine. The material is heated and mixed, then shot into a mold and placed under pressure that\nforms the shape of the part. Each headlight takes 30\nto 60 seconds to form. The final step is to ship\nthe headlights to Ford, where they get added to the cars. Ford began installing the headlights in its Lincoln Continental\ncars in December 2019. Other model cars are expected to follow. But this doesn't eliminate the environmental problem entirely. At the end of a car's life, some parts will still end up in landfills since they're still made out of plastic. Ford and McDonald's plan\nto reduce that waste by substituting traditional\nplastic with recycled plastic. And Ford hopes to have 100% recycled and sustainable plastic\non its vehicles by 2035. The sustainability\nefforts don't stop there. Ford is also looking into using other McDonald's waste products, like orange and potato peels. So who knows... Maybe one day, we'll be driving cars made completely from fast-food waste.", "RsaXEqTKa00": "what's baking you guys in this episode of baked which we're hoping on to the trend and making these super adorable eggless coffee bean cookies let's get started i'm starting off this super simple recipe by combining 1 4 cup of hot water with 2 teaspoons of coffee powder all you need to do is give it a mix let it sit and let the coffee dissolve [Music] now in a bowl i'm throwing in 3 4 cup of softened butter this is your regular salted butter and 2 3 cups of icing sugar [Music] now using a spatula i'll just combine the butter and sugar together until i get a mixture that's thick and smooth if you're using butter straight out of the fridge it'll be super cold and hard and it'll be practically impossible to do this step so just microwave it for a few seconds so that the mixture that you get is lump free and looks like this time to throw in the coffee that we had set aside earlier all of it [Music] and half a teaspoon of vanilla extract and then i'll just mix everything together at this stage your mixture is going to look very weird and all over the place but don't worry once we add in the dry ingredients it's all going to come together into a beautiful dough all right let's start adding the dry ingredients i'm using one cup of all-purpose flour which is maida [Music] 1 4 cup of cocoa powder and an optional 1 tablespoon of corn flour so i'm almost there one last thing that i need to do is to just mix mix mix until i get a dough which is thick but not very sticky the dough is ready and now this goes into the fridge for about 30 minutes so that we can chill it properly my dough has been chilling for 30 minutes and now it's the fun part i am just going to scoop out equal parts of my dough and roll it into an oval shape something which basically looks like a coffee bean and start placing it on my baking tray that i've lined with parchment paper if you don't have parchment paper you could just grease your baking tray lightly with melted butter or oil and put your dough on that the shaping work is all successfully done the single recipe gave me 20 coffee bean cookies the next step is to take the back of a knife and draw a line vertically across a dough ball just to give it that partition that a coffee bean has and can we please all talk about how adorable these cookies look right now and this is honestly my favorite part of making these cookies this is truly hashtag oddly satisfying and now these super cute coffee bean cookies are ready for the preheated oven i'm baking them at 180 degrees celsius only for about 8-10 minutes [Music] let me know what you think of these cookies in the comments below and i hope you guys will try these out very very soon happy baking", "jHJUpDx4noI": "yo Vince what are we doing today hi and welcome to a new series coffee with interns my name is Eric and I'm Jackie so today one of the things I've been supposed to do was try to boil coffee beans so we'll see how that works out today to preface this I want to say we're interns and we don't know anything about coffee okay so today we're gonna need obviously a pot yeah electric stove mm-hmm and obviously some water to boil and obviously we can't forget our coffee beans okay I recommend using kales coffee beans okay you can find us at WWE okay okay that's enough just get started [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay now that the water's boiling we can put a coffee beans in and to be honest I don't know the ratio so we're just gonna pour into it until like it looks right now whatever Hey just stir it got thought nice chopstick not gonna give it up I'm Meister probably bring the temperature down a little bit and you know we'll see [Music] all right Eric what have you noticed so after I think roughly ten seconds of boiling more or less it's starting to change a little bit colors I've may need to lay down okay so we're gonna check in quickly it's been about five minutes get a quick stir as you can see the color actually got a lot darker compared to how it was before one eternity later so right now it's going to simmer a little bit you see a house lost along the wall here actually yo like right now okay what are you first thoughts guys so yeah why does it look like this it's just kind of murky so it's so muddy yeah yeah right I see my father can't really smell anything I think all right all right let's try it oh my god oh my god yo you can poison me you put too many beans why don't you add some water in there a and got you some a kettle for you that's some water daxing me yeah nope so doesn't taste good oh oh oh why would you like wave what No okay stop stop stop I think it'll taste good now I don't know if I should really go for it again gonna watch for his reaction first go you boss stop this dude does they go how much beans you use and it's only for two cups of coffee listen you didn't tell me to stop so I just kept going like whatever all right let me let me try this you know honestly it doesn't taste like car it's a lot sweeter and it's a lot prettier than what you would actually expect from from a boiled coffee he's trying to one where we added water already okay this guy this guy's a poser man dude I know we added water let me add a little bit more but just a bit it tastes bad you know honestly I think it's a lot more interesting when you guys would think compared to like a normal coffee it's it's a lot sweeter it's it's really juicy it actually would be more like a fruit juice than it would be a coffee there's no that bitterness to be honest that darker flavor I suspect would actually be from the inside of the beans so what I'm gonna take from this is I'm actually gonna try to figure out different brewing techniques because of what we just tested here this coffee's really juicy but most of it is actually just from the outside being or the flavors being sucked up from the outside so I think if we ground the coffee differently I may be able to replicate something like this thanks for watching a coffee with interns I would highly not recommend you do any of this at home for your next coffee brew let us know in the comments what you want to see us interns do you next week alright everyone thanks for watching a video and removed it and hit subscribe turn the vacations and fireworks okay Lincoln bye oh that's tails coffee calm okay I'm going to follow us on Instagram too okay we're also on Facebook Twitter and only", "EO_YpdhJ5DA": "Do you love coffee and would you like to try coffee roasting at home? It doesn't need to be too expensive or complicated. We get our home coffee roasted for less than 20 bucks. Hey guys, it's Ale\u0161 from European Coffee Trip and as any coffee lover and coffee geek, I always wanted to learn how to roast coffee. I was lucky to observe many specialty coffee roasters at work but roasting coffee on my own was always my big dream. In this video we'll explain what green, unroasted or also coral coffee is and where to buy it and we'll help you to pick the home coffee roasting machine that is relatively cheap. Then we'll show you how we roast coffee using a popcorn popper that you might actually have at home already. At the end of this video I will share some extra learning material and also some more advanced home coffee roasters that are perhaps also more expensive but might be a good option for you in the next step. Okay, let's get into it! Let's start with a simple question. Why to roast coffee at home? I think there are many good answers, but for me, there are four main reasons. You learn about coffee in a fun way. Roasting coffee on your own pushes you to learn more about coffee origins, chemistry, but also about coffee brewing. You will always drink fresh coffee. Since coffee ages much slower in the raw form and you will roast in small batches you will have always some fresh coffee on your shelf. You can roast to your taste preference. Filter or espresso, light or dark. All of us have a slightly different taste preference and even your favourite roaster might not always meet your expectations. It's cheaper. Perhaps not at the very beginning when you invest in the equipment and also you buy coffee in a small quantities but later on you recognize the difference. If you can relate to one or more points, you are ready to go ahead with this video. We are not professional coffee roasters so we are making this video having a beginner in mind since we are just more advanced beginners ourselves. Coffee roasting is simple, but not easy. There are few things that you need to learn, but it doesn't need to be intimidating. There are two questions I want to answer before we will roast coffee together. What is green coffee and where to buy it? And what is a good home coffee roaster for beginners? Okay, so this is a green coffee bean. At this very moment it's very hard and dense. You could hardly grind it or extract any flavor from it. It's actually seed of a coffee cherry that is produced on a coffee tree that in our case grew in Colombia. When a coffee cherry is ripe at least for specialty or high grade coffee it's picked, processed, dried, packed and shipped to Europe. The real challenge for home roasters is the fact that the regular green coffee bags are 20, 50 or 60 kilos. That's not what you buy if you just want to give it a try, right? So what are your options to buy a small batch of green coffee? Say 200 grams, half a kilo or kilo. If you are in the US you are lucky because Sweet Maria's is an amazing place for buying small batches of green coffee and learning all about home roasting machines and craft of roasting. At the time of filming they had a selection of over 60 coffees in stock. In Europe things are a little more complicated. We get our green coffee beans from Georgi at Caventura in Germany. You can buy a home roaster starter kit for 29\u20ac that includes a popcorn popper. 250 grams of green coffee and 100 grams of roasted coffee for your reference. That's what we got for this video Another tips for buying small batches of green coffee in Europe online are Hasbean in the UK where you can buy most of their coffees also in a raw form and Roast Rebels in Germany. My ultimate recommendation though is asking your favorite local coffee roaster. Most of them don't officially sell green coffee for customers but if you are regular and explain your aim to learn more about coffee I think there is a big chance they will sell or give away a sample of their raw coffee beans. Perhaps they will add you also some extra learning tips and you can compare your home roast to their official one. So give it a try and have fun! Now I will give you a quick overview of the most common ways how you can start coffee roasting at home. and I will also explain why we pick to use a popcorn popper for this video. Once you have green coffee beans you can really start straight away in your kitchen with no extra cost. Your options are an oven or stove top and then you have a dedicated roasting machine that start at about 150 to 200 dollars and it goes to thousands. I will show some of the popular machines at the end of this video. Even though I did my first coffee roasting on a stovetop using a regular pan now, I believe the best option for the beginners is an electric popcorn popper. The problem with both oven and pan roasting is that it's quite difficult to agitate coffee beans so you don't burn them or roast them unevenly. I think it's almost impossible to do it in the oven to be honest. You have a better chance on the stove top yet it will take practice to do it right and you will need to keep stirring and rotating coffee beans all the time. For a stove top you can buy stool like StovePop or Nuvo. That makes it much easier to agitate coffee beans during roasting, you feel much more in control of the process. Yet you will keep moving all the time. What I like about the electric popcorn popper is that it automates the process. Hot airs keeps coffee beans in constant motion so you can focus on a visual control of roasting which means picking the desired roast color and other theory evaluation which means hearing the first crack. We'll use a popper from a German brand Severin and I saw that Nostalgia brand is a popular choice in the US. Of course, you can't control temperature, airflow, it's messy and you can really roast only a small batch of coffee. All these problems are solving more advanced and dedicated home coffee roasters but for much higher price. Eventually, many of you will get there and buy more expensive home coffee roasters. but in this case, I think it's good to start small and progress over time. All right. We have green coffee beans, we picked our home coffee roaster. Let's roast a batch of green coffee together. We actually went out of our studio because it will be quite loud and smoky and since we are filming at the middle of the day, not all our co-workers would appreciate the smell. But if you are doing it at home It's okay to do it by the window or in a well ventilated room. Besides the popcorn popper and green coffee we'll also need metal colander to collect a silver skin during roasting and to cool down roasted coffee. A wet towel to help us collecting chaff to keep the space relatively clean. A scale to measure beans before and after roasting, a timer to keep a reference about our roasting process. I will just use my phone. A bowl or tray to let the coffee cool down to a room temperature. I will start by preheating the machine. It will take about a minute and in the meantime, I will weigh 50 grams of green coffee beans That's about the optimal for this popcorn popper. You shouldn't overdose it which prevents coffee beans from moving inside of the hopper. Okay, our goal here is to turn green or raw coffee into brown roasted coffee and now we are lucky because we have the very same coffee roasted on the commercial roasting machine by Georgi. And this will be our reference for our home roasting attempt. Now we are roasting and we can observe a color change of the beans. First from green to yellow and then to brown. Between two and three minutes depending on the type of coffee beans You'll start to hear them popping like when making popcorn, that's called the first crack. Okay, so we are about three minutes in and I'm starting to hear some popping inside so it's a first crack. Now we need to pay attention. From there a real development of coffee starts and it will take another minute or so to reach a light roast for filtered coffee. Now we'll use our eyes and later perhaps experience to stop the roasting process and quickly cool down roasted coffee beans. All right, so we are done. Now let's quickly clean it up! Okay last important thing after you finish roasting with the popcorn popper is to cool down the beans very quickly because they are really really hot after finished and you need to cool them down quickly so they don't continue baking actually and developing some unpleasant flavours. Okay, so I put our roasted coffee on scale, we started at 50 and now it's 43 grams So we lost about 7 grams which is 14 percent and there's more or less the average between 10 to 20 percent loss and most of it comes from the water that evaporates and there are some other losses like like these beans that are on a table right now or the chaff that is all around the place. Now if you want to roast another batch, it's good to wait five to ten minutes so the machine cools down a little bit because it's not really built for long usage. Probably it will break down anyway, but this way you can keep it alive a little bit longer. Okay, so we are back in the office. Our coffee is already cooled down. It's more or less in a room temperature and it rested for a few hours and now we can put it into the bag. And tomorrow It should be ready for a brewing.

I hope that this video gave you all the essential information to start coffee roasting at home. Let us know in the comments if you tried and what was your experience. Before saying goodbye I wanted to mention some useful resources for those of you who want to keep learning right now. And I will list also some more advanced and expensive home coffee roasters for your reference. Let's start with coffee roasting online resources. There is Coffee Roasters Forum on Facebook with over 23 000 members. There is a home roasting talk at Coffeegeek.com with over 67 000 posts and there is also Coffee Roasting Subreddit with over 28 000 members. Then there are coffee roasting books. There is The Coffee Roasters Companion by Scott Rao, Coffee Roasting Made Simple by Raimond Feil. And Atlas of Coffee by James Hoffman, which is not really about coffee roasting but you need to learn a lot about coffee origins when you want to start roasting and now a short list of home coffee roasters. There is a Fresh Roast that you can get for about 190 USD Then there is a Behmor Plus roaster that you can get for about 449 USD, then Gene Cafe Roaster  for about 585 US dollars, Hottop Roast Basic that you can get for over 1 000 USD and IKAWA Smart Home Coffee Roaster System that you can get for 1250 USD.

we do rule number two buy from local coffee shops or local Coffee Roasters I try not to buy from the big-box big merchants pre-ground chock full of nuts crap don't do that rule number three make sure it has a roast on date yes coffee has a roast on date and I usually buy my coffee that's been roasted about two weeks ago but usually no more than that rule number four only buy enough coffee that you'll drink that week or that day that might be bad don't do that rule number three nope rule number five as soon as you get it home take it out of the bag it came in and put it in an airtight

"what's happening in the process between green beans and these yummy roasted beans let's find out throughout the roasting process a number of chemical changes happen giving rise to approximately eight hundred flavor and aroma compounds we still don't have a clear understanding of all of these reactions because it can be difficult to replicate in a laboratory setting but what we do know can be divided into two groups volatile and non-volatile are the two groups that the chemical components of roasted coffee can be divided into the volatile components contribute mostly to aroma while the non volatile components contribute to some of the basic flavors that we associate with coffee like sourness or bitterness one example being caffeine a non-volatile chemical component that is the major source of bitterness in your coffee during roasting the green coffee bean goes through a number of endothermic and exothermic phases the first is an endothermic phase meaning that energy is being absorbed in the form of heat and at this point the beans lose their moisture turn from green to a soft yellow and begin to smell bread like plant compounds like chlorophyll begin to decompose as well next begins an exothermic phase where energy is being released in the form of heat steam as it would be with coffee once the moisture in the bean evaporates in the steam it escapes by rupturing the cells causing a loud crack and then begins the next endothermic phase in this phase a lot of chemical changes begin to take place the beans begin to develop the flavors in the aroma of coffee and of course they turn the rich brown color that we know is coffee carbon dioxide starts to build through complex pyrolytic reactions when pyrolytic reactions plateau at approximately 410 degrees another exothermic phase begins as co2 and other various gases are released in another loud crack and from here the roaster would bring their coffee into the rapid cooling phase to stop this last exothermic

time", "q8zQUas30dM": "yeah my name is Tata here career cafe today I'm going to do a little bit of talking about different types of coffee and their varietals and characteristics toffee similar to pretty much any other agricultural product that we we enjoy somewhere to apples or pears really anything like that in the sense that there's different kinds of them there's granny smith apples there's Red Delicious apples there's red pears there's blue pears and green pears other kinds of things so for a couple examples of that today I've got three different coffees in front of me I've got one espresso and then two other coffees one from Kenya and one from El Salvador one thing starting on the left here you might notice that the espresso is a bit darker of a roast and the reason for that is because inside of the espresso machine there's quite a bit of heat and pressure and you need a little bit more carmelization just kind of a different different structure and different roasts in order to stand up to that heat pressure and time and still have a tasty product on the other two pop beans roast a little bit lighter just to really to show the characteristics of the beans themselves we'll start with the one here this is a pop Kumar of arrival from the Mercedes farm in El Salvador it's in the Las rawness mountain range and the PACU Mar you may notice is a bit larger of bean it's very true to its characteristics of the varietal and as a flavor profile it has more of a citrusy lemony kind of a really nice brightness and a nice sweetness in that sense the coffee next to it from Kenya is a bourbon varietal and this is from the Burmese Society in Kenya unlike the pak'ma'ra Kenya is much more kind of juicy and fruity and kind of that plummy stone fruit sweetness that is really nice and coffee there's another type of coffee which unfortunately I didn't have any to show you guys it's actually a mutation called P berry the bean that we drink is actually pretty much the pit of the coffee cherry and sometimes the two halves of beans which is what coffee that we know really looks like will morph into kind of one smaller B and that some people say that it kind of this is the flavor and kind of gives it a little more pop and vibrancy I just think it tastes good thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed learning about coffee you", "NBzTRnWwq2g": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hello everyone my name is Peter wolf and thank you for watching this is the Wolfe College of Coffee v-log and we're back in the Roasterie today and I wanted to really sort of guess share some of my thoughts and stories with you about cooling coffee we've been doing some experiments here at Wolf about you know how what cooling times do in terms of sweetness and it's been really amazing and also looking at you know the speed of agitation and controlling that agitation during the cooling process and I'll share that with you at the end of at the end of this fear log but wearily I guess on what I wanted to talk to you and start with this ticket you're thinking about well why is cooling so important well as we know with roasting coffee the main sugar that were using this sucrose and one of the issues is that we want to be able to you know cool that sort of sucrose down quickly enough to sort of retain the sort of inherent sweetness and most importantly it's a soluble and so the solubility of it we need to be able to add obviously our hot water to it to be able to take out the the sugar now we do know that if we have a really long cooling time this can obviously add to some dull neutral sort of flavors and flattens the coffee up a little bit but also what happens is the shook the sucrose and the long polymers that are sort of that are created it basically finds other ways of attaching itself to other parts of the coffee structure therefore decreasing the level of solubility and therefore making it sort of less sweet so cooling is very very important the general rule of thumb has always been look we've got to get the coffee below 40 degrees Celsius in under four minutes and and absolutely I think that's a fair you know it's a fairly tried-and-tested kind of theory we can definitely see when we have coffee that goes beyond four minutes at four to five minute that one minute gap you can see it's a very noticeable difference but for us you know we've been trying to get our cooling down to three minutes and we've done that by actually having a variable speed controller on the agitation and one of the things that I noticed is that you know the faster you speed the coffee up then obviously it's almost a bit similar to almost that principle of centra centrifuge you know we have a very deep bed of coffee on the outside of the cooling train it comes down to the middle which is quite thin and the thing is that we've got a blower sitting on the bottom and this creates of the velocity that we need and air we'll find the least resistance area and that will pull from that first which is the middle so effectively what I have what's happening is where we're cooling the coffee quite quickly towards the middle of the current e-trade but on the outside it's taking a little slower because you know there's less sort of velocity or suction being applied to it so it sort of got me thinking too well how do we kind of almost you know start start with the you know we'll just call it a fast sort of our p.m. and then obviously look to slow it and reduce it down through the end throughout the course of the cooling period so then we get an even bed or an even mass that can be cooled consistently and those results have been very very positive for us today albeit you know there is a caveat there is wintertime here so we have some really lovely ambient conditions to roast in so I will be getting back to you as a postscript at the end of ESA in six months time at the end of our summer and see what what results we are getting in terms of taste but key things I guess to take home for you is make sure throughout the course of your roasting day that you're maintaining and cleaning the roaster a little roller brush we have mentioned these before these are quite amazing that just make sure that we keep keep the perforation that's nice and clean and free of debris at the end of the day just wiping down the cooling tray with the microfiber cloth with some water to make sure any residual oils and and and perhaps any sugars that may be sort of starting to form or build up is removed if you're wanting to actually check you know what is the temperature of your coffee throughout the course of the cooling down process just a little infrared thermometer and you can do some simple kind of surface temperature measurements to give you a sort of a feeling for that also looking at making sure that the impeller is cleaned at a monthly basis the pipes are and the fluid of that particular system are also clean because you know if we have you know really good sort of suction and ventilation and we're creating a good sense of velocity this is going to actually help in terms of the cooling process so they get I wanted to talk to you about cooling of the green coffee and I said cool roasted coffee and sweetness it's been a real pleasure spending time with you this afternoon get you thinking a little bit more about cooling as forming part of your your coffee roasting profile and I look forward to sharing our results on the variable speed agitation in the next six months thank you for watching [Music]", "eadHZdzeM5U": "here's another quick tip from whole latte love Arabica and robusta they're the two main species of coffee but what's the difference well Arabica accounts for about 70% of the coffee consumed it has more sugar and oils which leads to flavor characterizations of sweet fruity and zesty acidity with a light feel in the mouth robusta gets characterized with terms like earthy and woody and has a lower acidity giving a heavier feel in the mouth as for uses Arabica is used in blends and prepared a single origin meaning all the beans come from the same growing region for robusta high-quality varieties can make up 10 to 50 percent of Italian style espresso blends it's also used as a filler and some mass-market coffees and for making instant coffee Arabica generally cost more than robusta it's grown in higher altitudes is more susceptible to pests requires more attention from the farmer and has a lower yields another large difference is caffeine concentration Arabica coffee zavoral 1.5 percent concentration and robusta runs about 2.7 percent the beans look a little different to Arabica beans are more oval and flat while robusta beans tend to be more round while single origin coffees are a growing trend it's done almost entirely with Arabica coffee in fact outside of its usin espresso blends you'd be hard-pressed to find a robusta being used in specialty coffee the number one source for everything coffee whole latte love calm like this", "QyLGe7-0JgI": "My name is Lennon. I\u2019m a green coffee specialist.  What is a green coffee bean? Green coffee, it is going to be unique for where it\u2019s from, how high up a mountain it\u2019s grown, when it\u2019s harvested, how it\u2019s processed. Those beans are going to hold a lot of information about what we\u2019re going to get in a cup.  When a roaster gets a coffee they are making sure that heat is applied specifically,  and allow that coffee to develop and go through the Maillard reaction and the sugar browning and caramelization.\n\u00a0 That\u2019s where we get our recipes and the Starbucks flavor that our customers love. ", "JCHOyimTP_o": "I know basically nothing about coffee when I go to a coffee shop most times I have no idea what I'm ordered so I'm gonna change that and then next to the episodes I'm breaking down aligning the three most important aspects and making the perfect cup of coffee the bean the roast in the brew will serve with a bean for help I turned a minneapolis-based coffee importer cafe in points for some information on the differences between different types of coffee beans and to learn what kinds I might prefer best that's a lot of coffee first and that would know up so here at our warehouse in Minneapolis we have roughly four million pounds of coffee at any given time we source coffee from about 26 different countries after roasting it's about 90 million cups of brewed coffee Wow it'll last a while pretty extensive so why does coffee general need to be growing in the mountains so it gets very cold at night at high elevation and what happens at night is that the coffee cherry actually enters the state of stasis and then when the Sun comes back out then suddenly it releases all these nutrients and starts to grow and it's that cycle of stasis to extreme growth that really help them bean to be a more flavorful more vibrant cup all of the coffee that we have here is Arabica in the global production there's about 22 billion pounds of coffee that's sold a high percentage of that is robusta which is a lower grown lower quality variety so robusta is probably what most people are familiar with you know the old cans of coffee that they would see in their parents house it was a pretty big taste difference between those two species and one is very leathery flat cardboard II that's a word and these typically are more interesting or can be at least next I checked out the tasting room with Dan to try out a sample of different beans in a process called cupping cupping is the way that we evaluate coffee here in the coffee industry what you're looking for are the inherent qualities in the coffee bean you're looking for acidity flavor sweetness body and your overall appreciation of the coffee we've got Mexican coffee here we've got a Kenyan coffee Colombian coffee Brazilian coffee and a Costa Rican coffee so not only do we have coffees from different origins but we have coffees that are processed in different ways let's go ahead and evaluate the dry fragrance of each coffee go ahead and grab a cup and you can tap the grinds a little bit give it a little smell you smell anything in there smells like coffee like coffee good so to me this coffee smells a little nutty a little chocolaty and there's probably a little bit of caramel in there and I'd say that's pretty typical for a Mexican coffee maybe smell that so let's go to the next one this is Kenya hopefully this one's a little bit more of a stand out to you good actually doesn't smell that much like coffee a lot of people say that about Kenyan coffee so some of the common notes that people will use are tomato or bright red berries pretty accurate for this coffee and this is the last one we've got this is a Costa Rica so naturally processed coffee what that means is that they pick the cherry off of the tree and they put it on a drying bed and it dries like that oh yeah definitely fruity there's no coffee it's fall that way so now we'll move on to luring the water into the into the cups to brew the coffee that'll take about four to five minutes we'll let it steep and then what we'll do is break the crust with spoons will evaluate the aroma that comes up once you break that crust and you'll push through to break the crust and you'll do it three times I'm go ahead and rinse your spoon off and we'll go to the next cup for a lot of people this is the most intense aromatic experience that they have with coffee breaking that crust can really releases a lot of oils and a lot of active components in a coffee that contain a lot of the things that make it taste really good you know put them together like this in the back of the cup yeah and then just pull them together like that uh-huh and scoop that stuff up okay that's the stuff that we don't the most important part of cupping which is what we call evaluating coffee is aspirating the coffee so that it covers all of the taste buds on your tongue and this is what like in wine tasting when you see people slurping wine mm-hmm it's exactly what they're doing they're trying to spray the coffee liqueur all over their tongue and then spit it out oh you can swallow it if you want but you'll get super caffeinated drink it what are the kind of notes that you're tasting in this in this Kenyan coffee that we're prepping yeah it seems not not super bitter a little bit sweeter let's move on to the Columbia all right that's it's a little bit more bitter okay less acidic I think how does it feel in your mouth does it feel creamy or really light or it feels fairly light maybe not I think the Kenyan is a little bit lighter maybe yeah I would agree so I would say it's a pretty classic Columbian profile it's got dark chocolate a little bit of medium acidity not a super-heavy body probably medium it's a nice sweet balanced coffee let's move on to Brazil yeah chocolate flavor I smelled is definitely still there I'm getting some nuttiness which is pretty common for Brazil let's go to Costa Rica yeah it's definitely very fruity yeah it's cool huh yeah it's very different like I don't know that's like what I'd want for a cup of coffee in the morning or not that's a really good point I think a lot of people find natural coffees to be intense and sort of hard to handle they drink a lot of it alright now on to Mexico it seems pretty good just kind of everyone's kind of extreme flavours but this one kind of seems like a balance just kind of a good normal coffee yeah I really like this coffee it's got like a milk chocolate flavor to me as opposed to the Columbia which had more of a dark chocolate mm-hmm it's got some medium acidity it's very balanced its creamy I would say this might be what I would like want in the morning for like a normal cup of coffee the other ones have a nice interesting flare to them but I like this one best well you know since you like the Mexican coffee so much it might be really cool to go to Mexico and visit some producers there you could probably set you up with some nice coffee sounds great fix the cafe imports I now have an idea of what vast differences different beans can offer to the taste of coffee and an idea of what type of bean I prefer best and where I might want ahead when I make my coffee entirely from scratch up next I'll tackle the next important aspect of making the perfect cup of coffee the roast be having yet

labor of love so many steps in the process so much time so many miles travel and the briefs that becomes independently responsible to protect the potential of that product grinding is the last step before brewing and once we've gotten the coffee there's no going back let's take a minute and familiarize ourselves with the components of these grinders each grinder has a hopper a bean release door this grinder has a dosing chamber a dosing handle an on and off button and the most important feature for the briefs understand is the grind adjustment collar in our industry there are two main types of commercial expresso grinders doser and dosa less now the main difference is that in the old system the barista has to control how much coffee goes in there by hand and in the new system a little timer is programmed to control how long the grinder runs and how much coffee comes out one of the main factors differentiating these commercial-type espresso grinders from the cotton grinder in your home is the blades or in this case we call them burst a typical espresso grinder uses a set of bursts like this the advantage of this type of equipment is that it gives us a very consistent coffee grind size this is a basic set called flat versus other types of responders use conical bursts the advantage of the conical type is that they cut faster they create less heat less friction and they

a frying pan this is called the gene cafe it's got a little cylinder that I loved with the beans a little roast about a half a pound at a time and for me and my wife that's good enough for four days of coffee I've pre set the temperature to 424 degrees and I generally roast for about 25 minutes but I need to keep an eye on it because the roasting time will vary depending on how how fast the beans roast and then I turn it on the coffee beans as they rose behave somewhat like popcorn and so they will pop and that's called the first crack of the beans they swell up a bit they begin to shed some chat and they enlarge and then they do a second pop a second crack later on down the processes one of the nice things I like about it is you can roast it to the degree that you like when you go to the store you get the beans roasted how they like it and you have to take whatever you get I like my beans sort of medium dark not too light but because I like a little caramelization in the beans sea beans to me or a nice medium brown color the smell that's coming out of the roaster now is no longer that caramel toasty smell it's more of a little bit of a smoky smell and it's about to tell the truth about it internal temperature it's 240 degrees the roaster will turn off and at that point I'll be able to take the beans out and finish the feeding process the general rule of thumb that I go

immediately before brewing and use them within two weeks but unless there's a coffee roaster around the corner from you that's not always practical so what's the best way to store your beans well the enemies of coffee are air moisture heat and light so to keep your beans fresher for longer periods keep them away from those things that means storing in airtight containers in a cool dark and dry place so being cool and dark a refrigerator seems to make sense right well although some people do store in the fridge it turns out it's actually about the worst place to put your beans they're very poor so they readily absorb odors and he smells in the fridge well they'll end up in your beans but what about freezing beans well according to extensive blind taste testing of espresso done by Kent Fox and Jim Shulman at home barista calm it may be appropriate in some cases they found freezing coffee immediately after roasting in airtight containers in a very cold chest style freezer resulted in no taste preference over fresh unfrozen beans after four months of storage so they concluded freezing as a viable method for the preservation of coffee beans roasted for espresso for a period of at least four months if you do freeze beans be sure to thaw them overnight before use frozen beans can damage grinders especially in super automatic espresso machines and once thaw do not refreeze as condensation will draw moisture into the beans so freeze only in sealed portions that are usable within a week or so but short of freezing your beans be sure to store your coffee beans in an airtight container and a dark cool and dry spot and not in the fridge and of course for best flavor always grind them right before brewing the number one source for everything coffee whole latte love calm",

like old-fashioned 70s that thing what you'll need is a hot air popcorn popper a bowl for catching chaffed unroasted green coffee beans a thermometer this is optional a baking sheet for cooling and an airtight container for storage hot air air corn popper air corn design of things so that it's not a thick start by preheating the hot air popcorn popper for about 30 seconds then add a half a cup of unroasted green coffee beans to the vessel and do not leave it unattended roasting should only take about five minutes now it's time to roast and there are 10 stages of coffee roasting the first stage is called the green stage the first few minutes the bean will remain a greenish color the second stage is called the yellow stage and the bean turns a lighter yellowish color and it mitts a grassy smell next is called the steam stage in which the bean starts to steam as their internal water contents start to dissipate next is the first crack this is an audible cracking sound where the real roast starts to begin the sugars begin to caramelize and it actually sounds a lot like popcorn right after the first crack is called the city row stage and this is where the Rose can be considered complete at any time according to your taste next is the City Plus roasts where carmelization continues oils migrate and the bean expands in size this would be a good place to end the roast after that is the full City roast when you are on the verge of what it's called the second crack now after that is the second crack at which point it sounds a lot like popcorn but more intense a few pops into the second crack and you at a full City Plus roasts next is the dark roast as the roast becomes very dark the smoke is more pungent and the sugars burn completely and then finally you hit the burn stage the burn stage is when the sugars completely burn and the roast will taste like charcoal do not enter the burn stage once you've reached your desired roast shut off the popper and spread the hot beans on the baking sheet to cool down quickly once the beans have cooled down store them in an airtight container like a mason jar if you've roasted your beans really dark wait about 12 hours before storing the beans so that they can gas off so that's it it's all you need to know you can so that's it if you have one of those hot air popcorn poppers at home you can actually roast your own coffee

going to be roasting our own coffee beans we did a previous video where we showed you our gorgeous coffee plant with the bright red berries on it so these berries have been harvested off of that plant and the first step in the process of turning these into coffee those pulping the berries the easiest thing that I found is simply squeezing them and the seed will pop right out of there they're really slippery you may lose a few on the floor when you're done popping them you just want to rinse them really well and remove any floating beans and extra pulp and the next step in the process is fermenting these because we need to remove that slippery Musil edge layer so you just soak them in fresh water and either glass or plastic bowl for probably two to three days you'll know when they're done because that Musil edge layer will no longer be there and the beans will won't feel slippery anymore after that you just want to rinse them really well and then the beans need to be dried and that can be done outside in the sunshine or on a sunny windowsill or even in your food dehydrator I did these in my dehydrator set right around 100 degrees and it only took a few hours you know when these are done because they'll get this crisp flaky texture and the best way that I found to remove that parchment layer is to put these between two paper towels this is the final step before we're ready for roasting and you can just crack off that outer flaky layer and then the beans will peel right out of there and this is your green coffee bean and it's ready for roasting we wanted you to see what these look like so we're gonna set up and come back for a third video where we're actually going to roast our harvested beans with you", "cfICa7APJ8Y": "hey hey now this is what I want to be doing for a while this is stabilizer coffee beans a few people have asked me about this as you know coffee is my thing I am luckily enough to have a very good friend who is a roaster earnest Josie coffee here's rowdy back veins which still slee yeah make the stand with coffee to the bra over estrella can argue their single origin all right so just watching me this time just gets all the natural oils and stuff which beans fat I just want the cactus juice to take up as well as possible we still watch deep whooshing straining now you can see the color of the Islamic see it changes it because of the practices taken out of the beans [Music] so I'm lately sort of baking tray but my pretty thick at the end anything you have to be a little bit careful of is not having like a load a stone stuck between it if you do put him a gun bang and your oven please help from the vapors campaign so I actually stuck this outside for a couple hours and made sure that all the vapors are good before I weighed it and so he's way before you stabilize you really want to know that you losing moisture watch this in the oven and then obviously you can weigh out towards and find out what its uptake in here isn't so not an easy ride down like it in Yemen so I start pre low like 40 degrees C just that's it so build up so you don't know cracking any beans or anything I'm bit of strategy what I'm gonna see do that for like 40 minutes and then stick it up to 100 degrees C hundred degrees C is the boiling point of water so just make sure there's no water near now this sat in the oven for probably two days cut remember don't have may not have you need to be that long all you do is take it out weigh it every four to six hours I mean it stops losing weight you down yeah so just gonna wet suits I guess I have replant times shouldn't way that still see that wasn't it this is critical let's see if you lose one or two baby stuff but you don't really you still gotta go out there so you can see that's one point three key eyes and we were 1379 and then I think we came down to 1328 memory after the isotoners will join out of it later once before stuff that stuck that sorry for two hours for 30 20 summers our coffee the ass attorney movie so here's the thing what you do not want to do is just like it's straight into cactus juice obviously it's it in the up on it I'm something degree Celsius and the Curie temperature of cactus juice is 93 degrees Celsius and actually it'll start curing from about 30 degrees Celsius for memory like cello fires which II don't want so what I do is I grab my coffee beans I whack them through a funnel and they sort of cool down as they're falling the critical thing really is to get the temperature as low as possible because these beans will hold will with temperature between them so it's still pretty fun off and then what I actually do is I see a lot my vacuum chamber and I vacuum all of the air out of it so essentially when something warms back up it draws all the moisture out of the atmosphere that's Troy oh yes I stick in the vacuum chamber actually draw all the air at the vacuum chamber and let it cool in a completely moist earth free environment seem to suck up adding new moisture but they know they're nice and cool so that's it in here overnight I think Maria needs an arrow too be what helps to know cakes just appeals bugger this activator make sure you shake it up really nicely and stops to get a decent lumps and stuff in it Chucky's you see where I put that bit fabric over the top and pierced it it's not for self got absolutely changed in water crap because it just it's so highly pressurized so just basically make sure you put it all in all of it you can take a bit of cactus juice out of the container and put it in the activator pot and then tip it all and shake it up and then dip it and then just shake the crap out of it if you do find there's any lumps bumps leave as in I've had it once before where I had to sort of get a bar in there and squish it all up but I actually think I forgot to shake up the activator first stop those beats on tops of the babies flatten please Rebecca they just folk Deathlok constantly actually you can run to stabilize quite a few of them still slow come on Toby trying to show me  to the pump one joy and at the time opportunity to hateful make hustle button so for memory this was about 40 minutes this time-lapse look [Music] Dean's coming unless cheese coming cheese coming [Applause] so it helped they've stopped the bubbles have stopped days okay turn this sucker off the being hosted by myself which I think just tightened up the pores of the probe made it a much more dense material stabilized been before in like three days but these are wonderfully good five you can see here it's chopped there's a line there I think so many deputies fingers I assume you go you can see it's a Purple Line there so it's chopped way about 1250 mm which actually is the least it will drop during vacuum it's actually under atmospheric pressure then it soaks up most of us issues because it's been running for five days I'll leave it under under atmospheric for ten days don't just like magic so actually after about seven days of decanted into another pot just just a bit nerve-racking journey now what I'm doing differently here is I'm not putting monster because I did when I was doing it first and put on to trace a big fat pilot on me Qbert that's from afterwards yeah a lot more catalyst to be stuck between doesn't it was nice when you Caston [Music] so to stop those in the oven and about 100 degrees Celsius to cure the cactus Susie for that too I think your house and then just let him see magic Krusty be you can see they don't come to start to get a really break up pretty easy Stinkmeaner pop smash them up make me paint again tipping the arrows once it's casting resin you can turn my lathe at work how much is about getting cheaper least what I did earlier bass

Test Kitchen at a coffee bean and we're going to learn how to brew the perfect cup of coffee so Michelle it's all about the coffee right the quality of coffee to begin with of course it starts with a coffee and we buy only the top 1% of coffee so we highly recommend that you buy your coffee at a coffee bean now when you're storing coffee I was always told you keep it in the freezer keep it nice and cold and ready is that true yeah you know what that is such an old wives tale you absolutely should not confuse ER it really wants to be in a cool dry place and it wants to be airtight so air and moisture are the enemies of coffee how do you choose the grind for the coffee it's really based on the way that you're preparing the coffee so I'm doing a pour over here and I want to choose sort of a medium grind and if I choose something that's too coarse for the way I'm brewing the coffee then the water is going to go through very very quickly and create a really light fruit so our recommended recipe is to do two tablespoons for every six ounces of water so this step is 12 ounces I'm going to go ahead and do 4 tablespoons and then water is crucial I mean coffee is 90% water so we want filtered hot water great and it's really that simple and so this is going to achieve that yummy full-bodied a medium roast coffee perfect well-balanced coffee and of course if you like stronger coffee you would use more coffee if you like something lighter than you would use looks yeah I know sometimes at home when you're making a full pot of coffee you're like what do I do with this extra coffee I always just put it in the fridge is that a good tip perfect right it's hot anywhere hidden perfect that's what my husband does all the time well Michelle thank you so much you and be sure to check out our get the dish original ice blended coffee drink we got to hang out here so much in the Test Kitchen so much fun with Michelle thanks so much you", "0VUOCYVWKyw": "it's the gala Miranda show not really it's scaling Miranda from Seattle coffee gear and we are Miranda is compiling questions from our customers and then we're answering them just so short videos for you and you have one for us I do yeah so what is the kind of staling time or how quickly do do your grounds or hold bean stale so what's the difference between whole beans will last there's two different types are processing for whole beans if you get a large factory that does whole beans like Lavazza out of Italy they do a nitrogen flush on their beans which makes their expiration date way out there because they have to distribute worldwide exactly and it makes the the bean last stay fresh much longer once you open that bag three weeks or so and you really want to use it up in there two and a half pounds 2.2 pounds so you want to use it up about three weeks or so I've gone beyond that it's not the end of the earth do now put it in a in the freezer or the refrigerator once you open it cool dry place something like our air escapes that we have on the webpage now vice versa local roast coffees do not do the nitrogen flush exactly so here in the United States they say that those beans are best to begin to be used at about four to five days off because they do off gassing the gas comes out of them and before that they're not so hot right once you open it up and start using it you're probably looking at 1012 days mm-hmm would you agree with that yeah yeah so 1012 days now whole bean that's that's whole bean ground coffee once you ground the whole beans within 15 minutes they start to diminish and if you go buy a bag of ground coffee down at the store you grind it you take it home the first day not too bad second day you'll see a little bit of a different little diminishing third day for two it gets worse and worse worse and we have people calling up saying oh I just bought this bag ground coffee I don't know it's a matter it's my machine it's most likely your coffee because it once it's ground it starts diminishing immediately absolutely so cool dry place again for the same whether it be ground or whole beam but use it up yeah well and I can totally testify to that because I've even ground coffee brewed a shot while I was training and then I brought grind coffee start talking about the sheen and get carried away I'm 20 minutes later oh let's go ahead and pull that shot it's at the same timing lousy yeah what was that yep no that's true or if you take and you grind up the coffee into the portafilter and put it in the machine and go oh geez I forgot to go get my milk yeah you'll go good the milk in the refrigerator and that is sitting in there against the hot brew head it turns it in and changes everything so it is crazy but you're wondering where you're not getting good shots it's not as a technical when it comes to drip but when it comes to espresso yeah mm-hmm gotta be right down yeah fresher is better right thanks we're gonna thank you mm-hmm", "5OlrwOEFQew":

has higher levels of these chlorogenic acids but if you look at the studies that have been done on this coffee bean they are not good studies there are very few people pay for paid people who make

Hello! Oh...competition! Competition! I feel like Starbucks is super basic. *gasps in horror* You know like the basic girls, like Hey! Whatever frappucino...\nI want a soy latte with skimmed milk and... ...yeah I want it like, grande. I want a pumpkin spice latte.\nYeah, yeah. Like what? They are overpriced! That I have to say, yes! They are really overpriced.\nBoth of them! Starbucks got all the seasonal flavours. Like the Christmas Candy-cane and the Gingerbread. You either like it or you don't. It's always a hit for me baby STARBUCKS! YOU MY MAN! I prefer Coffee Bean because I feel like They have a greater variety of drinks. And it's not too sweet. Starbucks is really sweet. Mmm...that I've to agree. R: CBTL (Coffee Bean)!\nX: Starbucks! ...Starbucks. P: Coffee Bean!\nC: Starbucks! Hahahah! Cos' I know my sh*t! Ooh! What is this drink? This looks like Milo. I think from the smell I already know who is who. This is confirm Starbucks. Oh my god. This one the coffee the coffee like wow... there man. This one got the coffee bean smell. Like when I walk into the Coffee Bean Store, *deep inhales* It's this smell! It's damn sweet! And honestly I can only taste the chocolate. It's like the chocolate right they crumble it and then they *swirls* You know. Mix it. Starbucks \u662f\u4f60\u5417? When I drink it just reminds me of those days where I have to stay up late and work and study at NUS. *sad laughter* Ok, go for it. The coffee is really strong here.\nYeah. If you put it in Milo terms right, This is a Milo with water. Ah... This is a Milo with milk. I really like this one because it's really sweet, it's creamy It's basically like... This taste like a milkshake! Cos' Java Chip is a coffee drink, I expect a kick of coffee taste. This one would be closer to my expectation of a Java Chip Coffee Frappucino. For me, let's say you're telling me this is a coffee drink Then I'll prefer B. But if you're telling me it's a chocolate drink, then I'll prefer A. Honestly it's the same thing. For me on the first look, A is lighter than B. Yeah! Just like the one before! I would say this is more of a caramel-flavoured milk. The milk is the strongest here.\nYeah. There's this milky aftertaste but the texture is very thin. What's that face? Hahahahah! You can taste strong coffee you can taste strong milk but you don't taste the caramel at all. It tastes like a caffe latte! Instead of a caramel macchiato.\nYeah. To me like this one worth my money. True, true. \nCos' it's not just milk! This one more gao (strong).\nThis one confirm stay awake eight hours also can! It's damn strong! Then I'll just be like- Honestly, I prefer this one. Is it?\nYeah. Cos' generally I don't like my drinks sweet. OH MY GOD, MATCHA! Matcha, matcha.\nWow! Looks-wise I think B already stands out as a matcha drink. A looks like melon milk. Ooh! If I close my eyes and smell this, I will think that I'm smelling milk! That is not matcha. It's missing the matcha flavour. Mmm!\nVery milky, right? Yeah! If you like milky, creamy stuff like me right you'll definitely enjoy this one. Oh my god, I will order this! It's delicious! I know. Mmm.\nVery sweet. Very sweet, very milky, very matcha-ey. If you look closely right, you can see the matcha powder for B. Yeah.\nAs compared to A which is clear this one you can see little sediments. This one is like a best student. in a school. This one is like...\nTop-ten. Yeah hahahah! Ohhhhh! Cheesecake! As a student last time, I'll always go to Starbucks or Coffee Bean to study, and I'll always order their cheesecake. And, I actually like both! Cos' I go to Starbucks for their drinks, so I naturally order the Starbucks' one more often. But just looking at the Coffee Bean one I'm like I MISS YOU! Hahahah! The cheesecake for this one is really dense. It's like the new york cheesecake kind. And this one feels like the japanese slightly airy kind of cheesecake. Oops! Oh, sorry sorry. Mmm yes it's this smell. I can smell orange. This one more cheese, this one more orange. The base doesn't look like the graham crackers kind. It looks like more of puff pastry. I really like the cream cheese that they use. It's sweet but there also a sour taste. I think they put a bit of lemon zest also.\nMm! I feel like texture maketh taste. Hahah!\nSo this one doesn't score high. Chiara 2k19. There's not much texture...\nTo the crust? Woah! Did you see that? Tastes so good...\nOkay you can say, I'll just eat. I would say if I were to eat both of them This one would have to accompany with a drink. Because it's very jelak. But this one I feel like because it's so light and so fluffy right, I can just eat it on it's own. Well no.\nNo. But I got to give it to Coffee Bean because I didn't know how sweet Starbuck's drinks were Yeah! \nUntil today. Urggh! I feel like Coffee Bean's drinks really emphasise on the coffee so it's slightly less sweet, more bitter. Maybe that's why Starbucks has more fans because it's catered more towards the general public. I always steer away from Coffee Bean because I know I don't like milk. Their drinks really taste milkier than Starbucks'. But today when I really try and appreciate their drinks, I realised that they have a really strong coffee taste, for example their caramel macchiato. The coffee taste is just like BOOM! So maybe next time I'll go to Coffee Bean and try their nitro-brew. Like, something without milk, you know? I think I will actually like it cos' I really like coffee. To compare them both is abit unfair. Cos' I feel like they are playing different games. I think it's according to your preference. So if you like something milkier, definitely go for Coffee Bean. If you like something more balanced, I think you should go for Starbucks. Just try lah! Sometimes when Starbucks has no space, go Coffee Bean! Coffee Bean no space then go Starbucks! Mostly they are around the same vicinity anyway. Thank you for watching this episode of Taste Testers! If you like this video, you can catch more over there!

machines coffee capsules and more great information all available at aromacup.com hey everybody this is brian from aroma cup.com thanks for joining me today here in my virtual coffee shop brought to you by aromacup.com always glad to have you guys here always psyched to talk about brand new really cool technology in the world of coffee making and all the cool stuff that you can do at home when you are making your own coffee shop right in the comfort of your home so today I'm going to talk to you about another awesome way that we can use one of these great single serve coffee machines from Keurig in order to make a great cup of coffee using your own coffee beans rather than and using the K cups which are usually associated with these single serve machines some folks don't like K cups they like to make their own coffee they don't like the waste that comes with K cups because there is extra plastic associated with them and you know we are all picky about our coffee and right that we should be because there's so many different options so let's say you love to make your own coffee but you also love the ease of a single serve machine and especially you like to grind your own coffee this is a big thing a lot of folks really like grinding their own coffee and I know that I really do because you get great really fresh really robust coffee when you grind your own beans so we're gonna talk about using this Bodom electric coffee grinder which is a really awesome machine you can check out one of our other videos for some very in-depth usage of it and other things like that but we're going to talk about using that to grind your own beans and then make a cup of coffee using this awesome curia single serve machine that we've got right here so what I'm gonna do is to show you how I can do a grind of coffee and then pop it right over here into the Keurig machine you an awesome receptacle called the solofill we talked about this in some of our other videos one of my favorite options that you can get for Keurig machines is the solofill does a great job of brewing a great cup of coffee so let's do it I'm gonna go ahead and grind some beans right here using this bottom coffee grinder I've got some fresh coffee meetings right here unground ready to go and you know I love the smell or cool place don't need to put it in the refrigerator you don't want moisture just take your fresh coffee beans and that's really gonna make a great cup of coffee I'm just gonna go ahead and pour some of these right here into the botom machine won't do too much because I'm just brewing for myself today so the cool thing about this botom coffee grinder is that I get to choose how much I would like to grind and I can do that just by using the time dial right here I'm gonna go ahead and just grind for a little over 5 seconds make sure that my machine is turned on and I'm just gonna go ahead and grind a little bit of coffee right here I'm gonna select by the way the regular filter grind right here and I can select different grinds by just turning the hopper here I want to use filter because I'm using a single serve machine needs to be somewhere in the middle not too coarse not too fine let's go ahead and grind some coffee so the thing I love about this machine is it's really quiet you know there's only so much you're gonna hear obviously over my microphone and everything like that but this is so much more quiet than most machines I've ever used there's not a bunch of beans jumping around and being pulverized and all these kinds of things there's nothing like that it's a machine super quiet because of the conical burr grinder that it's got which is really awesome and then really it gets just a ton of coffee out of a very small amount of beans so that's something I really like there's no there's no waste or anything like that so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna fill up my solo fill so I'm just gonna go ahead and go right in here and direct out of the receptacle it's gonna go ahead and fill up my solo film I don't need to go all the way to the top but I'll go fairly close because I like my coffee pretty strong so when I've got that all set I'm just gonna close up my solo film and now I'm ready to brew I've got my Keurig here I'm gonna pop it open and rather than putting a cake up in I'm just gonna put my solo fill cup in fits in just like a cake up which is awesome close it up the machine is ready to brew I'm just gonna go ahead and go with my default size which is about a middle-of-the-road cup about 8 ounces worth of coffee it's preset on my machine and all I have to do is of course hit the big brew button great thing about these these single serve machines is they're ready to roll I don't need to wait for a lot of heating up and things like that this machine's gonna start brewing immediately there you go so there's a little more work to be done here obviously but that is very little work I think in all honesty considering that you get to make your own coffee by doing it this way and of course while the machine is brewing I'll ask you guys please check us out on aromacup.com join our forums make a free account talk with other coffee lovers check out our videos and reviews for great single serve coffee machines coffee pods everything coffee you can get it all at aromacup.com come and you can see how quickly that machine is done so I've ground my own coffee here and you don't always necessarily need to grind your own coffee right off the bat you can you know or you don't or should I say you don't need to grind your own coffee each time you're going to make it in your machine you could grind some and keep it on the side but if you really want the freshest coffee the most robust cup that you can get grind your coffee first just when you're going to make your coffee believe me you will really notice a difference in the flavor both of these machines are super super easy to clean up when I've used up all the coffee inside my my Bistro machine right here I just need to go ahead and clean it out with a brush easy to clean the Keurig and you're good to go very little mess and the freshest

how to roast coffee at home before buying an expensive roaster my wife and I decided to try a $20 popcorn air popper obviously not intended for this use it still does the job the air popper we had could roast about a third of a cup at a time pour the beans in replace the top and turn it on you'll need a bowl to catch the chaff which is the skin that comes off of the bean as it dries and expands this process takes about five to six minutes and requires monitoring the color of the beans as well as listening for the cracks the first crack occurs at 385 degrees Fahrenheit and is considered a light roast the second crack is around four hundred and thirty five to four hundred and thirty seven degrees Fahrenheit which is the beginning of a dark roast after roasting is done poured the beans into a metal colander to cool once cool transfer to an airtight container but wait 12 hours before sealing the beans give out co2 four days after roasting but mostly in the first few hours this method works fine but only in small batches and over time the popper will break down ours lasted about four months before the plastic on the outer shell started smoking and melting at this point we were hooked on roasting so we took the plunge and purchased a coffee roaster there's a lot of Roasters to choose from but we went for the nesco coffee roaster this changed the game for us compared to using a popcorn air popper using the nesco is very easy it comes with several washable parts a roaster Tambor hey chaff cup with screen and front seal and a rear sill the roaster chamber holds five ounces of green coffee beans and it features an auger Drive to roast the beans evenly align the chamber onto the roaster base the chaff Cup sits in the top of the chamber to help collect the chaff as it circulates to start a roast lift the cover and remove the chaff Cup get your beans ready we enjoy several brands of coffee and we buy in five-pound bags pour the beans into the chamber choosing the fill line or dark roast replace the chaff Cup and close the lid when turned on the control panel automatically displays 20 minutes it has buttons for time a start button with a red light for heating and a cool button with a green indicator light adjust the roasting time and press start hot air will flow in from the bottom of the base as the auger and they're roasting chamber agitates the beans during the heating process the beans will expand and double in size while losing about 28% weight loss due to the release of volatile compounds and water evaporation we prefer it light roast so this process takes us 22 minutes wait 10 minutes for the nesco to cool and then transfer your roasted coffee beans to an airtight container but leave the lid off for 12 hours the beans will give off co2 for many days after roasting but mostly in the first few hours our only cause will danesco are cleaning the chaff which is still better than it flying around everywhere the cooling process during the last 5 minutes is very loud but we put up with it because of the amazing roasting job that it does so there's two ways to roast coffee at home whichever method you choose you can still take pride that your roasting your own coffee beans thanks for watching stay tuned for more how-to videos from show and tell", "zAcy1veHz4k": "hey everybody welcome to roasty Coffee calm my name is Matt and today I'm going to talk about grinding your own beans grind it grind it grind it so I have five rules here at rose tea that I came up with for grinding your own coffee beans the first rule of roasty is to always grind your own coffee beans the second rule of roasty is to always grind your own coffee beans the third rule is to use a burr grinder and not a blade grinder or a blender blade grinders just chop up the beans and sometimes the blades can heat up and actually roast the coffee beans a little more so now there are two types of burger einar's you can use one burr grinder is an automatic reiner or an electric grinder that is pretty great you just pop the beans in you set the grind setting and then you just let it fly I like using a manual or a hand burr grinder because I just it just feels good to grind the beans yourself and it's perfect for traveling the fourth rule is to measure out your beans before you grind so when you do the proper coffee measurement using grams in a kitchen scale you want to measure out the whole bean and then grind it the fifth and final rule is to know your grind settings there are actually three main grind settings and that's coarse medium and fine then there are grind settings that are above below and in between those settings the first and the largest setting is called the extra coarse setting and that's when the grind sizes are they're actually really kind of big almost like big pieces of sea salt and that's perfect for cold brewing the second grind is the main course grind and a coarse grind is a good setting for French presses and anything with a mesh screen the third setting is medium coarse and this is right between coarse and medium and it's perfect for Chemex pour-over systems which is actually my favorite brewing system the fourth setting is the medium setting this is the ubiquitous setting for all commercially ground coffee and it's perfect for drip brewing coffee which is why it's perfect for commercial in coffee so if you're making coffee with a drip Brewer use a medium grind Central v setting is a medium fine this is between medium and fine setting and this is perfect for pour over coffee the sixth setting is the fine setting and this is the final setting of the three main settings so many using word settings Oh many times and then finally the seventh setting is the extra fine setting remember these are just guidelines for settings you can actually experiment with any setting at any brewing method so if you really like a fine grind with a French press you can totally do that and if you'd like to try a coarse grind with a narrow press you can do that to experiment find what you like and then stick to it for as long as you want so that's it those are the five rules for grinding coffee and if you have any more questions of course you can go to roasty coffee comm and until then enjoy do you remember the first rule it's always grind your own beans that was a freebie there ain't nothing wrong with a little coffee grind", "3Liy86qEQHQ": "[Music] hello friends this is dmcm and this is my quick review of aldi's al cafe italian style coffee beans and quite cheap these in ali i think they're around the two power mark rich and refined it's described as a hundred percent of rabbit head beans and no reseal it on the top so you have to use the sticky tab they give you on the back to reseal your pack if you keep it in the pack nothing on the sides apart from the best before date which is september 2021 so just under the year on the best before date on these and there we go directions for use nothing at all information wise towards the coffee storage instructions 227 grand bag contact info for aldi so disappointing that they don't give you any sort of prescription on the pack apart from the rich and refined and rain forest alliance certified coffee so let's take a look at the beans quite random sort of sizes in there some quite large and some small some look a little bit bent around the edges and the sort of look as though they were edging towards becoming oily not quite fully oily i would say but they do look shiny and the aroma of the beans is really rich it's caramelly and has a almost bent toffee brittle hint it's oily and is quite earthy and woody at the same time it's not as sweet as i would like it to be and it reminds me a bit of um wood varnish thinking of it but it's pleasant enough and an interesting aroma and from the beans slight difference in the roast the darkness of the roast and it's unusually the smaller beans that are lighter roasted you can see here one or two got a slightly lighter roasted than the small one so wonder if they were roasted separately at some point quick look at the ground coffee quite dark a sort of reddish orangey look to it and after grinding it's got a lot more of a meaty aroma it's a bit more floral and biscuity with a nice bite to it i would say so taste wise it's a lot more nutty than i was expecting and it does remind me a bit of a nutty colombian coffee or maybe a brazilian either way it's an interesting tasting coffee it's quite rich but not overly and one slight downside is it's a bit weak in body so the mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery there is a bitterness there but it's nothing unpleasant and it's a decent coffee for the price nothing amazing and a bit flat but it's got an interesting taste then it's ten times better than the italian ground coffee i'll be selling for the queen that i reviewed recently so paid a little bit extra and get the beans instead so i'll give it a score of 2.5 out of five it's a good coffee to have a bag on standby in case of emergencies so i'd say the wafer try at least once maybe i don't know maybe you might find it very nice and it may be your go-to coffee in the future so i'd really like to hear from anyone who's tried this coffee or any of the other coffees in aldi let me know your thoughts in the comments section below if you like this video give it a

I got a phone call last summer the summer of 2018 from John Gordon and you know everybody on the speaker circuit knows John Gordon is but not everybody knows who damon West is so when I answer the phone is John John says hey this is John Gordon I was like John Gordon how do you even know who I am he said Dabo Swinney can't quit talking about you and that coffee beans I got to tell you I've been at Clemson 15 years and we just had a guy speak to the team tonight by the name of Damon West and just easily one of the top most powerful messages that I've ever heard he said Damon I want to write a book and I want to call it the coffee bean I want you to write it with me he said yeah and I said yeah John I'm in but before I get to the coffee bean let me back up and tell you some of my back story let's start this story off we'll start off 11 years ago July 30th 2008 I'm sitting around this little rundown apartment in Dallas Texas and I'm sitting on this couch I've got my meth dealer this guy named tech sit next to me at this point in my life I'm a full-blown meth addict and I'm sitting there smoking meth with this guy passing the pipe back and forth and I'm selling text text I think the end is near man I think the cops gonna come get me pretty soon you see about 10 days before this this guy that I've been committed in much of burglaries within the Dallas area have been picked up by the Dallas Police Department so they're putting the screws to this guy I know it's just a matter of time before they come get to me and just as I passed the pipe back to Texas here at window shadow I'm coming across my living room floors his canister going end over Annan and it starts to register what's going on in my mind it's like a slow-motion reel as I get up off the couch and I get up and look at this damn man flashbang grenade goes off on my face and white white light noise Bulls new back on the couch and when I came to when I could see it here again this cop full spotlight game and he has boot on my chest and the barrel of a machine gun he's digging into my eye socket and he's screaming at me don't move don't move man I looked up at this guy not Blaine doesn't man don't worry don't worry wait cops started flooding in my apartment and one of them screamed out we got him we got the uptown burglar you see about a dozen other method X my self young and old male and female black and white and everything in between indiscriminately without reservation broken into homes and dozens of people in the Uptown neighborhood of Dallas to feed our insatiable meth habits but on July 30th 2008 the Uptown burglars came in they had their man's doing another arrest is made in connection with a string of burglaries in the Uptown neighborhood of Dallas investigators today announced the arrest of Damon West so they took me in a Dallas County Jail and they processed me in and I go in there and I sit around and I wait for 10 months to go to trial and at the end of my 10 months I get my day in court I should I get my six days in court at the end of six days a jury of my peers was gone for ten minutes deliberating my sentence but if the jury's gone for ten minutes you're said of the defense table they smoked you and so where the judge came back in the gavel dedenne Bam Bam Bam Daymond Joseph West you are hereby sentenced to 65 years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and I just remember hearing my mother gasp from the front row you know if the sound only and mother can make when she hears her son get a life sentence in prison sixty-five years as a life sentence y'all and that's that's the maximum that you can get that to me was my rock bottom home it was at that point in my life that I knew that something had to change that something was me or they took me out of the courtroom in handcuffs and shoved me out of there put me in this little room on the side of the courtroom five minutes later my parents came in they're gonna give him one last visit with before I go to prison and my dad can't talk he's in stunned disbelief you know he just saw his son that had all this promise I'm like I played college football I played quarterback at university no text in the 90s they were the last Tuesday starting quarterback I went on to work the United States Congress I work for a guy running for president states I work for one of the biggest Wall Street banks in the world you be asked to train to be a stockbroker and he just saw that guy with all that promise get a life sentence for a bunch of property crimes around meThe so my mom did all the talking and she told me a very valuable lesson she said debts and life demand to be paid Daniel Wesson you just got hit with one hell of a bill from state of Texas she said but you did the things they said you did at that trial so you got to go pay the debt to society she said but you owe your father and I did too she said we gave you all the love and opportunity to support to me anything you wanted to be in this life and this is what you chose this is the path you went down a debt you owe to us when you go to prison with that life sentence you're gonna get on God's back like I told you to like God carry you through that she said but more importantly you're gonna get in there and you're not gonna give him one of these white hate groups one of these Aryan Brotherhood type gangsters you're scared Cruz a minority in there she I'll think so she's a matter of fact you're not getting any tattoos while you're in there she said no gangs and no tattoo she said you come back as the man we raised or don't you come back at all she said do you understand this debt you're gonna pay and I told my mom the tears it's like yeah mom I understand but I had no idea what I just promised my mother I went around asking all these guys that had been to prison been to prison before how am I gonna survive this and everybody's telling me every man black white asian Hispanic is telling me about the the racial factor in prison and said you could have to get to a gang but there was this one guy in prison this old black guy named Jax and I called him mr. Jackson out of respect mr. Jackson was in his sixties had been to prison four or five times and he pulled me aside and mr. Jackson was always positive and come up and and talk to me about positive stuff every day keep my spirits up I got to tell you what prisons gonna be like but let's use an analogy he said imagine prisons like a pot of boiling water he said anything we put in that pot of boiling water is gonna be changed by the heat and the pressure inside that pot he set him up with three things that pot of all warm water West a carrot an egg the coffee he's the first things first west if I put a carrot into a pot of boiling water and boy what happens when you boil that carrot I said it turns soften Jackson said that's right he said the carrot goes into prison he's hard but prison breaks that carry down turns him soft you said the Kerry got beat he got robbed he may have got raped into may he got killed he said you do not want to be the carrot he said now let's put that egg in that pot of warm water we call prison and watch how it changes what happens to the egg Wes I said well it turns hot like a hard-boiled egg you said it's right he said the egg went in the heart of the show they're protecting it in a soft liquid inside he's a prison change that egg to turned him hard on the inside he said that egg his heart got his heart heart he said that egg is incapable of giving a receiving love if you become that egg stay in prison because you'll keep going back the rest of your life because you're institutionalized he said the West if I put a coffee bean into that pot of warm water boy he said what happens if you bought coffee me and I had no clue mr. Jackson told me now you're gonna change the name of the water to coffee he said the coffee be the smallest these three things had the power to change the entire atmosphere inside that pot he said small like you West he said if you were going to survive prison to come back and keep that promise to your parents to come back as the man they raised you don't do like that coffee bean he said everybody in life put that energy negative apposite and whatever kind of energy you put out you get back he said so west if you walk around the frown in your face all the time you're gonna attract that same kind of negative energy he said but west if you walk around with a smile on your face and you were the snooze no they're not giving you he said we'll change that prison from the inside out he said but the best part about it is the other coffee beans in prison they will find you because of your energy he said go be that Coffee Bean West and with that I was off I was off to prison I got sense at the mark Stiles unit in Beaumont Texas which is kind of mixed bag for me you know because I'm from Port Arthur Texas which is the town right next to it and so I go to prison and here's where the story about the coffee bean comes into play I take that story mr. Jackson's with me along the way to prison and it's like a secret that I've got down I know everything's gonna be okay because I was in County Jail and I experienced a coffee bean thing myself because I looked around and thought about how did I even meet mr. Jackson and I thought he met me because of my energy so when I get to prison I start applying the rules of being a coffee bean coffee being life lesson number one is one of the most important you have to get up every day and you have to work out and I'm not talking about working out of your body that's one of the areas you have to work out in three areas every single day spiritually mentally and physically you have to get in shape and stay in shape and what I'm talking about this I'm saying what you you are what you eat and that's not just talking about food you are what you eat means what are you feeding yourself mentally men what kind of books you read videos you watch you clean up websites do you go to what do you feed yourself mentally spiritually what do you feed yourself do you tap into something spiritually every every day every week every month every year get down it's a big universe you should consider it and physically what are you feeding yourself and what are you doing to stay in shape physically spiritually mentally and physically stay in shape every single day coffee bean life lesson number two the secret to life funny how sometimes you learn some big biggest lessons in your life and some of the oddest places and I would say a maximum-security prison in Texas is a weird place to learn what the secret to life is but that's where I learned what the secret to life was and so let me just share with you without any more anticipation what the secret is the secret to life is one sentence it's real simple the secret to life is serving others and being humbled it's in two words servant leadership servant leadership is helping other people achieve their goals in life help and raise other people up to a different station of life because man when you are helping someone else when you are helping someone else achieve their goal is alive you're helping yourself and that's the way the universe works coffee being life lesson number three the four things that you control in this life I learned this lesson in prison and the sooner you learn this lesson the easier your life will become the more manageable your life will become there are four things that you control in this life and they're the same four things that I control in my life - same four things everybody controls those things are what you think what you say what you feel and most importantly because everybody's gonna see this what you do what you think what you say what you feel what you do outside of that you don't control what's going on the things you control are between your ears or in your mind [Music] coffee bean life lesson number four your past does not define you if my past defined me you wouldn't be watching me in this seminar right now there's no way that a guy that walked out of a maximum security prison three years ago but beyond your screen right now today your past does not define your past wins don't define you lost us don't define you your past is your lesson the present today and that's a gift that's a gift you've got to get up today and make something happen the future is your motivation you know your future goals your future plans your future goal is to be a better servant leader one day you'd be better husbands better better wise better fathers better mothers one day that's what your motivation is every single day the passage of lesson the president has a gift in the future is your motivation [Music] and the final coffee being life lesson one of the most important there is you see energy is a lot of times about your body language and your body language is what people are gonna see before you even open your mouth before anything has ever spoken so your body language says a lot the power to create positive energy in every room that you walk in starts with the way you look what I'm saying is a coffee being a vital essence in the five is it all starts with a smile it's impossible to be negative when you're smiling everywhere and when you're smiling just like I walked through that prison I had a smile on my face like mr. Jackson told me I had to have you will attract the other positive energy in the room and you will be a coffee bean so after seven years three months serving time with a maximum-security prison in Texas parole decided to let me go let me walk out my life sentence a parole I'm on parole until 2017 but I don't care about that because I go around all over the country sharing my story with college football programs with high schools with junior High's church groups and corporations and and sharing my story and part of it is a warning about the dangers of drugs and the consequences of bad decisions but the the other part of it the big part of it is about the coffee bean message that message of hope that message that anybody can be the change agent you know I want to conclude this by saying how grateful I am to be here today it's it's a blessing in my life to be in the position I'm in only a little over three years out of prison but it's proof that your past is not to find you don't ever let anybody tell you what you can what you cannot do you are the only person that can hold you back in life and the most beautiful thing is to wake up everyone and look at that mirror and talk to the only person that can hold you back look in that mirror and say this simple sentence it's ten words and 20 letters the most powerful sentence in the English language if it is to be it is up to me and that is a permission statement it's worth repeating if it is to be it is up to me all good presentations have a call to action and my call to action is this it's the same call to action that mr. Jackson gave me before I went to prison I'm at the County Jail go out there and go be that Coffee Bean y'all think survive thanks for having me today [Music]", "tgY8qVqlUR4": "topic at hand is coffee and why you should be freezing your coffee so I've heard in the past that it's really bad to freeze your coffee because the blablablabla a flavor flavor flavor blabla blabla okay but then this year I heard from my good friend Vania she sent the link and she's a total coffee nerd like on a next-level coffee nerd um I love you Vania but she sent a link to this article about the 2017 Marisa championship and what this guy did was just a little bit intense he used I believe liquid nitrogen to supercool his beans sounds awkward um but he did that to get better flavor extraction out of it and why and an interview I have the link on that right over there bit dolly for / freeze coffee that link tells you to get to that article but he says that you will get a more even particle size in the grinder because of freezing the bean okay because grinders even a good Berg rinder like this beast of a Mac app that I have it will crush a lot of the beans and so when you crush the beam to a fine powder it's going to over extract because you've got too much surface area and then when you under extract with too full too big a bigger grain that's gonna yeah it's gonna be under extracted so freezing your coffee before you grind it is going to give it a more even size which means less bitters uh-huh which means a sweeter coffee flavor and I'm all about the sweets man although coffee is usually bitter okay but there's also other benefits of freezing coffee especially if you're like me and you just got back from some amazing coffee nation like Colombia and so this is the thing I bought a whole bunch of beans and I'm always so worried about buying too many beans because I always think oh my goodness it's all gonna go bad before I can drink it all and so I drink copious amounts of coffee will never come back but they say you can freeze your coffee and you can kind of take a time capsule and lock in that flavor profile at that time that that coffee was roasted and rested and so this isn't credible to me and you can also freeze green coffee so if you've just harvested and you want to keep it longer pure of that exact time capsule you can do that as well and so it's really going the way of vintage wines where you can be able to try different wines at different years and have tastings as it's progressed and not only its green development as well as its resting nature and and roasting of course so craziness okay you can't just throw your bag of coffee in the freezer so how do you do this properly alright so what you need is a proper vacuum sealer all right because the enemy to any frozen food is going to be air and moisture and what you want to do is suck it all out before you throw it in the freezer so that your food locks in good flavors and not the bad ones and becomes kind of disgusting okay so we've had the FoodSaver for many many years now because we're sous vide junkies and I think the one negative to it is that you are going to use a lot of plastic all right but I do have links to bags that we're using that allow us to cut the seal and then reseal a game so we can use the same bag for like three-quarters of a pound of coffee as we keep on drinking it but here's the kicker you do want to keep your beans in the freezer and grind from frozen and that's going to give you the best particle size and I've actually noticed not only optically you can see that there's not as many fine spitting up and rising because of those really super fines and secondly flavor-wise it does create a sweeter Cup which is shocking because all we're doing is freezing the bean wha-wha this madness is magic okay so get the freezer the FoodSaver freeze your beans without oxygen and suck it all out and they look kind of weird right they look kind of strange but this is going to be the best way to get great flavor consistently out of your beans and there's an extra bonus for people who roast their own beans because now I can roast like you know five or six pounds and not worry okay I have to give this all away or I need to drink all this right now we can edit rest because I prefer to rest my beans for about one week to two weeks and then it has the best flavor profile and so we can rest the beans and then we can freeze vacuum-pack and then freeze it all and then I can have beans ready for whatever I need to drink it which is awesome because before I do have to roast every pretty much two or three weeks to make sure I've got my supply of my favorite drug of choice all right okay let's say Dave that's too cumbersome let's not do that well the next best thing that you can do is use this thing which is a planetary air scape air scoop okay and what it has oh my beans my beans are locked in here okay so if you take a look at that it looks like this little time capsule lock so you pull up the handle and if you push the handle down it is actually vacuums not vacuum sealed its airtight okay if you pull it push the handle up that becomes your lever you can pull it out and can you hear that there you go and here at the bottom of my jug are my beans that have been reduced of air as much as possible it's not going to be vacuum sealed but this is the best method of preserving bean freshness that I found at room temperature because when what you do is you push it down with the handle up and listen to this it just farted and so yeah and then you push the handle down and that means that no air can escape so air escape get it air escape ha ha ha ha okay but yeah um some have complained because this is an older one because I bought it a long time ago that they have now taken off this gasket from the clear lid but I'm pretty sure the clear lid does very little all right because beans doody gas they fart as we leave them on the table but I digress the main takeaway is to buy a food saver if you don't have one freeze vacuum pack your beans and then freeze them grind from frozen and you will be in the world of joy with less bitter coffee and better coffee flavor haha okay simple hack now the other benefit of having a food saver is that you can of course sous-vide anytime you want you can vacuum pack your food and I've got other videos at Chinese Secrets for that and you also have the ability to what is it just preserve food so we are a family of only four but we host a lot of people family friends and if we are buying bulk it's awesome like I think on Thursday I'm going to be cooking up 15 pounds of pork shoulder that I already precooked sous vide and then I flash froze and it's in the freezer and so it's easy to cook for big parties and without the food saver I couldn't do that okay awesome so that's all I have for today thank you guys so much for being here I'm going to check out the comments but you don't have to stick around god bless and I'll see you in the next video and make sure you do check out all the links at freeze coffee", "MBgpgAdkd3k": "[Music] me hello hello and welcome to at home with lucas so we're going to be talking about starbucks's pikes place whole bean coffee in this video we're going to be doing a hands-on with the bag then we're going to take those beans we're going to throw them to the burr grinder and see how they break down now that's going to tell us quality of those beans after that we're going to throw it to the pour over and we're going to do a nice pour over which is going to tell us a little bit more about the freshness of those beans after that we do the favorite part of my day the sip test yes i absolutely love tasting new coffee and i've only had this coffee in their actual shops and if you've ever had drip coffee from starbucks it is super intense and boiling hot i mean it will scold you beyond belief more than a mcdonald's coffee [Music] if you know what i'm talking about you know what i'm talking about all right so after that we're going to figure out is this a daily weekly monthly or never consumption coffee it does happen people it does happen all right so let's go ahead and jump into it [Music] all right let's take a look at this bad boy right quick so you got the iconic starbucks logo right there medium roast you have their like shimmering sort of blended in um looks like their old school logo right there very cool that's probably where they ended up with that um very nice got the starbucks pikes place roast right here tasting notes chocolate and toasted nuts very interesting it seems like a lot of starbucks has chocolate in their flavor notes right here we have the one-way valve very strong one-way valve the smell the aroma is great we want the whole bean of course because we do not want those additives or preservatives this was established since 1971 people what what old school 100 arabica beans i went with the larger bag because i'm going to use this for two things one is oh super excited for um the 1.5 pounds went big people let's take a look at the side over here the story of pike's place very cool all right of course you get their starbucks rewards if that's something you're into [Music] all right let's take a look at the back i really like this bag someone once told me if you put gold on something everyone thinks it's valuable so there you go you got that that seal of gold right down the middle the spine all right so they're going to give you a little bit of information on how to brew a great cup of coffee very very cool yes see this does not say to store in a refrigerator so this is what i've learned of how to store your coffee correctly right there some people say otherwise let's turn it on its side you have their pikes place roast right there and let's see medium roast balance smooth and rich very cool all right there's the best buy date right there we are good to go people good to go all right take a look at the bottom a little bit more information on the packaging all right so you have their one-way valve here which as you saw i pushed it out and it's already starting to gain a little bit of poofiness so i'm gonna suspect that the glue up here is uh possibly at fault um usually bags that do not have the glue will hold their um they'll hold their uh their tightness if you will um but this one seems to not do that so let's go ahead and crack this bad boy open yeah so this has the double layered glue so i just broke through the first layer and now i'm going into the second layer all right let's take a look at these beans [Music] those are dark let me try to brighten up this uh this image a little bit there we go all right wow those are dark and oily beans right there people holy moly starbucks spares no it's no expense for oil look at those glistening beans and as always there's no filter or color grading on this part of the video so you can trust that that is pretty much what i'm looking at right now wow yeah that is some uh oh i don't know if you can see the oil on the camera but my fingers are getting caked in oil wow a little bit of husk right there some beans or some companies when they roast they there's a lot of husk and some when they roast there's almost none and starbucks is usually almost none but these aren't the giant starbucks beans that you normally see so this is interesting um this could be the what the original beans looked like but yeah they're not the giant ones and there's a couple broken jagged uh pieces in there let's take another another handful [Music] the bag does not want to stand up don't fall over buddy all right yeah definitely some uh there's an imperfection right there definitely some good looking beans standard starbucks coated in massive amounts of oil um but yeah let's go ahead and throw these to the burr grinder and see how they break down [Music] all right listen up people we're gonna grind some beans all right okay so i'm throwing these into my burr grinder i usually grind up about 12 ounces of beans at a time that is because i use a lot of coffee in my daily life and it is very easy for me to go through 12 ounces in a couple days so that is the reason for all these beans being ground up plus when you're trying to review the coffee beans you kind of want to break them down and then get a good look at all of them just to understand where they're at so what we're looking for is a uniform grind that means that you do not want jagged edges you do not want large and small and medium and dusty you want it to kind of look like it's all one grind usually cheaper coffee beans will break down the kind of shatter and you'll see like a lot of jagged edges and you can also hear there's a little bit of a difference when you're grinding up quality beans versus cheaper beans so that's another thing to look look out for but coming up we're going to take a closer look at these bad boys and see just how good they broke down all right there you go so there's a little bit of imperfections but overall i would say this broke down quite nicely that is uh basically the standard for the starbucks coffee beans they seem to break down in a very uniform fashion all right through my cool editing here we are going to fill up my pour over coffee maker this is by coffee gator i absolutely love it that is also a coffee gator kettle right there i am not sponsored by coffee gator all right so you want your coffee to be just below 200 degrees so about 180 to 190 is good i usually go to 200 then let it cool a little bit so this is about 185 right here good to go so what you want to do is you want to cover your grounds with enough water and then let it sit for about 30 seconds and then you're gonna hit it with the second wave of water and that's going to really show you the freshness so the more crema and the more mushrooming you get the fresher the coffee bean actually is so that's a fun thing you can do with a pour over at home here we go there you go so that is indicative of a fresher bean you're seeing a lot of crema pluming you're seeing um a really nice response to that second hit of water the first hit of water is never going to give you anything it's the second one that does and there you go you're getting a nice rich um amber looking color right there very nice we're gonna hit this one a couple more times as you do with a pour over they say that you want to do this in about three minutes so if your first if this is your first time doing a pour over i would recommend getting like a a stopwatch and set it to three minutes um right after your first pour so right when you hit it with the second pour i would say start the three minute clock just to get you in the in the in the wheelhouse of um of what it's going to take to make a pour over sometimes you can waste way too much time by letting it drip all the way out after each pour sometimes you can go a little bit too aggressive and and pour too soon so it's kind of like a you you find your own science and stick with it whatever works for you is what works for you all right so that crema that that that cinnamon roll look is is still popping through and we're getting a very nice rich looking that is a very dark looking cup a cup of joe right there people i tend to make my coffee way too strong i do that for a reason so that i can get the most extreme taste and that way i can kind of figure out where where it lies in in in terms of flavor notes and whatnot i don't know if that's accurate i'm not a scientist people i do this as a hobby all right that is still pumping out some nice crema lately i've been going to about 500 milliliters of water i think that gives you a really good um [Music] it gives you a good balance between water and coffee ratio of course if you asked anyone they would tell you my ratios are completely off but like i said i am doing this as a as a hobby this is a fun thing for me all right so here we go we got the poor test coming up right now so we're looking for a rich stream not watered down and we want a nice color and boom goes the dynamite there you go people look at that right there that is beautiful looking wow and there's just a just a twinge of a bubbly crema at the very top um well no there's not i spoke too soon but that is a very very nice looking cup of coffee right there some may say motor oil i say it's the black wine all right coming up we are going to use our handy dandy trusted thermometer boom ski all right so you want your coffee between 130 and 145 i usually like my coffee about 132 135 so right here is looking perfect that's going to give you the best taste for your cup all right let's get into this sip test smells like pike place pike's place pike place i was gonna make a joke and say no it doesn't but it probably does to those who know what pike's place smells like [Music] whoa wow whoo now that's a cup of coffee right there people wow that is absolutely intense the flavor overload is unbelievable [Music] wow wow wow that is intense so you definitely get that sweet chocolatey taste you definitely have nutty full-bodied smoky earthy just everything you can think of is in this cup right now but it's it's bittersweet bittersweet um it starts off sweet and then it gets a little bit bitter and uh definitely smoky the smokiness is everywhere which some may push back and say they burn their beans but this is a good tasting cup of coffee people wow yes that is very nice it's a little bit bitter um and it's it's on the um on the harsh side so obviously starbucks loves to make their coffee very strong because they know people are gonna put stuff in it and try to cover up that coffee flavor um because most people that drink coffee don't like the taste of coffee i hate to say it but it's the truth [Music] wow that is so good um it's definitely not a um it's definitely going to jump start your morning um it's definitely going to be a cup of coffee you're going to want to probably drink i would say by itself um but it's so powerful that you could easily consume a sweet pastry of some sort i would not recommend this with any kind of breakfast food i don't think it would be good at all i think it's too much on the harsh side so any kind of like bacon and eggs and hash browns and whatnot i would say don't do it i would say go with like an eight o'clock coffee or something else if you want breakfast food um definitely folgers coffee is great with breakfast food but i would not recommend this at all if i'm going to give it a star rating [Music] i'm probably going to give it four and a half stars i'm gonna say that it's um not the best starbucks cup so if we're gonna compare this with other starbucks i've had in the past i would say definitely go with something else this is an acquired taste for sure it's good and if you want a cup of coffee that really tells you it's a cup of coffee this is the one this is going to give you a good reminder that coffee has a lot of flavor to it so i would say four and a half stars um i really should be i really should start a star rating that is starbucks peats gevalia and just try to compare them to the other coffees but i'm not there yet so four and a half stars good cup not the best acquired taste strong that's where i'm at right now so i would say if you see it in the store don't buy a big bag like i did buy um maybe a k-cup or something small just to get a taste of it because it is definitely um it's definitely strong and it is an acquired taste but yeah woohoo all right there you go that's starbucks is pike's place whole bean coffee hopefully you enjoyed this video if you did definitely

Munnar, in the South Indian State of Kerala. This is basically a cardamom and coffee plantation. The coffee harvest is just over, we thought\nof making a vlog or a small video about coffee, how it is plucked and harvested, how it is\nsun dried, then how do we roast it, and finally we make it into a powder, and make a cup of\ncoffee out of it. This blog is about coffee from the farm to\nthe coffee cup. This is a coffee tree, coffee is basically\na tree and this is the bean. Coffee grows in the equatorial belt, mostly\na native of Africa and now coffee is grown in around seventy countries around the world. This is not the way a coffee tree should be\nbecause they prune it all the time. These trees, I think there are not taken cared\nproperly, it has grown up high. The reason why we don't grow them high is\nbecause it is difficult to pluck, it is supposed to be somewhat of this height. They prune it all the time so that it is in\na height like this and when more of pruning happens, the yield is more. This is a cluster and what you see in red\nin the ripe bean, this is the ideal time to pluck this. This is the unripe one, the bean turns into\nsomething like this, then it turns into this color. This is the ripe coffee fruit, it is a berry\nbasically. So if you don't pluck it on time it becomes\nlike this. This is almost like you know it is gone.These\nare the different stages of the coffee berry. it comes like this. The next process is about sun drying, come\non. This is what we call as a \"Lungi\". In Kerala, it is kind of a native dress people\nto wear around. We have some people plucking coffee around,\nand they were in this attire. So I also opted to wear this. For more comfort, you just fold it and tie\nit again. So it is pretty much easy to walk. It was about to rain and it is partially raining\nright now, that is the reason why we have folded it down. This is coffee bean sun dried, this is how\nit looks like. This is basically the berry sun dried, we\nneed to take out the coffee bean. Let's go in and lets extract the beans from\nthese. I just brought all the dried coffee berry. I am going to hammer it and probably get the\nbean out. This is the bean and we have extracted it\nfrom the husk. We are going to roast it right now. So we just roasted it right now and we are\nletting it cool down so that we can probably blend it and get it into a powder form. You see this, this is roasted coffee, coffee\nbean! Add two spoons of sugar How is it? Fine, Super! Thats an awesome coffee! If you want milk coffee, pour in some milk\nor cream. and you just have it. There is a difference in this coffee, you\nmight see the color a bit different. It doesnt have chicory, it doesnt have anything,\nany flavouring elements or any preservatives or anything of that sort. This coffee tasts different and its awesome! What you just had is roasted coffee beans,\npowdered and we just added hot water into it, and added some sugar. This is the original coffee. So what you get in the stores would be something\nwhich might have chicory, which might have other preservatives, other flavouring agents,\nso thats kind of a proprietory brand of coffee that get in stores. If you wanna have some original coffee, come\ndown to Ela Ecoland, I am putting the name of the property and the website address, so\nprobably you can have a look into it. Thats it for now, thank you so much for watching. Please do subscribe for more interesting videos\nfrom us.

[laughs] For the first craft you'll need: Three small frames without glass, mod podge shimmer gold, a paint brush and glue! Cover the inside of your frame with glue. Pour some coffee beans onto the glue and press. Then hold the frame up so that the excess will fall off. If there are bigger gaps, add tiny coffee beans to fill those up. Let dry and do the same thing with the other two frames. The next step is what gives the beans on the left their warm, sunny glow. Do you see the difference? Brush the shimmery mod podge onto your coffee beans. Make sure your glue is completely dry before doing this and apply a moderate amount. This will give your beans a beautiful glow that will make them look even more delicious. And since mod podge is both a varnish AND a glue, it will add extra strength to your project. Do the same with your other frames. Once they're dry, you can hang them on the wall! For the second craft you'll need: Raphia, a dozen or so little glass vases, copper glass paint and a paint brush. You'll also need a shoe box and some gold spray paint. Put some coffee beans in the shoe box and spray them gold. Let dry, turn them over and spray the other side. And let dry again. Paint the top edges of your little vases with the copper glass paint and let them dry. Once they're dry, fill them about half way with both regular coffee beans and golden coffee beans. Grab a strand of raphia, make a loop and tie a knot. Leave a few inches open and wrap your strand around the neck of the vase and tie a double knot. Leave a few inches open again and do the same thing. I want my bottles to alternate which way they face, so at first I tied them in the correct direction. But I noticed that's really not necessary when you're going to hang it against the wall. So continue to do this until you have the amount of vases you want! When you run out of raphia, just add another strand by forming a knot. It won't be visible if you make sure to do the knot where you're tying it around a vase neck. When you're finished, hang it up! For the third craft you'll need: New or left over candles, a glass, a candle wick with metal base and a hot glue gun. You'll also need a stove and some pots to melt your wax. Put some glue onto the candle wick base and place it in the glass. Melt your wax. When working with moulds it's best to use a double boiler system, but since we're just going to pour it into a glass, it's okay if the wax gets very hot. Just be careful. My candles aren't clean, so I'm purifying them by pouring the wax through a strainer with a sheet of paper tissue. For more detailed information, please check out my other candle making videos. Fill the glass with coffee beans and pour the wax on top. Once it's hardened you can enjoy your coffee candle! I hope you enjoyed these crafts! If you did, please give the video a thumbs up and subscribe. Thank you for watching!

of coffee and today I'm going to try and reproduce it right here on YouTube I'm going to try and make things a little interesting this time at the end of the video I'm going to let you decide how this video ends either I'm going to make a traditional brew or a high-tech brew and you get to decide now for most of my coffee drinking life I've been sold the idea that the best cup of coffee is made from freshly ground coffee beans but that's not true the best cup of coffee is made from freshly roasted coffee beans most of us don't know this because it's not really easy to mass-market freshly roasted coffee I think it's safe to say that most people watching this video have probably only ever had stale dead coffee there's probably a few of you out there that have found yourself a coffee roaster where you can get freshly roasted beans and you know what I'm talking about but the rest of us are getting the very convenient already ground coffee at the local supermarket and it's likely taken two months to get there from the roaster this is a raw dried coffee bean it's actually a seed and in this form it can sit around for quite some time but once you roast this it will stay at its peak of flavor for about two weeks and then it starts to go stale and if you grind it it goes stale even faster so to make our ultimate bushcraft coffee today we need to roast so fresh coffee beans we've now reached the part of the video where we have the obligatory starting of the fire shot today I'm going to use my for now lens a tiny piece of dried shudder and a bird's nest [Applause] should have some coals here that we can roast on now now the roast fuse properly you got to keep them moving if you've ever made popcorn kind of the same idea don't let them sit on the flame directly and keep them moving around in the heat like this okay I've been at this for about five minutes now and my coffee beans are just starting to turn a beautiful light brown color now I chose a fair trade Ethiopian coffee bean for this demonstration but the key really is in the roasting a lightly roasted coffee bean and light brown color will give you the most caffeine and that coffee flavor if you like dark roast and I do you can roast the coffee beans a little darker and you'll have less caffeine but you'll know you're getting close to being done when you start to hear those coffee beans snap crackle and pop okay the beans are starting to smoke a little bit it smell wonderful and they've just started to snap crack on pop so that means they're ready yeah here let me show you can you hear them snap crackle and popping and there are nice golden brown and they smell wonderful I'm going to go just a little bit longer because as I said before I like a dark roast okay let's show you how we did there's the raw coffee and there's the freshly roasted coffee beans let's try one mhm mmm yep they're ready if you love coffee you should thank a goat according to legend it was Ethiopian goat farmers that first noticed their goats acting a little erratically after eating the coffee berry and in about 800 AD according to the legend a monk made a brew from the coffee berry and discovered that he couldn't sleep at night and thus the coffee beverage was born now next we need to freshly grind those coffee beans oh man that smells amazing now if you did your pounding ray you should have some coffee it looks like that ready for brewed some quick fun facts about coffee Sweden actually banned coffee in 1746 not just the coffee but all the paraphernalia that goes with it sweeted what were you thinking Finland is the most caffeinated country in the world the average adult consumes 4 to 5 cups of coffee per day but not quite enough to beat the good old USA the largest consumer of coffee on the planet four hundred million cups per day and that kind of consumption makes coffee the second most traded commodity on the planet after oil ok now we've reached a point where we are going to brew up our coffee and you get to decide how I brew it click over here and you get to see me do a traditional brew and try that coffee or you can click over here and see a modern brew I'll give you a hint this one's expressive so click here for traditional or click here for modern you get to decide how the video ends go ahead click one otherwise the video is just going to end", "u1WytoM1Q0I": "welcome to the first and only lesson on how to roast coffee I could be wrong but this is what I've found to work for me I was reading a book one time where a lady was roasting coffee in the middle of Africa over an open fire and I said we'll shoot if they can do that open open fire with the frying pan I can certainly do it at home so this is how I've learned to do it at home you may find other things that work better for you but this is how I do it so here you go first you're going to need supplies what I've got here is a wok that I use you can use a frying pan I've just found that a wok can help spread the heat evenly and I don't drop as many beans because I stir pretty much the whole time I'm roasting you can roast slow is what I recommend roast fast you may lose control of what you're doing after I roast the beans and this I transfer them into here and I take them outside and just kind of toss them a little bit while the wind blows away the chaff and then I bring them inside and I pour them into a bowl that can handle really hot coffee beans and I cover it with foil so that the beans can still breathe and I put it in the microwave for about four hours to let the beans breathe but not be completely open to there they're still releasing gases as they're roasting in the inside as they're cooling once that's finished and I transfer the beans into an airtight container first a little bit breathable and finally here's the green beans we're beginning with the Guatemalan blend will be nice evenly roasted I recommend beans beans they do good stuff and they support local farmers and they do it well I think you can check my dance beans calm anyways let's guess you have to put a whole pound of beans beans from Guatemala in the pan here you may want to put fewer beans if you've got a smaller frying pan just depends on how how deep you want the beans to be in the wok you can generally get a pretty good rope by continuing to stir the whole time the roasting I used to use a gas stove but we've got electric here gas is definitely control your heat but with electric it still works fine you're going to want to open a window or two probably because it will fill your kitchen with smells that don't smell like coffee I learned to love it but people who visit and the rest of my family may not appreciate it yet so I'm going to turn the heat up to probably do a slow roast we'll turn it up to about five and roast and we'll see a little bit he's doing this make sure you stir get a nice even you want to make sure all the beans are going to move regularly you're going to want to use a wooden spoon because it can stand up to the high temperatures and they're constantly touching the metal pan you can use a plastic spoon you're going to melt it if use a metal spoon you're going to probably make a really bad joys and maybe even get metal shavings in the beans as things get warm things expands it's the same with coffee beans so as they're getting warmer they're going to start expanding and releasing some of the oils that's good that helps with the roasting it smells great but once you get used to it as they expand they're also going to shed their skin called the chaff if you do this outside over the grill it's fine because it blows away the chocolate like I showed you with the color that I use the force fine just to take it outside and shake it blow on a little bit of the chaff throw away as you're roasting you're going to begin to see them turn a yellowish colors and then finally a brown and the brown will get darker and darker and as they expand they're going to pop you're going to hear them kind of telecom corn they're going to start the top that's going to get blacker between one and two tops is a really light roast around the second time they pop both start getting dark really quick so after the second pop you'll want to start figuring out whether you want to take it to a really dark extreme or you want to take it off and let it be ready and it takes some getting used to you'll probably have to get some more green beans and give it a try see what kind you like see how fast they rose and figure out exactly where you want to stop in future roasting like see mine are starting to smell really good you can't smell it but I like to smell some of them are starting to get a little bit yellow but it's only been about five minutes here so see a little bit about 13 minutes after we started the heat and you'll see the color is definitely changing to a more kind of yellowish green color turn slightly Brown and some of them and you'll start to freak out a little bit because it looks like the roasting and unevenly some of them are getting darker so we're staying green a little bit longer and that is okay that's one of the benefits of roasting at home is you get get a nice distinct difference because you're going to taste the beans and you're going to taste the ropes a lot of times you buy stuff in the store that's all rose to the same level and the bean has pretty much been roasted out some of these are going to be a little bit less roaster than others and that'll be a nice addition of the flavor in this case with the guatemalan beans for the topper that we're drinking and it's not a bad thing that it's not a how-to descent the same color all the way through as long as you get a feel for what it is as a whole you'll be alright and when you finish you may have some that are really really dark and you want you know take a few beans out just wait on the textbook the roast is a whole that's fine even as you're roasting they find it one or two games haven't gotten turned as much as the rest and if they're black you definitely take the black ones out but if they're sort of a darker that's no time we're going to keep roasting and that looks a little bit you that's 23 minute fast now you can really start to hear and crack on top like Rice Krispies getting a nice smoke from it and windows open so that's lines not quite there yet but just in a few minutes here probably I will be taking it off and that will take them outside it's about chaps blowing away with the wind just wanted to show you a town what it looks like so far into the calendar give it a go outside tonight 110 even color but even enough they're all kind of one big collection of amazing coffee got the sides kind of jiggle it like this now I'm alone on it to tell it's jack it's got a lot of the chaff out and it's looking nice it also cools it out cools it off pretty quick so the inside of the beam continues to roast you're not going to get all the chaff out but as long as you get a majority overlap they said about far away maybe the bowl that can handle heat because they still are pretty hot they will continue to roast on the inside we're going to cover them with foil we're going to stick on the microwave so they have a chance to air out because the beans are breathing out some gases they probably don't want flavoring your coffee in about four hours since we first finished our beans we're going to take them out now we've been letting them breathe in the microwave throughout the lunch hour and now they look like coffee beans smell that oh yeah that smells like often you'll notice how there's lots of different colors throughout the beans some of them were roasted a little bit further than others but together it's a great blend of bean and roast and it's going to taste good oh yeah that's not good so we're going to do is I'm going to put you use these kinds of things if you want I recommend something like this something that's airtight creates a vacuum seal you get those pretty cheap at the store let's see what else was I going to say oh don't put your coffee in the fridge or the freezer just make it out make enough that you'll use it within two or three weeks and the beans that are green will keep for several years on the shelf so don't worry about you know you can buy a huge bag of these for really cheap cheaper for shipping and such that way you've always got some green beans ready to go then roast enough for a couple weeks if you got a frying pan instead of a wok you may need to make less than this but that's fine you just experiment and see what you can do hope you enjoyed it and I hope you enjoy some coffee", "zqhL3u8cKM4": "hi this is sarah negly with Gurney's and we're doing the third in our series of coffee videos and we're finally ready to roast our beans okay we've got a hot pan we're just gonna pour in our green coffee beans then you want to keep a constant stir when you have these going on the range those other ways you can roast these you can do them in the oven on a cookie sheet and you can even do them in an air popcorn popper so this is the fun part of the process where you get to decide how long you're gonna cook these beans and what you want the flavor to be the longer you cook them the darker your beans gonna get and the more intense the flavors gonna be so if you like a dark roast you're gonna want to go a little longer if you like that lighter flavor you're gonna go for a light-colored bean and you're gonna want to have some extra beans to play around with and have some fun with that so we're just finishing these beans up you can see they've taken on this gorgeous dark color and they get sort of this oily texture and we're thinking this is about where we want our roast to be so we're gonna turn them off and cool on and grind them up and boom and we'll be back with you to taste them okay so we just finished graining our fresh beans

whatever you want to call it in other words they're getting stale so they take and they make a double shot which we're going to do and we deliberately took some intelligentsia black camp this was roasted about a month ago so it's you know it's on the edge of stale not so good they pour it over ice they put it in a cup of milk shake it pour it in the glass put a drizzle of chocolate on top and a pinch of cinnamon we now we forgot the pinch of cinnamon but you know the chocolates here so it'll make up for the difference so we're going to use the DeLonghi machine here and we're gonna make a double shot and you strain the ice out when you pour it down into the glass I know you guys are hoping when I shake it that something lets loose and I kind of wear it hmm I can hear the comments out there already it's happened don't look so stale but double shot nice in here shot soon pre-measured out a cup of milk gonna be like a yeah you're just waiting for me to have an accident here aren't you I can tell I'm not a bartender but I do understand that if you're having trouble getting it out there you go give it a little tap on the side like that it looks good it's a milkshake looks like coffee ice cream melted I love coffee ice cream come on do your thing we should have had this upside-down latte art you want the first sip there you go what do you think mmm it's good you never know what the coffee beans are stale you know it's cold that takes away from you know really detecting that the coffee beans might not be optimum a little bit of chocolate shaken with milk it's excellent

roast your own coffee now once you see our green coffee beans - look at those they look different than a regular coffee bean I pick those up at the grape and granary and today we're going to be making a sim Mottram mandolin I believe that's how you pronounce it and we have about a half a pound here first step put it in a roasting pan a nice flat layer and turn your oven up to 500 after reaches temperature you want to take it go ahead and drop it into the oven there you go now you gotta wait for the first popping or the first cracking it's called kind of like popcorn okay so now it is starting to crack it's called the first crack and it's almost like popcorn you'll see you start to steam here and start to pop and though I actually start to pop so you want to listen for those pops and when it's done popping you want to pop this out I'm a total roasting time on this it's anywhere between five and ten minutes so keep that in mind you can see it's still roasted and it's popping you have smoke coming off it that's totally natural I recommend unplugging your fire alarm though because it may go off but this is the roasting process you can hear that popping and clicking that's totally natural so now the popping has slowed down considerably and if you get to the coffee to the way you want it roasted you're gonna want to go ahead and pull that out there let it roast for a few more minutes okay now we've taken the coffee out of the oven and it is roasted there you get some beans for now very interesting mixture of those we're gonna do is you want to cool these down as quickly as possible so what I'm going to do is transfer these over like so take that wrap place this in some cool water now the cold water will take the heat away from the beans and suck the heat out to the cold water let that sit for about 15-20 minutes or if you have a freezer go ahead and throw them in the freezer until they cool down okay so now the coffee is cooled down I got a pan and you're gonna want to take these little shafts off almost like a kernel that's on the outside of the bean easiest way I saw you so the next date you like to do is to take the beans that I've actually tossed up in the air and got a lot of the shaft off I want to put it in a nice fall under here so now that you've made your coffee you ground your beans make it however you like to whatever strength you like whether it's a coffee machine espresso machine a French press whatever it may be just enjoy your cup of coffee because this is gonna be the best cup of coffee that you ever had and that's a guarantee you should roast your own green coffee beans and make your own coffee what can you find the grape and granary in Akron Ohio", "VnlIYSnZ-WM": "hi this is Waylon Pete's green coffee company bringing you a new video on how to store green coffee beans we recently released a video on how to store roasted coffee beans and we realize it was kind of long but there's a lot of really good information over there and just skip over anything that really doesn't apply to you anyway let's get right to it you might wonder why you need to worry about storing green coffee beans green coffee beans are a seed and for the most part storage of green coffee beans isn't rocket science you can put a man a vacuum in one of the vacuum sealer bags and Stewart and actually seal them with one of those little kitchen top gadgets or countertop gadgets or the other thing you can do is you can put them in a ziplock bag and if you really want to get fancy like I did the other day you can try to suck the air out with straw or you can put in a larger bag and then you can kind of just squish the air out but in any case all you have to do is put them in something that's airtight get a little bit of the air out put them in a dark cold place and leave them there until you're ready to roast them so next question is is why are we concerned well we're concerned because coffee when it comes to you as a seed has been dried and it'll absorb moisture and that's not good so coffee beans dry out and when they dry out that's not good but if you allow them to get additional moisture they absorb the moisture and then what happens is it changes the roasting or the nature of roasting in your roasting profile and it slows it down so that doesn't work either so good storage helps keeps coughing keep coffee beans fresh so we want fresh beans because we want living chemistry and living chemistry means that if I plant that seed it's going to grow a coffee tree so if coffees moisture drops below 10 percent the next thing that's going to have is that you're not going to have good aroma acidity or freshness and they're going to fade away and at 8% they almost completely disappear now I'm going to run off at the mouth a little bit about coffee drying and moisture content in general if you were to look at a seed bank and where seeds are stored they're stored at less than 1 degree Fahrenheit or or below because RNA which seeds have like animal DNA degrades with time so unless you're storing something like Kona coffee or Jamaican Blue Mountain cryogenics is a little over the top and really unnecessary with that said green beans definitely deteriorate over time and past crops sell at discounts for that very reason seed storage methods must be good enough to maintain the viability of the seed coffee beans are indeed seeds and when you can't plant them and grow a tree they're not going to make good roasted coffee ok the optimum moisture content for dry coffee beans is 10 to 12 percent not that it is the best moisture content for roasting but it's ideal for preventing substrate from mold and bacteria it's also best for hulling off dried wet processed beans the hoeing machine literally crushes and powders the parchment and allows it to drop out of the hauler separating it from the polished beans some heat is introduced due to friction in the hauler higher than 12 percent moisture contact tent adversely impacts the hauler slowing its mechanical progress and eventually adding harmful heat in the process Miller's won't accept coffee over 12 percent shippers won't accept green coffee over 13 percent coffee beans will absorb or loose moisture depending on the ambient climate sometimes beg coffee stored in New Orleans will swell and burst from the absorption of atmospheric moisture of course this is unusual because it requires about a hundred degree temperature and 95% humidity that rarely happens in New Orleans if you really want to know them you're content of your B feet of your beans you can weigh them before roasting and again after some arithmetic is gonna be required to do that but you can do it generally speaking from green bean - roasted bean it's about a 25% drop in weight if you're obsessed there are nifty electronic moisture meters that can be had for a few hundred dollars otherwise if you want to do something really simple just make a habit of dropping a few beans on a hard surface and noting the sound dry beans will sound differently and have a ring to them most fresh coffee beans will be gray screen or jade green drier or old beans can be faded variegated or yellow except for some Yemen and Brazil Naturals which are already yellow aged coffees and Indian monsoon coffees are exceptionally dried by nature and you wouldn't want it otherwise decafs are usually drier than natural coffee and roasting all these coffees requires special care drying coffee beans makes them change in density and hardness as they dry when they come from the rinsing tank and they're put on a drying patio or a raised screen drying racks it's they're prepared be prepared for about a seven day drying process the wet parchment is about 65% moisture at the beginning of the first stage drying to 11% moisture can take one to two weeks depending on the climate skin dry actually refers to the superficial drying of the parchment skin and the drying out of any water that is trapped between the parchment covering and the bean during the first three stages of drying it's important to shade the beans from the midday Sun because the parchment skins otherwise will crack from fast drying in the heat so in drying there are different terms about seven different terms for the drying process and skin dry means that the moisture content is about 45 to 55 percent soft white thirty-three to forty four percent soft black 22 to 32 percent medium black 16 to 21 percent hard black 13 to 15% green dry 10% to 12% and euro drier 9% to 10% black refers to the dark grey green color of the coffee bean inside the yellow parchment skin so drying methods there's a number of drying methods ground drying but it has its hazards animals other things that might get into it raise drying racks have certain advantages because they have they are up off the ground and away from animals but then they are exposed to the elements patio drying is better than ground drying indoor patio drying is probably better than outdoor just because you can control the elements and semi dry parchment coffee can be finished by mechanical dryers which is often done and then one last word about drying and mold another problem that is sometimes experienced with coffee which is the same as if you if you you did hay in the United States one of the things that's experienced with coffee is that it's in the process of drying or near dry and it gets wet and and that's because of tropical showers and that's all too common and outdoor drying requires vigilant because you have to vigilant because you have to stay on top of it you have to make sure it doesn't get wet and if it gets wet you have to dry it before it has an opportunity to get any mold if moldy coffee is begged and Wearhouse even one bag of moldy coffee in contact with another bag will spread the mold to all the bags it's the concept of the bad apple in the barrel moldy copied cannot be curry conditioned once it's molding so in summary what I did want to reiterate to you is the most important thing about storing green coffee is to buy it fresh store it and maintain its freshness which means that airtight out of heat in the dark and use it and roast it and soon as soon as possible it does keep a lot longer than roasted coffee but remember it will absorb smells it will lose moisture and it will absorb moisture I know that the videos that we've done on storage of roasted coffee and now this video and the storage of green coffee are long because we provide an awful lot of information but it is important information if you would like to go look at our other video and you haven't seen it yet on how to store roasted coffee down at the bottom in the description there's going to be a link to that video so please go there and enjoy that as well also don't forget to Like and subscribe as always if you can apply heat to it you can do it happy roasting guys", "Y7b9zm4NlJU": "hey guys welcome back to another video today i'm going to show you guys how to grind coffee beans at home so i recently purchased this coffee grinder on amazon it was about 19 it comes with the coffee grinder and it also comes with a secondary glass the bottom part of this coffee grinder is removable so you could have two batches of coffee grounds ready to go i'll leave a link to it in the description below but that's what we're going to be using and we're going to be grinding up some starbucks espresso so let's get started so first thing i'm going to do is take off the top to the coffee grinder here and this is where we're going to be putting the coffee beans so now we're going to dump some of the coffee beans into the grinder here as you can see the coffee beans are in the coffee grinder and i didn't want to fill up too much just because i knew that the top is going to have to go on this so we're going to place the top back on here and whenever you purchase a coffee grinder it comes with this little crank so just going to have the crank on top of the coffee grinder and we're going to start grinding away so i'm going to let you guys listen to some coffee grinding asmr all right guys there you have it so just filling it barely to the top uh got me this amount in coffee grounds so you just want to keep that in mind and it is a fairly time consuming process so you might want to turn on the tv or just hang out with friends as you're doing this but in the end it is very rewarding coffee and i look forward to making this in my keurig so again i'll leave a link to this coffee grinder in the description below cost me about 19 and very handy thank you guys for watching if you guys enjoyed it be sure to hit that like button and i hope you guys enjoy your coffee", "CYBaxWg24Xg": "so the properties of a whole green bean that is blended and cooked in this way are completely different than a roasted coffee bean hey beautiful people Connor here how are you I hope you're having a great day so I just put out a video why one would want to drink green coffee and you've probably seen that video or you've seen something else in the world that is indicated whole bean green coffee could be a great thing to drink and now you're coming here to this video to find out how to best prepare it and I think I've got some pretty good techniques on how to prepare it I've been drinking green coffee for I guess a little over two months so I've had sixty days or so of preparing it in ways that we're okay some were better than than others and I think I found the best way to do it so far before I get into how to prepare it I want to let you know you can get green coffee on Amazon I was buying first a 1-pound bag and then a couple times I bought two pound bags and then finally more recently I bought a five-pound bag this five pound bag of organic ethiopian coffee was $30 I will put a link to this and a couple of other of the Green Coffee whole bean products that I bought that I think we're great down below in the link you can use that it'll help me get an affiliate link kickback and of course you'll be able to link up with your green hoping coffee very easily okay now before we get into it we're gonna do some really quick basic math I talked about some of this stuff on the other video I made on why you would want to drink green coffee but I think it's important to let you know green coffee does not have as much caffeine as regular coffee as roasted coffee the way we traditionally see it it actually has five times less caffeine it's more like green tea it's not it doesn't even have so much as black tea it's more green tea so that's really nice for a a product in the world that has a lot of nutrition to offer it means that we can drink more of it and I think it's absolutely a wonderful warm and delicious beverage to have in the morning but you can also have it pre-workout or maybe pre something you're doing that you need a little stimulation and just in general it's a nice drink to have around so how we're gonna break this down is just the same as we would with coffee and I looked it up just to make sure all the elements were right and in general most people are using about two grams of whole being coffee I mean they grind it after but two grams of whole bean coffee for one ounce of water and this is 24 ounces of water so we're just going to double that and make that 48 grams of coffee so I've weighed that out over here on this fantastic little scale that I use for all of my weighing purposes and this is about how much it turns into it's about a handful and I haven't been weighing it until this video but as it turns out that's about what I've been doing I just grabbed a small handful and I toss it in the water so that's about the equivalent that maybe you want to try out for the first time 48 grams of coffee beans for 24 ounces of water how much caffeine is that going to be well if it was regular coffee that would be 300 milligrams of caffeine that would really start your day out that's for sure this is only going to be 60 milligrams of caffeine that's less than a regular 8 ounce cup of coffee it's maybe the equivalent of an 8 ounce cup of black tea so it's it's totally you know you'll feel it but it won't run your whole day so after doing this in a few different ways I have determined that the best way to do this is to grind the coffee beans in a high-powered blender like the Vitamix with some water the alternatives to that are you can make your green bean coffee whole you can just put the beans right in if you do it that way you're gonna want to cook it for a bit longer maybe 10 or eighteen minutes another way to do it is of course with a coffee grinder but these beans are much harder in this state than they normally are when they're roasted when when they get roasted the oils come out they soften up a bit in this state it's kind of like grinding pebbles so I have found that adding a little water into my Vitamix container adding those beans blending it up is the best way to get that's fine of a powder as possible so let's do that real quick I'm definitely going to turn the noise off for you because I wake up all my neighbors what I do this so I'm pouring in half of the water [Music] so I may think we blend it until the noise changes when I stop hearing the little pebbles bouncing around the blades and that takes maybe a couple of minutes the reason that I saved half of the water is so that I can pour this out and you can see I've still got grains inside so I'm going to use that other water to do a rinse poured that right into a saucepan and I'll turn it on high now obviously if you were going to use a coffee maker or an espresso machine or a press you would want to do the beans dry without any water and you can definitely do that in a coffee grinder it might it might shorten the life of your coffee grinder a bit I'm not gonna lie to you but if you wanted to do it that way you certainly could and I did it that way for a long time we've all probably had burnt coffee over-over brewed coffee or coffee that's been hanging out in a pot for way too long and it starts to taste super acidic and it hurts the guts it doesn't feel good going down it's it's pretty nasty stuff well that really doesn't ever happen as far as I can tell with the green coffee it doesn't have that acidic taste no matter how much you cook it no matter how much you boil it even boiled dark coffee can bring out this kind of acidic acrid flavor and really unpalatable and this it stays in pretty much the exact same state no matter how long you cook it except of course maybe it gets a little more concentrated as the water boils off I would recommend that you let this boil and then simmer for maybe upwards of five minutes if you're doing the whole bean ungrounded I would definitely do more like 10 to 15 so this beam being that you can cook it for as long as you want really on a saucepan I think is the best thing to do because you're ensuring that you're getting all of the benefits you possibly can out of this incredible green bean so I'm gonna let that cook for a bit and then I'll come back with you will pour it into a cup and I'll show you what it looks like and of course I'm gonna try it cuz it's the morning and I'm really wanting a little bit of this stuff so the water has boiled it's been simmering for a few minutes I'm gonna turn this off I'm gonna temper the glass a little bit so if you don't know what that's all about just put a little hot water in the bottom of your jar if you're using the jar and shake it around so the glass catches up at the heat so it doesn't break I have broken so many mason jars in my life not doing that that I just automatically do it so how I do it is I just pour in the roughest amount that comes out on the pour you can see that there's quite a bit of beam left over but there's also quite a bit of being in the bottom of the glass so that's sort of like my container vessel and then I use another mug to pour some of this the reason I do that is this just gives it a chance to continue to be with the bean and to continue to cook it and when I pour it into this cup it cools off just a little bit I'm able to handle it and hold it and keep it close by and it's manageable but I know that I want to drink about this amount which is why I really like using the mason jar so the properties of a whole green bean that is blended and cooked in this way are completely different than a roasted coffee bean the smell smells more like peas or quinoa and in fact the taste is a bit like that as well it tastes it tastes green it tastes earthy it's really mild I mean it really does taste like if you maybe cook peas and quinoa together and they were mild Peas and Kien want to begin with in water and you took the water and you drank it it's pretty similar at first when I had this I thought mm-hmm that's okay you know kind of like it but I've run out of the of the coffee before over the last two months and I've had some black coffee and I totally don't like black coffee anymore I much much much prefer this I much prefer the flavor I prefer the way that it feels in my body the caffeine that I do feel feels different feels like it integrates differently in my body and I really like it it feels more sustainable a little more relaxed and I'm talking about the equivalent amounts so this is like this is this is important to notice like unit eight has different properties in it so the caffeine is carried and digested in a different way the other thing that I'm doing that you may have noticed is I'm not filtering this which means that we will be drinking some of the beans and this is actually a really wonderful thing to do with any coffee product because you're ensuring that you get some of the beans inside of your digestive tract and specifically inside of your colon where it can continue to do anti glycation magic and if you have no idea what I'm talking about and you want to know more I'd really recommend you check out that video that I referred to earlier about why you may want to include green coffee in your diet so much love to you I hope you enjoyed it I would love to hear what you think about green coffee if you had it before if you're gonna have it if you are looking to buy it get

and we're going to need to be shooting coffee beans and this is the two setups between me and Alan me over here Nikon d70 200 young now Wireless to the young now 560 mark for for the bellow and 50 mil 1/8 fantastic plastic as we better know it that's my setup on my tripod everything like that now I'm going to be shooting on white and Alan's going to be shooting on black now on Alan's side over here we have the Canon 5d Mark 3 with 100 mil macro lens no bellow but he does have extension tubes that he's going to be shooting and as well compared to me running a timer he's going to be using a shutter release I'm going to be running a timer and now also compared to my speed light he's going to be using his 580 e^x mark 2 with the Westcott rapid box octa so that's the challenge bare minimum beast mode let's do it [Music] Oh [Music] you [Music] you [Music] alright guys so comment down below who do you think shot the best shot me or Alan we're both going to pick our favorite and we're going to post that in the video which you obviously already saw so and that's pretty much us shooting macro on some coffee beans now we did use different techniques when shooting the coffee beans as you can see from the title that we used with the white foam core on the glass and that was one that I shot and the snoot and tinfoil and all sorts of stuff there's so many different techniques that you can use this is actually a rogue flashbender that we used as a snoot you can take it and bend it and put it around your flash and Bend your flash pretty much and we use that as a snooze so yeah

to show you my home roasting process let's take a look at my acquaint I have popcorn popper induction stovetop gloves aluminum container and don't forget the let's not forget the time and choice of your favorite beans if you are first-time roasting or you might think about roasting at home try this beans Africa Ethiopia it's really good so current time is 7 and let's figure out how long it's gonna take stay tuned ok so now everything's are set up here in my patio and if you have the heat gun I like to preheat start what 375 let's start it for my gloves on set the timer so last time I did this pin took me 9 minutes so so 9 minutes more like there was medium roast so I like that flavor so I'm gonna do it again so here we go next few minutes I'm just going to just a fast-forward my video clips here I mean this is the most boring part of you know the roasting process you're just spinning and spinning and spinning the popcorn popper it's not fun but or actually it's pretty terrific process you can smell the roasting smell of the coffee and you know trying to develop the profile it's pretty fun anyway let's go back to regular click by just her first flag tonight about seven minutes [Music] so I'm gonna look for another minute or within a half I like meeting rows so now you keep in stop now this is the light whoa [Music] well meantime I'm gonna watch yep popping right now [Music] I'm going to fear for 9 minutes inside [Music] I'll go up there 8 minutes and 30 seconds [Music] another in seconds more [Music] okay I'm in nine minutes so now and then now I have to cool down quickly okay something like this imperfect imperfect copy miss just toss it so current time is so we start roasting around 7:30 so entire process takes about 20 minutes and so now I have to go out and clean it but you know I sticks by a few minutes to clean so it's not a big deal so so half an hour so if you have a half an hour to spare one swig I think it can get a really good coffee at home if you liked the video please like us or you know better yet subscribe alright see you next time", "ZDJNH8xNc1M": "[Music] hey guys welcome to the homestead so today we're going to talk about some kind of doom and gloom stuff going on um i was looking on the news today and i saw these charts this is the m1 money stock chart take a look at this this is this indicates money printing here in america today put out by the federal reserve what that hockey stick tells you that you're looking at right there tells you that they are printing money into oblivion they are running those printing machines like crazy and they it's the m2 money stock look at this chart it's the exact same way what this means folks chances are we are going to see in our lifetime some massive runaway inflation it just is what it is okay and what that means for many things that we enjoy today is that many of the things that we take for granted are going to go away i look um there's nearby there's a mennonite pantry that sells spices sort of in bulk you can buy it in bulk if you want to but they have really good prices on their spices if you know anything about spices they are really expensive if you buy them at a lot of the stores that you go to today a lot of the grocery stores unless you can find a place like we have where you can get them preach pretty affordably and if you know history spices are one of the major reasons a lot of the world's wars were fought you know several hundred years ago france spain britain um uh uh dutch the dutch especially fought major wars over land and sea for the spice trade things like oregano this oregano here you know oregano is not grown in america this most mostly uh fine black pepper the ground black pepper i love black pepper i love pepper you know salt and pepper on my eggs you know when i eat eggs or on my salads pepper black pepper is not grown here cinnamon cinnamon most of cinnamon in the world today is grown in sri lanka cinnamon is not grown here nutmeg how many you guys like nutmeg especially with ground cloves and nutmeg you know we're approaching the time of the year where people love some of the fall taste and spices in their drinks you know the the the different coffees and things like that and this stuff doesn't grow here it's imported it's a part of the spice trade what about chocolate did you know chocolate does not only can only grow about 15 to 20 degrees above or below the equator real chocolate if our economy ever took a crash do you know that chocolate would go bye-bye real chocolate the ability to get chocolate and enjoy chocolate doesn't grow here coffee is another one and we're going to talk about that today coffee has to be grown between 10 and 15 degrees above or below an equator to be grown effectively and so i've teamed up with a home-based business you know how much i love home-based businesses right and so i teamed up with a home-based business veteran-owned business that's based down in mississippi and they have a port there where most of the world's coffee comes into the united states and they have the ability to go into that port because they live just nearby and pick and choose some of the best coffees that you and i can enjoy and they get them green now the cool thing about green coffees is that for long long-term storage and preparedness remember i love prepping it stays good forever just like wheat berries wheat in its berry form will stay good forever they've taken coffee out of egyptian sarcophagus in the past and have planted them and they have grown coffee green coffee beans will stay good forever and so i decided you know what i really want to put aside some coffee for long-term storage i want to have some green coffee beans that you know what if i run out of my current you know roasted coffee beans that i have in my pantry that i can pull out these beans they're not going to go bad i can roast them myself at home and i'll have coffee i won't be able to get more of them just like i won't be able to get more you know cinnamon or black pepper but i can use what i have because it'll stay good forever until the day i decide to actually roast it and use it so today we're going to roast some coffee i'm going to show you how easy it can be to do that and then i'm going to give you the option to contact this home-based business and use a coupon code to get your own so you can have some coffee beans in your long-term storage that will stay good until the day you decide to use them so let's get started [Music] so on this napkin here i've got some brazilian beans these are from brazil green beans and over here are the tanzanian it's weird you can see the difference the ones from brazil are definitely larger than the ones from tanzania and that's what my friend from odyssey coffee told me he said that these tanzanian coffee beans are just a tad smaller than your normal average green coffee bean so very interesting to see the side-by-side comparison with some brazilian versus some green coffee beans from tanzania okay so this is what i use for roasting my coffee beans you can use there's all kinds of different roasters out there folks you can spend an enormous amount of money on roasting machines and gadgets and all kinds of things but really i've been using this for years just a small pan with a top on it and there's one key that you have to remember when it's on the burner you have to keep it moving you have to keep it moving now if you wanted to do a larger batch you could use something like this a popcorn popper a stainless steel popcorn popper it'll definitely keep the beans moving throughout the roasting process but i don't usually do uh large batches like this i just use this for me it's more of a treat where i use a small pot like this and just you know roast a few beans for a couple cup couple cups of coffee okay now just a bit of a warning small warning when you roast these on your stove if you roast coffee in your house understand that a lot of people do this outside number one because it's going to put out a gigantic amount of smell of those roasted coffee beans and if you like that great but if you know if it's a little more overpowering for you the smell can sometimes last for days i don't mind it i love doing it in the house but the second reason that a lot of people roast their coffee beans outside is because when your coffee begins to crackle it produces like you know popcorn you have like the hulls of the popcorn well the coffee produces a very thin lightweight hull that just the slightest breeze can blow it everywhere and can it can get everywhere in your kitchen so uh we will take this outside at some point and i will blow off the chaff or it's really the hulls i guess the hulls right and they'll they'll go everywhere so but just to let you know those two things a lot of times keep people from doing it inside they roast their coffee outside okay i got a couple of small handfuls of coffee beans in here what i'm going to do is put this on the burner and you have to remember to keep it moving you want to keep it moving you know you don't want these things to burn or one will burn more than the other and so you just got to keep the whole pan moving that's the key moving [Music] so this pan is still hot i'm gonna blow into it so you can see all the shaft and all the hulls just go flying away hopefully it'll pick it up on this white background you see that it gets everywhere probably my beard it's been my experience if you don't blow all this off it's just going to get everywhere in your house and so like it's all over my hands and probably in my face it just gets everywhere so i usually come outside blow it off and then go right back inside and then grind my beans so here's my coffee beans my other camera doesn't do it justice so i use my phone which has better a better picture here but does not have as good audio so let me be brief these beans are more of a dark roast i enjoy darker roast when it comes to my coffee but you can look at the oil see how shiny those beans are that's the oil on the outside that's come from the bean after it's been roasted and that's what gives it such a great flavor and if you have a coffee that has been roasted months and months and months beforehand that oil has dissipated and evaporated and it's just not going to give you as flavorful a cup of coffee as if you roast it yourself so you're going to get as much oil as you possibly can it just tastes so much better but anyway that is the benefit of growing or i'm sorry roasting your own green bean coffee and doing it from home now there's like a million ways to grind your coffee but i use a magic bullet simply because that is what i have here so i give it a quick whirlwind the magic bullet and in the cup it goes that was an easy and painless experience something you could do at home with just a simple few simple tools and some really good coffee smells fantastic by the way so if you enjoy coffee in the morning here's the deal here's what you're gonna do you can go to the link in the description below right in the description uh you're going to use

this coffee comes from the country of indonesia indonesian coffee which is roasted after being eaten digested and crushed by the civet which is known by its common name the civic cat law coffee is very famous worldwide because it tastes different from other coffees apparently these bright-eyed free-eyed animals eat mainly the sweetest and freshest coffee cherries once ingested coffee cherries undergo the most natural fermentation system within the soap digestive tract resulting in distinct taste characteristics that cannot be reproduced by any other step after the ferret scrape the seeds cleaned roasted and brewed lava coffee is also good for us to consume to maintain our health so that the body stays warm number two black ivory the price is approximately 42 500 000 million per kilograms if one of these coffees comes from elephant dung the name black ivory sounds cool like mysterious but you don't get it wrong that actually it refers to elephant dung produced through a similar process with copula wok black ivory started with arabica coffee beans consumed by elephants in northern thailand as herbivores elephants carry certain enzymes and during extra slow digestion to the system which produces a unique subtle mellow taste in the final product in other words not all dung coffee is created equal black ivory's really high prices were due to a problem extracting the whole seed the elephant have the formality of chewing more than one large piece of food and also storing them in areas that are hard to find therefore the price of this coffee is very expensive number three san helena san helena coffee beans were first grown on saint helena island pacific ocean the seeds themselves come from the country of yemen the beginning of the coffee bean trade was triggered by napoleon during his exile there coffee beans which are also included in the arabica category were awarded the best coffee in 1851. unfortunately in 2019 saint helena coffee beans are designated as an endangered coffee plant by the uk international union for conservation of nature it's only natural that the price is so fantastic where saint helena coffee beans sell for gbp 60 per 100 grams or the equivalent of either 1 million 67 thousand number four ospina coffee beans ospina coffee beans were first discovered in the highlands of colombia in 1835. they are usually at altitudes of seven thousand seven hundred to seven thousand nine hundred feet this coffee which is included in the arabica category has a very strong azahara aroma uniquely the taste of these coffee beans consists of a mixture of berries chocolate coconut and macadamia nuts when sipped it tastes like red wine for the price ospina coffee beans are priced at 770 us dollars per 250 grams equivalent to 10 million 519 000 million per kilograms number five jamaican blue mountain jamaican blue mountain coffee is classified as the rare coffee in the world this coffee is produced in the blue mountain region jamaica which is located between kingston and port antonio which is unique coffee beans are planted at an altitude of 7500 feet which has high rainfall so that the coffee beans produce are of high quality the things that make this coffee expensive include these coffee cherries that take longer to ripen than other types of coffee and the harvesting process until production is still done traditionally and handmade", "U2SjO65hRxc": "it's horrid Oh God I've got the coffee again now today I've got a little bit of summer different went to Pike arable places and picked up a couple of banks of their home blend didn't know what to expect I mean blooming out there my furniture than they but they're all seem to be branching out into these these different you know inventors coffee this and the other so anyway let's get a couple of bags whack him in the in the blind therein and see what it come out like [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] we've got yeah the one the blue bag or blue econ a pale blue bag is slightly stronger it's a five on the roasting five body and a three acidity this one is four four and four so that's pretty much everything now I've struggled with this really struggled with it I've gone through the whole bloomin law trying to get it right and it just not quite there it's a strong coffee it's a strong coffee it's the Bane's of there you go they're little the dark little suckers look quite a dark bean but what I've suffered with cannot get a decent crema just can't get there they taste there are strong coffee so they taste strong they're very aromatic yeah I'm not I guess I'd be upsetting the past I like a mild coffee these ones are a little bit too strong for me but saying that not overpriced bouncing it was six pounder back yeah well suppose it's a bit fast really yeah so I've really struggled to get a decent a decent mix and these are decent extraction I've really struggled it's all other been I've got the grinder it's really fine and it doesn't come through very well or backed off on the grind and then I've tempted in hard it just flows through too quick well I've got it I've got it to about 15 seconds but the creme is rubbish I know I can put it down too they must be on the shelf for a absolute age and the Bane's have degraded and you find that a lot with the commercial beans that if there are freshly roasted bean from your local rotisserie or whatever they they always crema rock nice they always come through real grill fluffing and beautiful whereas these yeah they've been on the shelf for a while they lose that they lose the crema is the first thing to go so one back down want back to go is this one gonna be any better and I'm gonna prefer it because it says on here it's a it's a more mild being in a more mild blends so let's whack him in the grinder give these ago don't say that one now to be fair let me see if I can get one more one more extraction out of it I'll whip up a coffee and I'll show you what it looks like right let's get some coffee beans in there so this is the this is this once [Music] Oh enough for a cup so there we go there's your ground coffee in there that's just if they say a mile tamp there where this is ground down on on an eight which is quite fine it's quite a quite a fine grind out on me on the rocket I'll give that a press on there back in there let me get a glass so we can see how it's coming out Troye Sivan's while I'm on the subject of beans mmm christmas has just been and gone we went to a few Christmas markets while we were out and about well I tell you what well there's just one thing to say about this these beans what's going on with Christmas Marcus I'll tell you what you go there we went down the embankment was the last one down in London on the embankment it all looks the same as everywhere else all these Christmas markets and all these major cities they all look the same the same sheds that they've Beryl in the projects the selling it's all looks handmade and you know kind of like these people are local people all their their you know tradesmen in the craftsmen it's a load of old Tosh everything everything is the same so they're just making it law in some factory somewhere and then he's shipping it out to these markets and putting some minimum wage in there to sell it to you pretending that they've made it made it made it this is no different oh my god do you know what I bought these beans I've got chocolate orange scotch whiskey Jamaica Rum just to try to see what them alive if out brought me blender oh I'd say you what the these the beans when you get there you get to the shed and they're all in separate compartments and you're checking out some of those plays and they get the little scoop out and you know bag you it or charge your bow I quit for a bag of beans anyway it's bloody horrible it's absolutely awful it's the cheapest nastiest stinking coffee I've ever had I put one bag in the blender I blended it all well I couldn't get the smell out of the blender Oh [Music] the photo was good when you in the middle of service they saw the bishop in Bible phones on a floppy summer yeah back to the beans do not buy these beans they are garbage garbage garbage they're horrible horrible horrible horrible and it Marcus I got him in the blender couldn't get the smell out that's it clean it all how it was did there pondered this stinking horrible there just like a bean they roasted him or Butler form that bought me all grossed it and then they've just tipped a load of chemical of red some fragrance you know like the chocolate orange they've just tipped a loaded loaded chocolate orange flavoring over the a lot and and slob absolute garbage yeah forget it rubbish right where we got on a bit of tangent there got off for more let's get back to your cabins yes here we go then this is the yeah five roasted five body half acidity let's bang it out the old blender and get in the cup here we go can you see that can we see [Music] we've got about 10 seconds out of that but that's probably the best one about that's typical of it they came out quick but he's calmed down a bit now look she's certainly he's got ideas go up if a creme Rob there believe it or not after all I've just said it's it's a big extraction know that he's they saw how fast he came through and look how much I've got in the cup that was a 10-second so he's yeah it's a real hard one to gauge it it's a real tricky one you to fine you to little yeah let's give it a taste and see what she's like it's horrid Oh God yeah that tastes over extracted it's nasty nasty aftertaste to it it smells like it smells like a bonfire yeah it smells like you've got a bit of water down at the bonfire and stuck he knows it's it's a root is that's what it takes my toes on burn ward oh it's so tight up yeah it's bad it's not a good taste that I that is not a good taste so now out with the old in with the new yeah I can't say about that with any cough that's probably the worst mo over than that it's probably the worst coffee about I want to see ya I'm gonna go with that that is the worst coffee I've ever tasted what right let's get some of those ones in the UH nice get the bum going to get the rest of their bags out there so we're not contaminating the next extraction let's get these let's get rid of these beans I might need a father driving me mad now in a in a lack tight in Atlanta it was bearable [Music] okay that's really that let's get back so even the placket they're not vented there's no there's no vent on this pack at all it's got its got a resealable tab at the top but there is no there's no vent on this bag it is it is sealed so why is everybody else venting the bags and the knees on there's no air in it it's not been backpacks almost so I'm not a vent on it it has got a vent man it must have been just squashed up that tight yeah that's gone now they know better they look a little bit better they're a bit lighter sorry if you can't pick it up to one on the camera but they do look much lighter stop I mean if you like papi that is boy you're a tall strong right then here we go we're in and living on the same it's the light so that there is going in the bin let's get shots of that alright let's try again let's try again let's get this one it's a sloppy put that one is very sloppy yeah she's out let's get something [Music] [Music] mmm-hmm see that is much it's a much lighter it's a better smell God I'm so full so I'm so full so fast it all came out thirty and that's just start to run through to water after 15 now look at that yeah that looks a bit but a bit better smells a bit about its settling down it's looking alright again we've got a bit of a crema on there and you saw how much slower that extraction was same same gauge same grind a lot slower came through they came through the filter there through the porter filter a lot slower it's a completely different taste warehouses now bizarrely that's a bit fruity it's getting worse as it's getting there at the bottom but in a latter I think that will taste quite nice Oh daddy is saying organic I mean again it's quite strong coffee it's got a bit of a kick to it oxide as it's getting near the bottom it's getting stronger let's just forgetting that crema it's the crema that's doing that but the creme has got a bit of acidity to it it's got that it's got like ice is it the acid D kind of odd yes show me Tom and that's it that's come up in the crema so that yeah the froth the froth has got the acidity the actual the extraction the coffee is is quite a bit is quite nice it's not bad it's not bad or no means is this one of my favorite coffees ever you know it's way down the list but it's drinkable that it's bearable you know for a young for a furniture shop it's not too bad but you know what IKEA I think you can keep your beans and I'll stick to Miele buzzers and yeah whatever else yeah I think yeah as far as that goes I don't know why he got into coffee you stuck the name on the bagging yeah it ain't the best very average very average that crackle a table with it there so it's locking a lot a pork on this one oh the stock there it is it's a sticky book it's a sticky book so there's the puck nice filling draw the balancing on the edge let's have a quick fish in session that's getting there yeah yeah there it is it's gone right through so it's a good extraction yeah messing about without we've got it set about right on the on the scale yeah I still got this flavor in the mouth it's strong a strut it's not really my I can't put that down as my old I say that second bag the first bug is extremely strong by your head off that second bag isn't my old it so it's a strong coffee it games quite warding it's got a little bit of fragrance in there a little bit a lot of acidity I found that this is quite acidic which I think did he say that that it was a it was a it's got a for acidity for where was the first one is not a three so it definitely could taste the acidity in in the crema let's get some he's thinking about it if she comes [Music] this is the problem that you have again that came out in a completely different way - the first one didn't tamp it any differently really same similar pressure what is that all about the grind is exactly the same and it sucked it out in off the time we've still got a little bit of crema on the top there but you're never gonna get a consistent extraction when when the flow is gone through this such different rains we know it ain't the machine and everything else that's absolutely spot-on so it's got to be down to the beans it's gonna be this is very very weird how you can have one extraction so different to the next but let's cook some milk or let's get some milk with that [Music] well it's nice it looks like a lily look at that oh dear I never Marquette they'll never make a lighting artist right there we go moans truth they know that's not half about that he can still taste that acidity on that top crema still coming through it's a lot milder than the other one a lot milder but I still got traits of burnt wood in there I can still taste a bit of like I say a bit of bonfire it's what where did these flavors come from it is bizarre I know that roasted and whatever but you wouldn't expect you can get such a different taste from one to the next it'll go down well with the rest of this on latte yeah I wouldn't want to do it as an espresso or an Americano not the right be for that you've got to have a good quality bean to do the the espresso and the Americanos the milk just hides a lot of the inconsistencies in the flavor there and yeah it's a cheap bean it doesn't taste very good it's not the best so I won't be buying any more of them we shall stick to what we know are to try different ones just to see cuz it's a is you know why not so I've talked about the challenge have a try on a taste but no don't bother with this stick to stick to some half-decent stick to you you know your favorite one sealer buzzes I like that Lavazza crema rasa oh it's a good one and mr. Martin's he's still my favorite so Marty's roses in Leicester they're fried history that the minute is beautiful so oh it's got a bigger bow at the end of that yeah no I think there's only one way to improve the flavor of these beans I'm us with a bit of that oh now this stuff this is really nice how they there's this latte macchiato lakeil yeah enough to make any bad coffee tastes absolutely beautiful know what I mean Oh get out a quick Swizzle heavenly bodies oh goodness me oh not now is this smooth as you like it's absolutely lovely I will not take money though I don't think you make a point it it's 15% yeah a little bit of a kick to it this is lovely though I've been a evening stick a bit of that in you in your latte really nice really really nice makes it air is just smooth really smooth and sweet and lovely yeah that's beautiful we've been doing those over Christmas a bit of milk been a Bailey's stick it in the in the frother steam steam the Bailey's in the milk absolutely beautiful beautiful and the same with this lucky latte macchiato you know lucky all of that a sped-up if it's been any use to you drop me a thumbs up enjoy a coffee I have a good day and thanks for

ready to use again [Music]", "liGwcuFyaNY": "I'm Dylan Edwards and I'm a coffee expert it is actually horrific ly terrible [Music] with these two coffees the difference is starkly obvious coffee a has a really dark glossy surface it even smells somewhat pungent just holding it whereas coffee B is cinnamon II in color it sort of has a silver skin intact in each of the beans so it's definitely a light roast it's not necessarily a direct indication of price difference it is a personal preference some people just really enjoy dark roasted coffee versus a light roasted coffee however a dark roasted coffee generally is going to mask a lot of the flavors in the coffee itself kind of like a heavy sauce it's gonna sort of just cover up all the sweetness and all the inherent characteristics of the coffee and really impart a Carboni sort of smoky flavor whereas with a light roast the nuances of the coffee the flaws the good attributes and the bad ones really do shine through with a light roast you're looking at more often than not a higher quality coffee and with a dark roast it's a little bit hard to say what the quality might be we will of course brew them and taste them and then see from there so the first thing I'm doing is just rinsing these filters the reason behind that is a lot of paper filters will actually impart a bit of a papery flavor in your cups you want to really wash out some of that flavor just scarred it before you bring your coffee so you got a really clean the coffee we have our filters rinsed we're gonna grind our coffee first thing I always do is smell them part of that is heat masks flavor you don't want to drink your coffee that's piping hot not only did not burn your tongue but also because it's really hard to taste that's why if you go to a gas station when you're on a road trip and you have a really piping hot gas station cup of coffee you could probably get half of it down without noticing it but as it cools off and it's sitting in your cup holder it's gonna taste awful coffee a is a definitely got like a really molasses e texture like almost the experience of having raw sugar on your tongue it kind of leaves one with like an almost bitter sweet kind of sweetness the acidity is extremely muted here what I'm getting is overall like a very velvety mouthfeel general kind of OneNote Wow after drinking coffee a coffee B is like drinking fruit juice there's like clear kind of stone fruit acidity it almost tastes like a sweet peach kind of nectarine flavor probably wondering why I'm slurping really loudly slurping the coffee taking some air in with your your sip is actually a great way to sort of aspirate your palate into to incorporate lots of air as you're tasting we actually taste a lot with our nasal passage so as we're bringing air in when we're tasting we really activate our olfactory sense and we really incorporate our sensory ability to taste I would say that sample B is the more expensive of the two just based on the transparency and the clarity of the sweetness press sample a is most likely a let's see [Music] hey wallah with darker roasts the coffee itself isn't necessarily inferior however more often than not the dark of the roast the less and less you can actually taste the origin character of the coffee with coffee a like I said I'm not necessarily certain that that quality of the beans are inferior but I can say that I cannot taste the origin character at all really just tasting a very caramelized very carbonic flavor that gives me a general impression of roast flavors whereas sample B is a very fresh very fruited very clear crisp flavor profile it definitely tastes like a unique flavor of origin I see pretty stark difference between a and B B is a fairly uniform looking being it has really whole clean kind of appearance to it the roast is a bit lighter all of the beans are fully intact they're a very uniform shape and size as sample a here there are some very misshapen beans and very small bits broken bits or even some of these pale colored blonde pieces and and beans themselves which we refer to as Quakers which are basically under ripe coffee seeds that are picked too early I'm gonna say this is a specialty coffee and this is a commercial-grade coffee just based on a beer really really bitter almost kind of sour as well honestly the aroma has kind of gone from just a rusty smell to now it almost smells like kind of a wet newspaper it's very bitter I instantly want to put a lot of sugar in this coffee this coffee is clear it's sweet it's a exciting coffee has really great sweetness has really good flavors this is a kind of coffee that I'd really want to just enjoy on its own black this coffee is the kind of coffee I'd expect on most flights and I'd really only asked for it if I was super desperate let's see how much they are [Music] Wow big difference needless to say these are very different coffees every step behind this coffee had to have been carefully managed for this cup to be so sweetened so clear this coffee is something that probably grew at a variety of altitudes it's grown with out of focus it was probably not even dried carefully or milled carefully it probably came from a very voluminous rose tree that was really looking to shave cost and to really just produce a drinkable caffeine beverage and and not something that was really delicious these two samples are fairly average in appearance one of them has a slightly more developed roast I can see that there's a little bit of oil on the surface which is an indication that was roasted a little bit longer whereas sample a does still have the silver skin intact which is some of the cell material of the coffee seed this is more indicative of a lighter and medium roast however these roasts aren't different enough that I would lump one into the bucket of dark roast and light roast these two coffees are probably of a similar caliber however I imagined sample a is probably just a little bit better we're gonna have to taste them to find out the first thing that I'm doing when I brew a cup of coffees I'm I'm gonna hit each cup with a bit of hot water and I'm gonna look for some off-gassing to happen it looks like one of these is already off gassing quite a bit more than the other one to me that indicates a fresh roast this coffee here is bubbling up you can see multiple bubbles still coming up probably 30 seconds into this room now this one here is just sort of sunk in it's already sort of stopped any sort of action it's probably a little bit more of a stale roast so fresh froze bubbles it really causes what we call the bloom and that that is because there is gas trapped inside freshly roasted coffee part of the roasting process is putting the coffee through a really really wide array of chemical reactions during the roast and what happens in that roasting process is gas are physically trapped inside the beat slowly over time they will leak out of the coffee bean however they do expediently leak out once the coffee is ground this is one of the reasons you really want to seek out whole bean freshly roasted coffee it's gonna be a lot more lively and sweet and vibrant when you get it and brewed it out sample amy has like sort of a crisp almost like apple like acidity really refreshing really clear it's actually a very sweet cup of coffee it has sort of almost a sugary character to it it reminds me of rooibos tea yeah it's very crisp very light very fresh with a mouth-watering acidity the predominant note here is a very tobacco leaf flavor very kind of bitter earthy flavors that are almost like heavy on the palate leaving one with like a heavy kind of bitter aftertaste overall it's a kind of a dull experience that that acidity that I was talking about in cup a I'm getting almost little to none of that type of acidity at all really I'm experiencing mostly a very big bodied cup of coffee something that you know it would definitely take a lot of milk and sugar quite well but on its own is it's not a very enjoyable cup of coffee at all based upon what I'm tasting I think a is definitely the more expensive coffee and I was clear expressive flavor vibrant acidity good sweetness it's very balanced it's very crisp coffee B again is is very tobacco a very tired very muted in terms of its flavor overall it just leaves kind of a heavy bitter flavor on the tongue I'm gonna assume that this is a commercial-grade coffee and it is the less expensive of the two we'll have to see [Music] based on these prices I think it's fair to say this is probably bottom of the shelf grocery store Best Buy coffee whereas $28 a pound you're probably gonna find this at your specialty coffee shop something that's freshly roasted in small batches when you're looking for coffee in your grocery store you really want to look for coffee that has a roasted on date not a best buy date roasted on really gives you a sense of whether that coffee is fresh you really want to look for coffee that's no older than then two or three weeks past it's roast eight if you want to enjoy it adds peak whereas coffee that has a best buy date and no roasted on date will really not give you any sense of how fresh it is that type of coffee is most likely commercial-grade it's a probably cheaper and there's a reason we see all sorts of varieties when we're traveling the world and sourcing coffees varieties just like in apples or in wine and coffee we also have specific types of seeds that produce specific types of plants if you're ever at your farmers market and you've seen the various varieties and apples available for sale the same thing is the case with coffee when we go to specific organs like Colombia like Panama like Guatemala we will encounter specific varieties of coffee I see two dishes which have very uniform beans in them coffee a has really elongated beans which is an indication of a few exotic varieties that I'm aware of the bean itself looks a lot like sort of an Eastern Ethiopian bean of being from Harar or a bean from even Yirgacheffe will have sort of an elongated shape like that whereas this bean over here has a very uniform sort of smaller kind of more round oval shape based on the way that these coffees look I'm gonna guess that coffee a has probably a very unique variety behind it it is most likely a Geisha or a pak'ma'ra variety something that is very unique and exotic whereas coffee B being kind of a dense smaller more more compact bean it's most likely a common variety like a bourbon or cat au revoir we're gonna have to taste them to find out soak up these was really fresh it's really satisfying has a pretty big body sort of has a character of a really juicy kind of caramel soaked apple flavor but overall also just a classic flavor sample a sampling is so distinctive it's got a really really apricot forward kind of flavor profile it almost tastes like a like an Earl Grey tea just doused with apricot juice super light super crisp it's a really exotic and really unique cup of coffee based on tasting these two coffees I'm fairly certain that this is a Geisha or something very exotic maybe maybe a variety I haven't even heard of in any event it has such clarity and such like pronounced clear distinctive singular flavors that I would assume that it's much more expensive than this cup this cup cup B is still very sweet very satisfying it has tons of fresh acidity however the flavors on the whole are more of a caramel II kind of classic predictable coffee experience in comparison to cup a let's see what they are [Music] whoa yep that is a rare variety of coffee at 86 dollars a pound and this one isn't bad either at $30.00 ago based on the price point I'm gonna say this is most likely a Geisha coffee geisha trees are extremely scarce in the world the fact that this coffee is so sweet and so clean makes me think it's probably from one of the most famous farms in Panama producing geisha however I of course do not know this coffee is fantastic - this is the kind of coffee when you're when you're going to splurge when you're you're gonna spend a weekend at home and you really just want to treat yourself you buy a fantastic single single producer a lot or a great coffee from your local roaster that it they're proud of it's probably gonna taste a little bit more like this and cost a bit more in this range with these two coffees it's pretty hard to tell which of them is the more expensive of the tube coffee a looks like it may be a single varietal lot just based on the the oblong elongated shape of the coffee looks like it might be a more exotic variety however coffee B and coffee a are both really uniformed they have no broken bits they have no Quakers it really looked like high-quality well processed coffees both of these coffees look so high-quality that I look forward to tasting them and seeing what the differences both of these coffees were really good they're both very expressive they're both very sweet it's hard to say which of these is is the better I think it makes sense to to continue tasting them in fact I'm gonna break out a cupping spoon a cupping spoon is a spoon that we use for tasting coffee professionally and it just helps us aspirate the coffee when we slurp it it allows us to incorporate some air really spray that coffee all across our palate I'm taking a couple more sips I'm realizing that cup a is actually distinguished ibly more juicy it's it's got a lot of citrus really really leaving me with a super crisp super lasting sort of juicy flavor in my mouth with cup B I'm getting a lot more sort of a general flavor profile a more of an impression rather than a clear distilled flavour that to me makes me think that club a is probably the more expensive however I imagine that they're probably pretty close let's see [Music] aha Sookie takeaways cup a is most likely extremely specific probably down to a single farm probably maybe even down to a single varietal from a single farm grown at a specific altitude whereas cuppy more of a general flavor profile really good really enjoyable but getting more of an impression and less of a singular flavor experience that to me indicates probably something that was grown in a general region not necessarily as expressive as cup a and thus probably more of like a regional lot type of coffee the great thing about this is one can enjoy fantastic coffees that are traceable to a region well also for a little more money enjoy coffees that are really traceable down to a single farm and get really specific with the tasting experience [Music] while you may not need all this information when you're just brewing your morning cup of coffee what I hope you will take away from this is that you can get well roasted freshly roasted traceable coffee for less than $30 a pound which is out sprouts better value than a good bottle of wine at

easy to fill behave", "0a1-qd5BySE": "[Music] everybody Roger Busby here with me gnome Roasters today we're going to go ahead and want to be roasting some coffee in a skillet we've already got it preheated we have our stirring utensil we recommend a wire whisk or silicon whisk because we find that it just does a better job of agitating the beans and with a wooden spoon at least I have a tendency to end up with beans popping out on my pan all the time which is kind of annoying we have 3/4 of a cup or 125 grams of green unroasted coffee we have a timer device so we can go ahead and keep track of it in our journal and we also have this nice metal mesh colander that we'll use to cool the beans down and so without any further ado we're gonna go ahead and grab those beans when I hit start and we're immediately gonna go ahead and start stirring and it's really important to go ahead and add to take your beans you keep stirring the entire time to get this even a roast as possible if you just let them sit and just stir them occasionally you're gonna get a very hungry and uneven roast and some of the beans are gonna burn on one side and still be almost we're all on the other so it's really important to make sure that you keep the beans moving at all times we find that most of our roasts if we're using a skillet runs somewhere in the 12 and a half the 14-minute ranged and so it's gonna depend on you know your skillet size and atmospheric conditions today is pretty interesting if springtime but of course you live in northern Maine so it is snowing out still the air inside the house is fairly dry and we've got it on medium or just a little over medium your stoves may be different you know don't be afraid to experiment with one of the joys of roasting at home go ahead and try different things out try different beans different beam sizes different origins different methods of roasting so we're gonna go ahead and step away for just a second while these continue to roast and we'll go ahead and bring you back in in a minute all right so about four and a half minute mark we've heard just heard our first beans go ahead and crack now if you're not familiar with what's going on here as long as the beans heat up moisture is pushed out and eventually they reach an internal temperature somewhere between 480 and 530 degrees Fahrenheit around there abouts and they caused the bean to go ahead and crack open and expel moisture more rapidly and we call that first crack now first crack once you have a full first crack we've only heard a couple so far the coffee is considered roasted it's a blonde roast or a light roast this can be fairly thin cup of coffee it's not gonna be full-bodied it is however going to be fully caffeinated caffeine binds to water and as you roast now you know that water is expelled and it takes caffeine with it the darker you wrote the less caffeine you have but the more flavor you have that's something to keep in mind a lot of people think it's darker it tastes more full it must have them more caffeine than EpiPens actually it's the exact opposite you really here to crack starting now you'll see there's a lot of chaff not to mention quite a bit of smoke coming off you want to make sure that you have your vent hood on or some kind of exhaust fan if you have your smoke detectors on you may want to disable them depending on how close they are to your stove and how well your your venting exhaust apparatus and works good go ahead and cause it to go off now you'll see the beans are quite a bit darker you also notice that they're of varying shades have done this with this method of roasting that is going to be a thing there's not a whole lot you can do about it the better you agitate the views the Jeffery's there will be the first couple times you tried this we tried it with a spatula we tried it with a wooden spoon and the disparity between beams was quite alarming we found that using a wire whisk like this and you know obviously we had one that was you know coated in something else that would be a little bit nicer to our cast iron pan we too used it but we find that it does a better job of keeping the beings agitated and giving us is even a roast as possible with this skillet roasting you can hear we hear those beans cracking quite a bit where it's a seven minute mark and again normally we end up somewhere around the 12 minute 14 minute range depending on the level of roast you want then we tend to go with a nice medium roast sometimes we'll roast it even right up to the edge of second crack and starting to get you know right in the edge of those dark there the lighter versions of the dark was you know just creeping into that territory but that's because that's where we like it if you like a French roast you're gonna want to probably go another minute or two once you hit first crack those things really start to move along even though it may not look like it but they really do and you know this is the point where you really need to be paying attention don't slack off don't stop stirring and you want to keep things keep things going you want to have your colander ready when the time comes to take this off because we're doing it in the skillet and because we're going to be taking care of the chap outdoors we need to pull it off actually a little ways before our desired roast level and the reason is those beans are going to continue to roast until we can get the temperature down okay now fortunately for us we live in northern Maine and it is early spring which means of course it is snowing outside so plenty cold enough to get the job done that's for sure we're at the eight and a half minute mark and things are moving quite along this may be our quickest roast you know if you find that things are moving too quickly or not quickly enough they'll be afraid again to adjust your temperature he'll just you know know where it is that you want to go or have a you know at least a general idea and adjust your your heating your climbing accordingly at this point we're starting to see some beans that have a little bit of oil coming to the surface and so I think we're getting to the point this is nine minutes second crack is starting in here it kind of sounds like cellophane so I think we're gonna go ahead and want to pull it now and we're gonna go ahead and take these outside all right so like we said you can see there's still a lot of smoke coming off this and you can see all the chests and this is why we don't use our air popper indoors so in the wintertime we've been raced outside in the winter we've just put our roaster inside a box to get a temperature up it does take longer but this is why you you don't do this indoors because you have all this chaff coming off the idea now no matter when you're roasting what time of year the idea is to cool the bees all of us now we're doing it in here because it just agitates it extra and you can get more of the cap off with your courses what you want to do now there are some people that they go ahead and they handle this process a little bit differently they'll go ahead and either decaf it by hand or they'll spread it out thinly on a cookie sheet first and let the beans completely cool before they try this if you do that and just know it's gonna take a lot longer for your beans to cool down and so they're gonna continue to roast so you need to take that into account and take your beans off the heat sooner knowing that they're not gonna stop roasting nearly as quickly but we find this is about the best when you're shaking it up like that as the beans been together obviously they take off any additional chaff that might be on there but down when you're done and that's what you're left with it's a pretty nice medium or else you see there is quite a bit of difference in some of these that one there you want to get rid of those you're going to be very bitter some of the beans do not roast all the way but and there's the snow on top of the confident but that's a guy that's gross [Music]", "8c-QPEIaoGg": "everybody's Monday here crab clutch and you know what that means that means it's make something Monday number of years ago I purchased this silicon pie plate and I planned on doing you know baking all kinds of pies and everything in there and I have used it exactly zero times since buying it so it just seems like the right thing to do would be to use it in my crafts and mainly by resin so I'm gonna be making a bowl out of this it's kind of more of a platter Bowl I'm going to be using coffee beans and I'm gonna be using the EZ cast resin which I always use and remember you can buy at your local craft store Michaels carrots it Hobby Lobby carries it you can buy it online and if you can't find it or need to find internationally go to their website at www.att.com/biz available internationally so let's get onto it we have the coffee beans and what I need to do is I'm going to pour the resin in here and I'm going to use all of it so I'm just gonna put it all right in there and I'm going to kind of start mixing the coffee beans around in here and the reason I'm doing this is I want them to be coated and I know need more than this but I want to do a little bit at a time so that I get everything nice and coated it's very important just to make sure it's all coated just for to be able to preserve it all and remember I'm using this for for the resin so I really don't want to be using this to bake anything in in the future it's now strictly a craft pie plate okay I'm gonna start spreading it around I don't really know if I have enough coffee beans in here yet or not I'm gonna start spreading it around and I want it to have a bit of a lip on the side okay once you've worked it to where you have it the way you want it you're gonna want to let this sit for a minimum of 12 hours before you unmold it and everything should have been covered with the resin so that every every piece that is up against another piece will be sticking together and hopefully it all worked out fine and when I come back tomorrow morning I'll pop it out and we'll have this great bowl this great decorative Bowl I'm back to unmold the coffee plate tray bit made the peeled rounder with nothing and here it is actually this is really cool because this silicone one it's it's very smooth but I still expected it to be a matte finish like all the other stuff it's not it's like mirror shiny beautiful look a bit so that's a nice unexpected surprise so here it is now you have this nice sturdy coffee bean Bowl you could use it to put your keys on you could you could put like spoons and stuff on there if you're serving coffee and you want to carry it out on a decorative little tray you could have wrapped stuff sitting on here you can make something bigger if you could find a bigger mold and I will be looking you can have like a big tray and you could do all kinds of things like for cupcakes and here's an idea it just occurred to me you could even like here's a plain candlestick so you glue it on there and now you have this really cool serving tray you know I would resins probably not food safe but you could put wrapped candies on their cupcakes because they have the paper on there anything of that nature cookies you know the cookies that come and those little paper things would be perfect so look how cute is that so I hope you like it I hope you give it a try remember to rate comment and subscribe stop by my website at www.flcfs.org", "TlNxC1ZveAA": "hey

right by Washington Square Park in New York City. I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making\nskills. So, what sort of beans should you be buying\nto make coffee at home? This is kind of a tricky question because\nit depends on who is offering coffee in the area that you're at, as well as are they doing\na good job. And unfortunately, there's no real way to\ntell until you buy it and taste it, unless you have some feedback from someone you trust\nor someone you know. But one kind of guideline to look for\u2014it's\nnot 100% guaranteed but a lot of grocers that are good in recent years have started moving\nto this trade program called Direct Trade, which is sort of a catch-all phrase to describe\nwhen the roaster is working directly with a farmer. So they're actually going there visiting once\nor twice a year. They have a relationship, they can guarantee\nthat it's quality, they often will actually invest in that farm and help them to get their\nquality of their coffee up. So basically, if you were to search for roasters\nthat have a Direct Trade program, you can at least contact them and see if you can buy\nonline or if they're selling in your area. That's what I would definitely recommend as\na place to start. Just search for that and then kind of take\nit from there.", "iPM98OXhLVA": "hello today we would like to talk about the different flavor profiles from three of the major graphical regions in the world Central America Eastern Africa in Indonesia let's start with central america central american coffees usually come from either Guatemala El Salvador Costa Rica these coffees are really well known for their bright tart acidity chocolaty components caramel sweetness and fruitiness that goes with it a lot of people say words like clean or balanced are characteristics of these coffees next we have coffees from eastern Africa these are copies from Uganda Kenya Tanzania or wandah these coffees are really complex and diverse in their flavors depending usually on the way that they were processed either washed or natural process washed are ones that are usually on the fruity side jasmine aromas and give you this really floral textures and tea like structure the other ones that dry process coffins which are usually dried with their fruit in it provide these more complex fruity bolder and earth your tones so there are two different flavors depending on the way that ever process finally there copies from indonesia indonesian copies are usually bigger bolder earth here in aromas and are lower in acid than the traditional other styles especially the ones for sumatra they're ideal for dark roast and the for espresso drinks so the next time you visit a coffee shop i would highly encourage you to try either one of those three coffees from the three regions that we just on

actually still does it the old traditional way is the Oscars cause your babysitter's landlord iced tea rose on the table analysis place been here since 1947 basically we call the show from a distant relative in four of May 1978 that's what they look like yeah it doesn't merely doesn't hiss of anything it has to be a girl great so old school is it I love it even the old weighing scale - like Randy for you you could smell it now pretty does I would like to get home the other day everybody's in on the train stop looking at you girl everybody's miserable fabulous the I smell like a toast melting

posted inside we got energy", "wI9M59_HSAg": "hello in this video I'll be showing off a really cool roster that I got recently it's a ceramic roaster from Korea actually bought from Amazon though and I really like it because it really roasts mean means very efficiently depending on the level of roasting you want for your coffee beans at Finch's roasting within 10 20 minutes so I'll be go I'll go ahead and start roasting my coffee for like a single on date usually like a scoop of coffee is enough and even our roast I think up to 3 scoops of coffee which if you imagine this to be like half an ounce different nutty things and it's really convenient if you have a gas stove I don't think this I don't think this was gonna work at all I will say an electric stove otherwise you can probably use like a like a burner from one of your barbecue and then you just sometimes just leave it sitting until the pen or ulster heats up and then it start fixing it or you can start mixing it empty once it reaches a certain level of heat start with a really small amount of smoke and that's when you want to start mixing it if you don't want to keep mixing it until I get so warm and you know so I just wait until this heats up when it starts cracking like that that would be like the first crack when it comes to roasting your beans and usually you will you would want to wait like self a minute minutes afterwards for a medium roast and longer afterwards and at this point I like to decrease the amount of heat I'm letting out so it's enough slower more even the roast or the means and I also like to turn on the fan so that my house isn't starting smelling like coffee means I personally like the smell but not ever likes the smell depending on where you live [Music] really really smoke once in such towards the medium in the dark roast levels right now it's the medium ones you see after like 10 minutes and if you leave it in the roaster it'll keep roasting the coffee's coffee beans for a while one thing you want to be careful about is that this here is just open inlet to the main chamber which is pretty useful if you want to pour down pour coffee beans until a vessel or container so I'm going to go ahead and grind up the beans so about this much to me like two or one and a half tablespoons is enough for like a 1/2 good puffs of coffee I like to make mine strong so it'd be about 1 cup of coffee usually you don't want to just directly for the means into into the grinder especially if there's plastic parts to it like my grinder actually broke because of the heat I think you can see there's like a fine line crack hairline crack something like this should be fun you want to take closer look at the beans you can see these uh this is how the beans came out yeah it looks pretty good a nice medium dark roast one more of a medium roast but yeah and I'm sure I'm done grinding it usually you know you would want to use this ceramic grinder but my ceramic whatever those these cheap ceramic grinders you can find from Amazon these just breaking up break down too fast too easily either that or I'm not careful enough and so this is how the grinds came out you can see how nicely the grands came out so now remember these are called Aeropress you know for making your coffee I'm just gonna go ahead and pour it in and there's a reason why to freshly roast my coffee every air right before drinking in I think freshly roasted coffee has a superior taste the coffee that's been sitting around whether it be pre pre roasted beans or ground to beans I think if you just that's what coffee sit around for a while the taste starts to deteriorate at least that's my opinion or experience another time but a major reason why I like to roast my coffee beans right before I drink him like this immediately after roasting I like to drink that coffee it's because like my stomach is very sensitive almost does it have like IBS I bet something similar to ideas but if I make coffee that's you know very fresh or like I roast the coffee and then right after if I make a coffee out of that it's really it's a lot easier on my stomach like sure there's a laxative effect that that many people experience after taking a hot cup of coffee but there's no pain but if I if I drink like really old coffee then I then it just really messes my stomach up you want to leave some room on top because the bloom will actually cause the coffee to rise up I haven't properly mixed it up yet so don't you do that it looks like I don't have too much bloom but you know it depends on the your level of roast usually a medium roast has the highest level of bloom you can see it's not like a bright yellow it could be also that the coffee is just thinking through the filter very fast and that's probably what it is this is how the coffee looks see it actually has a lot of gas but I think the coffee is just sinking down fast to the paper filter so I'll go ahead and give it a press and see how the coffee came out and definitely I think the coffee tastes better when you all sit fresh usually it tastes like there would be more off flavors the longer you'd leave coffee to go stale so thank you

Pete's bringing you a new video and this video is gonna be about five ways to store freshly roasted coffee beans so hey guys what's crackin no pun intended here so what we're gonna talk about is we're gonna cover some ways that you can store your coffee so that you maintain freshly roasted taste and aroma for as long as possible okay so before I get into how to store your coffee properly I'm going to talk to you about why you need to store your coffee properly and that's because coffee has for environmental enemies and those enemies are air moisture heat and light now it's with anything else there's no surefire way well with maybe the exception of time travel to maintain and guarantee the freshness and shelf-life of coffee but if you've been bitten time travel we need to know however if you haven't let's talk about why coffee doesn't maintain its shelf life very well and that's because coffee is chemically reactive and it deteriorates over over time just like any other food so the shelf life even the highest grade of roasted coffee is two weeks and really after that it depends on your tolerance because it it will be greatly degrade after two weeks so depending on your long-term storage tolerance it may not be acceptable for you to have it after two weeks but then again you'll just have to experiment and see but we recommend that you not definitely not drink coffee that's older than two weeks so there's a lot of pros and cons and depending on the methods that I'm going to talk about it's going to depend largely on your particular taste and your preferences okay the best part my favorite part of freshly roasted calm coffee is the aroma it smells really good and it just you know can take you someplace else freshly roasted coffee al gases because of porous so the aroma gasses naturally migrate from the internal cells to the surface because when you're during when it's put in the roasting process they're under pressure so commercial Roasters that sell ground coffee and cans let the roasted beans sit in bins from 24 to 48 hours to out gas before grinding in packaging you've probably seen that commercial portion packs that are in restaurants someone ran a pod some of them ran a little thing those portion packs have always been out gassed generally before that they were packaged now if they weren't out gas before they're packaged some Roasters actually print the packs so that the air can escape but if you didn't outcast coffee what would happen is even especially in a large shipment you can have your shipment inflate and burst so that's something that it's good to know that the outgassing has to take place and whether you're roasting at home or you're roasting on a commercial scale that's something you have to take in consideration another thing about roasted whole bean coffee and ground coffee is that once it has outgassed it starts to absorb smells and the darker the roast the more pores the beans and the faster they outguess and so consequently the faster they would would be you know subjected to picking up smells that being said you can use and we have used old coffee that was past its prime for us in the refrigerator and place a baking soda to remove undesirable food smells it works really well in fact the bus drivers in Columbia keep it on the buses in the event that a passenger gets sick because of the fact that it it absorbed smells and it also absorbs liquid because it's very absorbent and porous now I didn't mean to gross you out but the point I was trying to make is that coffee is very environmentally susceptance going on around it so if you have it exposed to some that smells bad if you have it exposed to moisture if you have it exposed to light if you have it exposed to heat in your car that's going to have an effect on the quality of your roasted coffee okay now we've come to the part that I've made you aware of what the problem is so the solution is is to make sure that you keep roasted coffee beans and ground roasted coffee beans in an airtight dark container protected from heat so let's talk about the five ways I promise okay the first way is freezing people always want to know do I freeze my beans do I not freeze my beans and you know generally we tell people don't freeze your beans you only keep a few days you don't a few days of beans ahead of time and if you do that you know there's no need to freeze your beans but if you're determined that you need to freeze your beans there's a couple of things you need to know pros and cons okay so the first thing is if you're gonna freeze your beans you can freeze them in a mason jar with a lid that seals okay because if you're gonna have them in there remember you get smells in your freezer not just in your refrigerator so you want to have them in something that is actually airtight so it doesn't get smells from the freezers that that's the first thing the second thing is is that if it's not airtight and you have a frost list freezer guess what it's going to dry out your beans well you don't want that to happen and the other thing that will happen is if your beans are frozen and you bring them out to the the temperature of your room and you unscrew the lid on the mason jar the first thing that's going to happen is that beans are going to start to absorb the moisture from the air and that is going to affect the the freshness and the flavor of the beans so if you decide that you are going to freeze your beans at least bring them out the night before and just bring out the amount that you're going to use and allow them to rise to ambient temperature in a sealed jar or sealed bag and then once they're at ambient temperature the next morning I'm assuming it'll be the next morning but once they're damn piant temperature then you're fine too you know grind or if they're already ground to actually bring your coffee the problem with freezing beans is the and bringing them out into the air is the same as a beer stein you know when a beer stein is frozen and you bring it out in the warm air and then you notice that immediately ice is over same concept same premise that attracts moisture and the moisture causes the coffee beans to go stale faster okay we're still talking about freezing beans but we're going to talk about another thing that you can use other than a mason jar and mason jar and for those of you in case you don't know what it is mace this is a mason jar has a two-part lead comes apart there's an inner seal right here and that seals seal the air out and what it does when you tighten it down then then it basically seals in the aroma and it seals in in and out moisture air that kind of thing so once you've sealed it you're fine but when you bring it out and you've got the coffee is really cold from being frozen when you open it that's when I'm cursed so with the mason jar when you bring it out let it rise to room temperature before you open the jar okay so the next thing that we can use in a freezer is a ziplock bag that's another way that you can trace beans you can freeze them in ziplock bags and one thing that you could also do is you could actually use sandwich sized bags or the smaller bags use the freezer kind if you want something that's more sturdy and you can freeze actual portions like whatever you're going to use for the day and you just bring out that portion and so that portion is the only portion that is exposed to the air when you open it and and basically you expose it to the air but you're going to use it right away so you're good to go the reason that we're trying to figure out a way to store coffee is to protect it from the environmental enemies so whether you use a mason jar or a ziploc bag for phrasing just remember to bring it out the night before you're going to brew it and allow it to rise to room temperature and then go ahead and grind it if it's whole beans or just open it use it and brew it the next morning one additional suggestion for zip locks if you use the freezer bags they are much heavier so you don't have to worry as much about getting a puncture or getting some damage because some of the sandwich bags can be somewhat flimsy ok the next method we're going to talk about is storing coffee in the refrigerator we don't think you need to do that either because again we're not looking for long-term storage we're looking for use your coffee as close to the roast cycle as practical after degassing however if you want to store it in the refrigerator our suggestion is actually to use Tupperware and the reason you would want to use Tupperware is because of the fact that Tupperware is stronger it can stand it can withstand the exposure to spills or having stuff stacked on it it is airtight so you don't have to worry about smells or odors getting into your coffee but you still have the disadvantage of the fact that you have something in the refrigerator you're removing it to use it and so as soon as you open it you're exposing everything that's in that container to the air so if that's not the amount that you're using for the day you're exposing it also with the refrigerator if you're opening it a lot you're going to have exposure to light and most upper wear is somewhat transparent so you're going to expose it to light every single time you open the door since of the refrigerator is not that cold it doesn't really extend the shelf life of your beans that much so the purely the only advantage that I can think of of storing your beans in the refrigerator they versus on your counter top is the fact that you can keep it from light so use a dark container dark container use a dirt container and you've solved the problem but you know we're still going to talk about the fact that this is we're not talking about long-term storage we don't think long-term storage is desirable no matter how you store your roasted coffee beans so let's talk about our countertop which is our preferred method and so for this particular method you literally have an unlimited amount of options you have containers like this that are dark a darker lid would be preferable where we start store ours though is in such a dark area of the countertop or in on a shelf in the kitchen it's actually kept from light and there's such a short period of time you don't have to be concerned about there are see-through containers but just make sure you keep it in a cabinet and this one actually has it like a lid that actually seals rather way you can even store it in a mason jar but again you're back to the same thing is that what you want to make sure that you do is that you keep it from light and heat and air of course all these are airtight the other thing I can do is I can talk to you about what you can do that is kind of a here's my neat little prop and this might look a little strange but what I'm going to do is how you can actually show you how you can remove the air from a ziplock bag so that it's that should basically vacuum-packed so you can if you have a fancy sealer hey you're good to go go ahead and and seal seal your beans but if you don't have a fancy sealer all you have to do is do this at the end of a straw and you're in your bag your ziplock bag seal it all the way over to the straw okay and then I'm gonna suck the air out okay I'm gonna stop okay hang on this worked before I that's worked before I was on camera well uh thanks my bag of beans are now vacuum packed so all you need to do is get yourself a straw and a ziploc bag and you can do that if you need to but I do want to give you one little caution if you're doing a two gallon bank you might pass out this is the court and you can do it in any size but you but basically what I would do is I would store you know a day's use at a time which this is much less than a day juice but a days use Sabine's at a time and if you put them in the fridge freezer wherever you put in and then limited amount of containers you can find out there I've shown you a few just so that you know there are a few containers stainless steel and otherwise that have two lids and the inner lid acts as a piston so that you can actually pump the air out of the container so that your container is vacuum packed those are really nice I think those are a great deal you can put them on the counter now what we typically do is we actually have our beans in our grinder and our grinder has a darkened hopper if you will and it's in an area of our kitchen under the counter where it's not really exposed to very much light and so there's usually like one to two days of coffee of coffee beans in there and we don't grind until right before we make the coffee one of the other things that you may be interested in as there are bags that are specifically designed for you to be able to put freshly roasted coffee in them and then seal them and then they have a one-way - gassing valve so what happens is as the coffee to gases and it inflates the bag the valve actually allows that gas to escape but it's one-way so it can escape but nothing can come in so you don't have other smells coming in and you don't really lose the aroma you just have the outgassing so if you would like you can find those bags on our website and in the description of the video there is also a link that will take you directly to that product so the last method we're going to talk about is vacuum packing and you saw earlier my lame attempt at vacuum packing and hopefully got a good laugh out of it and vacuum packing basically there's all kinds of equipment out there that you can buy that you can vacuum pack in bags you can vacuum pack even in jars and then there are containers that you can pump the air out so vacuum packing packing has a couple of advantages it's that it once something is vacuum packed it's more rigid and so it holds its shape better and so it can be stacked or stored more easily but if it's in a bag that you vacuum packed it in it still has the same same opportunity to be punctured or to leak or that kind of thing and then you can have damaged coffee one last thing about coffee if you decide to proove coffee before it's how to have an opportunity to out gas what you're gonna find it's that there's an awful lot of air and foam that are in your brew basket now on a small scale if you're just brewing a small amount of coffee at home it's generally not an issue but in a commercial situation you could have actually your coffee urns overflow from that so you want to allow it to D gas for 24 to 48 hours before you use the coffee the other thing that you want to know you might want to know is that it's coffee as soon as coffee has Outkast you're still going to be able to make espresso and have a lot of crema and crema is actually a sign that your coffee is very fresh once you grind coffee then the outgassing happens at an extremely rapid pace because you're grinding it into smaller particles so you have much more surface area to outcast and so it outgassed very quickly a pointer if barista offers you an espresso and there's very little creme on it that means that coffee is old and that's because it's fully out gasp so just pointer there and so if you look at your coffee when you are using the coffee that you're stirring at home if you're not getting some foam in crema then your coffee your coffee is old as well but basically if it's older than two weeks and it hasn't been stored properly it's old so ultimately what I'm going to tell you is that the best long-term storage method is no storage method at all we don't recommend that you plan to ever provide long-term storage for your coffee what we do and I talked about a little bit earlier is that we roasts our coffee and then we allow it to D gas for 24 to 48 hours before we grind it and brew it or grind it and make espresso or grind it and make drip coffee or French press however you do it we only have a lead time of 24 to 48 hours so what we recommend that you do is that you don't worry about all of these environmental factors and long-term storage because if you're roasting and using and roasting and using within two to three days you're always going to have your coffee at optimum so obviously I'm still going to tell you don't you know roast your coffee and then go put it in a hot car but what I am going to tell you is that just provide a nice container that's a dark and it's not in a hot place and it's not in a light place and not exposed to moisture of course so it's airtight and so keep that container let it allow it to D gas for 24 to 48 hours and then you're going to have maximum flavor development in your coffee and you're going to be ready to brew and try this and then compare it to coffee that's been stored and see if you don't agree that that's absolutely the best thing to do so if we gave you some helpful information today don't forget to Like and subscribe and also I just

yes i should check the traveling merchant maybe she has something good to buy nothing good today wait 2 500 gold for a coffee seat i'll take it it's a bit pricey but i'll take it i wonder how much profit i can make of this single coffee bean i guess the first step is to plant my single coffee bean let's see where this takes us a few days later i got my first harvest now i can plant four more coffee seeds just two days later my initial coffee being planned has another four coffee beans this is going better than expected maybe soon i'll be able to start selling these beans or maybe even make some coffee initially your coffee empire may grow slowly but once your new coffee crops catch up it will grow into so many crops so fast several days later my first batch of new crops were ready and this is really where my coffee farm started taking off i got almost 40 coffee beans now i could have sold these but instead i'm going to plant all of them for an even increased yield this is actually a good idea because we are still in spring and coffee crops grow both in spring and summer i think this coffee plan was my best yet guys don't be silly like me use speed grow on crops that have multiple harvests it can greatly increase your yield and thus increase the amount of coffee plants you can re-plant planting all of these coffee beans sure was tiring i think it's time to go to sleep no way a rare event the craft fairy is at my farm and doing her magic on my coffee beans now this is just perfect imagine how much coffee i'm going to have i hope this event happens for you guys when you plant coffee too look at all that coffee that very sure did help you know since the fairy boosted my coffee production so much i must plant them but i won't force you to watch me do that perfect all the coffee is planted now i can finally start selling the stuff i have not sold a single coffee bean yet let's see if this can actually make my 2500 gold back that i spent on buying the seed have you seen how much coffee beans i am collecting i hope this stuff sells well now i know you can turn this into actual coffee and make even more money but i think just telling all of this is much quicker and you know convenience is king i'm already at 300 and there's so much left to go and these regrow every two days so every two days you can collect just a ton of coffee is this the start of my coffee empire i can't believe we collected 580 coffee beans okay no more stalling let's see how much money we can make from a single coffee bean 9058 gold well we made our money back and we can continue harvesting this every two days for the rest of the season you guys grow coffee it's a money maker if you made it this far comment 580 coffee beans down below thanks for watching this coffee video i hope you enjoyed it well i need to go harvest some coffee so until next time", "-D8jo7fyqCI": "hi my name is joey papa i'm a coffee consultant and today we're going to learn how to grind coffee beans without a grinder now you may not be someone who usually gets whole bean coffee and maybe one day someone walks up to you and gives you a gift of whole bean coffee and you're not sure exactly how to grind it up to brew it well the best option obviously is to purchase a grinder to get a very precise grind on your coffee but if you don't have the money or the time or you just really want that cup of coffee and you're stuck with whole beans there are a few conventional ways to grind up your coffee beans the first way is with a rolling pin and the second way is with a blender now if you do choose to use your blender make sure you read the user manual to ensure that you're not going to burn out your motor or you're going to use it incorrectly so if you're going to use a rolling pin which is kind of a archaic way of grinding anything or breaking anything up just take some of your coffee beans you're going to put them on your countertop or a cutting board and it is it gets it could get a little messy because the coffee beans are going to try to get away from you as you apply pressure just put your rolling pin in the center of the coffee beans and you're going to crush them and in essence that's what a [Applause] grinder does when you're grinding up whole bean coffee beans you're going to have to work at it for a while and it does get pretty messy so you may want to opt for the other option which is the blender the other thing is is that you want to decide what type of coffee you're going to be brewing if you're making espresso or if you're making drip coffee or if you're making one in a french press will determine how fine or how coarse your coffee beans need to be once you've crushed them or ground them up if you're making a french press then you want them to be pretty coarse which this method could be pretty effective for that if you're looking for an espresso or even your drip coffee you may won't get it very fine secondly if you're going to use your blender again make sure you read your user manual to make sure you're not going to burn out your motor you're going to take your coffee beans you're going to place them in your grinder and then you're going to want to use the highest setting on your grinder to make sure that they blend up very fine and well so then go ahead and turn it on the highest setting you have okay so you're going to want to check your your coffee beans in there quite a few times to make sure you're getting the grind that you want again if you want it very fine you're going to have to blend it for a long period of time if you just want it to be coarse to make a french press or a medium grind then you know you're going to have to just keep your eye on that because you're kind of hit and miss with the type of blender you're using the blades that are on it and all those factors that go into that after you have your coffee all ground up you're going to prepare it as usual and again my name is joey papa i'm a coffee

out I'm Daphne Munroe your smart shopper", "jY9xoWhVSrE": "[Music] hello friends this is dmcm and this is my quick review of aldi's al cafe colombian coffee beans and this is a new one that i've spotted in aldi recently one of their sort of cheap coffees and they also do a green um one in a green bag which i'm not 100 sure which or what type that is maybe it's an italian roast i seen someone in the checkout with it in their basket but i didn't see it on the shelves myself so i'm intrigued to go back and have another look for that one so let's take a look at the pack it says coffee moments our cafe time number three colombian rich and refined it's a rainforest alliance certified coffee on the back it says well it's got directions for use cafeteria filter machine best before storage instructions it's a 227 grand bag contact info there for ali it's got a little resealable and tab on there as well the best before date is august 2021 so just under the year on the best before date on this one and that is it you can sort of tell their cheap air and coffees because they have very little in the way of a description and it always seems to be rich and refined that they say on the bag so that's the bag let's take a quick look at the beans quite dark and small sort of size to the beans but pretty uniform and the aroma of the beans is rich and earthy there's a sweet toffee hint there too it's slightly smoky and fruity it's okay but nothing amazing but not too bad decent looking beans anyway take a quick look at the ground coffee as well very dark again maybe a slight orange or reddish look to this one and after grinding it becomes really vibrant with a biscuity feel there it's a really meaty aroma but there's no bite to this one and although it's vibrant it's relatively smooth at the same time the more i kept smelling this one the more i kept picking up a nutty hint there too it's got a very pr very pleasant aroma actually this one so taste wise it's not too bad and it's bright and fruity with toffee hints and a slightly nutty side it's slightly smoky and it was more prominent when i made it in the erdo press and it was a lot more bitter too and when made in the aeropress when i made it in the espresso machine it was really bright and fruity and as i say in the aerial press it was a lot stronger but the subtleties seem to disappear but it's not a bad coffee for the price and one of the better coffees that i'll be sell so i'll give this one a score of three out of five nothing outstanding or memorable but a decent enough cheap um supermarket coffee and if you shop at aldi it may be worth picking up a bag to give it a try so i'd really like to hear from anyone who's tried this coffee or any of the other coffees that i'll be selling let me know your

watching bye for now [Music] so [Music] you", "n3Qq2b2tiJs": "[Music] so [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "ztsyrd6emOA": "Samantha: I think the one cup of coffee that I can never forget would be the first cup of coffee that I had here in Tiong Hoe Specialty (Coffee). And I remember it was a Kenyan bean. Kenyan (beans) are known to have a citrusy acidity (and) blackcurrant kind of flavour. At that point in time I didn't know how to drink pour overs. I didn't know how to appreciate it. I only liked milk coffees but when I had that it was so sweet it's so much like a (cup of) Ribena that I was quite blown away. So I will always remember that as the first good pour over I had. [in Mandarin] Tiong Hoe: Making a good cup of coffee requires strong knowledge of  selecting and sorting raw coffee beans. Raw coffee beans are the beans that have not been roasted. The next factor is one\u2019s roasting skills. If it\u2019s well-roasted, you still need a real barista to brew it. Only then it is considered a good cup of coffee. My nickname is Coffee Man. I am still actively learning at my age. If I don\u2019t continually improve (my shop and I) will be obsolete. There are three common types of coffee species: Arabica, Robusta and Liberica. Arabica beans tend to be clean and have no imperfections while the flavour of Robusta beans are more intense but less pure. Specialty beans require work by us. You can\u2019t just use the \"Tiong Hoe Specialty Coffee\" branding and trademark to say that it's specialty coffee. It's about ensuring that we sort the best quality of the beans from buying to roasting to brewing. There are different grades of Arabica beans ranging from Grade 1, 2, 3 to 5. Grade 1 beans are very clean with no broken or damaged beans. When we receive the beans I inspect it by grabbing a handful. If it feels sandy it means the bag (of beans) is spoilt. Then I will reject that batch of beans. Next we look out for defects like broken beans and shells. This is a defective bean that has popped out from its shell. It is not desirable. Typically one coffee cherry has two coffee beans. Peaberry coffee is where there\u2019s only one bean within instead of two. It will be more fragrant. Hence we prefer them when we\u2019re selecting coffee beans. I have been in the coffee trade since I was 17 and I\u2019m 76 years old now. Many people want to join the coffee industry. When they come to me as students the first thing I\u2019d ask is: \u201cHow determined are you?\u201d If you are not willing to persevere I will not teach you. But if you do choose (to continue) in this industry I believe no matter which role you play you will be very satisfied with your job. That\u2019s the way it is \u2013 you will be very persistent (in your craft). [To barista] After a few months of practicing you can create your own style. If it doesn't work out go back to what you were doing before and figure out what is not working. I am not afraid of sharing my knowledge. If you ask me a question, I\u2019ll tell you all I know about it. I want to share my coffee knowledge with all my students and friends. I was once very arrogant which caused some failures. If you\u2019re arrogant people won\u2019t want to discuss ideas with you. Even if they were keen, having airs will throw them off and they won\u2019t want to continue talking to you. So I\u2019d always tell my students to keep this in mind. [in English] Jacob: I was asked to join the company right after my National Service. Back then I was young and didn\u2019t know what I wanted as part of my career. So I thought, why not just come in and try out? It started from my grandmother who was working for a Dutch firm when Singapore was already a trading port sending out very good quality coffee but all these beans are actually sorted in Singapore. She actually got my dad into the company as an apprentice for roasting. Barely two years and my dad thought that he was ready to come out and run his own business. To date, I'm actually the third generation doing this coffee (business). At the start of the day usually the roastery assistant will prepare the coffee (beans). Whenever I\u2019m at the roastery coffee beans will be loaded up to the roasting machine and the machine will be preheated at the same time where we lock in all the (roasting) profiles. And then, the roasting process starts. The coffee (beans) itself is a rather complex food ingredient. Once heat is actually applied onto the coffee (beans) it goes through a lot of chemical reactions. When the beans are first loaded in (the roasting machine) we call it the endothermic stage which means the coffee beans are actually taking in energy. Then heat and pressure start to build up within the beans and it goes through an exothermic stage where the beans actually give out heat energy in particular. The coffee (beans) at the same time goes through a very complex Maillard reaction as well as caramelisation. You can see the colour get darkened along the way and we roast it according to the customer's preference. To be fair, back then they didn\u2019t have a lot of high-tech equipment or measuring equipment. So a lot of roasting techniques were actually based on sight and also based on smell and hearing. Because coffee (beans) are like popcorn they crack at a certain temperature so my dad gave me a lot of free reign to actually experiment different roasting methods at his expense. I think you need to burn enough beans. No, I\u2019m just joking. I would say experimenting is too expensive given the cost that is presented in today\u2019s context. Specialty beans are not cheap. What kind of teacher (is my dad?) I don't think I can call him strict but I would say he is a generous teacher. He doesn\u2019t hold back in (his) sharing. Over the years I think he has contributed a lot to the industry. He constantly has people in the industry coming to him asking for advice wanting to learn roasting from him. He is rather generous in (the sharing of) knowledge and doesn\u2019t hold back. Just because I\u2019m the son he teaches me a little bit more but he (shares with) everyone. [in Mandarin, to Samantha] Tiong Hoe:\nWhen the smell of the coffee appears the acidity is gone. [in English] Samantha: In general, Uncle Tan shares a lot here. So whenever he is around and we chat with him he will actually share a lot about V60 brewing. And one of the things that I remember the most will be this very interesting metaphor that he gives. The first part, the pre-infusion, as we call it which is you actually just wet the coffee grounds. He likens it to being in a sauna. So he says you have to do it very, very well. You have to actually drip the water and wet it but allow as little of the water to drip through as possible. So, it\u2019s like, in his words [in Hokkien] \u201cheap tiao\u201d (trapped). You actually try to keep the pressure of the water inside so it's like a sauna. When you go into a sauna your pores open up and everything so it actually makes the coffee more extractable. That was one of the first things that I actually remembered. (What makes) a good cup of coffee? I would say it's the balance. I think in specialty coffee sweetness in the cup is a given thing. So for me, a good cup will be one that is sweet but at the same time, it's not too flat. There must be a bit of acidity and a slight finish to it to balance and round off the whole cup. Pour over is actually a very general term. It\u2019s an umbrella term that also includes all the hand brew methods that require you to pour over the coffee grounds. The specific method that we do here is the V60. We actually chose the V60 because it is one of Uncle Tan\u2019s specialisations and also something that we feel can bring out the coffee\u2019s taste the most. With a paper filter you filter out a lot of the oils from the coffee (grounds). So you actually get to taste a very clean and at the same time, a very complex cup because of how it's shaped like a V. When I make coffee for my customers what I hope for them to take away or experience would be (the feeling) when you drink a cup of coffee or it doesn\u2019t even have to be coffee \u2013 (like) a drink that you like a lot \u2013 and it just makes you feel happier when you drink it or it makes you feel more comforted or it helps you feel better about the day or to start the day. That's what I hope for them to actually experience when they drink the coffee that I make. I think coffee is something that most people drink. Regardless of whether you are a lawyer from somewhere or maybe you are a student studying we all drink coffee. And that becomes a common language that we can start a conversation about. What is one lesson that Uncle Tan taught me? I\u2019d say on top of not being arrogant and always staying humble it's also about passion and the motivation to keep learning. I think till today, he is very passionate about coffee. I think it's very easy for us after a few years of (making) coffee to get a bit jaded because honestly, it\u2019s not the easiest job. There are many factors that (are involved). But he remains very passionate about the craft and the whole subject of coffee. Because of that, I'm kind of reminded to not give up so easily (and) stay true to what you like. My name is Samantha I'm a barista and I have been brewing coffee for six years now. My name is Jacob I'm a caffeine dealer and I'm also a roaster for the company. [in Mandarin] I am Tan Tiong Hoe and I am a student of coffee.", "iObc293g8wo": "a young woman visits her mother and her eyes brimming with tears tells her how difficult her life currently is as soon as she overcomes one obstacle another arises she feels hopeless tired and she feels like she can't continue to struggle like she has been without saying a word her mother took her by the hand and set her down at the kitchen table she then put three pots of water on the stove in the first she put carrots in the second eggs and in the third coffee beans she let them boil in the water still without saying a word after about 20 minutes she turned off the burners she fished out the carrots and the eggs and put them into a bowl and ladled out some of the coffee then she turned to her confused daughter and asked her what she saw carrots eggs and coffee her daughter replied her mother brought her closer to the bowls and asked her to feel the carrots they were soft and mushy then she asked her daughter to take an egg and break it the egg was hard-boiled inside finally her mother asked her to take a sip of the coffee the daughter smiled as she brought the mug to her lips savoring the aroma and the rich taste of the coffee what does it mean mother she finally asked her mother explained that the carrots eggs and coffee had each reacted differently when they faced the same adversity the boiling water the carrot went in strong firm and unrelenting but wilted when subjected to the boiling water becoming soft and weak the eggs started out fragile a thin shell protecting its liquid interior but became hardened by the heat the coffee beans were unique they were not drastically changed but they transformed the boiling water instead which are you the mother asked her daughter when you're facing adversity are you a carrot an egg or a coffee bean take a moment to ask yourself this question are you the carrot that seems strong but with pain and adversity wilts and become soft and loses strength are you the egg that starts with a malleable heart but with trial and adversity becomes hardened and stiff does your shell look the same but inside do you carry a stiff spirit and a hardened heart or are you like the coffee bean changing the very circumstance that brings the challenge when things are at their worst do you become even better and change the situation around you don't let adversity change you for the worst change the challenging situation for the better", "S9XnihHwZ3M": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] what's up everybody welcome back to another coffee experiment I hope everybody's doing well hope everybody is staying safe check out my sweet new quarantine haircut I think it looks pretty good today we have another coffee experiment what we're going to do is brew green coffee I have here javis state Papa New Guinea Kenya and some Brazil so I'm gonna do this a little bit of my own experiment I've never brewed green coffee before so first off that's gonna go I don't know how it's gonna taste I don't know it's gonna brew but I'm gonna try that in itself and then I'm gonna do these four different kinds of coffee all green coffee and we'll see if there's any difference between any of them whether or not they taste better now I did a quick little google and I found a few different ways that you can brew green coffee and I'm gonna test those three different ways well I guess there's kind of only two methods because one was grinding the coffee and I don't want to do that because green coffee beans are like rocks if you've never held them I don't want to put that to any kind of grinder especially not the one I have here it's not that expensive it's not that nice it's not like the grinder the commercial grinder I found back at the store I'll show you green coffee hopefully you can see it for anybody who hasn't seen green coffee it's literally just like coffee beans there's a smaller denser green Brown so they have not been roasted completely raw I'm gonna just go through the steps that I found online of how to brew green coffee and then we'll have green coffee extract or green coffee concentrate whatever you want to call it's basically gonna be like a tea with coffee which is what coffees like already but this time and I'm grinding anything we're literally just steeping the beans some boiling water you let it sit for a little bit and then you have green coffee bean extract the other thing I'm gonna do is mix a couple of these beans so we'll have each of them individually and then we'll have batch of some beans that are mixed and see if again that has any difference whatsoever or if they all taste the same and actually before I get started I'll do the majority of the talking here and then in the video will be a little bit more of just you watching the process go along so it'll be faster there's like I said two ways one in in both of the ways you boil the coffee but in one of them you let it sit in water overnight so it claims the ratio is the same so the same amount of coffee to water I've seen a one two three coffee to water and one of the recipes that's sitting overnight is a twenty grams of coffee to three hundred milliliters of water so that's only ten ounces of water says there's 30 milliliters in one ounce of water so 20 grams sorry 300 milliliters so I'm gonna walk through the experiment part like I said it's gonna be me trying these four different kinds of coffee to see if there's any difference between the four of them whether or not that's the overnight method or just the regular let it boil in water for 12 to 15 minutes is roughly what I saw and see if there's any difference there so I'll also have some mixes of coffee like I said but that's the experiment part the rest of it's pretty straightforward actually doing it's pretty straightforward so I'm not gonna be talking too much while I show you myself actually boiling the coffee and making the green coffee extract tea whatever you want to call it so it'll just be quicker I just want to do the majority of the talking now and then I'll taste it and tell you whether or not I taste a difference obviously I have to wait until tomorrow to do the coffee or the method that's overnight but what's gonna start it and it'll check back in once the coffee is done brewing [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so we just got done and the couple things I wanted to point out the directions or recipes I guess that I'm gonna provide for you that I followed they do it by volume not by weight I did everything by weight which you'll see I used to scale one cup of let's say Brazil is different than one cup of Papua New Guinea they're gonna be different because they're different densities they're different sizes so I do it by weight it's a one two three which means I weighed out my coffee and I weighed out my water just for consistency especially when trying to experiment and see the differences between these that was a process only because every time I tried to set something up to do it I was trying to film it at the same time we have our four coffees we successfully made green coffee extract I keep wanting to say green tea extract green coffee bean extract and I use four different types of coffee so we have Brazil we have Papua New Guinea the writing totally smudged but that's okay then we have a Kenyan double a fancy and Java state so I use CCM coffee out of Tampa shout out to them they're awesome it's a cesium coffee calm I could put a little link down in the description below if anybody wants to check them out but those are the coffees that I used they're all done the only thing I will say these two were done way before these two were done so they've been sitting for a while and as you know when you brew coffee if you brew the coffee and let it sit the flavors will change I don't know if that holds true when you're talking about green coffee bean extract I would assume it does but I've also never tasted this and yes I think we honest I haven't had a sip I have no idea what this tastes like I've never had this before my life and I made it so this is a first for me we're gonna go through taste them I have Jen here who's gonna taste them with me so I guess we'll both start I guess you just start here I'll start here and we'll just work our way all right finally I think about our our flavor profile okay we'll see what are we starting with Brazil yeah we're starting with Brazil okay so hopefully you can see that Brazil I'll tell you right now the color is different which honestly I wasn't sure the beans are different yeah but I mean it's just straight-up green coffee and all the colors are different so that's cool I know they're gonna taste different to know when you cook some kind of let's taste them Brazil okay no not there water if you smell green coffee means it tastes like you or just didn't drink them which I guess makes sense it's potent its creamy almost you're good lima beans that's the beat [Laughter] it's like I'm very very lima beans II okay this is Papa New Guinea Papa that one looks worse I don't know pretty much the same I almost feel like a giant save the verse but you know what this I feel like would be good if you were to mix it with with something like it needs it needs a flavor because the flavor in itself is very earthy and very I would say it's a little better than that because it has some sort of taste to it it's just not necessarily like the most pleasant or friendly flavor I don't know it's palatable I would mix I would make a drink with it and there's recipes that I've seen that are like you use this with different like sodas and refreshers from Starbucks and they say they use this in them for the caffeine and I was hoping it tastes kind of good or similar to like the base of a refresher but it sure doesn't so I don't know what they do but we're gonna try to make a refreshment later see this is Kenya Kenya double a fancy double a is just a grading scale kind of means best of the best in the works pretty bad it was just more bitter than anything not going but I think yeah Alan Pope I also want to point out this one surprise surprise I steeped a little bit so this is steeped for 15 minutes all of these were steeped for 12 again throughout the video I'll kind of like pause them and just put what I'm doing or how long and boiling then the temperature how much I'm weighing out what you know every step that I'm doing will be explained in the video but so you already know this but these were boiled for 12 minutes not boiled brought to a boil and then steeped for 12 minutes this one was steep for 15 which is a little bit longer so now I'm starting to think that that would have been wasn't honestly this was the most mild I I think that was the most like it still tastes very similar but it was not it wasn't like yeah yeah so I would say that this is definitely something to mix with other beverages or make a drink with there's a lot of health benefits out there there is actually a lot of research on coffee basically on a molecular level there's different mechanisms of different compounds of coffee like chlorogenic acid like caffeine all other sort of like phytonutrients there is definitely that aspect if this is what you're going for if you want to make your own green coffee bean extract for that reason I mean do it it's not like it's something that's absolutely unpalatable it's just definitely we need to go into something still try it and it wasn't hard to make it all like I said it only took me a while because I was trying to film everything at the same time and make sure that it made sense what I was doing like chronologically but if I were to just go into the kitchen and like make some of this it would really that the longest part would be letting it steep for 12 minutes and that's not that long at all go ahead and try it right out the the pot not that great get some green coffee I don't have my roaster here which is what sparked my my interest to do this I don't my resource coffee I roasted Minister crazy that didn't work that well so I decided I would try this now you know now I know I'll probably see if we could mix and drink with this and if we can then I'll keep making it but I'm gonna do the overall overnight one a different time and you know review on that I have a feeling it's pretty much gonna taste the same so I think we got our final product this is what it is go ahead and go try it yourself cesium coffee calm there's tons of other places you get green coffee from this is just the one I use so that being said hope you enjoyed it hope you learn something I'll see you the next video [Music]", "Dwi6WIpBkV8": "hi I'm Nelson and this is my uncle norm and we're going to explain our do-it-yourself home coffee roasting setup that we built this weekend this coffee bean roaster drum you see it opens on one end and it has some baffles inside to bounce the beans around when the basket is rotating now one of the most important things we had to do for this project we're going to put this coffee bean roasting drum onto a spit rod of a barbecue rotisserie and we're going to turn it using a variable speed drill which we'll show you in a moment and therefore we had to modify the basket to make it usable with the barbecue spit rod now we did that on the ends you can see these hexagonal holes here and these were made by using a simple bicycle wrench which you can get online or you can probably get this at any bike store and this little piece here is about the right size for a spit rod our spit rod to fit through so we cut this out with a hacksaw we filed it down a little bit and then we've attached that piece to the end here I've also done the same on the other end so you need to buy two of these things because there's only one that's gonna fit your spit rod now in order to attach this piece we had to cut off the post that was here and this post is used for mounting it in the actual coffee bean roaster which would cost you hundreds of dollars so we just cut that off using a dremel required two cuts one here and one here on each end and then that piece holding the post pops right out it leaves two pieces of flat metal pulling along these rods here and that's perfect for mounting this bicycle ranch piece to the end of the bean roaster now norm is going to explain to you how we've gone about attaching this piece from the bicycle wrench to being roaster on each of the ends we've attached the portion of the spanner that's been modified to the bean roaster using two approaches one being a cement first the use in stoves that provides an adhesive a high-temperature adhesive the other being drilling through the spanner piece putting on the backside a portion cut from the remnants of the spanner piece bolting that through with a short pole lock washer and nut on the interior this is fairly easy to do on the end that opens as you can imagine we've done the same thing on the other side with a little more difficulty making the connections from inside but easily achievable now this is the this is the product that we used for attaching the bicycle rental the coffee roasting basket is called Imperial stove and gasket cement it's a black colored paste that comes out of the tube and this stuff applies sort of like a toothpaste consistency it hardens in about an hour but you want to leave it much longer than that before you apply any real force to it and ideally what you want to do is warm it up slowly in an oven or in your barbecue or a couple of hours at least to let it harden we let it harden for over 24 hours just to make sure that nothing came loose before we used it and one other thing I want to mention about attaching this to the roaster is to make sure obviously that each of these two holes is centered on the ends so that the basket will spin properly okay so to mount the basket on the spit rod we simply take the basket and of course this would be filled with beans this is the end it opens here we put the end that doesn't open onto the spit rod first slide it through there how'd the other side okay now we've removed you can see we've removed a couple of greats from the grills so you want to Center it here and we're gonna put these Stoppers on I bought these stuffers online again I'll put the information about where I got those in the comment section your register you'll come with a couple but we used a couple extra ones but another one on the very end so that the rotisserie is supported on both ends of the grill so at this point there would be coffee beans in there tighten this down ideally we'd probably have another stopper on the other side we don't have enough to do that right now I might get another one I've been using these grill heat aid gloves because the spit rod is kind of hot from when we were actually roasting the beans okay now how do we gonna rotate this thing well we've attached it to a drill and this drill bought at a thrift shop for $7.99 and we're simply going to take a grill grill a socket and norm is going to explain before we start showing this spinning he's gonna explain why we did this why we used the intervening socket because of course we could have simply attached the whole thing directly to the drill but there's a reason why we didn't do it that way no one's gonna explain the situation there he's the engineer he came up with this brilliant idea and the norm do you wanna explain what's going on here yes backing up a little bit this socket is a 3/8 inch drive socket inside the socket is a bolt that's inserted with the head of the bolt into the socket and the threaded portion of the bolt attached by the Chuck of the drill so and say that there's a bolt in the Chuck of the drill it goes over the bolt 3/8 drive doesn't doesn't fit exactly but is is close enough this drill is an amazing piece of machinery so it turns out that this drill has all the perfect features we need it is a variable speed with a lock and not only just have it a lot but it has a set screw and by adjusting the set screw we can adjust the speed of the drill and see that we've got it held down here on a couple of blocks of wood to keep it at the right height and we've got this thing strapped down with a couple bungee cords to keep it nice and firm now the reason for mounting it this way is when we tried attaching you directly to the spit rod we had problems with vary the speed constantly changing depending on the exact position of the drill relative to the spit rod so this sort of axe is a little bit of a universal joint that allows a more smooth rotation further feature of this amazing grill is that it reverses the roasting drum has to rotate in a certain direction you could turn the roasting drum around but we wanted the outer end to be the the end that the beans go in it makes it more convenient for using it okay let's plug this in and give a little demo of how this works okay you can see that the drum is rotating now our target rotation speed here is 60 rpms which is probably a little bit slow right now and so to the justice be this beautiful drill just have a little bit of a adjustment here turn this thing and it will speed up a little bit we got to do this very carefully to get it about right and you just turn this thing get it to the right speed that you're happy with there it goes a little faster that's about the right speed now or roasting bean you so now if you're not fortunate enough to obtain a variable-speed drill with a variable speed lock on the trigger you can achieve the lock position by using a trigger clamp to set it at the speed that you want for your roasting coffee beans are going into the roaster hey and staying in the roasted okay so you can see I've attached this skewer on backwards to the spit just to keep the fancy from sliding any further we'll keep it in the optimal position another coupler here appliers okay so the basket is positioned in the right place got one more going in here tighten it down make sure everything's good to tire slide the other way okay everything's attached fire up the grill here clothes are up now hugging this and generation okay now it's time to take everything off get the beans out let me simply remove it here under a loss he's the grip really feel he gave gloves so you don't burn yourself there you have it he's a very gently roasted little dark v you want to go to a full French oh there's piggy roast okay folks that's all for today happy roasting you", "iaC_TkbzyB4": "hi everyone thank you for watching and today I'm super excited about filming this video because oh my god it really took me much time to find a fresh coffee cherry you see it this is a fresh coffee cherry and today I want to show you how to grow cotton and when I manage to find it I was super happy by the way please let me know in the comments below who else like coffee as I do there are so many types of coffee black drip okay do it with cream cappuccino Turkish and just plain espresso some of us for instance to rely on a cup of coffee just to stagger out of bed in the morning edit row' so the idea of growing coffee bean plant has exciting possibilities so the main question is how to germinate cotton seeds and today I will tell you and show you everything I deal in to grow coffee bean plants you should start with a freshly pressed coffee cherry but most of us don't live in a cottage producing country unfortunately but if you do have a fresh coffee cherry as I do do following steps to the other with me pick ripe coffee cherries pulp them yay is this team in Abra coffee cherry there are two feet so the next step you have to wash the physical down it is caliper is sticking please not wash them and after washing is very important thing this it is still climbing so you have to let the feet dry for a few days but it is very dangerous because such a seed has all chances not to sprout coffee beans root their germination very very quickly so what I will command you to do take some paper towel put you sit on it and try to wipe this pulp of the seed do it very gently and very thoroughly when assume that sees our green ad and is not sticking do the next you see there cling I'm not sticking anymore do the next thing take a pot here is my pot fill it for the potting mix as you can see I've already done this take your seeds if you see step two sides the flat one and the converse one so you need to put the seed in the ground with a flat part down this way the roots will go deep the ground and the spring will rise above the crowd so let's do it together with it part put your feet in the ground why I put them here just because I forgot to mention that I've got two coffee cherries just one foot I've already planted in the ground sorry guys so the next mm since I put here because my crew don't want the first one our sound work here so deepen your seeds a little like this just use your finger and dippin it in the ground okay then spray it with water a little and after it I add a little bit of soil to cover the seeds so to say just a little I like to press the soil slightly the next very important step is to make a greenhouse for all the seeds so what I do in this case and just take a plastic wrap oh dear and cover my pot yeah like that and this is it", "LmsGP-XmXbo": "I just don't understand decaf is in the name it's coffee it's caffeine it's supposed to be there what is the difference between decaf coffee for me it tastes less of coffee is that because the the caffeine they've taken out that some of the flavors come out I must be psychological then it could very well be how do they take the caffeine out that's the question that I don't know but we can certainly find out for you to get the lowdown on coffee there's only one place to go there are a number of ways to decaffeinate coffee but manufacturers don't put the details on the label the beans sit in a solvent for up to 14 hours to extract the caffeine [Music] Bell from the green beans get to the back of the throat it's the same as malleolus [Music] these huge tanks of methylene chloride or what a chemist would call dichloromethane weren't part of the guided tour but after a bit of persuasion send your Murai agrees to let me have a look at the stuff that I used to use rice to make little aeroplane models that sort of that smell back in the UK I decide to find out more about that pungent solvent that took me back to my model-making days this place supplies chemicals to all types of industries and sells lots of dichloromethane can I have a look at solving I've got a bottle here in the fume cupboard can I taste a little bit no just a little bit could be very bad for your health you did that really yes basically that sign means it causes some damage to the human body basically well it's a known carcinogenic you cause cancer know what's on the label just there you're telling me this stuff causes cancer it's been proven to cause cancer but yet we can use it to take the caffeine out of our coffee we can yeah these green coffee beans have been soaked in dichloromethane solvent for 10 hours during that time the solvent extracts the caffeine out of the beans the remaining solution is heated until the solvent evaporates and voila just the caffeine is left behind in the factory after the dichloromethane has been drained off the beans are put into another solution that removes almost all of the remaining solvent the beans now meet the FDA regulation and can be sent off for roasting so is that safe to taste there be no dichloromethane there and it's only been pure coffee beans so I would say yeah you saved us a taste of small quantity you wanna go first cool what's that like that's all right wasn't it it's just quite bitter quite bitter you took a load in your mouth yeah but you know what there's definitely that coffee punch that robust yeah bitterness that's where some of that flavors goes it's here we've extracted the flavor as well as the caffeine then what we're left with is probably a drink this absolutely except was coffee but now it's a bit more mild that's right yeah definitely it's interesting because I'd sort of now I get the bigger picture after being to the factory I can see why they didn't really want me poking around looking at the Selvam one because they probably worried I was gonna dip a finger and taste it and two as a coffee manufacturer you know that this is something they use in their process it is safe but really when you see suspected of causing cancer they probably don't really want to talk about it it's a shame which they would say me coming here and then at this day in Brazil somebody might have akkanee enough now [Music]", "LvUrg8iL904": "[Music] just so you know if you drink coffee you're also consuming cockroaches pre-ground coffee like you

of June 2014 and we are going to do our first taste test of the can you freeze coffee beans experiment now I meant to do this yesterday when we had our tasting session here in the Roasterie but due to all the curfuffle and all the people here and stuff like that i kind of had to you forgot to do it so I'm here on a Sunday working again on the weekend just to get this thing done okay so just to clarify why did we had the same batch of malawi geisha coffee I put one packet on the shelf I put one packet in the fridge and I put two packets in the freezer okay so this is now a month later we're going to taste them and then and again Wigan in one month we'll taste them again probably a 1 month isn't enough of a time to come up with a definitive answer because if you're going to treat your coffee within a month you probably wouldn't bother to freezer anyway however I'm desperate to know what the effects are so I think after one month we should have some idea of what occurs ok so I've actually set up a cupping here which I've done ok now I don't know which one is which I've got a label underneath the cups so I'll reveal in a second to myself and you guys what was going on so this one we call it we'll call it number one this was probably the worst of the three the aroma was kind of rubbery and plasticky yeah that wasn't too Pleasant the aroma at these two was very similar so I've got a feeling these two yeah these two were quite similar in the tasting as well the best one was this one it was it was it retained the sweetness of the molera geisha that normally has and it was well balanced it was you know you know enjoyable this one wasn't quite as good it was less less sweet had this one had a slightly powdery kind of dry aftertaste this one for tasting was again a little bit slightly unpleasant more of that powdery taste and it also had stuff like a rubbery a rubbery taste in there as well okay so if I was to now arrange these into order of bets the good I'd say this one was the best this one was second and this one was spared so I hope so we do this we do the worst first let's do the worst first okay so I'm just gonna pour this into the waste so underneath here the label has come off on my finger but here is ah Wow shelf shelf was the worst wow I'm really surprised actually we're really surprised okay right so second best okay this one freezer so by let me just you know see did you see that or not I don't let's build well you can take my word for it this one is freezer so that just leaves number one Oh the fridge wow I'm actually quite surprised okay so that was only after one month but that probably gives us a good idea of what the second month is gonna be like alright very interesting that so I'll see you back here again in one month", "3_GDyK8odH4": "hello everyone welcome back to this new farm I started the other day which has pretty much turned into the million gold challenge once again but this time it's gonna be

there it is I just realized I wasn't listening to it like they're supposed to be music cuz I do it separately I know normally the minds have their own kind of sounds going on but I have my music playing outside that way we always get music around the clock have I gotten any further with cleaner heights no well I did a bit from the last time you saw it but I screwed up the video and I just haven't really got back to it yet that games pacing is really slow and it's really hard for me to get content out of it like it's really just it's mostly this me farming again and again and it's not that's super exciting oh I'll make something out of it but I know they did a few patches to kind of make the game a little more Easter and smooth but I need to do some research into that to find where somewhere the interesting stuff is because mostly I paid our ease and I was just kind of wandering around hoping for stuff to happen I couldn't even get married yet despite me trying so hard Wow holy enemies I'm gonna run out of energy if I'm not careful well this is exciting my combats go better level up after this not that I really care about that but I just want to you know justify all that fighting em energies getting low so hopefully I can do this to get to the next few levels that I realized I was that low on energy whoops I'm mostly gonna ignore those I don't think I'm gonna make it to the next elevator to be honest not unless I find something interesting they're gonna kill those just in the hopes that they can give me a ladder those critical hits are actually huge I'm doing like 1 or 2 damage but critical hits go up to 10 it's like a 5 times multiplier oh that actually worked cool I did not expect that to work at all so I got two more floors to get down and I've got 46 energy to do it that means are probably just gonna kill a lot of enemies hoping it works can you guys just kind of nicely there we go nice and bunched up give me ladder give me a letter come on one more oh there's mark man there's a lot of these things today that's weird oh it's always K I also kind of curious yesterday I was playing start Eve Ali and then I closed the game and I noticed that it did some kind of an update like a really small one but it was updating itself I don't know if that was just a weird patch or just a random thing that happens once in a while but something happened whoa get out of the way Cory Wilson car sorry Corrine Wilson thank you thank you thank you my newest favorite is person ever you know get the green text the mums HED icon my hand in marriage my undying love a role in discord if you want it sponsor only giveaways and something else of your choosing why not have anything you want we go went to music coming in okay dummies I really need to kill you know cuz I'm running out of time and energy I really don't want to exhaust myself oh he's behind you I knew that same way play for tonight facing completely the wrong way completely vulnerable and clueless helpless topes on this floor so big I'm gonna run out of energy before I finish this legitimately I think which kind of really sucks unless the bag gives it to me that might do it I really want to hit floor 40 I'm gonna be super annoyed with all this come on I can't be breaking single rocks now cuz they only take one hit and have the potential to give me a ladder oh boy Aaron new sponsor my newest newest favorite is person ever welcome Aaron you now get the green taxi mums HED icon my hand in marriage my undying love a rollin discord if you want it ain't sponsor only giveaways okay well I'm officially out of energy maybe there's a ladder or do here somewhere oh and another sponsor the zombie or welcome welcome my newest newest favorite his favorite is person ever yes that works somehow the zombie you know get the green taxi mom said icon my undying love my hand in marriage sponsor only giveaways and a role in discard if you want it and a strawberry cuz that's still a thing okay here comes at that that's what I was waiting for come on bad I need you you need to give me a ladder otherwise I'm I'm pretty hopelessly boned I really hate redoing levels in the mines especially these ones I hate the dark floors here it comes there's two of them yeah here we go this should do it take him over here where I think you're more likely to spawn come on don't be shy we all have to die eventually come on give me a ladder give me a ladder come on ah man well I'm gonna run around and hope for one more really lucky bat but aside from that I don't think I'm gonna you get too lucky sponsor train yeah you guys aren't kidding sponsors everywhere sponsor City pretty soon the chat is gonna be just all green I wouldn't even have to turn on sponsor only mode cuz there's so many sponsors anyway so very generous of you all thank you so much hey dangerous is he funny will you be my wife no this is backwards you're supposed to be my wife Cherry Bomb oh I could make cherry bombs yes thank you Kyra you're absolutely right I can make one know where we're gonna put this I need a group of rocks it's gonna give me I'm going up to the top I feel like it's gonna be up here yep getting late I know game I know I need the biggest grouping of rocks I'm gonna do it right here actually come on matter oh I did it - all right I would say Thank You Kara cuz that was a really good idea that I didn't think of oh this slingshot you received a sing shout and I'm outta here Thank You Kira Wow near the entrance usually that's what people say and it seems to somewhat be true but I've always just kind of been under the impression that people check near the entrance first when they go down to mines it's usually the first rock they break so they kind of just notice it's always by the ladder it's confirmation bias it's like this saying that most people get into a car accident five kilometres from home well that's cuz you drive five kilometers from home constantly confirmation bias at its finest that's my theory anyway whether or not that's true I have no idea boom and I start getting iron tomorrow okay give me some of that I should about the cookies with me I don't know what I was thinking today I'm actually gonna sell the bat wings I'm gonna hold onto this thing because I don't have a choice what's gonna make another furnace tonight it's already late but I just don't care did I collect rocks I did okay crafting furnace one furnace - that should be lots for now furnace and furnace copper copper copper see perfect it's all coming together real nice like big nose with me so don't ever forget him again I could do a bunch of field snacks maybe am I gonna do more Verdun skies probably haven't actually given I gave a lot of thought lately I probably should it was interesting I did like it I very well could it's raining all right no watering for me how is my luck today very displeased it's a very bad luck day look that's raining to kind of make up for it oh look what's tad more of those potatoes you know we're gonna get a bigger backpack today that's what we're gonna do bigger backpack oh we can't even smelt an iron bar we're gonna get a bigger backpack we're also going to go down to the beach to see if there's any for jables available I could also just eat the potatoes for energy that's not a bad idea I also kind of forgot that I brought my how to help the worms in the ground rocks just what I didn't really want I lied I don't all want those I have homework to do DF well priorities you can multitask no it's Wednesday so piers is closed well we'll go forward to beach anyway because why not where's gonna check these garbage cans who bread perfect Mattias Olson Hagen bad luck desi not supposed to eat a lot of bread thank you for the math lesson big shock I learned much now I need to leave so enjoy stardew and some dinner from my money why thank you very much Mattias Oh H again with another 50 Norwegian crowns and a new sponsor Uncle salty and I believe this is not the first time you sponsored but thank you very much uncle salty my newest favorite is person ever on top of your large donation you know get the green text mom's had icon my hand in marriage my undying love and the other staff sponsor only giveaways and blah blah blah Thank You uncle salty yeah see everyone else is already like video is already a sponsor the gig is up salty we know your secret I'm carrying too many things is my needs a bigger backpack give me that and give me that oh it's silver quality too damn it all right that's just gonna have to work I mean it doesn't really matter if when people if they like response or every month it's the same effect anyway to be fair so that's all that is my birthday's on March 9th neat ooh cake I gotta stop touching things I keep overloading myself now cake is they're really good fine though I'm actually getting rid of the clams for that does anyone need cake by chance potato oh hell you actually needs a potato all right she just wants something to talk to you just so happens I have a potato she's not getting any silver one though oh oh but I got a way for idiot to get out of her room don't I she in there where is Haley yep she's in bed man what time did you come out of bed at anyone know flailing with purpose a modern approach to the art of dance why that would be the book Emily learned from it's a globe their sturdy valley coordinates actually lead you to somewhere in Russia I believe super fashion girl magazine kay Haley I need you to get out there's only so many things to play with in your house you know what yeah I think she like lingers in her room forever I'm not even gonna bother with this sell to Willie um yeah I'm just gonna go ditch everything in my bin right now well the new update break all the mods occur and exist probably because I believe they're like recoding the whole game more or less so it's probably gonna break the mods she stays in bed on rainy days well isn't she a and I got good items her energy I just got to pay more attention to energy today all right we'll go on mining I don't need that I wanted to make a backpack but so be it we can't all be winners you beat both Pam and Linus to that cake that's true Linus would have loved it that would have been a jackpot for him even Pam would have appreciated that what do we need mmm let's get this out of the way right now we'll go collect this some iron I'll have to redo the mom smart yeah my understanding was because the game wasn't originally intended for multiplayer when they wanted to apply multiplayer to what they had to like tear the whole game down but it sounds like it's pretty much their beta should be out pretty soon and concerned date said that he's also been working on his new games so that should be interesting do you have any mods right now not on this file I don't think hey DF what if i donated $2,000 right now will i be $2,000 richer that would be a large donation but crazy things happen sometimes I'm gonna kill these slimes just for fun oh well look at all the ladders it's supposed to be a bad luck day but so far it's not that bad or luck lots of stuff in garbage cans lots of iron in the dust bunnies just sprites whatever they're called little black fuzzy murder balls Oh perfect the world needs us those murder balls anyway look at all the iron Wow we wait multiplayer out soon pretty soon he said spring release and if you're going by the true blue spring the spring starts on e 21st that's kind of what I'm you know guessing guesstimating but that's based on nothing that's pure conjecture but that's what I think so we'll see oh okay if you would just go ahead and die thank you cool I like to stay in the mines it's better I don't like this far though there's nothing to play with just rocks but I can already start making sprinklers too so all my crops laid out now got to be in the process of sprinklers just basic sprinkler so far but before long I'll get better ones I think mostly the bad luck days gonna start on my ladder progress and also just less good drops and gems there's a ladder alright we're going from four for floor 50 ooh let's go get the murder boss let's eat that cake perfect big murder ball jumbo murder ball oh stop and that coming in will go ahead and kill that like I always say it's get to kill monsters in two minds because it takes zero energy to kill just a little bit of time nobody short I just press there to make it do that oh yeah X is also the right click I get it I don't go exploring my keyboard very often to see what else happens I want to see your face I want a billion dollars how's that for an interesting tidbit to brighten your day I don't know what I'd do if I had a billion dollars probably all sorts of crazy things oh there we go going down already damn it they can actually gonna have a surplus of energy depending on our lucky item these next few floors and I'm okay with that no whatever back and hit me a little bit run run run we're gonna lure him in crafty bat I like oh they dodged you like that they think they're so smart dead r.i.p bat you had a good run you should get a better sword yeah probably share hoping to find one you kill those times with a little star on top of them they actually are potential to drop quite good swords I just haven't found one yet what do you do without wings you can make stuff out of them but I sell them because there was somewhat valuable and you get a lot of they're my cash cow for now there's some copper we definitely need how was your day my T's been pretty good aside from my rough start at fortnight today I'm not really sure what was wrong with me today what is wrong with me today but I'm just not doing it today no YouTube notification Brooke barb oh well that's not good YouTube's supposed to notify subscribers and sponsors very much of these things you know it's been a long time since I asked but people should probably check to make sure they're still subscribed if they still want to be subscribed I don't know if you do still doing that weird unsubscribe thing or whatever was happening with that I'll make a mention to that in the next video because always I forgot about that that seems like I've forgotten issue now I don't know if it's still happening or what the deal with that ever even was but I know the people once in a while would tell me they check and be like oh I'm not subscribed anymore and no one was really sure what or how it was doing it cookie e42 up 232 perfect that needed that now if I could just find the ladder for this floor that would be okay I didn't get the notification either subd do you have notifications on that the Bell thing you gotta remember you sub and turn the little thing on though I pretty sure most people know that but people always mention it so I figured like I should too because I want to be like one of the cool kids murder balls give me a ladder we started out so strong in the mind so what happened there we go murder balls always give me good stuff whether it's coal air ladders there we go couple more swipes I have been unsub from DF three times for some reason I watch every single video yeah see that's what I'm talking about cuz people are clearly getting in subdue apparently YouTube could not identify any issue with the last I heard they didn't seem to be able to identify it even happening so that's what I hear from YouTube but then people tell me that so I don't know really well what the deal with that is curious the very least alright murder balls are going down an aquamarine and see oh and a ladder alright we don't need fertilizer there we go oh that was elevator already I would try and push for one more floor but I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it one in one two and one yeah we'd get some iron off the next floor of maybe or copper oh this is ghost floors ghosts are super annoying cuz they hit you and then they disappear and then you gotta chase them down again and again no fun you should do ASMR video yeah people always tell me that I doubt ever well though I don't even really know what it is actually we go down to floor 53 really quick if we get super lucky we might get more dodge to the murder balls there's a coal sack though I'll take it out thank you two more floors actually we might be able to do this because look at all the murder balls the ghosts are gonna be annoying but the murder balls might do it for me go away look at the knock back on ghosts I want to get that ghost on the other side of me let's reorganize here a little bit shall we if everything kid this go to my other side that would be very acceptable there we go you know what the very least we'll get some more money for killing these things health is dread dwindling somewhat finally down to the point where things in actually kind of hurt me I think it's about floor 80 when things really start to get dangerous and like hurty okay stop hitting me I've got to be careful one down few more things to go give me a ladder please give me a ladder stupid ghost holy okay I regret going down this next few floors in the mines waffle God Games $2.00 thank you this stream needs more likes waffle God gave says it needs more likes it absolutely does thank you Wow after all that no ladder it's really gonna be this one that only wants to run he doesn't wanna fight come here Murderball your time is up I demand your soul you must die well so much for that no bow 55 in the mines Oh that'd be pretty cool pretty quick oh no this is a big floor I'll never give up I think I'm gonna have to abandon this floor and this this time gets really really lucky man I was so close to get really running out of time come on ladder gonna make cherry bombs what do they take copper and coal no I'm one shine copper okay I've gotta leave the mines like right now I'm gonna pass out oh that sucks one more lucky one well my luck had to run out eventually damn so close now there's only spawned on the ground not the dirt yeah I was kind of curious about that you have to do the glitch soon it's almost 2 o'clock and again I want to do this legit though so I'm not gonna do I'm gonna try and avoid doing glitches I have so far not think I'm gonna be able to continue avoiding I could have broken probably one or two more rocks to be honest but whatever it is what it is now I'm getting all the copper and iron I need I don't really need to get deeper anyways to be fair so you know let's just go to bed let's not push our luck any more than we already have foraging mining combat see productive day we're doing it you get the teepee staff yeah if I'd 2 million gold I probably would I still made a thousand sixty two gold for the day so not bad today hopefully we can get that backpack of ours bigger backpack so I can start actually carrying some stuff Skyler Miskimmin $2 coffee fund donation thank you very much for the kind Coffee fund donation Robin lost racks for 250 gold well that's easy cuz I know where it is and we'll get some spring onions to go grab those uh get you you you you I gotta focus and I'm doing stuff no cuz I'm losing my mind we can make a few sprinklers so already we can make one I'm not gonna make too many these kinds of sprinklers I'm gonna do one for my current coffee plants but simply because a lot of that stuff Y can make the better sprinklers using refined quartz on top of those things so I should be able to make those pretty soon which will save me much time and effort okay let's go get the robbing money cuz well it was my farming right now not super high once I start selling some of these cauliflower that should help I'll maybe buy a few more - on top of what we got Phil is bad buy him go get the gingers X which he misplaced very irresponsible of her to lose her only tool consider who chops down wood she probably wants to hold on to that axe a little better oh cool let's go down and around all this mess cool should have hit 300 likes long ago we probably should have I don't know where we're at but let's hit 300 likes smash that like button for those of you that don't know Robins act is right down here it's very easy to find you should be spending lots of time down here anyway gathering spring onions which clearly grow in abundance when I go to find them well we got four so that's something then Robin lost rack somewhere right there you found the lost axe better return it to Robin you don't actually have to you can hold on to it for no reason at all really but congrats something to have Marty sell to Pierre let's go to the beach real quick a more affordable it's time feelin lucky it's only 254 lights not 300 for shame Wow good luck with the bread today don't know what that's all about not complaining but we got some bread almost instant 300 likes see that's all it takes you just got to ask for him or demand them or whatever it is I did either way everyone's a winner we hit 300 hula stick this up ancient seed trilobite also known as Pam now on too far dude yeah let's get 400 likes everyone move that curse of yours over that like button or if you're on mobile touch that like button just touch it hey you stop that yuck you know what here's a garbage back I hope you like it this makes me sick what are her and his gift that's cuz I took it out of your garbage can that should be in the recycling mayor Lewis this is a green community we recycle here we don't dis know things away that are recyclable hey hey hey the way what if you did a Fall Festival display with the things people asked you to find for them I don't honestly know I've had I think I've tried kind of works to some degree how much is the backpack mm okay well we need the Robin ax for sure before we do that if you want ancient sea grind grubs in the mine interesting we that you want an axe no wrong person but I don't know who Robin is I licked the like button whatever works - no it's technically touching it not particularly what I would have done but you got to do what you got to do oh right I guess you can have that back let's go gather that reward 2001 almost like I did it on purpose trilobites are useful creatures their blood can be distilled for medicine I would never call Pam useful Pam's blood could be distilled into alcohol again 190-proof it's like a grain alcohol but it's Pam okay let's do the back pack and sell the daffodils and if we can buy more seeds we will back pack up this makes a lot easier to do everything ancient is sping spring through fall it it is will do you want more cauliflower just because we can that's going in the bin that's going in the bin that's getting planted already it's almost like the berry season middle of the month 15 through the 18th salmonberries for spring that's what it's all about but stop Pelican town save money for strawberries oh I don't need to do strawberries I've evolved beyond and strawberries got a fertilize first had to catch myself there you know what I might do today actually is fire up some field snacks that might not be the worst idea in the world after what I learned from before also we can make more sprinklers let's do that right now actually no let's not yet I want to wait for the Betty sprinklers what we're gonna do today is get us some field snacks and a my axe for that so everything's going away there I do an old copper on me let's keep my furnace is going to you actually coals gonna stay and there all right let's see if we can make us some field snacks before we do let's gather that last thing out of the bin back and forth back and forth back and forth we need the a card and the maple so I need pine pine cones I don't think these are gonna be pine cones but they will be more of those people were also kind enough to point out that you can shake the trees think they have a five percent chance of dropping stuff but if they don't do it then I'm just gonna cut them down there's two pine cones just need a couple more and I'll have what I need whether those are pine cones that's weak I think downs a pine cone I think you can actually tell by the way they look more pine cones there's three filled snacks that's a pine cone that's not a pine cone but this few will give me a pine cone come on give me two then I can make six filled snacks which is great for mining purposes SAP in wood maybe my forging skill leveled up apparently the reason it stops giving you uh items is cuz you're foraging skill leveled up so I didn't know that before and if that's true that's very odd oh that's gonna be a pine cone let's see well I give me one yeah there we go feel stack fields necks are actually somewhat valuable in themselves fun fact okay let's clear the grass around these trees because this is just this is just too much grass the trees can't give me what they need to give me if they're surrounded by grass aren't we all Tomatoes I believe we are we all start out as tomatoes and grow into people and some people never grow out of their tomato phase they say a tomato as indicated by their intelligence pop pop pop pop pop yeah those things are super handy don't look she looks like a pine one yeah it is see there we go more field snacks okay if I get two more pine cones I can make two more field snacks then I think that one's actually a pine cone but let's finish off this tree there's one pine cone this is a pine cone okay there we go she's the field snack day there we go eight field stacks tons of energy that's a pine cone too actually now we need one maple these are maples see what is taking a day to take a step back these are worth 20 gold each so right away there's 160 gold disappoint me up down to an 80 if it gives me what I need it didn't cool one more acorn mmm might be looking for a while that's a pine I think that's an acorn or sad an acorn I need though I need the maple that might be a maple though there's no maple trees near that let's just cut this tree down enough debating let's just do it then I'm gonna clear out all this grass I don't go to bed I think Jen Hackett ten dollars thank you very much melons are better than coffee well for ten dollars they sure are Thank You Jenn Hackett for the donation also if you guys have been missing it Kirra my moderator there in a stream has been streaming started Valley quite a bit so if you haven't seen her stream go check out her channel right now subscribe to that see she streams pretty much every day and she's doing a good job of it she's very good at starting as indicated earlier by her elf so go check out Kirara Lala's channel subscribe to her watch her streams every day it's a lot of fun she seems more than I do so that's how you get a lot of streams pine pine pine pine okay one more one more maple give me maple are you a maple maple seed oh it is too cool oh yeah there we go I'm happy now let's clear out some of the grass again I've got tons of energy from field snacks can sell them but they're worth way more as energy right now goat loops is here hello goal oops getting dark out I got up I should teach a music playlist and s to put it on the upbeat song some of these songs are so relaxing they kind of like put me to sleep as we go alright that's gonna stay on me furnaces are ready to move flippity-flop and also let's start doing some courts while we're at it where's the courts did I sell it all did I smoked it all oh there it is I knew that just testing you cuz already I'll have enough for for quality sprinklers if I want them which will water 32 things which is more than I even have right now okay goodnight cruel world goodnight cruel world then I make any money today what I even sell oh yeah I guess I woke up they sell out crap 665 that's not bad I'll do some more cauliflower I'm waiting for coffee anyway Friday today traveling merchants well they have anything probably not well alright let's do yeah let's just do more why not if I could do 10 quality sprinklers that's 80 plants watered dear idiot egg festival tomorrow not sure if I'm even gonna participate for once yeah how was that for madness yeah that would be a field snack right there boom boo-boom boo-boom the more you know whoops and I managed to screw it up making a single field snack like that more coffee the coffee's underway it is on the way my addiction is partial oh yeah a lot of people really got into my time with Portia I was one of them I feel like I've run out of stuff Fairy Rose gave Kara tulip pint our rare seed for one thousand gold no thanks did I stop playing Portia uh more or less I need the game to do another update I feel like I've kind of run out of content early DF you're not the idiot I am well if you insist I won't argue with you pinecone hey corn Candide one more maple seed I need a maple seed to give me its stuff really I thought that'd be a maple we gotta go chase it down that might be one cuz it's closest to a maple tree yep there we go cool okay let's go see Pierre by the whatever it is we're after more cauliflower plant dose move on along I'm gonna have to get going any sprinklers though mmm that stuff can stand me to hide the axe for now but I need to actually water my stuff to you that's probably pretty important to growing crops watering did I forget to water yesterday I feel like I did have I seen spellbound is being made by chuckle fish I have seen bits and pieces I don't know how far along it is in its development or anything ever looked into in a while you know you can just shake the trees to get to see it's right why you're absolutely right there's a 5% chance that means they'll get a seed one in 20 times how many trees that I cut down how when he sees did I get I would've gotten maybe two seeds out of whole thing not even enough for one field stack that's why I didn't do it okay any more iron for sure let's go see Pierre why axe the seeds you can hold them you can help a lot of things doesn't mean you should I'm starting to get that afternoon slump should I have more coffee his you know it probably isn't the energy drink crash because I started this morning with a coffee followed up by an energy drink now I'm getting the crash here just gonna do eight more of those those would be good experience that should get me to where I need to go for farming I think I calculated it before I think was an even 100 strawberries will get you all the way to your quality sprinklers I have three dinners because I think if my stomach sent help that doesn't sound like a problem that sounds like a good problem alright fertilizer time one two three four five six seven eight well that's convenient more watering then I'm gonna go smash some iron up in the mines coffee should be ready in just a few short days and it's gonna start multiplying really quick almost to the point what's gonna be annoying it's actually gonna be a bit of a race to keep ahead of it with sprinklers but I'm okay with that can you more energy in here what do I got they get yeah let's just go farm up a ton of iron actually let's go process a geode since we're wasting time today anyway might as well the great thing about doing the floor is I'm at now in the mines is that there's a ton of iron and copper oh heck hey dangerously funny how are you doing I'm doing very well today catching winners teams for the first time ever Hale noodle Hale noodle yeah there's lots of other games similar to this that are coming out that I'm excited about there been a few good ones but the Kin seeds should be coming out pretty soon in its beta form that's gonna be a really good game I can tell already gravy I keep is gonna be coming out pretty soon to you same deal gotta be good I got a geode from that fancy okay it's processed this when do you think multiplayer is coming out if I was to guess guesstimate I would say within a month purely conjecture once again whoops I don't have the money for that okay well bye my earth crystal then and let's keep going with this forgot oh poor I am that should be a good one that's maybe a good one man again just I'm selling things for the sake of selling things now man how do money mean whatever I'm just gonna sell the geodes I did that experiment once is it more worthwhile to process yields or seldom I can't remember what the result was I remember you don't get any money for selling Omni geodes which is weird let's just go sell everything likely towards late March to early April and very well could be so close to foreign did like so let's get to 400 likes oh you know what let's just forget it get in there everything had enough for you right let's go gather bunch of iron ore that's what they called your mom the IRA nor but there was a w in there somewhere to sell the geodes yeah the geodes in the pit I'll get the money for him tomorrow the money's in the coffee and the plants anyway the first cauliflower should be done pretty soon to you the coffee will start getting done then we're on crop mode two prismatic shards gone I don't know if regular Gio's can give you prismatic shards can someone confirm or deny are you going to do her face your veil yep we're getting closer to that don't you worry probably maybe start doing the face cam just like Denver I kind of like that idea I do like that idea it's just a matter of actually doing it we'll get there eventually cam more concerned about iron and quartz right now that I'm about ladders in case you guys are all wondering I should just pretend not to see the ladder just to mess with you guys I could see Jeff freaking out with the ladders right there what's a very hungry sudden he can despite the fact that I ate just before this dream i barbecued a nice steak and had vegetables with it yet somehow I'm starving again suddenly it was a big steak something's wrong with my body it just always wants food no matter what I do are you going to complete the museum not in this file on my completionist I well what they're supposed to be cold there someone got to my cold before me maybe was line is trying to keep his fire going cuz I keep putting it out ok murder balls let's do it again one down okay I should mostly be focusing on the murder balls I don't care about progress right now I just I'm here for iron coal and copper and quartz there we go everything nicely bunched up lawful God Games two dollars 0w zero thank you I assume that's a compliment why don't you break the frozen crystals no energy lost in you a chance of getting or affine quartz so that's a good point I don't know there's a lot of things to you could be doing in this game that you know it's just hard to remember all the different little things that work because it really is such a very deep complex game seems simple on the surface but there's so much buried beneath that surface that it's really actually pretty amazing stop stop stop I really really hate the ghosts never mentioned out already Jade and they follow you from everywhere they're like the ghosts of the old Mario game so as soon as you turn you back to them they're coming toward you you turn a face of a phrase they get stuck in really stupid spots that's it they remind me of going down I think floor 60s where I'm gonna cut it off I think floor 40 is probably my best bet because there's lots of iron there's also good amounts of copper and the dustbunnies for coal I think that would work out pretty nice and quartz descends to show up over quartz shows up so that's easy if he looked like Tama might consider unsub Ingmar Bey m-pam that's a big twist it's a Pam reveal I could have got a free ghost fish from that Ghost though no worries it go sit too annoying yeah I said it I mean I'm not a racist or anything but I hate ghosts okay dust bunnies give me some stuff give me coal and a ladder that's what I want that's not even asking for a lot just like pretty much a rare drop that's also annoying because they also follow you slimes I don't care about because they'll leave you alone you just run away from them bats follow you and they have huge knock-back ghosts do pretty much the same thing Matti Alex goodbye thank you for stopping by and the kind sponsorship starting to feel exhausted well not anymore I ate some bread frozen geode that's something oh look a ladder how about that new second glow ring oh it's a big glow ring now I have a big and a small glow ring so I'll be extra glowy what's the benefit of that you asked I have no idea just glowy that's all alright it's good on the floor farty and get a little bit more iron if we can I can also be trying to get the mushroom floor but I mean I don't really need money now because coffee she's gonna multiply itself hey there's a force sword that's kind of exactly what I needed we'll take a look at that after I chase down his aquamarine hiding over there so there we go 8 to 18 damage to speed 1 defense this is only 4 to 8 so this is 2 to 4 times the damage this makes it all a lot easier this is always what you want to find so when you do feel lucky much bigger damaged things die quicker less annoying less time spit all right I'm just gonna spend the rest of the day farming this floor for iron what do we got for energy let's eat a few spring onions because why not I can't want to make a video to on stardew valley of just like the music basically kind of the soundtrack of the seasons and then just like the relaxing noises of like cutting down trees smashing rocks picking crops I feel that could be it almost relaxing type video in itself or just as sounds and music I don't know what are your guys thoughts on that would that be a good idea would that be useless just like an hour long video relaxing stuff cast your votes no you can sell the small into the adventurers guilt I could adventurous guilt is now closed but you're absolutely right Rin Neko Oni five dollars Canadian thank you very much sarcasm and sturdy valley two things that work perfectly when you were the one doing it thank you thank you for your five dollar donation Rin Neko Oni aeryn aeryn aeryn goodbye or do it one more time see we get a little bit more out of that floor what do we got all right well we go that's it Cole presumably it was a little bit of coal and a frozen tear probably left over from the children I murdered I leave leave some of them in the mines they can all be turned into doves so them have to be left alone to freeze to death in the dark I don't make the rules I just follow them kid carrot to camp carrots Juanito all right hey let's go back to the farm the ventures killed closes at 11:00 oh well it's 11:40 now so too late anyway I need that relaxation video in my life I think they'll just be a fun idea cause it would just be like different altogether neato burrito says Uncle salty the part-time sponsor I'll think about putting that together that's not a bad idea all right bunch of stuff in the bin so we don't work I kind of want you for your energy hard what I don't need right now that can go that can go that can go I can go that could go everything else I kind of want to hold on to or sell for that all good we'll even start the furnaces with some more Iren overnight oh I need copper to you running along with the copper department keep the copper and iron there quartz their energy items can go there and get to go in the morning we'll wake up the fresh bars also you should put a bunch of ads on relaxing video every 30 seconds all the way through 990 gold for the day mostly from there you go and a little bit from there you go Birds maybe next will be 500 lights could be maybe you know wonder what kind of answer to actually appear on a relaxation video I've never really noticed i watch of you they're like relaxation live streams cuz those are kind of fun to listen to watch whatever you do with them it'd be really cool if some of these things that start to be done today is the egg festival Coco gets strawberries they do give you a good experience I guess I might as well I might make a few crappy sprinklers just to water them just for fun because they're a good experience and everything's gonna be closed today because it is that day really couldn't water one last thing idiot let's go get some spring onions and then we'll go back and do it all again we'll go to the egg festival today buy some strawberries I like watching streams of people eating a lot of food do you reckon Pam is six eight or six ten oh she's at least six nine survival tip if you're near a cliff don't slip words to live by literally you can't plant infinite coffee after all no you cannot yeah I'll do a few strawberries for now they will multiply kind of slowly this one should probably turn into three more and then those should turn into three more each and then though she turn into three more each got some gold spring onions for once I just already want to water anything more than I already am but I don't want to make any sprinklers at the wrong variety either do you see the pickle I'm in but before long I should level up my farming skill I know it's slow right now but because I'm just watering and not picking anything but generally the longer things take to grow the more experience you get from them I think I can only buy ten strawberries anyway cuz I'm poor let's do well I guess all we can do is quarts right now anyway but I'm getting pretty close I'm already up to seven sprinklers worth of stuff potentially ten soon if at first you don't succeed skydiving is not for you yeah kind of get one shot to do that strawberry seeds ten deal bye it's been fun egg festival and it's night time because why not actually we can fertilize these strawberries too so all is not lost let me do the strawberries over here just to change it up end up here one two three four five six seven eight nine ten there we don't get experience good blah blah blah let's water that crap few days till cauliflower won't be long I gotta get copper in quartz tomorrow how's my cold doing I said about 25 cold so I'm still doing good they're staying ahead of the game that is quite important I married Sam I married Sam a few times all in good fun I know I put that away that was kind of short-sighted of me no wasn't it coffee beans almost ready to go I think it's tomorrow I put it on a Friday Saturday Sunday Monday should be tomorrow watering is fun yay oh well slowly making the money I really should do speaker on that coffee though I think it would be done right now did the whole process starts early who should I marry monks pretty much have to if you play this game now if you don't he'll this marry you and well you don't want that to happen so we're just getting rich off coffee we're gonna be totally I could get you some water hold that dot and we're back forty energy look at which energy he's up to some watering that crap is such a waste heat the cave carrot those should boost your mining skill but they don't what's that about I'm gonna do floor 20 again I can't see what that says I got a big net open stream labs we had a donation uno momento hyper active II walk I like the name twenty dollars Canadian first I'm catching a live stream love the videos thank you very much hyperactive II walk donated through stream labs everyone show hyperactive II walk some love and a chat for $20 thank you okay floor 20 I think is where the copper business is most abundant generally and when we got courts at the very least three of them what just happened Adventure is guilt something else you know you know what thank you thank you for dying I just had the sudden urge to murder that working out while watching VF I've been a very motivating little bit of copper I don't need a ton of copper every day I just need some basically show some love for twenty dollars twenty dollars is my love number if you give me twenty dollars I give you love and yes that's exactly what it sounds like I started listening at a weird time he sure did I sponsor you you better be marrying and divorcing me on multiplayer oh don't worry I'm sure there'll be plenty of that to go around $20 love you so much $20 I love $20 that's for sure how much coffee that buys especially going somewhere like McDonald's really sometimes do real cheap coffee I've been changing my coffee up lately I realized I was putting in such a little sugar that I might as well not put any sugar and to see if I notice a difference and I don't I literally put no sugar in my coffee now I don't notice the difference that's just a fun fact I wanted you guys to know that 18 copies so far grinding out copper in the mines what more could you want from a Wednesday afternoon Wednesday evening for most of you I suppose anyone here from Vancouver any Vancouverites in the crowd stand up and say hello tell me about yourself how's your day going what did you have for breakfast what did you want for breakfast and can I have $20 I need sugar and creamer I used to go really heavy on cream and sugar and then I don't know what happened I did kind of descended leaning off because I was like maybe I'm having too much cream and sugar in my coffee I know I'm like if I was to go order from somewhere I'd be like I want one one cream in my coffee that's it maybe maybe one milk depending on how I'm feeling Plain Jane whoops my mom's in Vancouver I'm listening trono American uh go I'll tell you about myself DFT more likes I had toast and tea that sounds pretty good depending on the tea had a PBJ for breakfast and Saskatoon siree that's Vancouver that's Greater Vancouver I thought all Canadians put maple syrup in their coffee I never have um that's probably maybe not the worst idea in the world that would sweeten it nicely I've heard about people putting weird things in coffee some people do coconut oil why don't you get yourself a coffee maker at home I do actually have a coffee maker at home I just when I'm out and about I usually buy coffee just to you know because I'm out and about I have a carry gear so that's generally where my coffee comes from just grinding out copper and chatting with chat this could actually be decent money in itself if I get enough gems stop hitting me eat breakfast your breakfast how about that chocolate waffle whoo look at all the fibers that's weird never seen it like that chocolate chip waffles they're really good I used to make those all the time I have a Belgian waffle maker and I made chocolate chip waffles a lot those were amazing I haven't done in a while though because I just go in trends with food I'll eat the same thing endlessly for like three months and then I'll move on but now I really want a chocolate chip Belgian waffles so awesome think each at Fir for making me think of that hope you know you just ruined my Wednesday cliff energy bar this cliff bars are pretty good don't want the red mushroom I guess I do Hooten to boot best coffee maker I've ever had a ninja coffee bar interesting never heard of that I just like the the one cup they won cup makers the pods cuz they're so quick and easy like here's the pod it makes it real quick and then you drink it no extra it's not too much not too little you can choose if it's strong or not mine is always strong just like me ninja coffee bar interesting if anyone here is in Vancouver could you bring me a coffee right now just you know I since I'm busy streaming you can actually just kind of feed it to me as we're going and like give me a sippy cup I'll slowly sip at it and people do keep asking about merchandise and stuff and still in the process of dealing with some of that thinking about it we'll see what I can make work I kind of want coffee mugs and coffee mugs it'd be a good idea because everyone could use a mug clothing is a little bit difficult because you know all sorts of people of different shapes and sizes I wouldn't really know that what to do really maybe like pajama pants or something cuz everyone can use a pair of those they're kind of easier to do t-shirts or hoodies or something maybe I don't know how much copper do I have 63 we're getting there not a great day for copper though usually there's more did he just get an ancient seed uh no I think you're probably looking at this had me excited for a second I was it oh boy I can definitely plant that who I should build into more five I'm gonna be more scarecrows oh I'm gonna have so much coffee that it's not really gonna be a big deal Oh Boop okay moving on pajama merch make PJs mumps on one side DF on the other yeah that's not a bad idea hmm the wheels are turning you know you're right it is gold I need VD of this pin Clarice damn it hmm well this was wasting my day I totally forgot it's the other ones well let's go mind some iron then I can make the basic sprinklers for now anyway then to water things as we're going yeah I don't know why I was thinking was the other way around cuz I'm thinking about merchandise now a pamphlet I would buy a t-shirt I think the problem really having with that is kind of the logistics of it all because if we're gonna do it I want to make it sure it's like a reasonable price of everyone cuz obviously I'm not gonna sell it one coffee mugs for $100 I want to make sure they're reasonably priced but we'll deal with that yeah we still got a bit of energy all right let's just we need some iron with all the crystals how fun finally found out about the cold yeah I completely forgot that it's yeah it's gold iron and refined quartz that's okay but we are gonna have to make it deeper into mines now so not the end of the world I can make these other sprinklers that's a no big deal I don't got lots of copper to make other furnaces if I want to so there's always that make them large bugs though not those ya know if I make a mug it's gonna be a full-sized big mug I don't do half measures when it comes to coffee I get the biggest baddest coffee there is well alright let's do one more run through the mines because I'm kind of getting bored but I'm also getting a good surplus of energy so make it down to the gold isn't gonna be too hard when's your next dream not sure probably the weekend I'm gonna say probably Saturday I might do a fortnight stream this weekend depending on if I can do it oops I'm paying attention yes I am it'd be nice if I get over a few days or I'm not mining but we'll see microwaveable is a good thing yeah totally I make sure they're a solid bugs don't worry I know my mugs big bold bad cheap coffee mugs yes you and Jay Mac fortnight yeah as long as I'm I'm really hit and miss with four-day lately some days I'm like I'm playing really good confidently and then those days like today where I'm like hey I'm completely not doing anything so I don't know what to say what that is yet there we are good enough all right I'm leaving the mines for today we're gonna go start smelting some iron we gotta make it down to the gold better good you were fun to watch yeah but it helps if you're good at it it makes it better for sure I'm not even picking that horseradish people from Europe all right what are we gonna sell a whole bunch of stuff gonna smelt some more iron you're not gonna make one more furnace than two because why not oh because they drove the stones that's why some of the iron I got seriously all right well I guess if that's all we got that's all we got I think coffee bean might be ready for the first time tomorrow so that's something no is it good energy okay well that's it the restaurants mostly energy items tons of energy atoms actually so good okay well get way down deep in the mines tomorrow then with our unlimited energy level for mining pickaxe proficiency and I can transmute and a massive 565 gold that was a really unproductive day in hindsight that was really bad should have been better but it wasn't you know coffee beans are done I want to speak grow those so I could go buy some speak well before we plant those but there we go first coffee harvest for beans cool and I got to start holding onto rocks in the mines that's important oh seven berries - yep Lucerne is getting very inefficient suddenly and I got a water all this well its water shall we we're gonna water go get some speed gross speaker the coffee I'm gonna put the Farsi coffees on the summary Dimitri sprinklers for now cuz I just don't want to water them continuously then worry about the upgrades later cauliflower is only a few days away strawberries are gonna be the 23rd I believe I think it ten days in every five so it'll be the 23rd and 28 for beans here rich oh just you wait that one coffee plant has now developed into big coffee because that gives me former coffee beans to plan that one's gonna produce me three four beans every two days rinse repeat it's big time exponential growth growth plus those coffee beans are going to give me experience every day oh I still need that so what do I got now for 12 hours 17 so pretty soon as long as I start getting a gold which I should soon for now let's make a few even it was just three four now that's a start I don't want to waste too many of my iron bars oh right so close to the top but it'll start right here for now one two three getting it ready actually I guess I didn't need to do all those only a four seed so those four are gonna be speed growed coffee excellent are you gonna be doing a face reveal I am one day might as well get more of these stuff and yeah I'm gonna make a few more furnaces cuz once I get gold I'm gonna have to catch up a gold pretty quickly because my coffee beans are gonna outrun my ability to water pretty quickly how come Gus gets to go in early don't even 9 o'clock and Gus just waltzes through but not me not that farmer who's Pierre's best customer who single-handedly runs the economy here was it looking for speed grow speed grow 10% so I'll save a day off this but you know what whatever a day is still a day sooner I don't know that's actually worth it or not Seattle that's pretty close I've flown out of Seattle a few times and I was going elsewhere actually I think it's been oh I think the last time I flew to Seattle is when I went to Florida always ten years ago is something long time ago no right let's use some speed grill because why not sorry to see it's like a light purple cool whoops meant to do that no big deal okay now let's go to the mines and see if we can deal with some of this mess I'm gonna start using up some of these items that are just kind of in the way do I like Florida I do like Florida I want to go back actually I really do that might end up being my next vacation but we'll see I want to go somewhere hot and sunny I do Vegas a lot anyway I'll go there anyway but I don't know Florida or Hawaii are the two that I have my mind on right now oh one of those two is still ignoring that by the way yeah that's right I'm ignoring it oh there's salmon berries - I forgot about these I don't want to go around picking a bunch of these now let's get deeper into mines first 55 oh we got the better start at least so we kill things quicker that's a start the last circus made a metal but this wooden one is better apparently gather some of this coal real quick yeah whatever going down oh that's handy oh look at all the dust bunnies cool is it easy there's another ladder little bit of iron we don't really need to focus on iron right now I need to get to the gold which is floor 80 now get this why not I'm here anyway waffle got games $2.00 welp I got a gig going have fun alright waffle got games thanks for stopping by thanks for all your donations along the way enjoy the rest of your day iron edge Oh is that's even better Wow not for you often you get one of those twelve to twenty five and this does eight to eighteen cool that's my knock back I can sell this wood sword now - it's a little bit slower but it hits harder and I'm okay with that because it's critical hips are gonna hurt big time good luck today in the mines Wow cruising downwards dead that reminds me if I am gonna stream for tonight this weekend I get any of my audio tracks back in order I need the help with mr. icy kress again for that I'll track him down hey you know what I'll even say right now I'll do a fart night stream on Saturday put it in the books fart nights dreams Saturday not sure what time yet but yeah okay bye audio issues figured out the rest of it should all be pretty good just a matter me not playing like a jackass there we go and this is one of my least favorite floor is because it's the big spiral floor which takes forever to get through Jimmy Warren thank you $5 DF would you ever make a live stream of fortnight's save the world or play me on Xbox one are you talking about the like not multiplayer version or not like battle royale part if so I've never played and I don't really play on console anymore I'm strictly PC these days the superior PC I used to only play on console but no longer give me the ladder even 99 rocks I would settle for then I could make the stairs ladder and a sword works good for deaf sprites murder balls California would be cool yeah California's good to you I like California come on come on there you go there it is just a sec shot no crystal taker I'm gonna go sell some of the adventurers guild right now while they're open and keep working downwards it's cross platform though is it really Oh interesting hello dum-dum buy my stuff hello oh okay so that's where 250 that's worth 450 you didn't even buy those and those how thoughtful like a by a pirate sir but it's less good a Cutlass wood mallet Templar blade oh yeah you only get like you unlock different things the further down you go Pam is hot well your title to your opinion ooh this would be good cuz I could make it sorry all right everyone bunch up above me perfect just what I wanted there we go just a little off the top and you're dead oh come on les pattes more ladders I forgot about that loner over there he's hiding cuz he's scared not scared anymore lots of iron I better go get all that you know what let's make a bomb for that doesn't make it so much faster whoa I just clicked off-screen didn't mean to do that there we go everyone bunch up now everyone died from this oh oh oh hopefully that doesn't kill me no not that much damage actually I didn't realize my health was getting so low should probably start paying attention I found a ladder though I was honestly worried I was gonna kill me can I get a heal up a little bit and then gather the rest this iron didn't go down a few more floors aquamarines sure another ladder I gotta remember to go grab all that iron over there I almost forgot went down the ladder already and another ladder okay must be good luck day well alright 500 likes and dangerously funny will slay Pam let's get it that's true it's not true but I'll say it's true that would be amusing there it is Flores 65 is anything here worth grabbing nope I'm out goodbye mines I don't feel like pushing down another five levels and too lazy let's go see what's done tomorrow my cauliflower is gonna be done I gotta start making it better why can't even any gold before I make better sprinklers it's all falling apart not a big surprise I don't think I'm gonna use any more speaker on the coffee it's only shaving off one day I've been thinking about it not really worth it for the price I'm paying maybe for the original one I could have just to get me one day ahead let's put stuff in the bin then I see how it is I go gather some yeah I'll gather some salmonberries for the rest of the day that's what I'll do okay it looks pretty good okay no stuff goes in the bin actually let's make on my furnace humor furnaces yeah we'll do five furnaces that we were pretty sure we'll be able to make as many things as we need gold bars when we do it when is next completion episode not sure yet rocks go in there yeah leave that in the morning anyway alright let's go together but just salmonberries see if we can find a bunch just gonna do a typical edge of the map loop to hopefully find them not too many just yet though is there well there's one also very good for your foraging skill because you find so many unless you're really unlucky which I'll probably be those would probably be the only two I'll find all day good berries Paul smelly $2 a DF love your videos don't have time for streams well thank you for your support and donation anyway thank you thank you thank you oh did the berry stack like if you don't pick him till the third day then like all the bushes are lit up I'm not sure how they work give me some of those hey hey give me that ten berries these are great energy too because already that's 275 energy drunk stream yeah that'll probably happen at some point too wouldn't surprise me maybe already is maybe I always am well alright they don't give experience I thought they did don't they maybe not can someone confirm or deny it's getting later right am I gonna be able to do this Foresti area and I can live with that did we reach the donation goal last time we never actually really had when I had that scrubber for a while the top of the screen but that wasn't anything that was just a joke and I didn't really like it I look back in the videos and watched it I'll make telex this gets in a way of things it's it's a weird distraction I didn't like it no foraging oh well we get berries at the very least I got 18 berries to consume 30 likes to 500 Kira's right we need more likes we need 30 more apparently all right let's call it a night I've had enough for this day just before 1 a.m. we would have made some kind of money moving our huge 964 dollars all right and nothing is done well you know what it's been exactly two hours now I'm getting definitely pretty tired so that's gonna be it for this stream more videos to come hopefully I'll get those good ones out by the weekend is gonna be a fortnight's stream on Saturday I'm calling it now so I'm gonna have to get ready for that so thanks Evan for the sponsors donations support kind words all the good stuff hope you like this one I'll see you guys all next time goodbye you", "vPG6A9f46i0": "good morning Rachel here from day to day joyce calm i had bought some coffee from Costco I like this organic blend and I left there without grinding the beans and I was thinking what have I done so it's been sitting here for Emma house for about a week and I've just been going to pick up coffee somewhere else but I said enough is enough and I decided to try this out I'm going to use my Vitamix to ground the coffee beans so I'm gonna set you right here while you watch I don't do this just pour your beans right in mmm  it put your lid on securely all right put your spinning on high around 9 or 10 on the variable setting and turn on high for about 10 seconds it's not finely ground but it's not course it's probably about meeting and then just put it in your air tight container to use and then enjoy you a cup of coffee thanks for watching", "MeADJIfYXAo": "meet the supremo coffee

this is a tuck and I have Brian here from belly smoking with me being from both of us from law enforcement we the other day I was sitting around thinking why can't the gross rebound girl if you guys know Chuck Jones he's always trying to find some new thing to do to keep things interesting so let's see how this turns out what went out and got some green beans I got these from Amazon so I'm gonna give these a test run just to see how they are I have three pounds that should give us some good trial and error test runs in case the first batch doesn't work out we're going to use our Green Mountain girl Pizza of an infrared gun and I have a cast iron pan in our Daniel Boone right now the Daniel Boone set 500 I'm trying to get the the cast iron pan up to around 400 degrees I think that's gonna be hot enough to mix these beans up and I'm not sure what's gonna happen after we put them in I do know that we have to keep stirring them they keep them going so I'm going to use a big cast-iron pan a wooden spoon and stir the beans so they don't burn and get it even roast I'm going to go ahead and pour the beans into the pan I don't know how many are going here half of the bag pretty spoken well jokes over here playing with the coffee beans you guys need to make sure you get to a shop he has a bunch of tools you guys need from pellets to accessories to thermo pens get the shop talk to him you never know what kind of fun stuff you guys gonna end up figuring out to throw the grill change things up make it interesting so we've been stirring the beans here every once a while close the lid try to get it hot and we're starting to catch a little bit of a brown color and probably down with a critical point where the oils from the beans are right just right now in the center warm there were cracks a light rose Gorillaz now flipping off the aroma of coffee so I'm gonna open it up I've been opening and closing it and letting it sit to get back pain and then stirring it right now I can hear quite a bit of crack going on we're starting to get color and we're getting some oil coming out still haven't decided how dark we're going to get these I'm just going to kind of go my appearance start to get a little dark or start to get another crack going so I think we're going to go ahead and pull him this is what they're looking like at the moment nice and dark [Music] smells like coffee so where'd you come up with this idea jack just woke up one morning and decided I'm gonna rush some coffee coffee we have a heat source and our grill so here we are [Music] we have our roasted beans in our green beans that way you can see the difference and I'm gonna go ahead and roast up the rest of my back should I have here all right so we've got our finished product here inside the bag after its cooled down we use the hair dryer to blow out all the excess shells and we're going to leave this ziplock baggie oh but how we're doing that this is gonna gas off so you have to let it gas off for about 24 hours and then you'll be able to grind it and coffee maker if you don't do that what happens is the gas pushes away the water and it doesn't adhere to the grounds good enough to make this good quality pump so as the week progresses we're going to try out some of this copy we'll let you guys know how days [Music]", "XLiZ5zczYPY": "hey this is a java gym with first line equipment and today I want to go over two shots of espresso the first one is going to be using very freshly roasted beans that were roasted about two days ago and to show you the implications that happens versus beans that have aged more than five or six days we're gonna first start with the freshly roasted beans roasted about two days ago Polish twist a little knocked another little Polish twist and this gives a nice consistent tamping pressure lock into place and again freshly roasted coffee so we're going to be looking for a bubbly pour and what's happening is it's the carbon dioxide that's exiting the espresso extraction okay it looks like a good pour right now now you're gonna start seeing the big bubbles that are coming out and this is the result of the carbon dioxide that's being extracted out of the coffee grinds this is something that we don't want so the pour is looking extremely horrible so this is why it's really important that when you're using freshly roasted coffee it does need a rest period some Roasters say 48 hours some Roasters say five days some Italian Roasters and even American roses may even go for a week so I'm not even going to taste this because I tasted this before and it's absolutely horrible now we're gonna make the espresso extraction with coffee that's a little older it's about a week old and a grind some coffee fresh not load the portafilter in to the group head nice mouse tell poor if you notice in here no bubbles some Tiger striping that's going on and this shot of espresso nice good crema and this one looks good to taste it's actually very very good so difference is you want to look for the poor that's coming out if you notice that it is very bubbly then you know the coffee beans are too fresh have too much carbon dioxide and you need to let them rest a little more", "x2bvkrJlUMA": "hey guys it's Brittany so today I'm gonna show you how to make these really great coffee bean coasters they're super easy to make and they're gonna make great Christmas gifts this year because they can also be turned into Christmas ornaments let's get started [Music] so first you're gonna take your D molding spray and put a spray in each silicone mold rub it around and let it dry link to product will be in my description but this will keep it from sticking to the silicone and ruining your mold after the D molding spray dries you want to mix the resin and it's going to be equal parts hardener and resin and you want to mix it for three whole minutes you want to make sure it's really well mixed you're gonna take a color that you like of just regular acrylic paint and put a little bit into your resin you want it to be about 10% paint and 90% resin you want to mix it thoroughly to make sure that it doesn't get sticky when it dries and doesn't have any weak spots you want to do this in two steps this is the first as we're gonna just lay the color down and then put the beans on top after we spread the mixture around this will make sure that the beans stay in place when you do your second layer because if you don't do this this step the beans will float to the top so it has to be done in two separate processes and you want to make sure that it's a really thin layer so that it doesn't cover your coffee beans and you can see them really well now after you have your first layer down we're going to torch it and make sure that we get all those bubbles out and then we're gonna start putting the coffee beans on after we're done laying down all the beans where we want them in place then we have to let it dry at least for six hours you want to make sure that the coffee beans stay in place like I said when you put your second layer on [Music] after the resin has hardened I wanted to add some gold flakes to this so I just take some Elmer's glue and add some gold foil and I think it's gonna add a a nice touch who doesn't love sparkly things I mean seriously [Music] and here is the last step we're just gonna take resin equal parts resin and hardener mix it for three minutes and pour it on top let them cure for at least 12 hours and they're ready to pop out [Music] [Music] [Music] you if you have any sharp edges all I do is take some sandpaper and lightly sand it and they're good to go if you liked this video don't forget to subscribe and like it really helps me out and I can't wait to show you more of my ideas in the future", "Vx-n7ED74Vc": "what's cracking everybody it's good to see you again hope everyone out there's have an awesome week today we're gonna talk about what happens to coffee as it ages and answer the question is fresher coffee always better now it's common Street knowledge that the fresher the coffee is the better but it's really not quite as simple as that once coffees roasted you've got two forces that are working in opposition to each other that are going to determine coffees keep freshness those two things are degassing and oxidation degassing is the release of co2 in freshly roasted coffee and degassing happens at a particularly aggressive rate during that first week after which coffee is roasted co2 can be a problem for a couple of reasons the first is that during that first week after roasting because the coffee is driving off gas it's such an aggressive rate the coffee isn't really settled and it's almost like this living breathing thing it's far from inert and what this does is it lends itself to uneven and unpredictable extractions any barista who's made espresso with really fresh coffee several days in a row has experienced this effect even if you have a standard recipe you're kind of chasing the dragon with the grind setting day two is so much different than day three day three is so much different than day four and it's really tricky to dial these coffees in the second thing that makes co2 a problem is the taste or flavor that's associated with it and really fresh coffee that co2 can mask some of the characteristics that make coffee special you won't have as much clarity of flavor you won't have as developed sweetness and the whole experience will have this kind of sharp and edgy vibe to it so for the first several days off roast coffee really isn't at its peak freshness or peak flavor yet so we need to let the coffee rest for a while before we use it so how long do we let it rest we'll to figure that out we need to talk about oxidation oxidation and roasted coffee starts as soon as the coffee comes out of the roaster now oxidation is the same thing that makes metal rust it's the same thing that makes food go rotten if you leave it out and it's a thing that makes coffee tastes stale so if you haven't guessed by now oxidation is bad now oxidation can be sped up and slowed down in several ways you can slow down oxidation by storing your roasted coffee in a sealed bag with a way valve on it that's that little valve that pretty much every coffee bag has on it that valve allows co2 to move out of the bag to allow the coffee to be gas but doesn't let oxygen in the bag to keep the coffee from oxidizing grinding your coffee increases the rate of oxidation because you're exposing more of that beans surface area to oxygen this is why assuming you have a good grinder it's preferable to get whole bean coffee when you buy it and not ground so we've got degassing on one side of the equation oxidation on the other side of the equation what does this mean for coffees optimum freshness basically we end up with a bell curve that illustrates coffees peak freshness for the first few days off roast you want to let the coffee rest and be gas and you don't want to touch the coffee the coffee is not ready to be brewed yet for our coffees that's generally zero to five days off roast we try not to use anything before day six the coffee's just not ready after the initial degassing has taken place but before excessive oxidation sets in now you're in the sweet spot now you're in that optimum window for making things they're incredibly delicious brewing in a predictable way getting even extractions the coffee should be sweet you should be able to taste the nuance you'll get good clarity of flavor this is where coffee is prime time for our coffees this range is that six to 14 day window now it's worth noting that this window is much wider than most people give it credit for most people think that there's a few days where your coffees really good and outside of that it's basically bad and that's just not true if you keep your coffee in the sealed bag keep it in a cool dry place your coffee should be at peak freshness for as long as it takes you to go through that 12 ounce bag unless of course you only drink one cup of coffee every three or four days in which case you need to drink more coffee what are you doing and that 15 to 30 day window the effects of oxidation start to become more apparent but it's not like the coffee instantly goes bad what you'll experience here is much less nuance some of the varietal characteristics and the things that make the coffee's really special and intricate will start to fade the coffee will be a little less lively lower overall sweetness level it still won't tastes bad but it'll tend to taste boring and just like a cup of coffee after 30 days the effects of oxidation really start to settle in the coffee will taste flat and cardboard e paper e you'll begin to notice those stale flavors a lot more at this point you should probably donate your coffee to someone that you don't really like that much so in a nutshell your coffee aging map looks something like this now different factors can affect this aging map as well for example darker roasted coffees oxidized more quickly than lighter roasted coffees so their peak freshness window might fall off a little bit more quickly if you get into really really dark roasted coffees even though they oxidize much more quickly you might not notice this effect that much at all because all you're tasting in the cup is roast in carbon and since you never really had any varietal characteristic in there from the get-go because it was all roasted out you don't actually notice the aging that much this is one of the reasons that that can of Folgers that you had tastes pretty much the same as it did three months ago so with all that we can conclude that for optimum brewing and the most delicious coffee possible fresher isn't always better you want to let your coffee age enough to drive off some of that co2 but not let it age so far that it starts to oxidize and go stale hope that's useful for y'all thank you so much for watching if you're feeling the vibes you might as well hit me with a like if you're feeling them on a deeper level you might as well hit me with the subscribe if you do those things I might be just the most psych person on the face of the planet state I love y'all and I will catch you on the flip side peace [Music]", "WSS6wnTQrNo": "[Music] hello friends this is dmcm and this is my quick review of starbucks limited edition holiday blend for 2020 and i picked this one up in asda i think it was around the sort of four pound mark maybe three pound 80 i paid for this one and i did review the holiday blend or christmas blend last year that was very kindly sent to me by viewer brian and that one was a sort of vintage um rare aged sumatran coffee which there's no mention of that on this pack this year so it must be a different blend altogether so let's take a look at the pack it's whole bean coffee holiday blend herbal and sweet maple notes limited edition whole bean coffee medium roast which is debatable 100 arabica coffee and more information on starbucks there take a look on the back of the pack and more information medium roast storage instructions ways to brew your coffee and contact information and the big surprise here is that it's a 190 gram bag now normally in the supermarkets they come in 227 grams for and starbucks come in 200 gram normally but this they've taken 10 grams off us with it being a christmas blend a nice resealable top on there top of the bag which i actually destroyed when i was opening the bag thinking i was opening the bag the wrong way so let's take a look and see if we can find the description on the side it says the story of starbucks holiday blend we combined bright lively latin american and smooth earthy indonesian beans and roasted them to bring out their full flavors layered balanced and sweet with herbal and maple notes there we go this is medium balanced smooth and rich and conservation international there and on the other side nothing much unless you understand those languages there so that is it for the pack as i say i bought this one and as then i'm not sure if it's available in other supermarkets so let's take a look at the beans they say that this is a medium roast and well it actually looks burnt same some of the beans which is a surprise with starbucks they don't normally take it that far really to charcoal but there we go the beans are glistening and which means it's being roasted to the point where the oil has come out of the beans and is sitting on the surface and the aroma of the beans is the typical starbucks dark smoky sort of pungent um roast with sweet caramel treacle hints it's hard to decipher the difference between this and their espresso beans they sell as they are very similar i would say i'd have to try them side by side but to me this is virtually identical to their and espresso beans quick look at the ground coffee as you can see very dark it's almost black and brown in there and it's clumping together slightly because of the oiliness of the beans and when ground there's not much difference really maybe a slight floral hint there but it's relatively smooth and surprisingly there's no real bite to it after grinding it seems there was more to this one and prior to grinding it from the beans themselves so taste wise it's strong and smoky with a nice sweet caramel hint and it's instantly recognizable as a starbucks coffee i would say it's quite smooth for the starbucks but if you're not accustomed to starbucks you may find it too strong and a bit harsh and even for me this is sort of low quantities or the single espresso in my coffee as it's so strong and plus i'll try and get the extra out of it um and get me money's worth out of the reduced 190 gram bag by drinking a single espresso in my coffee it's excellent for those milk based drinks as the milk doesn't dilute the taste and the milk seems to add a more nutty dimension to it it's really full bodied with no acidity but the bitterness is quite high with this one it's a coffee that i really liked and if you like a super strong coffee this may be one for you so i'll give it a score of 3.5 out of five not as seasonal as i was expecting but it's a coffee that i would really like to drink over the christmas period as the aroma of this one is really pungent and fills the house with its sweet smoky aroma but if you like a more delicate coffee this won't be for you i'd recommend it i'm just a bit disappointed with the price and the bag size of 190 grams which was a bit of a let down for me so yeah i'd really like to hear from anyone who's tried this coffee or any of the other starbucks coffees let me know your thoughts in the comments section below if you like this video give it a thumbs up and if you want to see more coffee reviews in the future subscribe to my channel that was my quick review thanks for watching bye for now [Music] so [Music] you", "DfsUn4uwWss": "This is scary. Welcome guys. Hello. And congratulations, you made it\nthrough the first week. Yay, girl. Awesome. However, don't get comfortable\nbecause in this war, you must be ready\nfor anything. Oh, shit. Only one of you\nwill earn $100,000, a feature in Inked magazine\nand the title of Ink Master. Last week, it was up\nto all of you to come together as a team, but everyone knows, an army is\nonly as strong as it's leader. What does that mean? Got me, man. Who better to lead you into battle\nthan experienced veterans. Oh, shit. Week after week,\nsome of the fiercest male and female artist\nwill return to coach each team. Who the ... is it? I'm ecstatic that we get\na coach. We need a sound person\nto help unite us. Who do you guys think it is? I don't need a coach,\nI'm here to prove my ability as a tattoo artist,\nnot as a student. This week, you'll be coached\nby two Ink Master heavy hitters. He won season three\nand she won season eight. Seriously. Joey Hamilton and Ryan Ashley. Oh my God, I'm so excited. Welcome back guys. Thanks Dave.\nThank you. I hate losing, I'm a very\ncompetitive person. I won my season,\nI never went to the bottom. So, I want to keep\nthat streak going. I'm excited, I'm nervous,\nbut I'm definitely ready. I'm always ready. Coaches, you're here to lead\nyour teams into victory. Your job is to save your\nentire team from elimination. If you're able to keep\nyour team intact, you'll move on to compete\nin the Clash of the Coaches face-off, at the finale,\nfor $25,000 of your own. Nice.\nWhat? I was willing to come in\nand coach just as a good deed, but if you're putting money\non the line I'm definitely in. But, there is something else\nthat all of you should know. I'm scared. To defeat the enemy,\nyou must know the enemy. So, artists, you'll be coached\nby the opposite sex. This is going to be good. Joey will coach the women's team and Ryan will coach\nthe men's team. This could not be better. The female energy that were now\ngoing to have within our team is a voice of reason\nand for some of us in this team, we definitely need that. Go ahead and join your teams. Joey is about to step\ninto a group of nine strong, opinionated female artists.\nGood luck with that. All right guys, this week\nwe're testing shading. Shading is when you use\na gradient from dark to light and it brings\nour dimension in pieces. For this Flash Challenge, you must create\na masterpiece bean by bean. That's a lot of work. Using nothing but 450 pounds\nof coffee beans roasted\nto different shades, each team must create\na work of art on a 8 foot by 12 foot canvas. Good thing we had\na lot of coffee today. How do you create smooth\nshading with beans? You now the nest part of waking\nup is not this Flash Challenge. Fail and your fate will be\nin your opponents hands. We got this. It's going to take every single\nmember of your team to make sure you cover\nthis canvas with a huge dynamic design. Needs to be legible, needs\nto be visible from a distance. Today you guys have an advantage because you guys have coaches\nthat have been here, they've won, they've taken it\nall the way to the finale and cashed the big check. They know\nwhat we're looking for, so listen to your coaches. Win this Flash Challenge\nand your team will have the power to assign\nall the human canvases in the elimination tattoo, which your coaches will tell you\nis a massive advantage. Very true. You have six hours\nand your time starts now. All right ladies, first thing, come up with a couple ideas\non what to do. We have to show shading. It should be something simple. One of the craziest things\nabout these Flash Challenge's is they force people\nto think in a different way. We have to do something that\nnot only technically impressive, we have to do something\nthat shows are creativity. What we're looking for\nis these people to be able to turn on their creativity switch\nand do something amazing. There's a lot of people\nand doing this group shit is really difficult when there's\nso many creative minds. This is my two cents, is I would\ndo landscape where you'd have trees\nin the front, do the middle ground\nand the background. A lot of high contrast maybe. I don't want to sound nerdy,\nbut I took a class in Dutch landscaping in the Baroque Age. I know that's super specific\nand weird, but it think\nI can draw something. It's definitely nerve-wracking\ntrying to coach these women. I've never met them. Do you want to put a second tree\nright here? Yeah, we can pull it off\nfor sure. The skinnier ones further back\nand then as they get bigger. We are dividing\nthe tasks equally. Some people are drawing,\nsome of the ladies are just smashing the shit\nout of those beans. Anybody want to do\nsome recon real quick? What do you mean?\nJust go see what they're doing. Ash, you're good at that,\njust go be cute. No. I just can't believe that my\nfate is in these women's hands. I have no clue\nhow good they are. Man, I just hope\nthey can step up. Okay, this is why having a guy\non our team's helpful. Thank God we have a man here. I believe we should do\na nice landscape with water. I say a little beach\ntype of thing. You boys are pretty indecisive. Can we do both?\nCan we do a shoreline? They're all good ideas,\nyou just have to decide on one. Oh my God, obviously the men\nare having a problem with commitment.\nJust pick one and go with it. Okay boys,\nhere's what we're doing. A, B? Castle, I like the castle a lot. Castle. I like A. A, castle? We're doing a castle. Okay. I'm not sure what this is,\nso you guys know. Hey you guys,\ndid you hear this idea? There's water, so we can make\nsome of the beans into paint. Shouldn't the background\nbe smoothest, so turning the beans\ninto paint for the background would create that smoothness. But the backgrounds a sky right? Yes. Okay, but we've already\ngot part of the sky on there. That's why we didn't want\nto rush to putting that. I'm just already feeling\nlike our team is failing\non working together. We're trying attack\nthe darkest parts right now, so it's not like\neveryone's running around with their heads cut off. I'm pretty pissed. My team is not listening\nto me right now. Everyone is just\ngluing beans randomly. Yay, it looks like trees. I think they're a little\ntoo close together. Well, these are the trees\nup front, so you want them to be\na little bit cluttered together. I just think it looks a little\nlike this, that's all, but you guys got it. So negative. Dude, we're\nkicking ass right now. We're cruising. I'm going to snap\nsomebody's neck today. Nobody wants listen to me. Four hours to go guys,\nfour more hours. Crushing beans. Crushing beans, yeah baby. You guys have to remember\nwhile you're doing it, make sure the tape\nis on the outside. We're taking the time to measure\nthis whole thing out, grid it correctly. That could be a risk.\nThese girls are already going. We might not finish at all and\nthat could really ... us over. We got to pick up the pace\na little bit. Like grade school\nall over again. I see absolutely nobody\neven trying to listen to me. Exactly. That shit all has to be crushed of these whole ones\nare sticking. That's what I ...\nsaid for the past 20 minutes. I am agreeing 100%. Thank you. One hour left,\none hour remaining. All right lift it up. Keep going towards you,\ntoward you, right there. That's cool. Is that what it does? Shit's going to fall off. Try not to jiggle it to much. Oh shit, Jesus. Look at all of our hard work\non the floor. Five, four, three, two, one,\nthat's it, time is up. It stayed. Good job guys ... killing it. I'm never drinking coffee again. All right, it is time\nto critique your work. Let's start\nwith the men's team. I think it's a really smart move\nto do something with the forced perspective. Showing depth and the shading\nreally helps pull that together. Your darkest, richest tones\nare your strengths here. The foreground richness\nin comparison to your dead center\nhorizon line, where you have that richness\nof the mountain scape gives a nice boundary\nto the whole piece. Without that little trick\nthey did with the white lines, they're piece would be\na lot less legible. I think it showed quite a bit\nof planning that it took for us. That shows a lot more skill\nthan just some random shading. Oh, boys. All right, women's team,\nyou're up next. Well ladies, you also did\na really great piece. You used the coffee beans\nin this painterly style, and you leave that little arc\nof light through the water, gives you that sense\nof warmth and sunshine. You get a lot\nof different tones. In the mountains, they show\nwhich side is being hit by the sun,\nthat's pretty cool. It's going to be\na tough call today.", "EXPpz20wodc": "hey everyone Joe here from thrive cuisine calm and today I've got my nutribullet pro 900 and I've got some coffee beans and we're gonna put this thing to the test and see how it does grinding these coffee beans and also I'm gonna try and do it in two different levels of fineness so I'm gonna do a coarse grind for a French press and then a really thin grind that you use in a drip coffee machine so let's get started alright so first step is I'm gonna take the nutribullet cup take the coffee grinds and I'm gonna fill it about halfway maybe a little more just cuz I want to give it enough room for the blades to spin around and catch all the coffee grind without them getting stuck on the sides I'm gonna screw the top on and I'm gonna try and use the pulse function of the nutribullet it doesn't technically have a pulse button but if you push down it'll do a quick pulse and you don't have to lock it in so let me plug this in real quick I'm gonna try and do that coarse grind first and then move on to the fine I locked it in accidentally alright so it took about three pulses and yeah I got a pretty decent coarse grind that I think I would put this in my French press honestly it doesn't didn't do too much worse of a job than my coffee grinder overall it's pretty coarse bring it closer to you guys can see it so you guys can see they'll also put a picture and now let's see how fine we can get it all right there you go perfect for drip coffee that was actually a lot easier than I had expected I'd never actually put this to the test in my nutribullet hey I know you I didn't give you guys a great look there when I had the camera facing the blender so I wanted to give him more close-up look at the finest level of the coffee probably get it a little more fine actually I don't know that's that's pretty close to a powder but I just wanted to give you guys a close-up of what it looks like all righty going as you can see it does a really good job it was super easy and the blades I have to say weren't hard to clean after I've just tapped him off into the garbage can and then used my kitchen hose on the sink to spray it clean so if you guys want to learn more about the nutribullet pro 900 and all nutribullets I'm gonna be leaving some links in the description so be sure to check those out and if you like this video be sure to hit the thumbs up and subscribe and let me know what you want to see me test next in any blender you", "TsNQPt9-ncc": "one of the biggest benefits of roasting coffee beans at home is the green beans last longer than roasted beans this begs the question however the green coffee beans spoil how long can you keep green coffee beans before they lose their freshness that's what I'll be looking at in today's video coffee beans are organic plant material after all and even after processing coffee beans still have about 10% moisture in them this means eventually coffee beans even green coffee beans will rot and decay however if you store them properly unroasted green coffee beans will last for one to two years now there are a lot of factors which impact your unroasted beans before they even reach your house how they're picked how the processed and how they're shipped can all impact their condition when you finally receive them this can impact both taste and storage times like most cargo around the world bags of coffee beans are packed in large metal shipping containers and sent by ship to their destination the metal housing of the container helps to prevent contamination from odours of other cargo but mistakes can happen from time to time often the bags used to ship unroasted coffee beans are made of burlap shipping coffee and burlap sacks storing them in burlap sacks for a long time can lead to a baggy taste even after roasting for this reason many coffee estates now use synthetic bags instead of burlap if you're being smelled musty or baggy when you get them talk to your supplier but let's suppose that you've avoided all of these dangers your beans didn't get stale from being too dried out during processing they don't smell like burlap and they didn't pick up any odors on the cargo-ship you have a perfect shipment of green unroasted coffee beans at your house how can you store them to ensure they stay fresh as long as possible the three main enemies of green beans are moisture heat and UV radiation so store your coffee beans in an airtight container in a cool dry place moisture and dampness will lead to rot and decay plastic bags glass jars or plastic containers all work to store unroasted beans provided they have an airtight seal this prevents the beans from picking up odors from other foods in your kitchen avoid direct sunlight because UV rays and higher temperatures will damage your beans if you follow these directions you can keep your beans for one to two years before you have to worry about them going bad I typically use 1 pound of coffee per week if you like me that means you'll go through about 50 to 55 pounds of coffee in a year coffee is very dense 55 pounds of coffee will fit easily in a one foot by one foot by 2 foot box so storage should not be a problem most people aren't gonna buy 50 pounds of coffee at once anyway so it's unlikely you'll need to store your unroasted beans for even a year let alone - I usually order a new supply of beans every 4 months to freeze or not to freeze now some people argue that you should freeze your unroasted beans to preserve the freshness this is a question that coffee fans definitely have an opinion on and the same arguments for and against freezing unroasted beans apply to roasted beans there are two potential pitfalls associated with freezing unroasted coffee beans first the beans might absorb odors from other foods in your freezer this will change the taste of the beans once they're roasted second the moisture in the beans can freeze this will change how the roasting process works because the moisture will have to thaw before the beans can dry out in the roaster I don't know about you but I have more pantry space than freezer space so I like to reserve my freezer space for foods that will spoil far quicker than unroasted coffee beans as i've said they'll stay good for a year or two in your pantry there's no real need to freeze them but if you want to give it a try go for it thanks for watching you can find lots more tips about roasting your own coffee at my website roasted grounds calm", "AN73N3JmaUU": "hi guys Chris from recycling just a quick video about coffee grounds I have done a worm test on them a little while back and I'll put a link in this video but this one's really just to show you how I collect them how they come from the bakery there's seven bags here which represents about a week's worth of coffee at a local bakery I'll just run you through what I do with them and how I distribute them to various worm farms and spots in my garden so I use this little crate which has openings at the bottom to work here really nice size as a sieve and I've just cut the top off one of these bags here so I tip it in so we've had to do this one-handed I emptied the bags in just mainly because the bakery aren't very well trained with regards to other things going in the coffee grounds there's often cigarette butts in little plastic containers and foil packets English breakfast tea that one was so these aren't going to break down that's foil lined so I need to see if these out before they go into the worm farm or compost bin otherwise it just creates a lot of liter that's just a little receipt or a note that would probably break down there's often tea bags in here as well which are generally leaving but I see be at the rubbish to give me buckets full of nice clean coffee grounds I break up the clumps as well and when I'm running in through the sieve here I just use a bit of wood to break up these these lumps so then we have the buckets of coffee grounds and I distributed regularly to various wind farms I've got also layers and compost bins and I recently put a fairly thick layer along the garden area that I wanted to keep the weeds down and then mulched it so I'll do a video on that at some stage as well so I've just saved this one and as I mentioned there's all sorts of rubbish goes in here I suppose sticks little plastic containers are not turned out what they were maybe Jim or Vegemite single serves at the bakery are not sure and even a latex glove so I need to get those out otherwise though my compost bins and worm farms will start resemble a refuse dump and as I said I'll just use a bit of wood here in these last three pretty easily and that gives me your nice bucket full of clean coffee grounds so this garden beds just had a bit of a revamp it's been used as a testing station for all sorts of things but it's time to give it a good good dig over and the last test was quite a while ago and the worms have moved moved on there's still a few in here but we're getting beautiful depth to the soil here and lots of worm castings incorporated there's quite a bit of fibrous roots here which is one of the reasons I've dug it over is it it's becoming very fertile and any nearby Plains recognise that and they're sending fibrous roots into here so it's time to give it a dig over freshen it up and now all top dress it with a good thick layer of these coffee grams and keep it damp put the carpet back on and in a matter of a week or two worms we'll be right back into this bed and having a feast so I've put two full buckets full to the top they were over coffee grounds spread around on this bed and I reckon that's probably two inches thick so that'll really inject some nitrogen into this spot and I'll keep it damp it'll take quite a while for the worms to get back in and and demolish this lot but this garden beds sort of on its resting phase and this will just re-energizes nitrogen in the worm castings so I won't check back here and as far as this video goes if you want to have a look here with worms get into a good thick layer of coffee grounds check the link in the top right hand corner in the mean time this is how I process some of the grounds I'll get from the bakery both in the garden bed and also I'll do a layer in a compost bin shortly here's another garden bed I've got here that's due for a rest this area here I've just pulled out some pumpkin bushes that had finished fruiting we got a good crop of pumpkins and I've put a lot more of these coffee grounds here but I've also done a layer of shredded paper underneath so what that's going to give me is it would weed suppression and it will rock down and eventually the wounds will get into it now I should have mentioned a thick layer of coffee grounds being a nitrogen source will actually heat up so you're never going to get worms into it straight away it needs to heat up cool down it'll start to go moldy and in the wounds will start getting in there but this primary aim of this spot is to keep this garden bed neat until I need it again I'm not even going to mulch over the top of this I have further down I've put some carpet underlay further down but I'm gonna leave this as it is and the coffee grounds will probably form a bit of a hard crust which should give me a barrier for weeds until I'm ready to dig it over and do something else in the meantime the strawberries down they look like they're creeping this way so they might enjoy it after oil - and another destination for coffee grounds just before I go is in my compost bins and this bin has had some a while back and you can see that there's also been some shredded paper in here but the coffee grounds once they break down and they've cooled down really become a had an attraction to the worms so this is compost bin I've actually just left for a while it's cooled down there's no activity as far as heat goes and there's some grass clippings as well in here but it's it's turning into beautiful soil so that's the final yeast from all the other years for coffee grounds that I collect I do layers in my compost bins and really it's a fantastic resource just call in to any coffee shop or bakery nearby and I'm sure they'll be only too happy to let you collect them before I started collecting from here they used to put them straight in the Skip pin every every day so I'm saving landfill and I'm tapping into this great resource for my garden ok thanks for watching we'll do some more worm food tests soon so keep an eye on my channel if you're interested in that sort of thing", "5xGNp_bcfFE": "Arabica reboost uh how'd we get here I am amber here in front of our coffee tasting experience in Alderwood mall and I'm here to talk to you about Arabica and robusta coffee beans rabbika and reboost are just two species of coffee plants and within those two species there are thousands of varietals that all thrive in the southern hemisphere between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn or the coffee belt coffee in general originates from East Africa but the Arabica bean itself hails from Western Ethiopia where you can find thousands of varietals of Arabica coffee the Arabica bean being the most enjoyable likely due to its higher sugar and fat content has been transported all over the world and cultivated to create new varietals with more desirable flavor profiles you can now buy delicious Arabica beans with widely varying flavor profiles from all across the tropics area they're a booster beam with its less desirable flavor profile was left behind in Africa sadly this type of bean has historically given African coffee a bad rap because of its bitter flavor despite the many delicious Arabica varietals that can be found on the continent but the reason that or booster coffee is more bitter is that it has about double the caffeine content of Arabica beans and caffeine itself is bitter in nature there are however a few upsides to reboost two coffees they're much easier to farm they grow at lower elevations produce considerably more fruit / trees and Arabica plants with a shorter maturity time and they are less susceptible to disease and pest infestation all this making them much cheaper to buy some Roasters still use them in their espresso blends because they make a nice long-lasting crema likely due to having a lower oil content than Arabica beans so what do you guys think do you have a particular region you like to buy coffee from let us know in the comments down below once again this is amber this has been coffee on the brain see you next week don't forget to subscribe", "MU8xZgfYRLw": "I have an idea. Coffee grinder is broken. Yeah? You want me to stomp on some grinds? Yeah, or we'll throw some beans in a Vitamix container and see what happens. Let's do it! [music] Okay, so quick debrief. Dogs are barking. Babies are crying. Construction everywhere. Beyond that. Need coffee. We have coffee. Burr grinder was broken and we used the dry grains container to make coffee grinds which we've never done which is so weird because it's like what it's made for. Because freshly ground coffee is better than ground coffee that you ground at the grocery store a week or two or three ago. That's the important point here. Or a bag of ground coffee that was ground like a month ago in a factory. Let's try this coffee It's good. As good? Nope. But it's better than whatever I had yesterday, which was out of a Keurig.

your coffee sealed away from light air and moisture that works towards breaking down the original freshness of your roasted coffee yet still allowing for that natural co2 of the beans to escape the containers so your coffee rests and it's at its peak when you're ready to enjoy it the freeze comes in a 16 ounce size which holds approximately 750 grams of beans or ground coffee and there are three styles to choose from you have your black red and brushed silver if you're wanting to shop either of these freeze you can head up to the product page in this link up above the containers are made from stainless steel which does resist staining on the inside and odor retention the other materials used being bpa-free plastics in the lid and the seal the lid contains the freeze freshness valve which is a one-way valve that vents away trapped co2 gases whilst preventing fresh air and moisture from getting in now freeze recommend changing out these valves every two months and thankfully they include a full 12 months replacement seals with every freeze purchased and they also have a handy bean scoop which will measure out eight grams of beans you can find a further one-year supply of these seals in this product link up above there is included a rotating wheel on the top of the lid you can set as a reminder date to replace your valve although it's not an automatic reminder and you can't set it to the month it still acts as a timely reminder to replace your valves to ensure a functioning seal the pool latch on the lid does always establish a good solid seal but i would occasionally wipe the seals down on the lid to avoid any build up and hand wash the inside of the container to keep it sparkling clean now to replace the freeze freshness valve simply push the valve from the inside of the lid until the date wheel and the valve pop out from the top of the lid and then seat the new seal in place with the date wheel on top press it back together and you're done for another two months freeze coffee storage canisters are reusable they're refillable and they're simple yet an ideal solution for storing ground coffee as well as whole beans and any perishable goods really locking in the freshness so you enjoy the very best of your coffee so if you have any questions on the freeze containers throw them in the comment section below and we'll get straight back to you

gets weakened some of us like I have no idea when you put an egg into boiling out water what happens it gets hardened by its environment so often we allow our environments to cause us to get hardened hardened hearts bitterness angry so off we get weakened by our environments but when you put that coffee bean into hot water what happens magic I love that transformation magic the bean by the way even if it's not ground up within an hour we'll actually make coffee it's not impacted by its environment instead the coffee bean transforms its environment so imagine we're driving our energy bus forward we got this coffee bean in our hand reminding us that we don't create our world outside and we create it inside out and every moment every opportunity every club every kid we can transform from the power that is inside of us that's where the power lies never think your circumstances to find you they do not you define your circumstances by your beliefs by your faith by your optimism by your vision by your purpose by your love and everything we just talked about the power is on the inside so let's go out there together and transform this world every club every kid every day from the inside out thank you so much", "wH8m3EEHJUw": "[Music] in this video I'm going to show you how a draw a coffee bean and paint it in watercolor I also use a little bit of waterproof ink so if you're interested in seeing how I do that then keep on watching so I'm starting off with a pencil drawing in my sketchbook I think in previous videos it kind of speed through the drawing portion sometimes because I'm always more excited about the painting portion myself but I thought I would kind of show you more of this step this time so I'm just kind of starting it with one half of the beans shape and then drawing in the areas where the bean splits and then adding in the other half and I think the best way to go about drawing is just starting off with the bigger basic shapes and then adding in the detail as you go now I'm going over the drawing with waterproof ink I'm using the pigma micron pen and I think point to five millimeters you now I mixing up some colors for the coffee bean and I always use more than just one tone of the main color so I'm as you can see here mixing up quite a few different shades of brown some are reddish some are more of a darker brown gray tone so it's great to just have a look and try and use your x-ray vision when you're looking at a reference photo to see what underlying colors are in the photo and in this case I'm actually adding some purple into my Browns but I think that will look good for the dimension of this illustration now I'm starting the painting process and I started this off with wet and wet so that means I wet the paper with clean water and then I drop in the watercolor if you want to see more detailed examples of this I have some full-length classes on Skillshare comm and you can find a link to my profile and classes in the description of this video below and I go through things step by step real time in much more detail now I'm adding in some darker spots to the coffee bean I can see in the picture that I'm working from that these are kind of almost like blemishes on the bean so I'm going to add those in early on so I can get the contrast levels right you now I'm laying the water in on the other side of the beams I'm just using clean clear tap water to lay this in making it nice and smooth making sure if out the water right in the lines and then I will be ready to drop in the first layer of paint you adding some detail on the edge and some darker spots on the other side as well you just adding the first layers of color into the center of the beam now I've started with a really light straw light color and adding in a bit more definition with a darker Brown you now I'm starting to work on wet on dry painting meaning I'm taking fairly wet paint and dropping it onto dry paper and using my brush to make some texture and then I will wet my brush and soften out the marks a little you now I'm adding more color to the other side of the beam and I'm really trying to get those edges where the beam kind of rolls into the center that are nice and dark to create some death now I've started using a little bit of a red redder toned brown just to create more interest and I'm going over the dark little cracked areas with a smaller brush you I'm using my tiniest brush to make even more detail in the center of the beam you but I'm getting closer to being finished painting and making lots of little wet on dry marks and then I'm using a larger softer brush that's stamped to soften them out quickly after I make them so that they don't set in too quickly you now I'm going around and making sure I get the darkest areas of the being nice and dark to create more contrast you and now I'm just defining the edge more but I'm leaving a little bit of space against the extreme edge of the beam and this is to indicate reflected light you so again I'm using my think it's a triple or double zero brush just to make tiny little dark marks to create more contrast and final you I'm using a larger softer brush with a very thin watery wash of brown to kind of go over the beam and unify the color and texture but making sure that I keep the lightest highlights clear from pigment you and now I'm just tidying up the edges a little bit now just adding in the last tiny little details thanks so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed this video please give it a thumbs up and I will post another new video next

and got this out of Tesco normally retails for three pound fifty bought em I waited until it went on offer the do tend to go on offer quite often in the Starbucks coffees for a pound less at two pounds fifty so I waited until the scene then at that place I don't think it's been a very long though this coffee am I think I may be seeing it a week or so ago and I was looking at it thinking maybe I'll buy but I did wait as I say until it went on off there so let's take a look at a bag this is whole beans let's say Starbuck Blanc Starbucks blonde roast smooth and sweet notes whole being a hundred percent of rabbika coffee contact information therefore Starbucks at the bottom flavor lock bag or something special about the back and on the back of the pack it says it's in a lot of different languages most of this bag so we say blue great coffee grind beans for your brewing method use cold filtered water store coffee and an airtight opaque container packaged in a protective atmosphere contact information and this is 200 grams this part Starbucks whole bean coffee it's just the state and the obvious I'm repeating the same thing over and over again so there we go take a look at the best before they something that is on the side of the pot somewhere says here best before there's no date there so people up on the side of the pack it says blonde dog smooth and sweet know once again just repeating the same thing Starbucks folks each coffee requires a slip slightly different rose to reach its peak of a roll met acidity body and flavor we classify our coffees and freeload profiles so find in your favorites is easy this is blonde and we do medium and dark as well a bit of information the story of Starbucks blonde espresso nearly five decades of sourcing blending and roasting laughter's here a second espresso that's bold boldly mellow this special blend of beans from Latin America was carefully roasted to cope salt sweet vibrant notes soft and balanced it pairs well with milk meeting making classic espresso drinks extra smooth revolves a roast the edge and that rocks the edge is what I tend to like aim above Starbucks and all a lot of people being fanciful there we go let's see implying this past before they was a cannot see it our where we go the 14th of October 2019 so what's that about six months the goal on the best before dates on this one well that's not very long really and that is it for the park take a look at the beans not what you'd expect from their Starbucks coffee I was expecting great things when he opened the bug because I am a fan of Starbucks dark roast but this is very different from any star walks have tried before the aroma is woody and slightly spicy it's sweet and slightly fruity and it's definitely not your normal dark roast this smells similar to our light or medium roast to me and more good quality looking beans anyway I just like to know what part of Latin America they come from raveling should say Latinamerica quick look at the ground coffee quite light say it's more medium actually than our light it's got a sort of reddish orange lot to it and when ground it's sweet and more vibrant with a rich bite to it there we go mm-hmm so taste wise it's a really nice smooth sweet coffee and creamy almost it's slightly woody or earthy where the hints of toffee caramel and chocolate on a very slight fruitiness that I was picking up intermittently I do like Starbucks dark roasts with the sweet oiliness but they do have detractors who say they are burns beings which I would agree with to a degree but I wouldn't say that's unpleasant in their case and anyway these are totally different from any Starbucks have tried before and this will please the people who say they produce Bhim Coffee this is a light roast in comparison and there is a nice taste from the beans rather than the roast given the majority of the flavor it's a good addition to the Starbucks line of coffees as it is a complete 360 to what they normally do but this is definitely on a par with those dark roasts and it's a bit better than supermarket quality I would say and it gets that four out of five from me so definitely recommended especially if you can get it on offer around the two-pound 50 mark so I'd really like to hear from anyone who's tried this coffee or any of the other Starbucks coffees let me know your thoughts in the comment section below if you like this video give it a thumbs up and if you want to see more coffee reviews in the future subscribe to my channel that was my quick review thanks for watching bye for now [Music] [Music]", "HmliFFOGGxo": "we got man julie is waiting for us hello julie and i hope you guys are having a wonderful morning uh if you're new to the channel my name is hun my channel is all about making better coffee at home i mean i just want a better coffee i don't need great coffee i just want to make some better coffee every morning okay so let's see i'm gonna shout out to mr thomas he's online as well okay so this morning let's talk about some beans okay so as you can see from here i have a whole bunch of beans so i got starbucks beans i might one of my favorite good brothers beans and so this one i had for a while it's from uh let's say puerto rico boldachi beans and then we got some beans from california as well let's see here and so this is also beans from guatemala as well but here's thing about the beans whatever you guys watching like instagram or youtube channels and then you know people makes wonderful espresso and not that many times people talk about the beans okay and we talk about the grinder size a lot we talked about uh what else like brew ratio and we talked about like blue temperature and but thing is again the the reason i think i know why we don't talk about beans because beans are very subjective okay you and i have different taste then you know i mean your taste versus my tastes are completely different it's all subjective that's but comes to like ratio blue temperature that's pretty much constant that's pretty much standard but here here's thing about the beans okay we know the difference between starbucks beans versus like freshly roasted beans okay because i know most of you out there just bought this i just bought a new espresso machine for the christmas or holidays and i know some of you are really frustrated with it uh dialing in beans okay i know let's see someone sent me i think a lot of you sent me a message recently the last couple days they're having a really hard time and then one person told me i cannot pronounce uh that person's name and but that person just bought a bristol express two weeks ago and using starbucks coffee okay a starbucks french roast and then told me that always bitter taste so what so this morning what i'm gonna do is i have starbucks coffee it's got house blend and so their roast even though it's a medium roast it's more like dark roast so you know what let me show you first part okay on my video and let's try the diet in starbucks coffee and then after that i'm gonna dial then let's start in like you know freshly roasted coffee beans i think i have a brand new bag open already uh good brother so let's try the difference between the freshly roasted coffee beans versus kind of like starbucks or like store-bought beans and i'm going to show you the different i don't want to say technique but you're going to see the shots okay you are going to see the shot quality and let's see let's get going by the way so if you are new to the channel i just uh recently uh i got a loaner from my friend of mine the arrestor leo v uh s24 that's a dual exchange uh not the dual motion but the heat exchange machine and i used it for a while and i actually i returned it yesterday and the reason is i prefer to use you might be surprised but i prefer to use uh this machine the brush express machine then the heat exchange because that motion was so old okay and the all the quality wasn't there but um so anyway uh let's dial this one in okay dial the starbucks beans first so let's see you know what i'm i'm just going to use my built-in grinder okay because i know most of you out there you don't have separate grinder like niche or any other separate grinder so let's start with a built-in grinder if you don't have scale spend 10 bucks and just get a scale is really easy to start dialing in your process actually you know what hold on a second i'm not going to use my scale this morning because i i remember one of my viewers asked me i don't have a scale can i pull the shot without using scale so you know what let's do that okay i'm just going to put some beans in [Applause] you know i'm going to put 20 gram in it okay hold on i change my mind i'm just going to put 20 grime in but i'm not going to do anything i'm not going to measure out i'm just going to just simply put 20 gram in and let me show you why i'm doing this 24 gram okay even though this is the medium roast according to starbucks it's more like dark okay so if you guys like kind of like dark roast go with the starbucks medium roast i mean but if you go to french roast it's going to really burn taste so you're not going to get a good shot anyway okay i'm just going to put some beans in okay so whatever you set the diet amount you have couple options okay you're going to have a three o'clock four o'clock three four five six and i usually set at four o'clock so this morning i'm just go i'm not going to use my dosing funnel i'm just i'm just gonna straight just using my portafilter only this time because i know if you are new to the barista express most likely you don't have this one yet so okay so let's get going here so i set a number four and i'd like to just shake it so you're gonna have about this much beans in okay usually four o'clock and sometimes overflow as well but don't worry about it you just just go like this just clean it like this with your thumb i'm not gonna use dosing corner this time go like this okay and then just tap it yes the reason why i'm not using dosing funnel this morning i'm just trying to show you guys if you are new to the barista express you don't have a dosing funnel right now so and most likely you don't even have distribution tool either so i'm not going to use that so i'm just going to make coffee i mean from the box okay only thing i'm going to use the just the tamper okay i'm just going to give it a good temp okay and then so comes the grinder setting for i just use number six outside internal number five okay if it does something means anything to you if you're new to the bravo uh just always i just said around the middle section you know between six and eight so let's score the number six for now and then let's put the shot okay i'm just gonna just give it a quick rinse just gonna lock it in the fact is most of it you don't even have scale so you're not gonna even measure either so okay so that's what i'm gonna do i'm just going to just use like you just got this okay and most likely hopefully you have some cup okay and then let's give it a go okay so so this is a double shot so i'm just going to put the double shot button okay guess what good pressure shot looks terrible okay i'm just again pressure is good there's no whole lot of creme out there you know what hold on that looks like some creme on the top it's not too bad isn't it yeah i mean oh i mean appears to be a pretty good shot yeah but it is seems fast but again you guys saw the the gauge there i mean that's free i'm okay with that pressure okay so now you put a shot that and we are going to taste i'm really anxious to find out what this one tastes like okay just make sure stir it with your spoon cheers okay first of all it's bitter okay uh it seems like very bitter taste and seems very over extracted but as you saw the bean easter the gauge there it seems really fast as well okay so if what i'm trying to say is it is all about the beans so so this one is really good for i say i just want to make some good black coffee okay but this one is not good for just drink as espresso because the quality is not there so what i'm going to do is i'm going to make myself americano on this one i'm just going to get my hot water right here [Applause] okay so this is also a great thing about bristol express give you a high water faucet my rent julia serbia does not have that so okay so this actually this is called long black so long black is hot water and so put the espresso over hot water so something like this cheers okay so if you guys just looking for just the black coffee having a good black coffee just you know get out the door this is just fine okay it's perfect i mean but if you want to have a good espresso this is not the one i mean i have to say but unfortunately if you want good espresso this is not the one you want to make in the morning but black coffee or latte be perfect drink okay so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to use a fresh beans okay and i'm going to use our other tools available okay so now so so this setup is like you just bought the machine you just want to make some coffee so now you've been using it for a couple weeks you know what i think i want to use some tools so i got myself a 3d dosing funnel maybe some you know distribution tool okay so let's use that this time with the copper rim who made that okay somebody asked me where do i get oh so this one is okay i know some of you bought this okay from amazon the jonathan is the owner of the company and then so so this is this is kind of like his proto model on a proto model so when he designed the dosing funnel so this is just the plain white he just adds the copper color that's it so they are pretty much the identical as the other ones okay so this time what i'm going to do is i'm going to use some couple tools and that this time i'm going to use a fresh beans okay so this is the fresh beans from guatemala good brothers coffee as well so let's give it a try so now uh i have older beans in there as well i'm i need to discard it so i'm just going to get all the beans out first okay again so i mean so this is part of the process whenever you switch out the beans if you don't do single dosing just make sure uh discard all your beans first okay yes i do have another dosing funnel as well okay okay so this time again you've been using bristol express for a while and that you you are getting liking it and that i want some tools so you just bought let's say dosing funnel some scale what else some distribution tool okay it doesn't have to be san antonio industry just any distribution tool i'm going to put all i'll link down below as well okay so at this point linda says so with good brothers my first dial-in should start at seven enter at five okay so uh linda asked me what's the good dial the the grinder setting for like let's say fresh beans like good brothers doesn't matter uh any fresh beans and i start with the mirror okay just like right now i'm going to start with just like the starbucks i'm going to set a number six for me for now and the inner bar at number five okay so so once you set a starting point so that's kind of like your go-to setting for that beans okay and you're going to start up or down adjustment there okay so even though i flush out all the beans and i still have some beans stuck in between i'm just going to give you a handful of beans go through the machine and then so this technique i you know a lot of viewers told me to uh do it just put the take the top go like this create a kind of like vacuum kind of vacuum funnel so now i got all the beans out so now i my older beans are completely gone and i got some new beans so we are good i'm just gonna flush out the juicing final cut is from primal coffee right dosing also dosing cup from crema dosing funnel from amazon okay okay so this time i'm going to just measure out i like to use about 17.5 gram for my uh my breast express it doesn't have to be okay it could be 17 grams it could be 18 gram but i happen to like 17.5 gram okay i'm just going to 17.5 okay hope you guys can see it there we go and then oh okay also by the way you see hold on i have to show you this i just removed my portal filter okay hopefully you guys can see it so this is what happens with uh if i'm using like uh store-bought beans you see there uh and then also my beans are stuck to the top hopefully you guys can see that but as you can see stuck okay the best way to remove that let me show you the technique okay watch this just simply just press single double button that's it and stop and puck's gonna fall out so that's the one technique so that's what happens when you are using like store-bought beans or uh beans is not that fresh so if it happens it's nothing wrong with the machine just simply bean is too old okay that's [Music] it you mean someone asked me about that i or just my grinder yes of course yeah i adjusted you know constantly okay i'm just gonna [Music] clean my pore filter here okay i mean making cup is somewhat messy okay this is messy hobby so just make sure i got my tower let me clean things up time to time all right i got my 17.5 gram this time i'm using my dosing funnel the reason why i like to use those in front is messy free [Music] okay [Music] okay i'm just i'm just going to tap it a few more times get all the beans out okay all right somebody asked can you do a video on how to recognize good roasted beans just by the look of it okay yeah someone asked me about how can you tell what good roasted beans look like uh i can't i can show you in about a few minutes okay hold on a second i'm just going to there since you just got the distribution tool let's imagine you did that and then just tip i mean as you can see you don't see any ground beans it's pretty clean that's why that's another thing i like dosing funner and those in cup i mean that's why i have both so it makes a lot life a little easier okay at this time the thing is i mean once you start making espresso and then you're starting to develop your taste and you're going you're going to start realize which ratio you guys like so 17 grams in like one to two ratio one to three ratios all depend on your taste and right now i really like the one to two ratio so 17 gram in like 17.5 gram in like 35 gram out so that's what i i like lately and then it comes to once you once you got that uh that place and then you want to start time your shot so between anytime between like 20 and 30 second range there i'm not that picky okay i got my scale set up i'm going to start time when uh for uh when i start the button okay so let's take a look at this shot close up here got my shot glass so [Music] i'm looking for 35 36 gram okay let's do okay 34 perfect even better okay around 40 seconds around like 38 39 seconds there as we can see you're gonna see very beautiful dark crema you know let's give it a try let's see here hold up [Applause] so for uh for the guatemala beans the tasting note was pretty simple you get chocolate a chocolate nutty and some lemon flavor cheers okay i need to stir this so this is one to two ratio here we go okay sweet the lemony flavor is much better okay it's really sweeter okay at this time this one i tasted the temperature wasn't uh i like them a little bit harder the temperature is not that hot okay it's good but it's not i want a little bit more hot okay and then actually with the bristol express you can change your temperature pretty easily so if you don't know how to do that check out my other videos as well but by the way anybody saw the james hoffman's video yesterday uh he talked about the broad temperature i know that's something we discussed last week as well but he did a fantastic video on blue temperature if you haven't seen it make sure to check it out as well okay he did really great great job on blue temperature and and the with bristol express uh mine set up at just a regular uh stock okay not the stock but the default temperature around 1 195 to 200 degree there but we don't know okay even though machine say it's 195 to 20 degree range but in reality this machine is not that consistent so isn't that vicinity okay so if you want to change your temperature let me show you quickly again uh shut your power off press your program button now right now i'm in default i'm gonna go plus two so that's single cup is plus two double cup is plus four uh filter size this button here is a minus two and minus four so now i change the temperature so i'm gonna put a shot next time it's gonna give you a more uh higher higher heat to brew my coffee beans let's see so again you are going to see the big difference between fresh coffee beans versus older beans like store-bought so watch this one so i'm going to remove my portafilter again stuck this time as well but everything is all nice and dry so that's kind of like you know you're being somewhat fresh all right i'm just going to flush out the oil beans okay so any question about beans okay hold on so someone asked me earlier how can you tell how can you tell the difference between fresh beans versus kind of like older beans hopefully i can show you guys i'm gonna set up my table here okay we got lucky this morning okay all right what oh right okay so let me show you the uh kind of like uneven starbucks beans okay hold on hold on check this out okay so this is starbucks beans if you see the good quality uh higher quality beans you're not gonna see these beans like broken up okay and then this is somewhat darker as well you see this so this is not uh yeah this is not evenly roasted either i mean it is roasted but somewhat burnt evenly it's a medium but yeah so this is not good okay it's not the beans you want to use regularly okay so i mean so this is kind of like tell you the quality of the beans so let's take a look at the let's say take a look at the freshly roasted beans okay so this one is the good brothers coffee i'm just going to show you guys a little bit as the different color as well and then you don't see any beans that are not broken up like starbucks does so you're going to see the different color as well so this is somewhat light kind of like a little lighter than starbucks and also drier as well it's somewhat oily it's somewhat oily and then so this is a little more dry so i mean that's kind of like you can tell kind of visually okay but the fact is you don't know that until you actually brew your coffee beans but meantime i mean you can usually tell you know somewhat visually okay again i'm not i'm not a coffee expert but what i know what way coffee looks i mean i can usually tell the the quality of the roasting okay because i mean if you go to like fresh roasted coffee beans and like specialty coffee shop you're not gonna see that okay you're not gonna see this yeah uneven size most times you usually uniform size as well so okay so look like we got some questions okay so let's take some questions so this is one part okay so dylan asked me a question quick pressure during extraction from the higher end of the gauge okay so dylan asking me what causes less pressure the higher end you know what during the extraction that's great question okay okay here's the thing about it so whenever i use my rental ear uh i do not lose any pressure okay they give me that solid you know the stream of shot but with reset express the problem with the uh bristol express something is consistency and i'm i i don't know the answer of that okay so if anybody knows the answer please leave me under comment okay it'd be great and then that's good to know would it be better to get the dosing cut first so you can flush the coffee before putting in pork someone asked me should i get the dosing cup or dosing funnel it's up to you okay so this is 35 from kramer coffee products so this is 30 from amazon 29 bucks okay the reason why okay actually the the problem is so let's say you are using the dosing cup you kind of fluffed it and then you just uh transferred to your pore filter like so and you have to fluff it again okay with the dosing cup endorsing funnel you can just flap it right inside and you're ready to go so i mean there's no right or wrong but i mean they're both great and i mean that's why i have both okay they're both fantastic so this one is really good for if you have a separate grinder at home let's see if you have a smart grinder or you have like you know other grinder just those out directly goes to you're a pore filter i mean that's really handy as well so this one is more versatile okay you can use so this this is a kind of like one trick pony this is it does only one thing but this one you do a lot of multiple you know way to use it so so i mean they're both gray but if i'm going to pick just one and if you only have bristol express only if you don't have a separate grinder i don't know i'm leaning towards the funnel but again you know they're both good so how do you reset the programming someone asked me how to reset the programming okay so earlier i just uh set program at plus two so let's say i wanna just wipe everything out okay hold down the power button okay i'm gonna hold down for like a couple seconds you're gonna hear all the beep noise watch this three beeps so now everything is all default setup so if i shut it off let's say i'm gonna change temperature so now you should see default temperature right now okay if it doesn't uh reset didn't work so watch this as you can see everything is reset so now the default temperature is set at default so just hold down the power button for like three seconds and then you're going to reset all your program method um do you change your ratio for lighter roasts or just temperature i tend to struggle with the lighter roast being acidic at one to two ratios okay so it comes to ratio for lighter roast uh looking at the james hoffman's video yesterday because the lighter roast you need more heat to extract it so you want to be like in a little harder and also you need to play with a different ratio as well so man that that's wonderful question so if you haven't played with the temperature on your bristol express that's really easy to do so i mean try that first okay maybe like try it maybe plus two and even plus four and then do the same ratio and if that does not work play with it maybe one to three ratio so you can just play with the different extraction and dosing amounts i mean they got a lot to it so make sure keep track whatever you want to change the variable change one at a time okay change one thing at a time so that case you can keep track of what you are doing dylan says to you have you seen the replacement steam dial lever on amazon he put a link below for you he said definitely a cool little mod for the barista okay someone asked me the steam the replacement steam dial i think one of my viewers sent me a while ago hold on maybe i can find this uh steam dial okay this 3d sim dial something like this okay i know crema makes the legit okay so this is not a crema product so this is some 3d dosing form from my viewer from singapore so what this one does just simply lock it in like this and this is this is become steam dial okay like so you know makes it easier but i think i really i really like the crema one the cream i want you actually have to install it so this one just pop it in it just pop up so easy but yeah i mean that's really nice touch okay anyway okay do you always have to change the temperature uh someone asked me do i have do you already has tension no i mean don't change temperature you know unless you you need to okay because that i'm tempted to just leave it you know personally i like to leave it like maybe plus two for maybe my lighter roast but 99 percent of time i live a star default temperature my burst setting is four and my grinder is four i use 18 grams of coffee beans with one to two ratio how much should my coffee weigh 36 grams okay someone asked me if you're using 18 grams what's my good ratio is going to be the ratio is all about the ratio is just the guideline okay just whatever you want to use if you want to use one to two 36 grime and if you like the taste of it go with it and if you don't like it if you think that's bitter or sour and you can start adjusting from there so again the ratio is not a set of stone that just is all is all up to you okay i mean that that's why you know this machine is really fun to use once you start getting into it you know you you start tweaking stuff and you're gonna have fun with it but if you don't like the tweaking stuff i'm just stick with the one setting you guys like just go with it do you have the brand victoria in america someone asked me is there a brand victoria uh i'm not sure i know i think a couple of vendors in u.s uh sell those machines the victoria again there's hundreds and different kind of express motions out there so once you go like above like 1500 range there your options are you have a lot more options under 1 000 range you only have a few options like barista express is one of them you've got guys at classic pro and rachel or serbia so about three good ones i mean that's something i recommend but over 1500 man just you know pick your pick your machine i mean that's you have great options does your barista express leak water from the storage tray mine is and the company said that is supposed to happen when you turn it on and pour a shot storage storage trade okay so okay so make sure i know people ask me when my motion is leaking the fact is your machine is leaking from so that is a wonderful question okay the looking from the back flush so here's what's gonna happen okay i'm gonna show you guys so the back flush is right underneath okay i mean if i touch it you got water coming out still okay that's why you have this water tray has a little hold up this water tray has a hole on it right there so so all the water is dry collecting in that that hole on the bristol express so so that is the hole yes so that's normal the you're going to have make sure your water trade is in properly and then you know you're not going to see any leak again yes it does happen all right we've got some do you recommend getting a bottom filter someone asked me do you recommend bottomless poly filter i mean they're wonderful tools okay i mean if you're planning on using it if for like a replacement of your filter you are going to you are going to have one heck of a time uh playing with it because it's messy okay i get about 50 50. 50 percent of i got a really beautiful shot and the other fifty percent of the time it's you know channeling everywhere and no i personally you buy as your tools just make sure your techniques down so tell you all your flaws okay flaws on your grinder size and all the fun stuff but that's why i don't use that often but again it's great tools okay i do have one and and i use it you know once in a while mike in san diego just bought a rocket apartment so shout out to mike from san diego he just bought a rocket apartmento that that's good motion uh what i what what grinder did you get with that because make sure it doesn't matter if you have a ten thousand dollar machine if you have a crappy grinder you're gonna get a crappy shot so you haven't it's slightly used he's wondering if anybody so mike okay so so mike has lightly used gaza classic pro if anybody interested make sure let mike know okay and uh mike make sure give uh our viewers good good price on it all right um what are your favorite beans right now so someone asked me what is my favorite this right now i really enjoying the sumatra lately okay so i roast my own smartright at at my shop as well as uh i'll be really enjoying the good brothers uh smile try as well by the way the there's a lot of coffee roasters out there so i mean just i mean if you can support your local coffee roasters and personally i like to support the like smaller coffee roaster like good brothers coffee is like the micro roaster okay they just uh roast you know one batch at a time you know not one batch but in a small order at a time so you are going to get the freshest coffee as possible but yeah just support your local coffee shop if you don't know anybody good brother's coffee is the good option and also let's see oh yeah what can you recommend what brand of coffee means to buy what brand of coffee beans to buy if you're at the store-bought i just said okay i mean i mean the coffee beans they've got thousands and thousands of coffee beans out there so it's all try okay try most of them if you want to buy from the store about make sure beans coffee beans the bag has the roasting date on it so this one does not have roasting day okay starbucks or even other coffee uh the retail i mean i'm talking about retail they don't have uh roasting data on it so if you can buy the bags with a uh roasting date i think only coffee i know has a roasting date is the uh pizza coffee from the store and the i know like stumptown has one that sometimes is more higher end of spectrum they're like 18 to 20 dollar range uh pizza coffee and starbucks are around 10 range there so all depends on what you like do you use pressurized baskets someone asked me do i use pressurized basket i don't i do not use pressurized baskets i always use a non-pressurized basket how often should you descale the machine okay someone asked me how often do i uh whenever this light comes on okay i do this scale so they got two kinds of light the blinking lights and the solid lights the blinking line light means a clingy cycle solid means d scale so whenever the light comes on just do the maintenance cycle just do the cleaning what skill do you recommend not too expensive what scale okay so what scale okay so this is scalar i've been using for the last couple years uh it's called g dealer from amazon i'm gonna put the link down below as well twelve dollars i think two hours fifteen bucks definitely worth it they're small and but i mean if you want to buy someone really nice scale obviously a kaya skier is way to go but this is like 250 bucks so i know unless you love that person but yeah but you know 10 15 scare is good enough their victoria coffee beans v-i-t-t-o-r-i-a okay he said they do make little capsule machines and make a good shot but they're no fun okay so so uh did i mention about the capsule machine i'm not a big fan of an automatic machine i know some of you out there really likes those uh kerag or you know one of those capsule machines but i mean i mean what's fun is that you know unless you just want a coffee and in and out just use the pressurized basket on this one okay once you use the pressurized baskets you don't have to worry about grinder setting much you're gonna get a good shot every time so i mean if you don't have to do mess with anything yeah pressurized basket um julie asked what good brother's flavor should i order today okay so julie asked me which uh good brother's coffee i mean if you like milk based drink go with the espress blend i mean any espress blend from any specialty shop very nutty and chocolaty okay so they're really good for their milk-based drink but if you want something different smartright is also good costa rica is also good as well guatemala so yeah yeah yeah so and mike you asked what grinder he has he has the eureka knot okay note so so mike has mike and san diego uh he has the eureka notice so eureka makes really good grinder they're they're using the flapper so entry level to you know high end so there's also a really good grinder as well if you're looking for good grinder check out eureka somebody asked espresso beans dark or light roast somebody asked me about express beans taco say espresso beans i mean depend on what you want to drink these are subjective and i mean if you like them like you know robust flavor go with it like medium to dark but don't ever go like french roast first of all the french roast is not a i think someone come up their name they're more like that's kind of like burnt you kind of like burn the beans that's why they're called french roast but correct me i'm wrong guys but yeah but i never go dark roast on my coffee beans i always medium is there a good coffee roasting machine you recommend someone asked me is there good coffee roasting machines uh i use b more okay i use a 1600 it's about 15 years old but a makes fantastic uh coffee beans as well i mean that i mean they're roast coffee beans i know let's see i know dane i know he's still there but dane owns a bmore 2200. he told me he just got that uh coffee coffee roaster so i used to use like popcorn popper and you know even skill skillet as well but yeah is that personally that's the best uh coffee roaster for home use for the price drew asks after getting the hang of dialing in i find that i have had to set my internal burst setting to 1 and my external to 2. that seems so extreme based on all my research do you think there's something off with my machine okay so drew mentions a drew uh he said he's an inner bar the okay the i think george mentioned to me yesterday the inner bird or upper bird for me is uh it's the same okay so the bird inside you can adjust it the jewelry has a number one okay that's pretty low and there the dial he said at number one three number two it's not okay it's not the machine because i mean that's just the grinder setting there so and i i don't know how long you had that machine i mean if you if you are using it for a long time you might want to replace the bird inside i mean if you just got that machine change the beans okay change out the beans make sure it might be the beans as well so there's a lot to it he's been using it for a year okay so drew you've been using only for one year so that's that's still new okay the birds i mean and are you using the dark or lighter roast beans that's also make a big difference too but again the one inside is really really fine okay so light roast so man i i mean i mean i love to because i want again the one is somewhat fine because one and yeah three inside outside diet is really fine so but here's the butter as long as you get a good coffee just go with it okay it's not going to hurt the machine and how many days do we have to wait for dial and espresso without new roasted coffee beans okay so someone asked me how long you okay so let's say you just roast the coffee beans today the ideal time to drink is about after like three to seven days i prefer seven days out okay but i usually drink within three days definitely you don't want to drink next day though okay you're gonna see a lot of crema coming out the taste is not quite developed yeah so you wanna wait about between three and seven the days 870 that comes with the grinder or the ves840 and buy a separate okay so someone asked me should i buy the infusion versus barista express uh it's up to you okay if you're planning on if you're planning on uh buying a good grinder i mean goodness that is tough question okay because you got the infusion versus so in future is about the same price as gaza classic pro okay and gaza classic pro is they give you a commercial commercial size portal filter the 58 millimeter versus 54 millimeter but gaza classic pro is the only single boiler so you have to do some temperature surfing and some you know you have to time your steaming versus infusion is building pid with i mean milk frosting is also you know you don't have to wait for that as well so man that's tough car guys okay what do you guys think if you have the money you go with infusion or gaza classic pro so personally i go with in future because i mean i like it i i like the in future i used to own it and because compared to gaza classic pro is a very com pretty much the same as the rancheria seria if you don't care for milk-based drink i go with like geyser classic pro or wrench or trivia but if you like to make a milk baked drink i go with the infuser um have you tried yemeni beans before someone asked me yemeni and beans no i do not i have not tried yeah many beads about oh hold on i'm going to go back to the other question again uh i mean if you like to drink like big string i go with bristol express okay a hex building grinder because this one does whatever you want to do and i mean you're going to use for a long time even though this is a you know a lot of plastic there but i've been owning for two years has no issues so far my scale light never turns on any advice okay someone uh asked me my this scale light never turns on okay but here okay so here's the thing about the machine okay i don't know which model you guys have did this person have okay so mine say clean and discard on it okay hopefully you guys can see it cleaning this scale i know some modern some model only has clean okay which is with the descaling you have to remember okay you you might want to do maybe every other month or so so that's something you have to keep track of manually but if you have a newer model i guess this is considered as a newer model has a clean slash d scale so with that machine this this scale light is on um can you get good coffee beans from the store someone asked me can i get a good copy beans from store oh my answer is yes and no okay it's all about your taster okay it's all about your textbook i mean i really enjoy the starbucks the blondie roast the blondie means the starbucks lighter roast actually they're surprisingly good okay so that one i really enjoy so go with yeah if you haven't tried blondie roast definitely try it out what espresso machine do you have your eyes on after the breast someone asked me what espresso machines so i have my rancholia servia here bristol express at my shop i have a lava bony and also i uh i've been using the heat exchange machine for ranch leo so my next machine i mean same goes for all of you as well if you are owning a barista express and if you are thinking about upgrading machines go with heat exchange machine okay or dual boiler okay and then if you are thinking about getting rancherly or serbia uh skip it okay so this is not it's not an upgrade from freezer express to ranchers it's not personally my my personal opinion it's not a upgrade it's kind of like we are comparing aperture range so my next machine is again dual boiler or heat exchange machine i hope that answers your question okay okay so okay so what else um can you get a pid controller with the bristol express okay so again so reset express already have the pid already built in okay that already has pi pid built-in so you you don't have to buy separate but but with the rentally or servia i mean you can upgrade you can add a pid as well a pid module okay so you have a lot of options okay with the rental service you have a lot they have huge communities out there you can upgrade um you can add not only can add a pid and also you can add like you know i mean precision shower screen as well as i mean filter baskets you have a lot more options but with bristol express if you want to buy a precision basket you have no options uh no one makes it okay so if anybody knows makes precision basket for 54 millimeter please let me know on the comment as well just let me know because i've been waiting for about two years for someone going to make dosing cup okay so finally crimer come up with a dosing cup for 54 millimeter and then before that let's see mr thomas made made uh this custom dosing cuff for me so yeah i mean goodness so so this is first okay i don't this is first somebody actually come up with 54 millimeter dosing cup but uh but again i mean for most people like us just machining just fine you don't need to buy fancy you know equipment but if you want to have fun with it it's definitely worthwhile um i like my coffee extra hot should i turn my water temp up or heat my milk cotter okay so uh i got a question this person really likes to your coffee extra hot okay so if you make your cough your milk extra hot you are going to break down the milk so that's not a good idea and then and what else if you want to change the uh temperature on barista express you are going to change the the testing profile as well but i think i think the hot coffee is more like us in united states thing because most people you know we want the extra hot coffee but if you go to other countries you know they're not looking for extra hot coffee they want a good tasting coffee so i think it's more us than you know so again i'm if you want extra hot coffee just go with a plus four on here and just but again it comes to milk wise you don't want to burn the milk so i don't try that but that's what i recommend i bought a grindex for cleaning the barista grinder would you recommend it as it saves time taking the grinder apart so grind x uh actually the grind x is kind of like the remove the oil i mean i do have it at home i've been using it but it's nothing like okay breaking apart your grinder and give it a good clean i think that's the most cheapest way as well yeah yeah so i mean definitely do that once in a while okay let's see i think i'm gonna take a few more questions and then so by the way if you see us tomorrow morning uh we're going to have a totally different background tomorrow meet so we are going to take a little trip up to north so so i'm planning on taking my breeze express and some cups to litter we are taking a small vacation so you guys you're going to uh you're going to see us tomorrow morning in different locations it'd be fun should i get those fancy shower screen i got a 54 millimeter it's hard to find someone say fancy okay if you can get the shower screen for 54 millimeter i mean i'm talking about the barista express please let me know in the comments okay i cannot find it nobody makes shower screen for barista express what i know of it wrench leo i mean man you can get a vst a shower head or ims they're wonderful but yeah i mean let me know if someone makes the shower head for that um mr thomas is selling the dosing cup on etsy okay so mr thomas is selling from singapore he's selling on his dosing cup three etsy so check it out okay check it out um crystal says i have a problem with my shower screen seems like the water coming out on one side more than the other has this happened to you i back flushed it oops for a little bit okay i'm gonna shout out to crystal she's having a hard time with the shower screen when's the last time you cleaned the shower screen okay if you haven't cleaned the shower screen in a long time make sure take it out and clean it okay and then give you a nice even flow if you don't know how to do it make sure to check out my channel as well my videos i have how to clean the shutter screen so make sure to check it out okay i'm i'm gonna take one more and i'm gonna see you guys tomorrow morning okay i guess we are done oh make sure you're following me on instagram as well so i'll give you a like kind of like behind the scene okay behind the scene on my channel so you're gonna have some fun with that and let's see what else and i'm going to see you guys tomorrow morning and you guys having a wonderful day", "BjVD4VyIsQ4": "[Music] yeah it's 4:20 somewhere and right now that somewhere is right here hello I'm janae Buress and I'm Jake Brown welcome to the can of a show we talk all things weed hey Jake what's up the new West summit it was a lot of fun thanks friend of the show Jim McHale plant is for 20 games yeah it was really good there was there was some great panels there were a lot of really interesting parties I got a chance to do virtual reality stoned again which is one of my favorite things to do and then I get home and I'm looking at Facebook and it's all of these young women talking about how they were sexually harassed her in the I give Jim some credit because he's you know said hey listen this isn't what the conference is about I want to you know if you have any stories please relay them to me these people won't be invited back to the conference but I mean you hear about this at MJ bisque on last year we give a number of women that are sexually harassed you have there was at one point people eating cold cuts off of a nude model at one of the parties it's like at what point do we just realize that it's 2017 and that we need to address these things before the conference not after it could be before any conference so I think yeah I think it doesn't it's not just this industry it's the entertainment industry it's politics it's everywhere so if people want to get ahead of it and just address it before every conference hey guys keep your hands to yourselves I mean I think that that's just the way things have to go now it's just like the comedy festivals - um well here's a thing about it I have almost grown out that being privy to the harassment but I do remember being a younger woman and feeling a little bit powerless in those situations just yeah it is everywhere powerless is such a key term to cuz it's like all of these you know very power oh we're business guys and they're in Vegas for like MJ Pez con and oh yeah we're just gonna be we're playable and it's like it's such an old stale mentality yeah if some of the good guys could start talking to everybody and being like hey it's abnormal what you're doing well it's sort of normal but it's not very nice what you're doing the way you're treating the women in your industry you're making it uncomfortable you're making it difficult for them to get their work done and succeed in their work like if decent people could start talking to these other people and I don't know we just got it we got to keep the conversation going and start to make some change and start to demand some changes demand some better behavior out of people than guys hold accountable guys holding under God's camera change change the culture it's absolutely a thing that happens I think in every industry to women it's just the history of people and sure we can be better than that it's a new burgeoning industry anyway you know let's start it off well how was your weekend what did you do did you get sexually harassed I'm sure at some point I've been watching the Dodgers let's go Dodgers that's it that's that's the best thing that's been happening this weekend Dodgers are three and now going into Chicago I will root for the Dodgers now that the Red Sox are out you know you have my producer Vince just fists in the air I don't know if that's Pro Dodgers anti Red Sox either way a lot of my ru TV my a lot of my Rocky's friends have gone a little internet quiet [Laughter] yeah oh good luck to the Dodgers I guess and can we both agree death to the Yankees Yankees all right now it's time for the weekend weed and I want to start in Northern California this is a story that it's particularly close to home for me as I know a number of people affected by the wildfires that have decimated the region thankfully they weren't hurt but some of lost friends and almost all of them know someone who's lost a farm our own Bruce Kennedy has a story for the cannabis touching on how this could affect up to 17 thousand farms in Mendocino and Sonoma alone and that includes smoke damage to plants which essentially renders them useless when I was in San Francisco for the summit last weekend there are people talking about five-pound bags going for a thousand dollars where cannabis benchmarks has that price for the market at fourteen forty five for one pound I think what makes this truly devastating is that most of these farms get one harvest a year that's it and that this is a catastrophic loss there's no federal crop insurance and a lot of these farmers don't have access to banking so you have people that are burying cash that could be lost as well and then you couple that with the fact that they were counting on that money to be able to go through the licensing process as California launches its regulated recreational marijuana program in 2018 and this is something that a lot of good people just won't come back from if you're watching in NorCal know that people around the country have you and their thoughts and I encourage everyone to go find an organization that's dedicated as sporting relief efforts specifically for growers and also a big [ __ ] you too we pay who is holding over thirteen thousand dollars of donations that were made online specifically to go to growers Janette what's their excuse for holding this money no it's weed money weed money that's real money so you know I mean these people were involved in a tragic disaster they raised it through one of the more reputable sites you caring calm and this wasn't all weed money these were you know just regular people trying to help out and now they won't release the funds and there are people out there with no homes no money nothing right now that have lost family members friends and it's it's disgusting yeah okay hey there Bravo - representative Tom Marino Donald Trump's nominee for drug czar thank you for having the decency to remove yourself from consideration for the position due to the conflict of interest created by your involvement in essentially aiding an increased distribution of opioids in our country yep not taking a position where you could continue to prop profit from this country's devastating drug epidemic is the height of decency shown by Trump nominees previous Trump nominees include Betsy DeVos billionaires - the Amway fortune and part of a family who has given millions to advance their radical school privatization agenda she's our Secretary of Education y'all also lacking in the decency Marina was able to show is Trump nominee Rex Tillerson current head of the Environmental Protection's agency and former CEO of Exxon Mobil hello senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is quoted as saying that confirming Moreno as our country's drug czar would be like putting a wolf in charge of the henhouse The Washington Post reported that Moreno as well as members of Congress and some of the nation's major drug distributors helped to create industry friendly laws which derailed efforts which would have limited the flow of opioids those painkillers eventually led to tens of thousands of deaths up Nexus Trump's nominee for drug czar El Chapo Jake one of our top stories this week was a researchers claim was a reversal in overdose deaths caused by opioids here in Colorado in the two years after legalization just crushing it on the funny stories this week losing everything in fires baloney humor no this one's actually positive as the American Journal of Public Health looked at the data starting in 2014 after adult use dispensaries open their doors according to the Washington Post Christopher Ingraham the study controlled for what medical are controlled for medical weed by skipping over our lame neighbors to the west in Utah and looking at Nevada which had an mmm a program at the time but no recreational chronic even after taking into account the numerous other factors they still came up with a 6.5 percent drop in deaths and that's substantial when you see numerous states continuing decline dr. Larry Wolk who serves as the executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment warned that quote anything that does get published at this point should be considered preliminary data unquote which is something the authors of the study readily acknowledged but you also have robert bellick coordinator of the Colorado Consortium for prescription drug abuse prevention noting that deaths from heroin have been rising as people often switch to the harder stuff when they can no longer get a prescription personally knowing people that have kicked both prescription opioids and heroin thanks to weed and with a number of guests on this very show claiming the same it's my opinion that it's only a matter of time until the science comes in today after finding out that a story posted by amherst new york police was an April Fool's Day hoax Dave Quatro is doubling down in saying that hiring drug sniffing bunnies could actually work hold on there did I just say drug sniffing bunnies I sure did Jen a Quattro Quattro the Phoenix with the Phoenixville Pennsylvania mayoral candidate thinks that the idea of hiring rabbits to find illicit drugs is not so far-fetched lots of great innovations were inspired by pure fiction well we even have cell phones if not for gene roddenberry with anyone drinking Pepsi and milk before Laverne and Shirley I was Jake or keepin their wife in a genie bottle before I dream of Genie I sure hope not Bugs Bunny has been one of the most clever cartoon characters on television for the last 50 years maybe the Warner Brothers saw something in rabbits that the rest of us look right past and with all the great attributes that bunnies hold why should dogs be getting all the cool jobs here are my top 5 jobs for bunny rabbits just in case Dave doesn't win the mayoral election and we never get this drug-sniffing rabbit unit off the ground those bunnies are gonna need jobs they got a lot of kids to feed you know number five bunny therapist rabbits are very quiet which means they're probably great listeners get that rabbit a tiny office in in even tinier sofa I think we found your new therapist Jake number four roommate hey I hear New York City apartments are closet size but expensive a rabbit takes up very little space rabbits also get bored easily so you'll always have a friend who wants to party number three house made everyone knows that rabbits are very clean does everyone know that you probably get it I just can't wait for more obscure rabbit facts you've looked up and you could probably get away with paying the man lettuce are you one of those weirdos who doesn't like other people using your toilet well rabbits aren't people and they're known to eat their own poop so worry not their motto a rabbit's teeth and nails never stop growing how about we put that natural talent to use and hire them as nail models instead of sifting through that boring basket of nail gel colors we could say really sir habits and then a bunch of bunnies come clacking out with fancy nail all right way to make in your nails fun number one marijuana show co-hosts full of personality but that jobs already taken I'm gonna Google rabbit facts and the top questions are do rabbits have feelings for their owners just like you are single if you're typing that are rabbits fragile [Laughter] [Music] how do you get a bunny to like you oh that's I don't even answer I think it's just feed it but bunnies they don't like to be alone I love rabbit job yeah I don't are getting all the cool jobs man these rabbits got to work there's just the pet jobs like very specific people I create a new job a position for myself I'm like a pet career camp next week cat jobs schedule alright cats get in the weave news the cats in their resumes out in their questions there's a bunch of cool stuff on the site this week I want to tell people check out the new high-minded podcast there's Alex Pascarella Alicia Wallace from the cannabis or both on there it's kind of there's serialized stories from Alicia alex is doing some panel stuff our own Lindsay Bartlet has a really great review of the pax era and their Mike James is on it this week yeah one a friend of the show I was calling everyone for listen you want to be a friend of the show send me an email Jake at the Cannabis CEO because that's an email address that will exist in a few days all right for more on this and all the stories from the weekend we'd visit us online at the Cannabis CEO now this week the state of Colorado held a public hearing asking for the people for opinions on proposed marijuana regulation changes we wanted to know if the people knew about the existing regulations of which there are more than 400 pages combined medical and retail surgeon and producer vents headed up to the People's Republic of Boulder or this week to find out hey it feels good to get out of the studio get on here get some fresh air in Boulder beautiful Boulder I stick out a little bit in Boulder I noticed but we came out here to find out what do people actually know so we went to the streets asked a few true or false questions about some basic marijuana pot shop rules and check it out and see what the people told us okay I doesn't quit - applause questions for are you just about marijuana and the legalization of it true or false consumption of marijuana on the premises of a retail marijuana shop is prohibited at the shop yeah that's true true true true or false I don't believe they allow you to smoke true it is not smoke there I would imagine that okay how about this one you must be at least eighteen to enter a recreational marijuana shop that's cool between yes true actually about 20 moths 21 yeah okay 21 21 so right answer right false okay it is illegal for a retail marijuana shop to give away free marijuana product sadly true true or false a retail shop can give away free marijuana products those false false false that is false true pause you can sell marijuana over the internet as long as you're 21 and have a retail license hmm I've said I've heard situations where people have gone over over online but it being legal I'm not sure I would suppose now I'm gonna have to say fawful no definitely followed by no thing in the future you could like order through Amazon Prime or something I mean no oh [Music] man I wish I could sing I thought like the urge to sing except the ability wasn't there hey thanks podcast listeners we love you please don't forget to tune in to our YouTube channel to see that and more don't forget to subscribe to the cannabis other podcast high-minded but back on the cannabis show our guest this week there's coffee and cannabinoids please join me in welcoming Devin Jam rose to the show how are you doing I'm good thank you for the cup I can just say cup all right that's just a cup of punch here yes sir what do you guys think this is a this is our original it's real hot what we call around the house old and cold just whatever is left over from the previous day but this is this is delightful good good we're drinking it black and it's it's delicious how would you describe this this particular blend because I know very little about coffee that's fair that's fair this so this one is actually a single origin so this is all from Ethiopia it's an Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and Yirgacheffe is where coffee the coffee species actually originated so it's the motherland of coffee itself yes this is like a land restraint exactly exactly so we we wanted to start with that because it's a very popular coffee and also you know the for the firt to do a new product like CBD coffee why not use the first coffee that ever existed and so that's what we did but this one this is truly og it is original gangster actually really delicious and it smells great as well I thought I'm when I have a CD not just CBD products but any sort of marijuana products I don't necessarily expect it to taste really good maybe I'm getting it because of the marijuana or we are in poverty yeah we spent three years trying to overcome that we we started off when we first started experimenting there was a lot of soaking beans and tinctures a lot of spraying beans with oils and a lot of really bad coffee oh god yeah the worst I ever tried I will admit is you pull doing a butane run through your tube into a plate of coffee curing that and drinking that and it actually worked as a weight loss coffee because I threw up so I wouldn't I wouldn't recommend that either that's aggressive well and then I hear a lot of people doing bulletproof coffees so imagine you could do like a little bit of steep views that mitts the brand of the coffee for everybody listening so we do a little steep fusing then maybe some can of butter in there too is anybody tried that out oh yeah we get we get submissions from people doing all sorts of recipes people love to make their own butter and throw it in people like to use it in cooking like making tiramisu and stuff so yeah we get all sorts of fun submissions from people doing all sorts of cool things with it I bet that's like one of the best parts is you're kind of letting everybody's weird like home recipes and you know do people because we all know certain temperatures you can burn off certain cannabinoids and I imagine that would be a difficulty when you're talking about an incredibly hot thing like coffee well I don't know how hot coffee gets that if you burn your tongue on the hot coffee there's already some CBD in there to help alleviate the information so you know we've made it amateur coffee drinker proof I'm gonna ask the FDA to evaluate that statement continue these statements have not been evaluated to treat burned mouths so yeah we we don't tend to see too many issues CBD doesn't tend to vaporize until you're about 350 I want to say and you're you're not gonna get any boiling water hotter than that for the coffee we do we don't recommend people cold brew it that's actually the opposite problem we have because when you cold brew the coffee you're not extracting any of the oil and what we're putting in is a co2 oil and so if you're not pulling the oil back out then you're obviously not getting all the benefits so so what's that process look like because you're okay so you source these beans and I'm guessing that you since we're in Colorado are you sourcing cannabis it's high in CBD are you sourcing hemp so everything we do is hemp derived okay and everything is grown locally in Colorado outdoors organically we find the best hemp that we can and we spend a lot of time finding the right strains that have the right flavor profile that's really gonna play well with the flavor notes of the coffee the coffee's got a little bit of a citrusy finish to it and so we went with a chain a string that had nice cherry notes some earthy and a little bit of black pepper you might get in there and yeah so all the everything is hemp derived that's all sourced from Colorado and then the coffee we we import the coffee and we source from all local or small farms around Africa and South America so we can change new people aren't necessarily getting the Ethiopian your go it's an embalming it's an ancient bean so so there are cannabis terpenes in here as well oh yeah that's amazing cuz a lot of times people do extracts and you see you lose the Terps and so should you tend to try and find strains also that have more of an alert profile and flavor and also the effect interest exactly we really like beta-carotene is what we really look for that gives that earthy peppery flavor and then beta carotene has also been shown to interact directly with the endocannabinoid system and it's been proven to be an anti-inflammatory and analgesic like if you get if you get your wisdom teeth pulled out they give you clove oil it's the beta Kari awfully and that numbs the pain there is also beta Kari awfully and in black pepper so there's a you're gonna get a little bit of that too we also like humulin mersin all the all the common ones but yeah baby carry off lean is our favorite hello this is a conversation about terpenes people out there watching around the country so some people are having different conversations way to carry off no you said it really well is all I'm saying well you guys were doing your bit I was in the bathroom practicing you guys have done some really fun events around to tell me a little bit about kind of introducing people to CBD coffee and especially at an event we're walking around something that's hot can be dangerous idiot like me yes so coffee doing the coffee we interact with a lot of people who cannabis in general is very new to you know you've got people who hear horror stories about edibles on the news and that could blown out of proportion and they're afraid of smoking they're afraid of vaping but then they'll coffee hold on a minute now I love coffee sure and you have hemp is good is safe so we get a lot of people who have never tried a cannabis product at all who want who are willing to try our coffee we have a lot of people who do know cannabis or like oh this would be perfect for my aunt my brother lives way out on the East Coast for whatever as an intro into the world of cannabis so we deal with a lot of Fringe users so education is a huge part of what we do because people are like you know what our terpenes sure sure sure and then you have coffee which is kind I mean it's a daily thing for most Americans I'm guessing and so is this almost like a micro dose or would you consider this a full dose of comedy or it just depends yeah I mean it depends on the strength you're gonna make we definitely see people making such strong there and we're at the rate we infuse a typical cup like these cups are probably gonna have 10 12 milligrams so you're getting a full dose in a cup and then we also do half strength releases with some partners that we're working on that are gonna for people who want more coffee but don't need more CBD and just so people that are listening know this won't produce a head high it doesn't know a psychotropic effect so in that way you can still be productive I'm gonna be able to finish this interview hopefully and you will literally die of caffeine overdose before you would get high on our NAAFI we do use a full-spectrum extract so that is trace amounts of THC we're firm believers in the entourage effect so we do have about 0.01% residual THC and some CBN some CBG all that other good stuff but yeah we're way way way below the federal cutoff of 0.3% so yeah you're not gonna bring this into work and it's not gonna like set off alarms oh yeah oh no we what would you recommend giving this to somebody if they don't know that there are cannabinoids in it because I think there's an interesting discussion around kind of dosing what what's responsible to give people and not we certainly don't recommend it but we hear people people love to tell us oh yeah I've been feeding it to my grandma or I've been giving it to whoever and I'm like I don't think I can support that what the unethical pranksters out there Nana's just haven't have a good time couple one that's what is interesting is she's like so she didn't even know she was getting it but I noticed the difference in her so you know you were limit you know on it is we definitely don't recommend it but it does eliminate the possibility of a placebo effect which is very interesting to see so it's almost like a gateway edible for for her Nana for me mods if you need something that kind of get her started with we do see people who will start with the coffee and then sort of get into stronger doses of either CBD or sometimes that is how they start trying THC like you know the CBD does a lot for me I'm gonna I'm gonna try the other one I'm gonna I'm gonna try the dangerous one when we talk about THC I when we were out at the or when I was out at the summit somebody made a really interesting analogy and they talked about how kind of cannabis flower is becoming the coffee bean where fewer and fewer people are using it because cannabis flower comes with all kind of these you know you have to break it down you need to put it in something and it's this there's a lot of Labor whereas now people can go and get the vaporizer right and they can get something that's easy to use it's almost like the the vaporizer is the k-cup yes so where do you see kind of coffee bean going in kind of the same you know relation yes and no that's a really good analogy actually I like that a lot what I remember who said it somebody who's a smart guy somebody who knows what they're trying genius um copyright 2017 so what we see I guess is we're seeing in the coffee world there's a lot of there's a bit of a division you definitely see you're seeing growth on both of the opposite ends of the spectrum primarily you know you're sort of mid-level coffees I've always been and always will be where you're seeing a lot of the growth is like you say on the ready to go versions you know K cups are getting huge instant coffees actually on the rise there are you can buy a $6 instant coffee now you know you're definitely seeing that means it's good because it's a expensive [Laughter] tons of waste just like your giant packaged vape pen exactly and it doesn't even have CBD our coffee isn't six dollars or serving like come on right so we are seeing a lot of growth in that side and it does you know you do get a lot of waste the environmental impact on that is huge with K Cups and then you're also seeing what's funny is massive growth on the high high high end you know single origin beans very lightly roasted to preserve all the origin flavors made in a pour-over with you know weighing out every tenth of a gram of being and water you got copycats you've got your civet cats crapping out the coffee sure that'd be a good job for bunnies you feed bunnies to coffee cherries you get bunny [ __ ] that's like intricate knowledge of rapid I I do have several rabbits myself yes they they do make great roommates [Laughter] [Laughter] you've got instant that is you've got these two different ends of the spectrum you're doing beans are you doing instant are you doing so that is actually the next thing in the pipeline for us we're partnering up with Evo hemp also out of Boulder sorry what up man guys we've been working with them for actually probably about five months now and we are doing a co-branded instant with them we're very excited about it we're hoping to release it before the end of the year it was an interesting thing to take on because I would never consider instant coffee before I don't want to do it I hate instant coffee but we've really gotten to play around with a lot of formulation you know spray drying freeze drying the whole when I'm sure the infusion changes a little bit oh yeah it's we had to tweak a lot of things for that to get everything ready to freeze dry and to spray dry to get everything all all prepped up and infused at the right strength but yeah so that should be coming out by the end of the year gum and that's gonna be fun I'm excited to work with them and to get to partner up with those guys all right you said tweaking speaking of tweaking so commonly hippie speedball so you know what a hippie speedball is oh yeah can you define it for our audience I hippie speedball our chocolate-covered espresso beans where the chocolate is infused with THC whoa okay that was not heavy speedball is a cup of coffee and cannabis to start your day so I want to propose to you I want to propose to use some rebrands okay hippie speedball you're the coffee expert tell me if these are any better what about rips and sips receivable like bongs we do rips and sips okay I like that one yeah what about guerrilla brew if you don't mind getting sued apparently Gorilla Glue is quite litigious alright we're gonna pass on that one cake up at the state K stands for cush the cush kept the cush cub okay right field of creams for those that don't like black coffee yeah that sounds way too much like a porno flick instead of the kickstart the wick starts okay okay a little bit of a stretch but I'll but I'll accept that one they're all a bit of us and finally just a chatty barista to be able to go into a coffee shop in the future though to sort of ask for these type of things would be really nice you know I keep asking people like what's there what are they envision as being a where they consume cannabis once we get all of this you know 300 worked out the details worked out but yeah a coffee shop where um yeah we're working we're talking to a lot of the places who are trying to get permitting for the 300 we're also in quite a few coffee shops right now in Boulder you feel like the unseen bean is our sister shop as our sister company they have our coffee and then the point cafe on the hill in Boulder they're also doing the coffee but if you hate going to Boulder yeah regular people buy your product is it available out-of-state oh yeah we shipped we ship all over the country because we're all hemp derived and we test rigorously we will ship to all 50 states close friends in Iowa is a step up in coffee game hey guys yeah absolutely and I know a lot of people that would love this product when I think espresso is the best way to do it the the heat and the pressure extracts everything all the cannabinoids all the terpenes all the good oils everything you want out of the coffee's coming out of the coffee in espresso so coffee shop model is great that's a great place to uh don't like coffee I'm not saying I don't like coffee I like old disgusting coffee no one else I drink you got any other options for him we're working on it okay instant coffee is first with Evo that's the first thing we got we've also got in development tea and hot chocolate right oh yeah a lot of people get excited about the hot chocolate yeah a little apres ski is that a thing people say it's time for everybody's favorite game pot or not [Applause] and

"ZYIAO1ZgYcA": "so Maria you have a pretty blankie question for me yeah that's right about coffee let me paint you a picture girls so um I've got a humid environment i live in florida i am using an oilier beam wait a minute we're not in Florida we're up here well no I'm painting a picture for you miss an Oreo if you will Florida oilier beam using an air escape popping that escape in the freezer and when I take it out and I put my beans into my grinder and grind it seems to be gumming up and getting moist and sticky oh well let me start at the beginning mm-hmm the when you put your beans in the freezer once you open your bag of beans you can put it in the freezer before you open it once you open that bag and put it in the air escape or whatever you put it in it the seal do not put it back in the freezer you're not doing it any good leave it in the air escape that'll work great but don't put it in the freezer right the freezer that then what you're running into it you're not helping the freshness but what you're running into is when you take that out of the freezer and you put it in the Florida environment which is very warm and very humid hot a meeting called kool beans hot air condensation right so your beans are getting a lot of condensation on them you throw them in the grinder all that moisture is getting in there and gumming up the stainless steel burden or whatever kind of birds you have yeah it doesn't matter it's still going to damage them Oh terrible yeah now you can clean a standalone grinder but you can't clean a super automatic so if you put that in there super automatic mm-hmm I hate to see what that's gonna look like absolutely so um put them in the air scape don't put them in the freezer or if you insist on putting them in the freezer you have to take them the portion out that you're going to use and let it acclimate itself to the air in the room and probably dry it off a little bit too because you know that moisture you've got all those oils we gonna take a couple hours yeah just don't put them in the freezer yeah because really the air escape is gonna keep them as fresh as possible yeah at that point yeah exactly when take those beans out you get a little bit of that condensation on it now you put it back in the freezer now you're stealing even more oh this bad boy so was there any more to that question or was that basically the I think yeah I think that was it why is that happening so you can rest out your birds if they are stainless steel you can cause a lot of gumming up because the oils and the humidity of seeing rusty brewers were people yeah I've seen super automatics where the water tanks kind of close to the grinder where people get up in the morning and all ooh whoa I poor clutter is a grinding dirt and it all up and they say what do i do get it right in yeah immediately because the longer it sits in there yeah mmmm absolutely yeah it's not good for it I've seen them all rusty food and then the ground coffee in there with water turns a clay yeah oh goodness it so this question led to other things we weren't really gonna talk about but there you have it yeah exactly okay like a pantry and sorry yeah some up yeah some up um pantry airscape just simpler where it's not being exposed to UV which is what their escape helps yep and then squishing as much as a tear out yeah so it doesn't stale as quick yep and then don't put it in the freezer yeah cool all right thank you thank you", "zkYRYZ1LDYI": "all right so today I'm going to be doing a video comparing fresh coffee versus not so fresh coffee Kaffee that is not no longer at its peak coffee has a small shelf life if you want to get the best of it once it's roasted you want to wait maybe til the third day since it was roasted let the oil set set in and then you can brew it and it'll give you the optimum coffee and from there you have maybe about one week two weeks at the most to keep getting really good coffee and after that coffee is gonna be getting stale so I went today in the morning and bought a bag of a half a pound bag of coffee at my local coffee shop they actually roast them there it's a really good thing it's about five blocks from my house I like their coffee and this is also a copy that I've had for about two weeks I saved it just so that I could demonstrate this so I'm going to be using the same grinder same machine gazia pure espresso same tamp and actually on this time it's going to be a euro curve your curve temp I like it so everything is going to be the same and then you'll you'll be the judge okay okay so my first which is going to be the fresh fresh coffee I'm grounded packed it in tempted my use 15 grams I normally use 14 grams but today I decided what the heck just go use 15 grams okay so we'll give it give it a shot lock it in and then I'll show you or hopefully you'll see the difference between the fresh one and then the older one right so here we go have that locked in let me just get this back then right here time to focus all right I thought that's about 25 seconds and look at that crema for those of you that really want to see your good grandma again fresh coffee is probably the only way you're gonna get a good crema look at that layer of crema ounce of coffee a little bit of a let me show you look at that crema it's about a dark kind of a red I don't know if you can see the color that well but it's really intense looking and again it's not going anywhere and that is not a pressurized the Porta filter it's not pressurized so it's not fake it's not fake grandma is the real deal I'm just give it a shot let me try it out see if I see how it tastes right nice that is some good good spresso okay so ready for round two this is the other coffee I've mentioned earlier that it might hits about two weeks old it's actually a little more than that I'm going to say about three even four weeks I apologize about that again everything is the same same grinder same tamp is the euro curve you can see also 15 grams so now I'm going to pop it in and show you how it brews again it's not going to be you're not going to be getting that thick layer crema that I got earlier with the fresh one fresh coffee because that's a because it's no longer fresh so already we go that's actually a little less as far as timing it was about 22 seconds and I did the exact same tamp exact same everything and this one just came gushing out and for some reason that seems like a copy when it's older it does that I'm not really sure why maybe because the oils are drying out so it's you know a little less dense whatever it might be but look at the crema right away you'll see the difference right away it's much pale it's barely anything in there I'm pretty sure if I put a teaspoon of sugar it's just going to think right away", "KIBvEOiZ-qU": "hi I'm Zack with whole lotta love and today we're gonna talk about storing your coffee know it's typical when you buy coffee you do get it in the back like this but once you open it it's really crucial that you store it properly to ensure that you get the best taste out of the coffee for the rest of the time that you do have it so when you get your coughing you're ready to store it you're gonna want to remember the four variables that are actually going to affect the coffee after you store it over a longer period of time so those four variables are moisture air heat and light here we have two bags of coffee that you would you know typically buy we have our whole lot sale of Malabar gold and we do have the paradise espresso now in though it's a little bit different in the actual bagging of the two but important feature that they do have in common is they have this one-way valve you can actually see it to the clear part of the bag here and what this does is after the coffee is roasted it's going to let off gases as it's in the bag and what this does actually allows the gases to escape out this hole right here but it doesn't allow air to come in so it's gonna make sure that your coffee stays fresh while it's in there it is important to know that when you do open a bag of beans such as you know you get your bag open them up and actually break the seal they're only gonna last for a limited time you know week ten days may be a little bit more depending for the best quality I mean you can still use them after that just the original taste quality is not gonna be there as it would with a freshly opened bag of beans at our site we've actually have several devices that you can use to store your coffee please do a really good job of protecting from all those elements the first item we have is the coffee vac now what this does is actually a container you can keep your coffee beans in this is nice because it is dark and it doesn't allow light to get in and affect the beans also it has a velvet similar to the one way valve you see in the coffee bag and what this does is when you put on if you don't press the button which opens the valve you can't get low and that's because you press the button push it down and actually it pushes the air out so you're not gonna have a lot of excess air in here that's gonna make your beans go stale no this is also good because it's not going to allow moisture in with you means either and then if you store it in a proper place where there's not a lot of excessive heat your beans should stay fresh for the longest time possible now the next item we have actually is the vacuum in and this is actually a really unique product because it has a pump and the pump actually removes all the air from the container so you notice that it is tinted to help prevent light from ruining the beans and what you do is simply open it up we can use our ml of our gold then put the top on take your pump and on the front there's actually the fitting which draws the air out and you actually just set that there pump it up and you'll feel it starting to get harder as you do pump it and it's gonna get to the point where it gets pretty it's pretty hard you can actually you know lift the whole thing off because the suction is so great and what this does is now I removed all the air from in the container it's not gonna let any air in nice thing too is you can't open it cuz there's a suction in there with the air remove just so great if you want to get into it what you'll do is there's this piece in the middle you just pull it over you actually hear the air go back into the container and then you can remove the top and access your beans now remember if you have any questions about how to store coffee or you know what is going to affect the overall taste and quality of your coffee feel free to give us a call once again this is the vacuum in and this is the coffee vac so two great ways of storing your coffee and to make sure that you do get the freshest coffee every time you", "LSiVeQJrtlU": "all right everyone finally we have a new installment in our Explorer series as the Kenyan pbar II now what does Peaberry actually mean well it's a mutation of a being that only happens about 5% of the time and coffee you know we all know the coffee bean here I even have an example here we have the coffee bean here you'll see the regular coffee bean is flat on one side the pea berry is round and it's much smaller you can see them side-by-side they're much smaller and that causes a lot of cool things to happen because the pea berry is round when you roast it as rolling around is getting more of an even flavor and think about it when you have that flat spot it's clucking around whenever you're roasting it so that's one great thing the other thing is a small and denser and because of that there's more flavor you're gonna get more of a sweeter note from it you're gonna love this bean we really got hold of some really special Kenyan beans this time our pea berry has kind of a peach lemon zest e with a real chocolate on the back you're gonna love it as it cools it really smoothes out you're gonna love this roast pea berries normally much more expensive because it's only 5% of beans so they all have to be started by hand and it causes the price of this P berry to go up but our Kenyan PBE will be given to you at the same price as all of our other Explorer Series coffees 1995 so go check it out right now at pure coffee club.com", "a0Atz5T5V2o": "hey welcome back to the shop today we're gonna be talking about coffee bean blanks how to cast coffee beans in alumalite resin so I'm gonna kind of walk you through the processes the tips and tricks that I've found over the years that'll get better results with the castings and how to prepare the beans all that kind of stuff nothing to you know spectacular it's it's all pretty simple stuff but I'll kind of show you my process the other thing we're gonna be doing in this video though is I'm gonna compare stabilized coffee beans to non stabilized coffee beans to see if it makes a difference if you stabilize the beans before you cast them alright so the first thing you're gonna need is coffee beans pretty much any coffee beans will do you want to get the whole bean I get mine there there's a brand called blind dog that they're roasted in Nevada so I just use that for my coffee bean blanks and then once you have the coffee beans you're gonna want to do a little preparation before you cast them the first thing that I do is I soaked them in acetone and that's trying to get as many of the oils or any contaminants that might be on the coffee beans out of them and so I just grab a big bowl and I dump some coffee beans in there dump some acetone and then let it soak for probably about give it about two hours some around there and I kind of stir them up a little bit here and there and then once you the two hours have passed I take them out and then dry them just kind of lay them out on paper towels and dab them and I just try and wipe off as much of the acetone as I can get off and if there's any other oils left over I try and just kind of clean as much as that stuff as I can off before I cast them now the next step is you're gonna dry them out you want to put them in an oven and bake them at about 212 somewhere over 212 degrees Fahrenheit the reason for that is 212 is where water boils so I usually go about two fifteen to twenty some around there and then I let them bake overnight and you're kind of shooting for you know somewhere around 24 hours that should give you as dry as possible beans basically ready for casting now I want to stop real quick and talk about safety because you don't want to take the the beans out of the acetone and then go shove them in an oven because the acetone is highly flammable so you know let them dry them off dab them with the cloth and all that kind of stuff and then let them sit for you know you can let them sit overnight if you want just to make sure but I usually about a couple hours of sitting maybe even put a fan on them or something like that the acetone will evaporate basically pretty quick but you really want to make sure that you're not putting flammable acetone in an oven alright so once the beans have baked overnight they should be moist you're free and ready to cast basically or you could stabilize them so I want to talk about my tests with the stabilizing so what I did was I made a batch of you know coffee bean blanks with non stabilized beans once they were done baking I just cast them and then I also stabilized some and made another batch of coffee bean blanks and the the white ones in all the video clips here the white ones are the non stabilized beans the tan ones are stabilized so and it's the same resin I use the luma light white for each one of them and the results are I have to say that the stabilizing helped I don't think that you're gonna be able to say that it's you're never gonna get chipped out or anything like that I did have a little little tiny chip that I had to fill but overall it was much better now with this test I I kind of skewed it a little bit not to make a pun or anything like that the stabilized blanks I pretty much I didn't use any CA glue before drilling or turning and I just took a gouge to it and I wasn't going like super easy I wasn't taking the lightest pass I could I tried to you know give it run it through its paces a little bit and the beans for the most part stayed you know they weren't brittle they weren't chipping out too much I got one little chip that I had to fill but that's it and the rest of everything it was great now the white ones the non stabilized beans I was going really easy on them I used CA glue before I drilled and just kind of hit it on the ends to try and help stiffen those coffee bean fibers up i doused it you know uh multiple times while turning use the skew chisel and took very very light passes for the most part and I got lots of little chip outs so overall it worked pretty well but the question is is it worth the investment stabilizing the beans for a you know not perfect result it's not gonna solve all the problems with shipping but it made it a lot better you know the other alternative is don't stabilize them and don't waste the time or money on it and then just realize that you're gonna have to fill which is what most people do anyway all right so once you've stabilized or dried out the beans they're ready to cast now the only difficult thing about casting coffee bean blanks is they float and you really want to pack them into your mold as tightly as you can but it's kind of hard when they're just kind of floating and separating in the mold so the thing that I do to combat that is I just have a little little piece of HDPE high-density polyethylene so it's nonstick and I just stick that on the top of them now this is gonna this is kind of the tough thing is you're gonna have to figure out a good amount of coffee beans and resin because it can get messy when you're pressing down on that it can kind of overflow if you have too much resin in the video clip you'll see that I made a gigantic mess this was the first time I used this specific mold and I didn't know exactly how much to put in there and it became a giant mess I got to use a lot less resin but overall if you think about it if you're shooting for a 3/4 inch blank you need to fill the mold with at least 3/4 inch of coffee beans so that's a good starting point you might even throw in about 7/8 inch you know and just fill that and then figure out how much resin it's gonna take to fill that up and just get this thing so that you can keep even pressure on the entire casting but you're not you know making a gigantic mess a little overflow doesn't hurt anything it's not gonna you know make it cause a problem basically you can just clean up any spilled resin with acetone but the only other thing is D molding gets a little bit more interesting when you've got something jammed into the top of your casting so you're probably gonna have to take both ends off the mold and you might have to kind of cut away a little bit of that resin and just kind of break it off so you can pull that that lid piece out of the top of the casting but overall it's not really that big of a deal so that's really the biggest tip that I can share is you know use something that's gonna press down on the the casting and you should get a pretty tightly packed blank you know full of copy means all right so once you've cast your blanks all you got to do is cut them out and start doing the milling process and turning them now this is where it gets interesting so I have a couple of little tips and tricks that I wanted to share that I use and again these are very difficult blanks they're very chippy and so there's a couple of things that can kind of stack the cards in your favor in the end they're delicate you got to be kind of careful with them but hopefully some of these little tips will help out and you'll get you know perfectly good results on your blanks so the first thing is drilling for the most part cutting them out on the table saw or even on a bandsaw that shouldn't really pose any problems for anybody but once you start drilling that's where things get a little bit interesting first tip that I have is I would recommend cutting the blanks for each tube a good quarter-inch at least over the length of the tube I might even suggest going maybe a quarter-inch over on each side so a full half inch longer than the tube that'll just allow for if you get any tear-out or you know the beans kind of chip out at the end when you're drilling you can just cut that off basically and you're fine that's the first thing now the second thing is before you start drilling I would actually douse the ends with CA glue thin CA glue that'll kind of penetrate in there again it's not a perfect fix but it'll help a little bit and even if you use stabilized beans I would probably recommend doing that just to kind of a little insurance policy the next thing is when you're drilling make sure that the bottom plate you know whatever you have is the backer piece that supports the bottom make sure that that is not a giant hole or something like that have a full piece of wood supporting where the drill bit is gonna go through so that you don't get it just cracking out that'll kind of help out a little bit as well but overall drilling shouldn't be too bad just make sure you're taking your time clear the chips and everything should go pretty well then barrel trimming now this is where something can go really wrong so what I recommend is after you know you you've got you have like a half-inch of excess material after drilling I would go and sand that after you glue the tubes in sand the blank down the ends and get it down to about a sixteenth of an inch past the the tube on each end then use the barrel trimmer but again I would probably kind of soak it a little bit don't try not to get the glue in the tube but soak that end a little bit let it dry then take it to the barrel trimmer the next step is turning so as always but even especially in this case you want to make sure that your tools are razor sharp i would recommend pulling out a skew chisel that's gonna be your best bet my next one would probably be a gouge turned kind of on its side that'll kind of give you that 45-degree angle I don't think that I would really recommend using a scraper I to me that I haven't tried it I guess but to me that seems like it's gonna be the worst method because it's just gonna want to kind of rip those things out so if you can use a cutting tool rather than a scraper I think that's a better way to do it but you know high speeds as always is you know if you're using anything acrylic you want to wind the lathe out as fast as it'll go basically and take very light cuts now the other thing that you can use is CA glue and just doused the blank every once in a while and take a light pass or two douse it again and just try and keep those fibers locked down on that thing and to minimize any of the chip out again the stabilized beans seem to help out a good amount I mean it was night and day compared to the one that I did without stabilized beans so you can do that but I still even had to kind of fill a little bit of a chip right on the end but it was it was a easier process alright so the only other thing that I had was I tested to see if you could just wet sand the stabilized coffee beans you know once you get the blank all turned up and everything and you've started sanding it can you just wet sand it and polish it up the results are yes you could do that I actually don't think I'd recommend it though I didn't really get an even sheen on it doing that and the stabilized beans seemed a little bit like harder I think that stabilizing resin hardens them up a little bit and I was using a luma light white which is a pretty soft material it just didn't stand that well and there was a little bit of a texture to it at the end and it didn't really polish up awesome it didn't ruin the blank though it's doable but I would actually just put a full CA finish or whatever your your top coat of choice is and just do it that way I think it's a lot easier so I guess if anybody has any questions you can definitely leave those down below if you've tried you know making your own coffee bean blanks and you've got better ideas on how to you know pack those beans down or any parts of the process definitely let me know and leave that down in the comments so we can kind of share with everybody as well as tips and tricks on when you're turning them how to get better results so definitely leave those down below and I appreciate anybody's input cuz I always like learning new things and improving my techniques too so if you're new to the channel and enjoy resin casting stuff I'm always doing experiments and testing stuff out and doing kind of little how-to videos subscribe and you'll get notified when new videos come out I'm also out there on Facebook Twitter and Instagram so you can kind of catch up with me

coffee roasters youtube channel today we're gonna be doing our first episode of our coffee 101 series where we comparing hoping coffee versus pre-ground coffee one of the main problems when you buying pre-ground coffee is freshness now when you stop roasting coffee from the moment you consume it it's it's degassing which means that it's releasing co2 and depending on the different roast levels the co2 releases at a different rate now when you grind that coffee you're suddenly exposing the grounds to oxygen and you're letting it de gas at a much faster rate what this means is that it goes very flat and very dull and it loses all of its acidity and nice flavors that you would find in a really fresh coffee so when you're buying the pre-ground coffee from the supermarket or you're buying pre-owned coffee which was ground two weeks ago a week ago you're losing all of these nice fresh juicy flavors at the coffee could have now this kind of leads on to grinding the coffee yourself and the ways you can do that but first let's talk about also the other thing with pre-ground coffee the other thing with pre our coffee is that it's ground to one specific grind size and that grind size doesn't take into account what method you're using to brew it what sort of times you're looking to get and what sort of flavors that you want to get out of that coffee you're just relying on on the grind size working and that's not really the best way to brew coffee every method requires a very different right size there's a big difference between a French press and an espresso you can't use the same guys size they're very very different so why is whole being better what whole being allows you to do is allows you to grind it yourself at home it allows you to grind it much closer to the time you're going to be brewing that coffee hopefully in a minute or brewing that coffee and what it allows you to do is it allows you to play around with growing size yourself so you can fine tune your brewing so tastes much better and much more what you want it to taste like rather than being dictated by what person you've ground it up wanted it to be grinding at home it can be quite expensive and grinders there's a huge range of prices the best way to start if you haven't got a grinder and you're looking to make the transition from free ground to ground to grinding it yourself is to buy a little hand grinder you can keep it these up for about 30 pound will leave all the links in the description below for five different price points it ranges from thirty pound for a hand grinder or if you want to invest a little bit more which we recommend doing then you should get a one for around a hundred pounds around them run a good point that's a bit for to leave the script link in the description there is a difference between the different price points obviously the main difference is growing consistency what your grab grounds to extract at the same rate and if you have a big particle and a small particle they have those two particles are going to extract at different rates which is going to cause different flavors to come through and a less and clear cut and clear flavors now the more expensive the grinder is more consistent those grinds are gonna be but as I said if you're just starting off you're just making the transition from free ground to ground coffee to whole bean coffee then worrying about a 300 pound winder and the consistency is it not gonna make huge difference you're going to notice huge difference when you start grinding yourself compared to buying a career yarn and it's a great place to start so thanks for watching the video and what I want you to do is comment below whether you're using pre ground or whole beam and why and if you're using whole beam walk grinder and easy and what suggestions do you have everybody else that may be making the transition around the whole thing and make sure you check in next week we're doing a coffee 101 series where every week we're gonna be releasing a video on a different episode different topic so this week's topic was all being vices ground next week topic we're gonna be talking about how water quality affects your coffee so make sure you subscribe make sure you share this cut this video and make sure you give it a thumbs up and we'll catch you next week ciao [Music]", "HgamxRvxHzw": "Hi, I am Thompson I have been roasting coffee for a long long time and This last weekend. I lent out my air popcorn popper that I use When I'm at home when I'm not at sweet Maria's [to] a friend and had no coffee so I decided I would roast some coffee on the only thing I had which was a cast-iron skillet [and] to be honest, we [talked] on their website about roasting coffee in a skillet And I haven't done it [for] a really long time so I actually had What I thought was some pretty good success roasting coffee in a skillet, and I thought I would go over How I approached it this last weekend given The long Hiatus I have been doing it and the experience I have roasting coffee so many other different [ways], so I'm going to try to Make this whole video myself and make the audio not completely sucky which is kind of difficult Given that, I need to turn on my fan. Which is up here and that's the lowest setting but the problem with roasting inside is you're going to need a You're going to need some exhaust and I've got my skillet here Which I've been heating up, so I'm going to go ahead and pan down the self-made video And I was checking the temperature and we're about 250 I want to get up a little [bit] higher. The conventional wisdom for dropping coffee into a roasting drum is 300 degrees 350 s fine to prevent scorching and So that's the big issue with Roasting coffee in a pan is scorching [I] would say in general. It's impossible not to scorch coffee in a pan and Pretty much scorch coffee is not well roasted but given the fact that roasting in a pan is just using just what you have and Costs nothing, but the coffee. I think we should really try to do [our] best with this I'm up at 262 I'm going to turn on my other little camera over here and You'll notice one of the most important things to have \"Hello\" oven mitt. I've also got a baking pan here and what I have is about a cup I actually don't have a good scale here right now either I loaned that out too. So this is a cup of a really nice dense coffee. This is Ethiopia Yukiro Coop from Agaro area of the West and that's good because a Really soft coffee like a Brazil or something like that is going to scorch a lot easier so a coffee That's dense and super high grown is a good choice for roasting in Pan [and] My temperature is good and I'll set a timer And we're going to start So the first thing I want to do is just not have constant contact with the coffee, without moving it in some way and Golly Gee I Had a wooden spoon here, and I just misplaced it. So I'm gonna grab what I've got So one of the things I discovered this weekend when I was roasting Was that you know shaking and shaking the pan is really the best way to do this Not necessarily stirring with the spoon the problem is a cast-iron skillets incredibly heavy So if you've got the technique where you can sort of you know flip over a flapjack in a pan That being a pancake That's probably one of the best ways to agitate the coffee in here So what I was doing where I got that good roast. I was moving the coffee from one side of [the] pan to the other Shaking it out letting it lay flat for you know 15 seconds and then flipping it around And the problem with this roasting method is you have to be very patient and it takes a long time and [a] lot of work. But your reward is minimal scorching and Actually a very good tasting coffee in fact Here is my coffee from the weekend. [I] can see that. It's got a quaker, but that's a light roast of a Kenya and I do see some signs of scorching there But it's fairly minimal so I think coming at this from some the experience of roasting and drum roasters and all kinds of different machines and sample roasting is Understanding a little bit about how you want to see this bean development happening And what you don't want to see which is early scorch marks and here's a here's a very light bean. It's actually a sort of a defect bean, and I saw a little bit of what you call facing. Facing is scorching that happens on the flat side of the beam and the two places you're gonna see scorching are going to be on the flat side as Well as on the tips called amazingly enough \"tipping\". So I'm starting to smell some some light roasting smells. I'm going to turn up my burner little That's what I've got right now But I'm basically seeing some good development here. We're getting a little bit of yellowing I can smell a little bit of that bready pleasant flavor slightly Herbal Flavor So as I said I had a kind of a bias against this type of roasting this is not For me the first type of roasting [I] would want to do I would want to do roasting in a hot air popper hot Air stream [and] the reason is because of the heat transfer the sort of Thermodynamics of... Heat transferred through a hot air stream rather than this which is conduction Now you might say to yourself well All those coffee roasters you see at shops, It's a big Metal drum spinning coffee around and it's a lot of those actually the good ones are cast iron drums Because they don't warp Over time as you roast in the heat and and cool but actually Roasting in a shop roaster is really not conduction you're not conducting heat from the hotter metal to the beam and The reason is is that if you look carefully at a shop roaster, You'll see a lot of blades on the inside of the drum a sort of a structure there As well as along the outside of the drum and what's happening is as it turns Coffee's dropping off the side of the drum in through the air hitting that structure in the middle and what it's doing is keeping the coffee as Airborne as possible, so The coffee is basically touch. They're trying to have it tumble in the middle of the drum essentially it may come up the side and fall and When they've sort of been able to measure how heat is transferred in a drum and the thermal dynamics of Even a cast-iron drum roaster and test that Probat did, what they were finding was that it's actually convective heat its Transfer of heat between coffee between the coffee and itself so coffee is essentially sharing heat by heating the warm air around it and [there's] a lot of care in those types of roasters to not heat the drum directly most of those roasters Have if they have a gas flame they have a thermal shield That's deflecting the heat, and you're really heating the air that's going into the drum anyway. I'm getting some nice browning You'll see that. It's uneven it's not Exactly what I would see if I was roasting right now in the our probot Roaster however, it's really not that bad and What you'll [find] out in roasting in any kind of roasting is that you can get some really big problems in these? development Stages of the Roast That later on you [won't] see in the roasted coffee All the coffee will be brown. It'll look fine however that coffee is essentially hiding defects make sure my other little cameras going here, so you can see the is what looks like an even roast at the end of a roast [where] coffees brown like this and yet, [the] [signs] of Roasting defects early in the roast are sort of obscured but you will have those signs in the form of bad roast tastes skunky Roast tastes kind of unpleasant Like Harsher bittering skunky is a roast defect flavor. You can have biscuity flavors of sort of Under roast where the inside of the coffee beans not as rested as the outside or Sort of wheaty, oaty flavors oat oat oat like flavors. See a defect being, take that out Or you have the scorched flavors? and a lot of those are this kind of baked or roast taste, but without sweetness, so sweetness is really a sign of the quality of the roast [but] tell you what's so cool about this, and why I got so excited to roast again this weekend There's not another roast process that I can think of where you sit and it all happens right in front of you like this Even in a big roaster where you have a sample trier Where you essentially can put a spoon in and pull out a portion of the coffee like this and look at it You never get to sit And see all [of] the coffee roasting right in front of you So I'm going to adjust my heat a little bit The other thing I really liked what I did On the weekend was I had a very long extended first crack Which is something that I like to do without stalling the roast in a drum roaster? so I felt like I had really good control of it, so [there's] a lot of value in this for people of any roast Experience of coffee roasting even somebody that's roasted 20 years to roast in a pan and see the whole process Happen right in front of you And I feel like this development is quite quite good quite even and I don't see marks Of high heat I put I put the coffee in at 300 So the one issue, I'm going to have is that especially as we hit first crack [we're] going to be releasing more chaff from this coffee And chaff being the skin you can see some in the bottom of the pan there and I'm kind of limited with my options about [how] to get rid of the chaff I think this coffee is fairly low chaff, but others are going to have quite a lot more and I'm going to go ahead and [adjust] my heat up a little a little bit more So I'm going to get a little bit of a mess what I did the other day I just take the pan over to the sink and the sink is kind of I wet the sink down and Let the chaff kind of blow the chaff out and it sticks to the wet surfaces So I go ahead in between these agitators [and] let the coffee sit and gain some heat Like I said, this is probably the most conductive roasting process that of of any type that you would do at home or or in a or in a commercial roaster Without there being an Airflow passing through the coffee either part of moving the coffee as it is in an air roaster or fluidized bed roast system or mechanical movement of the coffee as you would have in a, in a drum roaster with an Airflow moving through the through the drum and every drum roaster has air flow moving through the drum, so but what I loved about this is A. I roasted some pretty good coffee and was kind of stoked the next morning and B. there's zero investment. [I] mean I had to get the green coffee. I got a good deal on [that]. But I didn't, there's nothing else. I need to buy and I consider that to [be] pretty cool So I went a little flat there for a while on the warm up and now I think it's progressing a little bit better but I think the other issue here is is um, is that this takes especially with a cast iron pan [a] bit of Fatigue on my arm to do this, but I really feel like this shaking is the best way I just don't feel like with a spoon I can do a good job. Now in Ethiopia, they drink a lot of coffee and they roast a lot of coffee still in the traditional coffee ceremony which is essentially like this roasting in a small, Oftentimes, it's Clay or metal pan Using a an implement. That's kind of like a wire with a little hook and they use that and pull against it and I think it's probably better. It looks more like something [you'd] have in a fireplace rather than a spoon And if you can hear that I'm starting to get a little bit of first crack here And I'm seeing a little more chaff releasing What I like is that it's a very slow controlled first crack So I talked about the arm fatigue. So why am I using a cast iron skillet rather than stainless steel or something much lighter? There's some first craft real snap Well, I just like the way that cast iron distributes the heat and if I took it off the heat here for a while And put it back on I really wouldn't be Losing anything in terms of the heat Retention so it's it's a even distribution of heat through the coffee I'm sure there's other types of materials and pans that would work well, I think an induction burner with a you know a correct type pan that has a kind of a heat distributing bottom would be fantastic [for] for roasting coffee and I really like how much this just involves seeing it I can see the whole batch and Sensing it and hearing it [besides] the sound of my fan above my stove. There's really no distractions We've got some nice first [Crack] going very slow controls [I] Definitely see a few quakers here, but those aren't really from the roast process those are part of the how the green coffee is with this batch I can just pick those out and No to the [eye]. It's not the most even roasting. I think we'll see a more even roast color later on but as I said Even roast color in the end is not an indication. Here's a quaker right here [even] [roast] color in the end is not an indication that the roast necessarily happened even through the first stages of the batch And you have to admit that if you roast copy yourself this way Take some labor my arms getting a little bit tired here You kind of feel [like] you earned it I? always call [that] the kraft macaroni and cheese effect you go backpacking with Kraft macaroni and cheese and It's a taste like the most incredible meal after a long day in [a] remote camp and then you say why why don't I eat this more often at home and you you get them and you make? It at home you think How could I possibly have thought this was the best stuff? And then of course you realize [that] the the box of Kraft macaroni and cheese that [you] got Was probably a one of their specialty [reserved] lots? certified Fairtrade Specialty Macaroni and cheese, and that's why it tasted so good That's a joke. I'm kidding So we're still in first crack. I haven't heard anything of second crack yet and I'm not going to roast this coffee - second Crack [I] Do see that I've got a couple darker beans in here it's definitely a even at its, best a crude way of roasting And I feel like I'm starting to hear just some signs of a first crack blended with a second crack I'm definitely going to cut my heat. [I] think it looks really good Just for the sake of this video go ahead and put [my] Half pound batch Sizable batch on this cookie tray right here and That's what we got And it's probably going to be delicious It's probably not going to be the finest coffee. I'm probably going to enjoy. It's probably not be best roast But what's really cool is I did this myself In a cast-iron skillet, [it's] a half pound so it's bigger than most home roast batches And you know it looks pretty good I'm going [to] pick out a couple of These light beams and a lot of the other things you see in here that look light or chaff because I did not do any Chaff removal you can see the chaff there That's blowing off now. I got to clean that up that's the kind of Roasting [that] you can do with the only cost being some green coffee Cool. I'm going to take this out and Maybe switch it to another cookie sheet. That's cool, but I want to share that with you [home] roasting doesn't have to be expensive coffee roasting I Think at any level a coffee roaster. Who's done this for a long [time] or Somebody who's just starting could learn a lot from? roasting this way and unlike myself who didn't do it for like 15 years [I] highly recommend roasting in a cast-iron skillet Thanks, a lot", "o9Ytr0gTZvM": "[Music] [Music] yeah that's a strong note hi guys I'm Raja so welcome back to this new episode I hope you guys are having an amazing day yeah

coffee beans why should you bother ok well the logical theory would be that fresher is better and that's why we have coffee roasters that roasts fresh coffee yet that makes sense but the problem is is that when coffee is too fresh it doesn't taste anywhere near as good as it should do now this this probably doesn't compute with with what you're thinking you're thinking you know straight out the oven as best you know serve it fresh fresh is best yes that's true for food and things like that but coffee no doesn't work if you were to smell a batch of coffee that had just come out of the roaster it smells like dog food it's got like a beefy meaty smell to it it's not really that pleasant at all to be honest however you bagged that batch up seal it up leave it for two weeks and then open it and oh my god it's amazing the transformation is unbelievable so I would say don't get hung up in fact I would actually say avoid fresh coffee as in fret to fresh okay you want some numbers I would say a minimum absolute minimum of three days for drinking coffee but even then you're probably only getting less than 50% of what it could be a week is good two weeks brilliant - three weeks rest you're going to get something really good but the problem is is that a lot of people they don't plan ahead or you know you order coffee you want to drink it you drink it now and then you never actually get to taste it at its full potential so my advice and this this is not a sales tactic my advice is to order ahead make sure you have plenty in stock you know it will last for six weeks you know so don't worry about you know you're not going to end up throwing it in the bin because you haven't used it so order an order ahead get it in give it two weeks perfect to rest and then you are going to enjoy 100% of what that coffee bean can offer you okay right thank you for watching see you again next time", "x1MjT4wt_Do": "so in this video it's gonna be a little different I'm gonna show you how to roast your own coffee beans so as we know hopefully you know coffee beans or seeds actually are green and to roast em they turn black or dark brown these coffee beans are so much better home roasted than if you buy them in the store in the store those coffee beans are really old and they don't taste as good so if you roast your own at home the coffee is so amazing it is it is so good you open that jar up in the morning and it smells so good it's fresh trust me you need to start roasting your own coffee beans and it's super simple so let's get started on a first run through the products you will need to roast your own coffee at home first thing you'll need is a measuring cup that reads a half a cup another thing you will need is a metal colander this helps cool down your coffee but we'll go over that later another thing you'll need is a popcorn popper this popcorn popper needs to kind of rotate spin around not the ones that blow up because those kind burn your coffee at the bottom when they rotate it kind of like stirs your coffee so it evenly roasts and then of course the last thing that you need is green coffee beans are you sweat marinus of course there are other coffee companies out there but this is just where we've always purchased our beans and I can put a link down below if you want to find the company what I like about them is their prices are reasonable and they have a great selection so I think we're ready to start roasting coffee so they have different size packages you can order this one's the big size this one's a little size this is more of the sample Hackett and if you order a bunch of sample packets it's cheaper plus you get to try and figure out which one you like okay so the first thing you want to do is you want to get a measuring cup and this is a half a cup you want to take your beans your green beans and half a cup of beans or seeds and putting them in your popcorn popper and just continue to do that until you have enough beans they it usually lasts our family about a week and then we another thing you'll want to remember to do is make sure you turn on your ventilate ventilation system like open a door up in a window because your smoke alarm will Koha with all the smoke from I like to place my popcorn maker over the sink so the shape falls off into the sink and just put the lid on so it doesn't blow it all over and then turn it on and you're ready to listen for the first or another happening alright guys so the second crack happened and you are ready to take these beans and put them in the colander this just kind of helps cool them down and then just continue the process so it depends on how many beans you want this isn't very much so I need to continue with the process so it can be it can take a long time but it is totally worth it so once your beans have cooled down you're ready to place them in a jar you can put them in any container that you want but I always put them in a mason jar it's just easier and I'll explain why so then I take a paper plate and I take my beans and I use the paper plate to help the beans get in the jar this just makes it so the beans don't usually get all out and make a giant mess anyways and then you will want to take the lid and place it on here but do not tighten it do not tighten the lid because the oxygen from the beans needs to escape and then your beans are ready to try out in the morning do not try them out yet because they are not ready okay guys it's been morning I wish you could smell them they smell so good but now that it's morning you can tighten the lids now now all the air has extinct I think it is time to try it your coffee nice so just put it in the coffee in there of course and you get to grab it look how pretty this looks it's nice and dark and rich okay so I hope you enjoyed this video on roasting your own copy beans at home so let's give it a try oh yeah this is so good it is fresh if you are a copy lover there

to my channel to support it you can also find me on other social medias to talk to you later", "O-iw4Dy9-s8": "it seems pretty cano and today I want to talk to you about home roasting I am working on a couple of reviews for some hand grinders but I wanted to knock this out and get this done first it's really more of a primer just to get you excited about home roasting I feel like everybody at least once should roast their own beans it's super easy to do in fact you can do it with what you have in the house already all you have to do is get the green beans and there is no shortage of people selling green beans online at this time so you know if you've got no money or you're not sure if it's something for you start with what you have you've got a skillet I know that you have a whisk you might have a popcorn maker that was suitable for this as well you could do something with a barbecue and a rotisserie you could also buy yourself a dedicated coffee roaster this is the SR 500 from fresh roast this over here is hearth where precision I bought this for five dollars at a garage sale five miles from my house not saying everyone's gonna have that kind of luck but it just goes to show that if you look around you can find a really good deal and there's there's things on eBay and Craigslist so if you can buy secondhand do that until you really know this is something for you and then after that you can spend some money anywhere between 350 to 500 for a pretty good quality roaster that will do larger sizes because if you're going to do drip coffee Chemex that sort of thing you're going to go through larger volumes of coffee than I am with my espresso and these are small batches I would only roast about 1/3 to 1/4 even though manufacturers suggest a 1/2 a cup I try to keep that under but you can do half and full pounds will say like to be more this was the drum out of my be more before I burnt it down another thing to keep in mind never leave your Roasters unattended I did that with the be more and it caught on fire three separate times and the third time was the charm or not so charm and I lost the be more in almost the house you've got to be careful with a lot of these because you're taking in some cases for me you're taking your grind into the second crack or just before the second crack and this is where the the fire hazard usually comes in depending on the chaff collection every roasting mechanism appliance that you get is going to be a little bit different than how it controls the three main parts to which is typically considered temperature time and airflow now some of them don't have air flow for instance the skillet you have to keep moving things around agitate it with this you should be doing this underneath say like an arrange or a microwave oven that can suck that air and if you're doing it in the house I'd recommend doing this outside you want to keep moving this around you absolutely have to be there the whole time otherwise you'll just scorch your beans something like this BBQ here I took my be more drum you can buy these drums off of ebay and I just stuck the skewer right through with these little wedges it will rotate and move the beans around so that they're not staying in contact with the heat source for too long when it comes to the air Roasters there's the fresh roast there's nesco there's quite a few out there this tends to be a popular model and they have the 500 the 700 the 700 gives you some options you can plug it into your computer through the USB and you can really dial in profile temperature time and airflow so it's not too bad for I think 275 dollars to have all that control but if I'm going to spend that kind of money I might actually choose the be more sixteen hundred plus because you can with the plus have some control over those things as well and you're going to get a much larger batch size up to 16 ounces I think I hate about these in particular is they're dangerous someone like me will break this glass or even this plastic at some point or another because they don't have any way to lock it in they just sort of set there it just wants to fall over pretty easily everything just pops off nothing locks in and that bothers me and I've knocked this over a few times and have caught it kept it from breaking but eventually that will happen I don't understand why they didn't lock this in another thing that is a concern of mine is they have this straight bottom flat bottom on the chamber here and if you look inside there's also a lip where the beans will collect here and not actually move through as the air is flowing through I don't understand why they did that if you look over here at this hearth where it has more of a funnel shape bottom and that allows naturally for the beans to slide it also has a nice little bell on top and what that does is as the air blows the beans up it deflects them out so it gets a nice movement of the beans and I feel like I score CH less with the precision than I do with say the fresh grouse because the fresh frost as I said the movement isn't isn't good I've seen people talk about ways to to mod these steps these ledges and keep the beans sort of sliding through but I don't understand why I didn't come that way that should have been something designed by them and why they've made this so dangerous and not lock it in the fresh rose tier will lock in and it will stay put as well as the safe collection been here too I roasted the same beans with these three air poppers and then the barbecue and I tried to get them in the same range the same look it takes different times some we're faster than others to get to that same look as I said that's more like two and a half minutes the barbecue took twelve to fourteen minutes to get in there these are more about six to eight minutes to get into that medium dark roast just prior to first crack just before first crack now not all beans are best suited for your type of root process so for espresso versus a pour-over Aeropress that sort of thing also you need to think of whether you're gonna do like a single origin or a blend single origin typically are going to be a higher quality Arabica bean versus a blend they'll generally sneak in some lower quality robusta and that's typically something that those of us that do espresso sometimes we want more crema production you're going to get that with some robusta so we'll lower the cup quality I would say of our brew just to get a little bit more crema if that's what you enjoy if you do get a blend consider buying the beans separately finding out what a good blend might be experimenting getting some some feedback and blending it yourself at home after you've roasted each of those beans individually if you buy the blend from the wholesaler all these beans have different profiles that they need to get to that same color or darkness that you want to go to so if you try to reach a medium dark roast overall on the blood you're gonna get some that are over roasted a little darker and some that are under roasted a little bit lighter because they all have a different water content and other characteristics some are smaller beans and larger beans in here and some require more time so it's best to do the blend yourself after when you start to roast your own beings you'll notice the difference between a bean that is fresh and stale when you stop putting sugar and cream in there and I think a lot of the companies like Starbucks it's in their best interest to to get us all excited about these creamy and sweet drinks that they want to sell us in part because they make a whole lot of money on a latte but in part because they're hiding a poorly roasted being or a stale bean you own a Starbucks and you grab a bag off the shelf and you'll see that according to them that bag of beans should be good for six to eight months and they generally never tell you when it was roasted because that would clue you in the fact that these are months two months three months there's also the concern about the coffee off the shelf not getting rotated do they just keep putting fresh coffee in front everybody should try a bean that has been roasted within three days to two weeks and ground moments before it's hard to beat the aromatics of a freshly roasted and freshly ground bean it's almost as good or better than in the beverage now when it comes to arresting the beans that you freshly roasted it can vary based on your preference but also your brew method as espresso goes because of the emulsification and the pressure being added to that coffee bed you're going to find that if you don't let that being rest for three days at least and maybe longer you'll have not allowed the beans to off gas enough so there's a lot of co2 that still needs to be released from the roasting process and if you use that within 24 hours as some people like to for other methods like Aeropress and pour overs Chemex you'll find that you're going to have a lot of crema but it's not high-quality crema and the bubbles are huge and you have to let that settle for you to enjoy this press so that's underneath and by the time that's happened you've allowed your espresso the cool and it's not as enjoyable as well we first rushed the first 24 hours put the lid on but leave it loose so that you allow that off-gassing to happen because it is the first 24 hours of the most of that happens and then it starts to drop off as you go you know a few days out and then do a week but first day I'll go ahead and leave that open not locked down after the first day I'll pop that close and leave it in that way at the very least I hope this video has demonstrated to you how easy and accessible home roasting can be it doesn't need to require a lot of investment on your part you might already have what you need in the house or you might be able to find something down the road at a garage sale or you can find something that's inexpensive like an air roaster to get your feet wet and to see if it's something you might be interested in but you do it to yourself to find out what that process is like and how good your coffee can taste and what a fresh bean tastes like so you know at least the difference between what you're buying off the shelf these days and what you could be making in your home so don't forget if you liked the video like it if you disliked it dislike it I just want your feedback I want to know what you're interested in what you'd like to see more of put that stuff in the comments below until next time this is the end of per Nakano stay and enjoy the brew process", "4ZSz92W3VzE": "[Music] hey everybody Naville swinging here clips in football I got to

right here in Dallas Texas July 30th 2008 I'm sitting around this little rundown apartment in Dallas where I live and and I'm sitting on this couch and I've got my meth dealer this guy named Tex sitting next to me that caught you off guard didn't it yeah this clean-cut polish looking guy you see in front of you today I'm an addict y'all I'm an addict in long-term recovery but in 2008 yeah recovery is good every addict needs a program recovery in 2008 I was a full-blown meth addict and I'm right down the road in Dallas Texas and I'm I've sitting on that couch and I got text my meth dealer sitting next to me I'm smoking that pipe and I'm passing it back and forth and I'm telling Tex hey Tex I think the end is near man I think the cops are gonna come get me pretty soon you see ten days before this this guy have been doing all these burglaries within Dallas this guy named Dustin had been picked up by the Dallas Police Department so I know it's just a matter of time before they get to me and just as I passed the pipe back to text or the windows shatter off to my right you know and tumbling across my living room floor since little canister going end over end and it starts to register what's going on in my mind it's almost like it's so much real from the movies I'm watching that canister and I got up on the couch and I got over this thing and but the flashbang grenade goes off my face bright white light loud noise blows me back on the couch and when I came to when I can see it here again this cop and full SWAT riot gear this Dallas police officer had his boot on my chest and the bear of a machine gun is digging to my socket and I can feel the barrel because my eyeball y'all it's cold and stinger mind he's got his finger above the trigger and he's screaming at me don't move don't move I'm and I looked at this cop and I blinked and I was like man don't worry you know don't worry yeah I'm not going anywhere man and so cops start flooding in my apartment and one of them screams out we got him we got the uptown burglar the Uptown burglar people from this area probably remember this story the uptown burglaries y'all it doesn't matter how much good I can put back in the world how much I can put back into the stream of life and I certainly try everyday I will never escape that name the Uptown burglar you see about a dozen other meth addicts and myself young and old male and female and black and white and everything in between because addiction of drugs don't discriminate they don't care who you are your race your gender your socioeconomic status but we indiscriminately and without reservation broke into the homes of dozens of people and the Uptown neighborhood of Dallas to feed our insatiable meth habits but on July 30th 2008 the Uptown burglars came to me and they had their man and they took me down to Dallas County Jail where they processed me and fingerprint mug shot they look at the guy in front of you today know that guy's dead that's the transformation that happened and I'm about to tell you the story that transformation absolutely if that guy can change the guy you see in front of you today then everybody in this room can achieve whatever you want to in life you know I said around that jail for 10 months waiting to go to trial and at the end of ten months I got my day in court here in Dallas may 18th 2009 I got my Daniel actually I got six days in court and six days is a long criminal trial in the state of Texas man it's a long trial for crimes where nobody was physically hurt not aggravated crimes and at the end of six days the jury of my peers deliberated for ten minutes on my sentence ten minutes I don't know how much law and order you watch but if a jury's gone for ten minutes smoked you and when I came back into that courtroom that judge who hasn't smiled the entire time was grinning from ear to ear he gathered it back in Bam Bam Bam he said Damon Joseph West you are hereby sentenced to 65 years in the Texas Department of Criminal Justice life 16 above his life I got a life sentence my first time out my first felony conviction now obviously I didn't do life in prison I did seven years and three months in the maximum-security penitentiary in Beaumont Texas and it was a roughest hardest thing I've ever been through my life but it made me the man I am today so let's back this story up we're gonna start off at Port Arthur Texas where I grew up I grew up in a town called Port Arthur my dad Bob West was a sports writer there and my mom was a nurse and I had an older brother named Brandon younger brother named Grayson nice knit a little happy family but we had problems too I mean everybody's family's got problems 1985 I came out and told my parents that my babysitter had been molesting me and this is childhood sexual abuse back in the eighties y'all didn't know as much about it back then as they know now so my family loved me they sent me to talk to a counselor a family priest and we prayed about it but something inside that little nine-year-old boy went to a really dark place and by the time I was 10 I started putting in chemicals to change the way I felt I started getting into my addiction drinking beer drinking liquor out of friend's parents liquor Kevin smoking cigarettes by the time I'm 12 I'm smoking pot so the worst part about this is is I've got a bad belief system and let me tell you something about bad belief systems the longer you hold on to a bad belief system the harder they are to get rid of because a bad belief system tells us how to do something the wrong way all of our lives and it's hard to change that and bad belief systems usually went out in the end at 10 and 12 years old my bad belief system was all I'm doing is uh all I'm doing is drink a little beer smoke a little pot I'm not hurting anybody I'm not even hurting myself but I couldn't be more wrong but hey yo this is Texas and God gave me a lightning bolt for right arm and I was the best I was a starting quarterback from a high school 518 for three years in high school got a lot of breaks cut to me in life got a scholarship to play football here right here in the Metroplex at the University of North Texas came here in 1994 to UNT played football there and when I got to college I lost sight of the important things in life because that foundation that environment around me my parents my family my town was not there to keep me in check and I really only cared about two things in college I wanted to be the starting quarterback for my Division one team and I wanted to party and I did both really well but life has a way of knocking you down giving you these days and I like to call fork in the road days and a fork in the road day it's when life's knocks you down so hard and when you get up and dust yourself off the world looks different things are in different places you know but instead of me telling you about a forked Road in my life I want to show you my fork in the road September 21st 1996 we take the field against Texas A&M I'm 20 years old I'm a starting quarterback I thought I had arrived until this day right here here's my fork in the road with a single setback two flankers to tie it ends they go on a play-action back to the 20 now to the 25 a Leola more than west across the 35 to about the 37 and they will come out and show a shotgun facing a second down and four from their own 37 yard line a running back on either side takes the snap delay out of the backfield and that should be hot all right all rent goes to about the 39 yard line he'll be too shy of the first down one of the linebackers for Texas A&M that'll win a top 100 high school recruit just made that for the Aggies began a shotgun for Damon West two running back all ran off to his left here's the snap he drops back to about the 32 throws in the flats to Coleman he makes the reception and he will be paddled up at the line of scrimmage he fought at the the 38 he got to the 39 and that will be here first of all do we have any Aggies in the room I knew it everywhere you go in America there's Aggies man hey they're great they're great I love the Aggies Dave South that legendary announcer from Texas A&M he said that will be it he's talking about the end of the series we went three and out and had to punt but we're not here Dave's say that will be it I think about my college football career you see I didn't get up after that last play I separated my shoulder on Cal field that day and had to go in and they had to cut my collarbone out and I never played college football again so when I got up to that fork in the road in life and football was gone which I had put all my identity into being a football player I made some bad choices that fork in the road y'all cuz my bad belief system kicked in you know drinking a little beer smoked a little pot well now I'm doing cocaine ecstasy pills I'm putting in every chemical I can to change the way I feel because I don't like being Damon West any more football's not attached somehow I graduated college in 1999 I move off to Washington DC I get a job working in the United States Congress after that I go work for a guy running for president United States and I raise money for him all over the country and in 2004 when he dropped out of the race I moved back here to Dallas Texas to train to be a stockbroker for one of the biggest Wall Street banks in the world UBS United Bank of Switzerland and it was at that job is it training as a broker that I learned about different financial instruments with which to invest your money you know they've got stocks and bonds and mutual funds with commodities commodities always interested me because commodity is a tangible thing you could touch we oil platinum gold silver but I learned about two commodities that are traded on a life exchange not the stock exchange those two two commodities are misery and time their first commodity of the board misery misery is the only thing in life that I've found that it's free y'all and what's mystery is gone all you got to do is tell life give me more and I'll give you all you want and by the truckload mismo people stay miserable because that is a choice but time time is antithetical to misery because time is the most precious resource in the world and once it's gone it's gone for good and all the money in the world can't buy one more second of this stuff called time tell you about misery time so it's 2004 I'm at the job it's a broker I'm passed out asleep at my desk cause I've been up partying for a couple of days and the sudden the broker comes up he's freaking out he's like Damon wake up man he said you can't sleep when this job he'll fire you for that you're messing with fuel his money the markets are open he said come on down to the parking garage I got something to pick you up so I think we're gonna go down to the parking garage and do a little cocaine because that was my drug of choice and o4 but when we got into his car and he handed me that glass pipe of those crystal rocks in it I freaked out on him like man what is that he said Damon relax it's crystal meth he said you'll love this stuff and y'all truer words have never been spoken I fell in love with that drug today that's easily the most addictive most destructive drug ever created by man and I gave everything away from that drug my job my home my car my tethering to God my sanity I went from working on Wall Street to living room the streets of Dallas y'all sleeping on park benches sleeping behind buildings living in dope houses with other dope addicts because that's what I am as a dope fiend and we started doing property crimes we start breaking into people's storage units we start breaking into people's cars and eventually we escalated to home burglaries and whenever I did burglaries you know my victims lost something more than their property there's a lot of property that was stolen at the Uptown burglaries but my victims lost way more than that I stole my victims since the security off and anybody's ever been the victim of a home invasion or a burglary knows exactly what I'm talking about and they have to live with that for the rest of their lives and so do i but on July 30th 2008 the Dallas SWAT team put an end to those uptown burglaries and that's the day they arrested me as I tell audiences all over the country that was the day they rescued me they got me out of a situation I couldn't get myself out of so now we're back where the story started where they booked me in and they throw me in the general population to County Jail and County Jail and Dallas County was rough I mean they throw me in a bad pod the little guy like me goes in there and I'm fighting immediately and I'm scared and so I want to talk to my parents at this point I don't even know if they know where I am so I call home from jail and my father answers the phone my father's from my older generation of men he's in his 70s you know I've never seen my dad cry but I heard him cry one time when I called it from jail and he was screaming and crying on the phone like Damon how we go so wrong man how we mess up with so bad and what could we have done different so he's crying and now I'm crying because I've broken my old man so my mom gets on the phone my mom's a nurse she's a strong-willed Christian woman she's got a great faith in God so she grabs that phone she says Damon your dad can't talk right now I've never seen him like this before in my life she said but we need to have a serious conversation she said Damon we love you unconditionally she said there's nothing you could do to make it's not love you Damon she said that was the deal we made with God when he loaned you to us she said do you understand Damon that we love you unconditionally and from that phone in Dallas County Jail behind those tears I was telling my mom said yeah mom I got it you love me unconditionally and she said that's good baby because we just gave you back to God she said your property the state of Texas now Damon we can't do anything for you she said but God can't she said you are now a captive audience to God and you better start listening then she asked me a question she said Damon do you remember that prayer plaque that I had on your wall as a kid growing up yeah you got to know my mom my mom was one of those moms I had a prayer plaque or a cross in every room in the house I mean she's got crosses everywhere to this day I don't mean some of y'all maybe moms like that you may have had a mom like that but that was my mom but she's asking me about the one that was above my bed in my bedroom on Roanoke Street Port Arthur where I grew up and I've been knowing I've been on drugs for four years my brains fried and I can't even think straight so I was like mom what are you talking about what prayer plan she said baby its footprints in the sand she said do you remember the story of footprints in the sand and I told my mom was like mom I don't know what you're talking about so she patiently and lovingly reach told me the story of footprints in the sand about a guy welcome to the beach with God right she said they're watching the video was life play out in the sky she said every time something good happen in man's life there's two sets of footprints walking side by side she said but every time something bad happened when there was pain there's hurt they're suffering there's loss things that happen in the human life the guy saw one set of footprints and feels finally the guy calls God out he says God what's up every time something good happens in my life man your walk with me side by side but but when bad things happen you keep abandoning me I see one set of footprints and she said Damon that's when God laughed and said you fool every time you saw one set of footprints I didn't abandon you I Cary's you boys sure to scream them like a football coach she said Damon get on God's back she said there's one set of footprints in that Jail and they're not yours she said get on God's back I don't want to lose my son so y'all that night I started talking to a god that I hadn't talked to in 12 years since I got hurt in college football and this isn't some kind of jailhouse conversion story some kind of Paul on the road to Damascus I'm Way away from that at this point my in my incarceration I'm I'm still an addict trying to get high in thinking about the day I get out matter of fact let me tell you about my prayer to God was in Dallas County Jail the whole 10 months I hope I haven't spent 13 months total in there and get on my knees every night and my bunk and Dallas County Jail and I'd say the same prayer dear God please get me out of this and if you do I'm barking with God right like that works so dear God please get me out of this Jam if you do here's what I'll do for you man I got a great deal for you look I'll be a normal guy again I'll go get a job and I'll just smoke meth on the weekends man I got this yeah that's the best thing to come up with y'all he never opened that email it's like one of those spam viruses you don't open right and I know that because when I went to trial ten months later and that jury came back in 10 minutes with life man it took my breath take my mom's breath away I heard my mom gasp from the front rows you know the sound only a mother can make when she hears her son get a life sentence in prison and after they sentenced me man everything sped up the bailiffs were on me the sheriff saw me they threw lawns behind my back they slam the handcuffs on me drugged me on that courtroom headfirst and all I could think to say on the way out of there is I'm sorry mom they put me this little room on the side of the court at the side of the courthouse got a bulletproof glass right there they told me to wait five minutes later my parents walk in they're gonna give one last visit with me before I go to prison my dad walks in at first he's in stunned disbelief he's stoic he just saw his son and with all this promise in life get a life sentence in prison so my mom does all the talking that strong-willed nurse that Christian woman she does all the talking and she says baby she said debts in life demand to be paid and that's the lesson of life but we all know that right if you owe a debt you're gonna pay that debt right she said debts in life demand to be paid Damon and she said you did the things they said you did at that trial though so you had to go and pay the debt to society you had to go to prison now Damon with a life sentence you oh that debt she said but you owe your father and I debt to Damon she said we gave you all the opportunity love and support to be anything you want to be in this life and this is how you repay us she said that's not gonna work Damon that's not gonna work at all that's not fair to us she said we raised you at Port Arthur Texas a giant melting pot of a city gave you a great moral compass but you chose not used so here's the debt you're gonna pay to us she said when you go to that prison you will get on God's back like I told you to and she said you will not get one of these white hate groups what are these the Aryan Brotherhood type games cuz you're scared cuz you minority in there she said that's not gonna work she said you will not get any tattoos while you're in there y'all look I spent I spent almost ten years in the joint y'all and those guys want to tattoo every inch of your body in prison those guys know hey Wes let me put a tattoo on you I might man my mom said no sew all the time all the time so my mom's telling me she said Damon no games no tattoos she said you come back as the man we raised or don't come back at all tough love for my mom yeah in fact my mom this book to change age about my life my mom's really the star of the story y'all I mean because the diction affects everybody affects the family's emotion and my family's went through hell with me and so she said Damon do you understand this debt you're gonna pay and I said yeah mom I got it but I had no clue but I just promised my mom because I've never been to prison before so when I get back to my pot in Dallas County Jail I'm asking all these guys in there that had been to prison for these other inmates hey man how I'm going to survive this and every single guy I talk to you black white asian Hispanic is telling me the same thing man you're 33 years old your gang recruiting age you're going to the worst part of the Texas prison system where everybody in the building you live on has life and you don't come off the building the life sentence building for five years they don't want you to escape man make your life easy Wes get into a gang you don't really have a choice but there was this one guy this older african-american man named mr. Jackson and mr. Jackson man mr. Jackson was a seasoned convict he had been to prison four or five times they was in his sixties you know I've never got his age but he look like he was in 60s and and he had been to prison four or five times but it was a real positive guy and he'd come up and check on me every day and talk to me and keep my spirits up so one morning he comes up he says West I've been watching how you're dealing with these knuckleheads these dummies talk about you to get into a gang he said do not listen to them man he said you don't have to do that he said but you need to understand that prison is gonna be rough on you at first he said and prison is all about race he says a race runs the institution so when you walk into prison all the white gangs the Aryan Brotherhood the Aryan Circle the white knights the woods they get the first dibs on you man you got to fight all of them and if you survive all that you don't give him to the ideology I hate out of fear because we do a lot of things in life out of fear y'all he said then you're gonna have to fight all the black gangs because they're coming after you to the Crips the Bloods the Gangster Disciples the mandingo Warriors they're gonna try to get you in line with your own race he said but if you could survive all that you will earn the right to walk alone he said the strongest man in prison always walks alone he said but you don't have to win all those fights west but you do have to fight all those fights and that's a lesson in life y'all nobody is that good to win all their battles in life we are going to lose and that teaches us character that teaches how to deal with loss we grow from our losses growth takes place in an uncomfortable place outside of our comfort zones and he's telling me don't ever turn down a fight in there and he can see in my face that I'm struggling with what he's telling me because you know who prison sounds like there's no way I'll survive so he says West I want to give you an analogy man let me make this easy for you imagine prison has a pot of boiling water he said anything we put in that pot of boiling water is gonna be changed by the heat the pressure inside that pot he said I want to put three things that pot of boiling water that we call prison and watch how they change I carry an egg and a coffee bean he said first things first he said West if I put a carrot is that pot of boiling water we call prison he said what happens to the character and I said well it turns off mr. Jackson he said that's good he said the carrot goes in there hard but the water prison changes that carrot he said he gets beat down and gets soft he gets beat he gets robbed he may get raped and he may get killed he said you do not want to be the carrot in prison he said what about the egg West I said well the egg jar is hard mr. Jackson he said that's right he said the egg has a hard outer shell so physically eggs are protected they're fine physically but inside they turn hard to that soft liquid core their hearts become hardened he said if your heart becomes hardened you're incapable of giving a receiving love he said if you were incapable of giving a receiving love you have become institutionalized and you do not come back as someone your parents recognized because your egg shell has swastika tattooed all over now he said what about that coffee being West and I had no clue what happens to a coffee bean right he laughed at me he said you know for a college boy not too smart all that education I God didn't do anything for me now going to prison anyway so he said for a college boy you're not too smart West he said if I put a coffee bean into that pot of boiling water we call prison he said now you got to change the name of the water to coffee he said the coffee bean the smallest these three things small like you West had the power to change the entire atmosphere inside that pot he said everybody in life puts that energy negative or positive he said whatever kind of energy you put out you will attract back the explaining what's called the law of attraction he said so West if you want to walk around prison and act like your heart with the frown in your face all the time and like you're a tough guy he said what you're gonna actually do is attract that same kind of person he said on the life sentence building that can be a very dangerous even deadly endeavor he said but west if you walk around that prison with a smile on your face and you let those guys know they're not giving you no no matter what they do they're not getting to you he said you will change that prison from the inside out he said them best part about that is the other coffee means in prison the other positive people will find you because of your energy and the last thing mr. Jackson told me before I got in that prison bus he said West go out there and go be a coffee bean and y'all with that and August of 2009 it was like a secret I got to take with me didn't come with instructions but in August of 2009 like I told some people in the elevator I moved out of here in 2009 and August of 2009 I left Dallas County on her prison bus headed into Texas Department of Criminal Justice I became inmate West number one five eight five six eight nine and y'all if you get one of these in your pocket you've had a bad day and it's tough man prison by design prison this is a punishment you know I learned a lot about prison for my time in there and since I've been out of prison in four years that I've been out I went back to school I got a master's in criminal justice in May I graduated from our University I got a master's yeah and I'll actually here's what's crazy I'm about to announce this in social media probably next week is in January I'll become a professor West because the University of Houston downtown is going to bring me into the criminal justice department to teach a class on prisons to the next generation of criminal justice pregnant that crazy God's world is crazy y'all that guy that guy's going to be teaching a college class about prison pretty neat huh god is amazing in me so so but in this time right here none of that stuff looks like it's possible I go to prison and it's every bit as hard as Jackson said it was gonna be and he was right he said he said that race runs the entire institution and he told me you know he said the first fight you get into is going to be the most important warning and y'all the first two months of prison were brutally huh and you know listen from Dallas County Jail to the penitentiary I probably got in three dozen fights and I lost physically lost 75 percent of those fights I mean I got my butt kicked all over that place but I won because I showed up I won because I got up every day and I fought and not just the physical battles but the mental and emotional battles too but I learned a lot about myself for my losses and I learned about overcoming adversity that suck that we talk about all the time right overcoming adversity life is about adversity but we have to overcome we have to understand I heard someone else talk about limits today one of the speakers talked about never let anybody put limits on you know don't ever let anybody tell you what you can cannot do in life if you allow someone to put limits on you then that is on you so I'm in prison for six weeks at this point and the first two weeks were spending the white gang the next four weeks I'm fighting on the black gang sometimes more than one at a time so I went out to the REC yard one day and I started this this project to earn some respect on the basketball court because the REC yard is very segregated there's no white guys allowed on the basketball court but I went out there day after day after day and after six days of this basketball court journey I was finally accepted I was finally taken in and I was told hey you don't have to worry about fighting the rest of the time you're here man you're good with us and after that was over after I saw that the coffee bean stuff worked because on that on that basketball court everybody became coffee beans out there and I knew that mr. Jackson he was talking about but here's the thing mr. Jackson didn't give me an instruction booklet he didn't tell me how to become a coffee bean and at that point six weeks into prison I was becoming the egg I was becoming the egg and I didn't want to be the egg and I thought I had to find a way so I got down to the chapel and I met other positive people because mr. Jackson told me if you want to find a lot of those coffee beans get down to that chapel there'll be a lot of coffee beans down there and I found other positive people and I found out that if I was gonna change my life inside the hardest census place ever a maximum-security prison that it had to start with a mindset and that's what we have to do our minds have to change we have to change the way we think Dabo Swinney the coach you saw a while ago he and I become close personal friends and of all their leaders I've met in this in this country doing this motivational speaking that I do that most Whitney's the best one you know why because he's got the players and the people at Clemson and his staff believing that they can do it a belief system that you can do anything you want to do all you have to do is set out to do it and the people around you the team around you it's in the same belief system but in prison that's not a team sport prison was an individual sport so I had to get to work on myself I read a lot y'all I had to occupy my time I changed my mindset I look at the prison as a punishment to looking at prison as an opportunity an opportunity imagine that I'm in prison I wake up every day and I say hey this is great god I get an opportunity to work on myself 24 hours seven days a week and I got to work I read I read a lot of books in prison I was a voracious reader I had to occupy my time I read everything I get my hands on a book every other day history fiction nonfiction the history of world religions I found that there are five major religions in history history of the world Hinduism Buddhism Judaism Christianity and Islam and at the core of all five of those religions are the same four spiritual principles I've read every one of their books the book vaquita the Quran the Torah the Bible I've read them all there's four spiritual principles at the core of all five of those religions those four Spirit's principles are unselfish honest pure and loving unselfish honest pure and loving and what I have for myself was the first key to the puzzle of a matrix to put to plug every decision in because if I'm doing things that are unselfish honest pure and loving then I can't be over here on the other side where I've been on my life selfish self seeking self warrant self desire and the worst one of them all self delusion self-delusions when you believe your own garbage you believe that voice in your head this is your pretty unique diamond know and I found out that there are about five ways to becoming a coffee bean and you may find out there's more but the first rule about being a coffee bean is the one mr. Jackson told me you have to have positive body language y'all every room you go into smile especially when you don't feel like smiling because your body language affects everybody in the room whether it's negative or positive you were infect or affect everybody in that room and two things I learned about negative people in a room full of positive people they will either one start smiling to give with the positivity because people have an inherent need to want to be loved to belong or they will get out of the room and either one of them is fine for a room full positive people we don't want the negative people in there anyway so the first floor learned about being a coffee bean was having a positive body language the second rule about being a coffee bean was to get up and go exercise every day and I'm not just talking about physically working out I'm talking about working on three areas spiritually mentally and physically getting up and get into shape every day because growth takes place outside of our comfort zones growth that's not a fun process growth takes place in that feel right it's awkward at first what does it mean to spiritually workout that means at the end of each day you have a conversation with God and you say hey God how was I today let's do a checklist do I owe someone an apology was that resentful today was I a good person what did I do to put back in the stream of life and one of the big question is do I owe someone forgiveness and hold yourself accountable to this stuff hold yourself accountable is your God because that is a spiritual workout not enough of us are doing out there mentally working out what does that mean meant to be working out means feed yourself the right stuff we are what we eat that's not just about food it's about what kind of books are you reading what kind of websites do you go to what kind of videos you watch what kind of TV do you watch are you watching someone TV with people just yelling each other the whole time if you are change the channel because that's doing nothing for you physically working out that means we got to take care of our system we understand this if here we understand taking care of ourselves put the right stuff in get enough rest you get one body all after that it's over so the second rule by being a coffee bean is getting up and working out in these three areas every day the third rule by being a coffee bean this is an important one the third rule by being a coffee bean is the most important thing because it is a secret to life oh the secret to life in reality has nothing to do with you the secret to life has what can you do for other people the secret to life is two words servant leadership servant leadership is helping other people achieve their goals in life helping other people reach a different destination of life because when we're helping other people we're really helping ourselves and that's what we're called to do nobody got here by themselves she'll nobody made it in life by themselves I don't care who you are you didn't get here by yourself someone helped you along the way you have to find ways every day to put back in the stream of life and help other people I had to do this in prison I couldn't take college classes of prison because I had a bachelor's degree already but I got to go to the schoolhouse and I talked guys on a read how to write how to get them ready for the GED test so they could have better lives no and my prayers changed remember that crazy prayer that I told you about in County Jail get me out of here so I can smoke meth on the weekends no oh man I got into recovery in prison I got into a 12-step recovery program and that's when I learned how to pray I pray for the same two things today that I pray for when I was in prison my station of life may have changed but my intentions in life have not changed I ask God every day for two things and I don't ask for anything else I say God put in front of me what you need me to do today for you and let me recognize it when I see it and then I'm gone I leave the house today and I'm I get going y'all because that's what life is all about finding ways to help other people out and I promise you if you do this the universe will pay you back and dividends the fourth rule by being a coffee bean this is the big one for me because I have a big thing about control I'm a I'm an addict I'm a very type A personality I've learned in prison that there are only four things you control in the four things you control or in your mind those four things are what you think what you say what you feel and most importantly because everybody's going to see what you do what you think what you say what you feel and what you do and if it's not one of these four things then then you don't really control anything y'all and when I learned this in prison when I could learn to focus on these four areas a lot of other decisions I was making that I had really no effect on because I thought I was the wizard behind the curtain pulling levers and pushing buttons and manipulating everybody do what I wanted to do but that's fantasy that's in my head when I focus on these four areas everybody took notice the inmates took notice the guards took notice prison became a pot of coffee and then the parole board took notice November 16 2015 the parole board comes to see me and they're looking at my file and they're like the ladies like mr. West we don't see a lot of people come through like you she said you had an amazing life yo guys like you don't usually come to prison you had all this going for your life and you get involved with drugs and you make these bad decisions you get this big sentence but you come to prison and you transformed the prison around you she said I've got one question for you mr. Westen and in my mind this is the one question it's gonna decide whether or not I go home whether or not I make parole right she said if you could be remembered for being anything in this life she said give it to me and just one word go and y'all because I was a coffee bean and because I knew what my place was in this world because I new with the secret to life with servant-leadership I had her answer for it I fire off right back at her real quick I said useful I just want to be useful ma'am I could be useful in here in this prison as you seen or I could be useful out there in that world going out there and finding coffee beans and she said you know what we're gonna let you go we're gonna give you one shot she said we're gonna let you go conditional that you don't ever come back in handcuffs anywhere in America between now and the year 2000 73 we'll keep you until the year 2000 73 y'all they let me go in November 16 2015 on a lifetime of parole I get off parole in 2017 three y'all yeah but I'm okay with that yes I'm okay with that no it's fine because now I'm out here having a positive I can be part of the solution instead of part of the problem and that's all I ever wanted to be and there's so many people in prison that just want to get out and be part of the solutions to the part of the problem but it was whatever I was out of prison then I learned what that fifth thing that fifth rule about being a coffee bean was because all these ideas I had in my mind about whatever the world was gonna be like when I walked out would I ever be accepted would I ever get a great job would I ever be able to go out and share this message like this would I ever find love and find a family all that stuff God has taken care of because I get up every day and I asked him the same question what can I do for you God in that fifth rule by being a coffee bean is this your past does not define you that's right your past doesn't define you I don't care what you've got I don't care what your past winds are or what your past losses are your past is your lesson man we learn from our past all right we don't dwell in our past there's a reason why the windchill is bigger than the rearview mirror y'all your past is your lesson you learn from your past the present today that is a gift you make the most of today because not everybody got another today you make the most of the day find out what you can put back in the stream of life find out how you can be a better human being a better servant leader a better person the future man the future is your motivation no the futures are motivation that question we always ask what is your why that's your future ask yourself every day what is my why because that's my future because the decisions you make today will affect your life tomorrow your passage or less the present today is a gift in the future and that's your motivation that's your why so here's all the five rules about being a coffee bean the five life lessons and you know my story's the change agent the book to change energy goes over all this stuff in it in the book the coffee bean it's about it's about know that taking that message it's about a kid named Abe you know and the word prison isn't even in that book the whole time but it's a best-selling book because any team organization can use that coffee being lesson right because the coffee bean is what we all strive to be so here's my call to action to you my call to action is this y'all you go out there and you go share mr. Jackson's coffee beans story that's not my coffee bean story that's mr. Jackson's coffee mean story and mr. Jackson you know mr. Jackson our pot of boiling water is different your pot of boiling water are part of all warm water is prison your pot of boiling waters life the same one I have today and life is going to turn the heat up and when it does how would you respond you talk about that carrot that turns soft no one wants to be the carrot but I've been the carrot before y'all I've been the carrot and so of you you tell him about the egg that turns hard the egg turns hard y'all no one wants to be the egg man the eggs are mad they're miserable but I've been the egg y'all it's so of you but you tell them what that coffee mean and when you do when you talk about this coffee bean when you get animated get excited because the coffee bean jumps into that pot of boiling water and says you know what turn it up I've got this and the longer that coffee bean sits in that pot of boiling water the stronger the stronger your pot of coffee is going to be so my call to action you today curve is you go out there go all over the country and all over the world every place you came from you go out there and I'm gonna give you the same advice mr. Jackson gave me ten years ago when I left Dallas County Jail went to prison he got on that prison bus go out there and go be a coffee bean y'all thanks a lot thanks let me talk today thank you thank you so much thank you guys thank you so much thank you in the West everybody [Applause] you", "cEbMNpKqWL0": "welcome to the green coffee bean arees home coffee experiments in this episode we'll be

and how you can correct them for our setup we're using a 12-inch cast-iron skillet dry with no oil and we'll be roasting today on a gas burner for the beans we'll be using three quarters of a cup of Costa Rican beans which we chose due to their small size as we want them to stir properly we didn't want beans to be sticking flat side down in the skillet and roasting unevenly from there we put our skillet in place turn the heat to medium let the pan heat for approximately a minute and then begin to roast after adding our beans we immediately begin to stir and the stirring process will be constant throughout the hosting process to again ensure the beans are roasting evenly and consistently we start with a wooden spoon quickly saw that it wasn't doing as good a job as we would have wanted we then transition to a metal whisk which did a much better job of moving the beans around constantly in pan skillet roasting at the right temperatures will take approximately 12 minutes relatively slow process and so you can see even at the three minute mark there's been very little change to the coloration of our beans fast-forward to the 9 minute mark and we're just reaching what's known as the first crack which is a term that describes a a light popping noise that you'll hear from the beans and is an indication that you reached a light roast after the beans reach the desired roast approximately 2 minutes later we transfer them to a metal colander and whisk them outside to allow them to cool as well as remove the remaining excess chaff we then transferred our cooled beans to a zip top bag being sure to remove all excess air because exposure to oxygen will cause the beans to go stale very rapidly we then put our beans on the counter top to allow them to de gas degassing is a process during which the beans will emit carbon dioxide after roasting and you're going to want to wait at least 24 hours before grinding the beans to allow them to partially be gas and fully develop in flavor so what are the lessons we learned on bean selection we felt like our small size was a good choice it allowed us to stir the beans easily and the slow roasts made it easy to get the target color which can sometimes be tricky with a smaller bean on our choice to use 3/4 of a cup of beans however as you could see there was quite a bit of open space this made stirring much more difficult we would recommend using a smaller skillet paired with 3/4 of a cup to make the stirring process easier on smoke and chaff the vent hood over our stove did do a good job of controlling a smoke however there was no way to remove chaff that was released from the beans during the process as an overall assessment we like that this was obviously a very inexpensive method the roast level was easy to control making it a good choice for beginners however the roast was slightly less even than we've seen with other methods though the overall finished flavor was still very very good so we hope this helped please visit our website at Green Coffee Beanery com for more information or subscribe to our Channel where our next video will be roasting coffee in the oven until then we hope you have a great day and thanks for watching", "YYpl0In8laI": "one of the ways to finish out your meal have some nice fresh ground fresh roasted coffee there's number of the merchants and carry fresh fresh coffee beans or green coffee beans it looked like little green peas and actually coffee beans are called peas from there if one state and they're actually when they're there off the tree you pick them when they're red and they look like little cherries and at that point they're referred to as cherries of course now we're not tumbling them in this we don't have a coffee roaster as such consistent but the main thing is not let the bean sit there and you want to try and get them as consistent as possible and you can see these beans now or a little bit oily the darker ones are which is more like a dark French or Italian roast then we have some lighter beans in there which is more like a American or European roast and you could smell smell the different flavors in there yeah another way you can roast your beans is you could you have a brazier you can roast your beans over a brazier gives you a bit more of a control take some beans here and make a cup of coffee this is an 18th century style of grinder and these are still readily available grind a little bit and then you pull off the bottom and check your grind make sure it's just it's properly so you get a consistent grind okay then we take and we have our coffee fresh ground fresh roasted fresh roasted and fresh ground smells real good now if we're making", "ChOQ_swe5e4": "hello YouTube and stir in very different videos what I normally do about coffee I've become quite a big coffee fan and I've tried the cafetaria star one with the filter in the top but I find it doesn't make em that good of coffee so I borrowed one of these which is a Philips enso and it takes pods and there's no pot in there and they fit like tea bags and it does produce a good coffee smells really good in these little tea bag type things but they're expensive it's like three pound for 18 and but um I just borrowed this which is a coffee bean roaster we can buy green beans such as these these are maca Arabica green beans and the case inside my hand it takes 300 grams and you set it to the roast at certain temperature keep an eye on it and you get fresh beans so I've measured out 300 grams already 4m roasting got some more down here El Salvador Alliance can go more maca Fairtrade Costa Rica green beans and bazillion green beans so I'm I'm gonna run this up shed fill it up and we switch on together and we're see if we can grow some beans I guess I'll be back shortly right so I've got the coffee machine it set up in the shed mainly because it smells quite horrid I've been told so I've no idea how this works and I had I did have a quick look on the instructions online but they were mostly French mmm so this 300 pound piece of kit is meant to turn out some good quality roasted coffee beans so I'm gonna turn it on and I think I've got a rough idea actually I might lift you up a little bit more and you're there on you set it on to leave it in 250 I will set this for 15 minutes Oh 15 is a minimum time so that seems good to me so let's hit the star button is fairly warm the only thing I think I'm not going to be able to do is film the whole time to become about his ability see the temperature is rising the ticks J 59 60 which will get 73 70 degrees and it is fairly warm I hate these cameras no it's funny though it's at least and funny I'm just a trifle it's quite a quiet machine so I'm just gonna leave this on for a little bit longer and then we'll come back and see some changes in a little bit well we've just reached the five-minute mark temperature is 170 degrees Celsius not noticing any and is changing the color of the beans but I am noticing is some husk starting to float out the end where my hand is here there's a hole and there's to enjoy Hut just poking out the end of it and no idea what that's about but I'm gonna let in runs five minutes and I'll be back alright we've just hit five minutes and I am starting to notice it notice a color change in the beans they went kind of lighter first and now they're starting to pick up some color as they they roast longer it still isn't up to temperature it's a two hundred two hundred and four degrees out of 220 just lower the temperature down lots of husks still flying out of these out of the machine inside a little bit shoot now so I'm gonna let this run to the end of the five minutes into the 15 minutes even and see what we end up with it's not I will put this on for longer it's just reached the end of the five minutes and it's just on gone onto a cooling cycle but we don't want that so we're going to there we go I don't know what I did but I managed to get it going oh come on oh well that wasn't that successful was it a fun I don't the end like the electronic cupboards in there we go another 20 minutes I do say I will say it does smell quite bad coffee wise yeah most definitely making some progress sniffing get a shot of these beer they are definitely starting to turn coffee brown I was backing firemen right where we were not quite at the 20 minute mark and they're starting to crack but popcorn from what I've read this is first crack this is when it first becomes a drinkable coffee and then it will proceed to get darker and darker until you hear a second crack and that's when you get into dark roast territory so I think we are definitely on the right right track here and I can also see the white bits of husk within the within the proper breeding themselves on the back I starting to get more pronounced oh and if you can hear that so we vacuumed at 20 where I we are now at 20 minutes there is some visible smoke coming out for machine I don't know whether that's meant to happen or not although it is missing its box at the end to contain with that coffee beans are a bit more notably black or dark brown of the vias zoom shot and the cracks are more prominent now more pronounced and I think I might have to open the door so this placement it a little bit before I self out so I'll be back at 25 minutes and it might well be it I think right I'm calling it it for now we're just over 25 minutes we're at 26 and a half minutes and smoke is billowing out the machine I'm now getting a more pronounced coffee smell I'm not getting any horrible like burnt smell this is a it's very pronounced dark Kris coughing smell and I think I may have overdone it a bit we've gone for the form dark roast products of it because the oils have to come out in the bean straight away don't stick me be getting in the way so I'm gonna call it down let them sit for a while I guess but these are lovely glossy black beans like the ones you see in the coffee shops that whoa look at that and the oils have come out so yeah okay so I know know what I need to do next time I do some coffee I I will reduce the time and possibly the temperature and see if we can get better result but then again dark coffee strong coffee I do like it it's amazing that they went from like a man like a medium brown to a dark brown in in an instant I can't believe it but yeah I'm gonna let this continue calling out still quite hot it's 274 degrees down from Sue's 30 and we go back down the house and form to a bold I think see you shortly right so we're back in remember that's what we started off with that's what we've ended up with and this is a small quantity that I managed to grind up into a kind of fine paste and so I'm gonna put the kettle on I'm gonna borrow me some water yep and we'll be away so hopefully we've gone from green bean to roasted coffee bean to coffee in about half an hour it might take longer to brew with in a normal cup because as you dive into appetizing well wizzy I've only put a teaspoon and a bit in supporting a bit more so I'm gonna let that do its thing and I believe actually it does appear that the coffee making here is almost a failure it because it takes eagerly have been roasted to the fullest it still takes a couple of days the oils to come out and obviously not having a proper grinder Coffee no coffee machine yet then I'm currently at a loss so I'm gonna try it anyway it looks a bit like Luke tea but I've seen some conflicting statements saying that coffee can be his best between four to twelve days from ways roasted so it's a matter of time just let it do its thing maybe I can borrow someone's coffee machine proper coffee machine to see if I can get the full potential out of these beans I've got to find out whether I've gotta stick these in the fridge you know I can't remember but anyway that concludes today's video I've managed to make a kind of weak mediocre style coffee from green beans but I may do some follow-up videos later on if I do find a way that works and I'm expected to get on for the coffee going of Christmas and a small coffee machine so this this is um this is all all these things are stuck from a coffee shop they bought the coffee roasting machine so that they could roast coffee in shop and they were hoping to get the ambient smell but obviously I'll just spoke the garage out and and my clothes smell of it now so it's not the best idea I've been an int it to see if I can play with it and I've got to give it back I think it's because they don't want the beans back they want the beans used up and make you sit on the machine with beans so I've got seven kilos of B's which is one head up a lot of coffee and I just got to find a way to make it and use it now as it as it's free I'm going to use it and they're cookies I'll speak now noses money there that concludes today's video and I'll see you next video cheers guys", "mwv-jarrs0U": "[Music] ever been told that you should keep coffee in the fridge only to find out that when you take it out the beans are more oily than mr olympia just like the myth of storing coffee in the fridge there are a lot of myths in the coffee world and some of them are really confusing to the home user i'm ryde from coffee beans delivered and today i'm going to bust open a few myths to help you understand more about coffee [Music] yes it is true that coffee is destroyed by heat so keeping it in a cool dark area is important however coffee is allergic to the 21st century so things like heat oxygen moisture all destroyed coffee and coffee is hydroscopic which means it attracts water which causes it to sweat the oils are normally trapped with inside the beans and the oils are the flavor so when the beans sweats that means the flavor escapes the bean so essentially by putting your beans in the fridge you're ruining the flavour of the coffee here i have some refrigerated coffee beans just to show you how the coffee is affected when you put it in the fridge see how the coffee is thin and wavy instead of in this shot where it's thick and creamy and caramely if you use your coffee up within a couple of months keeping it in an airtight container in a dark cupboard is perfect and even up to six months you'll only have 20 flavor loss there is great debate about whether you should even put your coffee in the freezer and i say this is possible but only if you're going to be storing it for more than 12 months if you're using it and it takes you that long to use it up i suggest you subdivide them into small packages like this and then only take it out when you're going to use it the only time i could ever recommend putting coffee in the fridge or the freezer is in the extreme case of high temperature high humidity and you live in the tropics and you do not have something like a wine fridge there you go we're going to be looking at some more myths coming up in another video so stay tuned and if you have any questions please leave them in the comment section below i'm ryde from coffee beans delivered enjoy your brew", "PcQIIeaYmRE": "it seems like every barista has a different opinion on the best way to store coffee now not knowing really annoys us so we decided to put it to the test and find out fridge freezer or shelf where should you store your coffee at home [Music] hey it's ben for the coffee science education center at seven miles today we're going to talk about how to store an open bag of coffee at home in a previous video adam went into detail about the ideal shelf life for a sealed bag of coffee what we've found is that for most coffees it peaks at around 14 days after roast now that's great information to know in say a cafe we're going through coffee quickly opening lots of bags but at home it's a slightly different story typically we've got open bags of coffee and we need to somehow seal those up and store them for later so where's the best spot to do that well if you're just here for a quick answer i won't keep you waiting our research shows that the freezer is the best place to store coffee it came out better than the fridge better than the shelf it wasn't as good as a sealed bag of coffee but it was the next best thing now there are a ton of elaborate devices on the market for keeping coffee fresh but for this test we wanted to keep it simple and test it the way that most people store their coffee at home in the original bag now to test this out we set up blind taste tests with a panel of professional coffee tasters we stored open bags of the same medium roast coffee on the shelf in the fridge and in the freezer so we tested these coffees at 14 days and 28 days and compared them to a sample of the same coffee that was in a sealed bag for reference now in these tests we asked our tasters to give each coffee a score for acidity intensity sweetness and smoothness and finally while our taste is staggered out of the building in search of fried chicken we crunched the numbers and came up with these results so first up is acidity i know acidity can be a little confusing so to keep it simple we'll say acidity is the bright fruity zesty sensation that you get from most light and medium roast coffees now acidity is generally seen as a good thing and it helps to balance the sweetness and the bitterness of the coffee so in terms of results the seal bag was by far the best at preserving acidity and to be honest all of the open bags did a pretty poor job having said that the freezer was slightly ahead of the shelf and the fridge now for both sweetness and intensity the sealed bag still wins overall but the freezer came a solid second place in both of these categories well ahead of the shelf and the fridge now when it came to smoothness the freezer was actually the overall winner better than the seal bag now this is partly due to the fact that it's got some reduced acidity ultimately whether you think this is a good thing depends on the balance of flavor that you prefer so in terms of overall results our winner was definitely the seal bag second place was the freezer followed by the shelf and in last place was the fridge now one thing to watch out for whenever you store your coffee is strong odors coffee just loves to soak these up and they can easily ruin a whole bag of coffee with a tank that's another good reason to store it in an airtight container so to sum up here's what we recommend you best to buy small amounts of coffee more often now for open bags of coffee that you're going to use over more than a few days you're best to store that in an airtight container in the freezer all right that's all we've got for today why don't you tell me in the comments what should we test next time i'd love to hear what you think until then see you later you", "s4OsG5KgBq0": "hey I'm Matthew Lewin and my name's Rhys and today we're going to show you how you can easily freeze your coffee at home now freezing coffees become increasingly popular as a way to preserve and store your coffee a little bit like we've been doing with food for a long time as we know with coffee it goes stale which nobody wants yeah so about freezing your coffee you can slow down that aging process which allows you to preserve that flavor that you love for extended periods of time so many cafes and restaurants use commercial equipment however you can achieve the same results with much more affordable domestic equipment it's what you need to freeze your coffee is a vacuum sealer some vacuum seal bags now these are channel bags which you'll need for domestic units now optional is some scales and some little cups to weigh your coffee into and of course you're delicious on a coffee now we're gonna show you how to freeze your coffee into three easy steps first one going to weigh your coffee now we've freeze our coffee down ten days after roasting another cool thing you can do is just give the bag a bit of a smell if it's smelling really sweet it's probably ready to freeze step two and we're putting it into our channel bag step three we're going to seal it [Music] so the cool thing about our bags is once you've finished sealing all of your dosas pop it back in and put it straight in the freezer and you're all ready to go when you're ready to make your coffee you can grab it straight from the freezer it doesn't need to be defrosted before you use it and you can grind it straight away and make your coffee as you usually would so once you're ready to start freezing your coffee at home head down to your local retailer of Honor coffee or jump on the website there's plenty of delicious coffees to choose from and if you have any further questions around freezing coffee don't hesitate get in contact thanks", "GzJuSVEV1aM": "this is my coffee roaster it is a whirly pop popcorn popper that has been mounted inside of the old pressure cooker that I purchased from Goodwill the purpose of that is the pressure cooker is very heavy aluminum and it distributes the heat really nice to the whirly pop when I just used the whirly pop on its own I used to get some hot spots and it would cause inconsistent roasting as you can see I have a thermometer or a temperature gauge mounted in here and will undo this thing you can see there's three bits where the whirly pop is mounted inside the pressure cooker this here I'm showing you I mounted the thermometer with a cable clamp or a cable tie and then this wire is the stirring mechanism of the whirly pop so this is the cooling apparatus setup as you can see we just got a simple milk grate on top of that we have a box fan on top of that we have the wire mesh strainer that will give us good airflow to cool coffee when it's done roasting this is the coffee were roasting today I'm not even going to attempt to pronounce the name of it they're ethiopian coffees are my favorite specifically the ones that are natural process or pipe process what that means is when the coffee is harvested it is a fruit it's like a cherry that is picked off of a plant they allow the fruit to stay on the the seed or the bean and let it dry and ferment and it creates some fruity notes some whiny notes and those are my favorite kinds of coffee this particular one it says is best at a city to a full city roast so that's a pretty dark roast but not not a French roast or an Italian roast we've been preheating this I was just about off the temperature when this gauge reads between 475 and 500 I'll drop in the coffee beans I'm gonna call that 475 to 500 let's the ways to measure done is that because people show all the time the Russian troops the population we confer in Malaysia to box me five minutes hopefully you can hear that soft popping and cracking noise that is what we call first [Applause] most popular that you consumed was rusted through the first class and into what is called the second thing you can see all the colors but Isabella [Applause] we're back and very steady but fractions with off my administer a given place right now the color of the crossing is at Starbucks Wanda [Applause] sometimes when I'm getting you into those alexey potekhin testimonies of the hellish work at other times of the afflicted by time some people can do this all by fans [Music] [Music] [Applause] so we've got this completely cooled now you can see it's very shiny that's when the oils of the coffee come into the surface this would be a full City Roast", "eDMQwSvYWlM": "hi Gayle Williams good morning Ken so we got some suggestions that's going to be the nice way of saying it if you want froze on frozen beans and some recommendations and so I thought you know we're we're a couple of well-rounded fact-based journalists so and I was like you talking about my baby is so let so I thought you know what let's let's try some recommendations that people told us about why we went us right now I do want to say well dad she's got something to say folks regardless of how much we dialed in the first round of beans there's no way to dial out freezer burn taste folks no okay so maybe we should do this one six months or years ago at some point these are just one month off these are just one month old in the freezer one month we did the bag from Belton's with tape across the one-way bill yes that was one person's suggestion we did this is Scott Reil suggestion ziploc bag and we had all the air out of this yeah there is some air in it and we assume is from off gassing yeah this is a you know a seal-a-meal kind of a thing and this was absolutely vacuum ya know you can see what it is and this this is one refrigerator this you had one freezer and then we have a second freezer to freeze yeah but neither of their just refrigerator freezer so yeah frost free yeah so same thing this is the silver fridge we have one of the state would you like that also put it in silver sharpie on the same thing this is gassy this one isn't as gassy for some reason yeah now when I took these out this one was still like as if it was vacuum vacuum packed this one was loose in fact this one seemed to be more like this when I took it out this was blown up yesterday one so these this was fresh coffee when I put it in the bags that had been roasted a couple days before yeah yeah roasted on the turnouts are one of the recommendations is you know is well to also add you know do it as fresh as possible you know so 23rd roasted on the 23rd and we put it in the 2009 25th so alright I've ever seen now another thing that I wanted for us to try this time is to grinders so you have dialed in this guy the mini a and is a virtual virtual so both with fresh ready to rock Belton never do McRae we're just going for it well come on write a damned alright okay can I say I think I tamped it just a little bit harder we had to I had to go light around the tamp with the virtual so to get it dialed in rightly rightly rightly correctly well this is a good sign now don't you think well I think it may be I tempted just a little bit harder than I have but the fact that it's good yeah yeah oh yeah no kiddin all right we're at 35 seconds okay you want to taste it I think I tapped it a little bit hard ice I say it stayed fresh I taste that I'm not gonna say anything that's a good shot nine seconds yeah that's actually really good it's not as full body does the fresh coffee no not as usual with his coffee but it's still a good shot it's very smooth lightly smooth I love it when we're surprised like the scale you know what I'm gonna start freezing my car which one is this this is this bag yeah Fraser backed it bag with the tape on it look at that that's coming up not too bad it's going to be the timings going to be less for sure good servants all right and taste it Chua came out at the right time hmm you a double taste nice yes I do one definitely isn't like us full-bodied as the fresh coffee oh but it's a smooth shot I actually like it better there was a there was undertone there are a little flavor he picked up on that was love me don't say anything let me see if I can get it yeah it's going on dialing in folks this virtuoso with a little bit of a task the same morning maybe ease up on the tab or also he were stuck between two nachos Anderson that's where the precise would be good exactly go in for a little espresso hardcore porn shot oh yeah geez look at that coffee coming now okay I hope you edit some of the evening sometimes just once in a while just for my benefit now yeah I don't I know okay we're at 36 seconds okay that's like the last one ran long too I'm going to try that sucker out okay crema blondie it's good at all going on mm-hmm all right I'm not gonna say anything you've really mastered your poker face Gail smooth just like the other uh yeah ready heavy I am already Gail I am ready for y'all show we're going down to Houston this the end of this weekend for the NSCAA show you can get myself some real buzz a gale I thought q unfortunately the only thing I know about Texas I learned from king of the hill is the seconds oh okay so a little farther a little bit over but not much we were at 25 on the other one right mm-hmm 25 26 mm-hmm my assessment of that is that actually just like the other one is still smoother but that has a little more of the original acidity to it in full body yeah it's more like fresher coffee I agree with that so the miles are maybe is doing a better job of the grind a little tinge of sourness to it they'll go so that one might benefit from a minor tweak yep okay we'll be right that week though I mean if we're talking maybe one notch not even barely okay look at that well it did it didn't like maintaining yeah there you know wasn't outgassing it was neatest it was sticking around and that is just plain straight Oh feels weird what does it feel like it's clumpy against my fingers that little birch is just not breaking down that's that oh man having the gas in there did something compared to even the fresh cut yeah well that tells me something some whoa I don't think we're going anywhere no okay okay so that it would need it and a significant adjustment to coarser how does that feel feels finer normal normal okay Oh totally different Wow so this one you might want to go the other doors there absolutely this is about 17 seconds okay and I mean taste that baby grinders make a big huge difference exactly tastes pretty good taste it does does huh yeah Jason it tastes really good nice and smooth see you might yeah you might want to stick with it or maybe make it a little you could probably get a little more full-bodied flavor out of it if you want a little finer so it kind of the same story is the other one logs yeah all right well let's why don't you top that out and let's take a look at the mother you want me to do it no we know it's not gonna fold it shot looks good gal does look good coming out fast yeah 15 seconds good I don't want to get you sour yeah that needs to go find her oh yeah not as good as the other one was the other one even though it came out fast tasted pretty darn good yeah hmm so this one needs to go finer when dialed in okay so Gail those beans smell good fresh like they're right out of the bag yum yum yummy where they've smelled the freshest I post something about I'm not even gonna bother to grinding like a little log I can practically pick them off okay coming up nice looks like the velocity is real good little fast well fast a little quite a bit faster sixteen seconds all right taste test let's see this is the one out of the fruit now is it black or them yeah bag whoa oh that's really sour okay you didn't have to say that's really sour came out to fit okay so this one we definitely want to make finer okay all right one is too far I mean this is just honest I love it it's a crazy Gail's story yeah look at it oh yeah it's hard talcum powder and then some yeah looks good coming out at a nice velocity little fast now she's getting fast she's losing it she's losing it goes just watching the staff watch it's not as bad as you think okay where are we a second wet 21 new one give her a taste a rogue ale I am so tasted off my tail it's gonna be saltine crackers from me for the rest of the day oh you're able to give it a second sip it's not the best but it's not the worst either I think the so yeah I think the smoothest was in the bag itself yeah with the tape so I think that we have learned our lesson Gayle you can freeze your beans if you want to you can freeze if you want to you can freeze them if you want to but you're gonna have to tweak the grind if you have a virtual so especially you're gonna have to play with it yeah then and then another test would be okay these are open these are these are a month old mm-hmm now they're open for three or four days and then reseal them see what they don't want yeah you know and I think too the other thing is that the taste did change it did actually the one from the bag of it with the tape on it huh it mellowed it out just wasn't quite as as acidic and it wasn't his full body oh yeah I liked it I hate to meet was a little it was not as rich as I like well from an espresso shot but it was a minor change I like my special shots a little less yeah most people so yes you do Gayle so we learned our lesson I guess we've got to eat some crow that'll be nice with all that coffee we have going on in our belly korone coffee yeah we're not above eating a little crow no we're not well I mean we're about just testing you we got feedback we tried it out and hey you know what it's possible yeah exactly all right well thank you very much Gayle Williams I'm gonna go have a saltines or something I'm gonna settle down my Tommy thanks Cal see ya", "6j9mf5hZSDM": "welcome back to another amazon top 10 coffees today we are looking at the pelican rouge coffee roasters from amazon which comes up in number three when you do a coffee bean search obviously we're going to grind that on the sagebrusher express today and i'm going to show you my grind settings and go through all those things a quick note i've just uploaded a video for any of you that are following my videos and struggling to pull the same shot as me and that is to adjust your burr grinder setting so that's the internal burr on the grinder itself it literally takes two minutes to change these settings so check out our video i'll leave a link above and just check your settings to see where you're at if you are struggling to pull a decent shot but let's get into today's video so this coffee says it's a medium roast coffee is mellow bodied with a well-balanced smooth flavor it has it's organic it has over a thousand five hundred reviews on amazon and it costs 8.99 for this big one kilo bag thickly sourced and um it comes from they've got a lot of ethical experience and heritage for this coffee and um yeah it's got some kind of you know very good reviews and people got a strength five out fine details it says it's a medium roasted to preserve a strong flavor the added arabica makes this a versatile coffee suitable for cappuccino cafe creme and milky drinks so great if you're into these kind of milky drinks and flat whites and all that kind of good stuff starting off as always my grinder is going to be on a set five and we're gonna grind this using the non-pressurized double basket which is what i always use on my videos and we're gonna grind this 18 grams of coffee and let's take it from there [Music] okay let's see how we get on with this shot so i'm gonna start my timer and press the double shot [Music] pressure's building up very watery not enough pressure yeah and that was incredibly short so that was less than 20 seconds and you saw there was hardly any pressure built up so this time i'm going to do it again and we're going to crank this up let's go to a 2 on that see how we get on with that and see how we get on so this shot straight as we just did it on that number five um doesn't taste too bad it's um fairly sweet has a slightly bitter aftertaste but that's okay again that's quite palatable if i added some more water to that i think i could drink it it would be okay but let's see how we get on so we can get a better extraction [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] again not enough pressure very very low very very quick shot so i'm going to go again ultra fine for this i'm going to stick this on the finest setting and i'm going to increase the coffee to 18.5 grams and let's see if we can get a better extraction that way so this is my final go with this particular coffee obviously i've got it on the finest grind settings i've got 18.5 grams of coffee in and anything other than this if it doesn't work it would require me adjusting my burr grinder and i'm not going to do that again i'll leave a link to that video if you've not seen how to do that but i'm not willing to adjust my grind settings my burr grinder for this specific coffee so let's see how we get on so i'm going to start my timer and press the double shot [Music] pressure's building up which is looking good much much much better again very very short i only got about 22 seconds on there but that's the best i'm gonna get um with this particular coffee because you saw the pressure built up i got a decent amount of pressure but just didn't pull a very very long shot but let's just see what this tastes like oh i said that was gonna be my last attempt i was just wanted to see what this would be like with 19 grams it fitted easily into the portafilter no problem i'm just going to do a double shot now and see what we get this time [Music] so yeah good pressure we're going to pull a longer shot again that was 23 seconds and there wasn't a massive amount of difference in the shot uh let's just see that's finished yeah so it looks pretty decent to be honest looks like a decent shot let's just see what it tastes like okay so here's the shot we finally pulled so that's with 19 grams fitted okay in the portafilter no problems not much of a difference between that and 18.5 but as i said without adjusting the burr settings that's the finest i'm gonna get so really strong coffee nice and strong full of flavor slightly kind of caramelly flavor to it but that would be very very nice as an americano or with like i said it mentioned the instructions with milk having that with a milky coffee having a latte flat white potentially that'll be a really good coffee but it is very strong so compared to the other two coffees that i've recently um used this is much much stronger in terms of its flavor profile so if you like strong coffee you're probably going to like this if you find this video useful guys let me know in the comments let me know what coffees you use on the sagebrush express what extraction you use it will help other people as well so i'm trying to help as many people as i possibly can if you need to know how to adjust your burr grinder settings check out my last video i'll leave a link to that as well and hopefully i'll catch you on the next video", "6ByFIzbdG3s": "[Music]", "M1pE3ksfubs": "good morning and welcome back this morning I'm trying to make coffee here's what happened okay I need to make some coffee so what do I do so I remember I had this coffee beans it's pre-ground pre-ground coffee beans that says Kona bland the thing is this coffee beans problem is this is already free ground as you can see this is not the expresso sighs but I don't know so I want some coffee something I'm going to try this anyway I'm trying to make americano using these grounds but in this time I have to use the pressurized basket instead of the non-pressurized so I'm going to use pressurized because fertilize the ground sighs it doesn't really matters and it still give it you know give us decent shot you know a decent shot it's not great shot but just decent shot so let's see what happens okay so let's make some coffee so I'm going to put 18 grams that's what this brahbrah Britax is car for 17 [Music] okay and then I'm using my phone oh I think I show you how to I'll show you guys how to make our last video this is pretty handy by the way okay here's the problem this is too much because because grants are so big it's not going to fit so so so we have to text so I'm going to use this measuring thing here to tech some beans out okay it's not gonna hold up I'm going to try I'm going to try it goodness I mean this time I'm going to use instead of 18 maybe start with 13 first let's see what happens nope I want a little more see here another two grand so now I'm at 15 okay okay that's better so 15 grand I think if you don't use regular coffee wannabes try 15th it's over 18 okay so now I'm using pressurized basket so let's make some coffee [Music] I'm gonna heat up some cup yeah here goes nothing all right [Music] [Music] okay so now we have this shot then I'm gonna make a McConnell [Music] [Music] smells okay hmm just coffee yeah it's not great but did I do since I don't have coffe maker at home only much and I have is brave words to express so I mean if you're out of beans if you only have just a plain brown beans at home you know what it work it works it's not bad it's not great but it's not bad anyway if you like this video please subscribe and I tried to come up with an ear video maybe one or two a week so if you have any suggestion you know about why should I make video about next time please leave us in the comment and see you next time", "8PG2A8uHWF0": "hey guys I'm a forester here today I want to do a quick video on how to make coffee probably everybody knows how to make coffee but if you watch my videos you know that I'm a big coffee drinker and I like to use whole beans and grind them myself this is Starbucks this is the breakfast blend that I'm using right now but I read somewhere where you lose 40 percent of the flavor of the coffee within minutes of having grounded so I like to use fresh beans and grind it myself my grinder that I was using broke recently and so I had to get a new grinder and I did a review online of coffee bean grinders and I looked at YouTube videos in fact and you know you these YouTube reviews are very useful for any number of reasons but this Krupps grinder is one that was rated highest on several reviews so I thought I'd give it a try and it grinds just about the right amount that I would need and I forgot a measuring scoop so I'm gonna go get that and be right back okay I'm back that didn't take long I just needed a tablespoon scoop and this is very simple but I have a lot of experience I started drinking coffee a long time ago as a boy actually my grandmother taught me how to drink and she saucer cooled her coffee but one tablespoon for every 5 ounces of coffee that's 1 2 3 or 5 set that back you want to get a close-up of some fresh coffee beans you can almost smell the aroma now ok so there's 5 tablespoons now this is the control this is the button it's a different mechanism than what I'm used to but this just fits over pretty tightly there we go I don't know why is having so much trouble and then you press down on this to engage it I like to rotate it just to make sure all the grounders uniforms and that's probably good enough this type you don't have a timer you just grind it until it's as fine as you want it if you want a coarse grind then you don't do it as long the blades are very sharp since this is new and then we're going to open this up and basically just dump this into the clean filter this filter is not the right size and so I'm trying to use them up before I go get more and then one thing that you'll see you'll notice is that the grinds stick the coffee grounds stick in there and so I just loosen them up with my finger now it is plugged in right now so I got to be careful if I was in the kitchen I would unplug it okay and I'm gonna call that good enough for this video there's still some in there there we go that's why you need to unplug it so there's the grounds now it's one five ounces are one tablespoon of coffee for every five ounces so I've weighed out or measured out 20 ounces we're going to pour that in the reservoir now you know a series coffee drinker when he uses a black & decker industrial grade coffee maker okay we're gonna press the button lights green and we'll wait five minutes or so and come back and do a taste test see y'all in a few minutes all right the coffee is finished brewing so let's give it a taste test take the pot out and fill up the glass a coffee mug fresh and hot there we go let's see how that tastes looks good mmm rich dark and rich we'll set it there on the bandana and we're ready to make another video and that's how it's done y'all take care", "cV0VtPKRbNw": "hi everyone so we're going to do something slightly different today first of all you might notice i have this lovely thing here i want to try not doing a voiceover i'm not using a lav mic we're going to use this it'll look a little silly that's okay let's see how this goes anyways so i was at ikea the other day and i noticed that they had coffee now i've hi hello this is voice over morgan and i gotta say something real fast because i think i'm just very unobservant and didn't notice that ikea sold coffee they've been doing it since 2017 but this is my first time seeing it and i also didn't make videos back then so we're gonna explore it and this is a little explanation on why i haven't done a video about this until now okay goodbye now i've seen in the past they have this wonderful collection of coffee tools and coffee gear in fact james hoffman has done a video about it in the past which i will be linking below however when i went i did notice this time they were selling actual coffee now i know they have a couple different series of these when i was looking into it they have an espresso series they also have a like drip slash brewers series and then they also sell some whole bean now the ikea i was at only had the drip series so i picked up a couple packages of each i thought we'd give them a test and just to be totally authentic to the ikea experience i also picked up some brewing tools as well so we'll take a look at those and we'll just see what ikea coffee tastes like now my understanding is this is what they serve in the cafe so in those days when you could actually go to the ikea cafe this would be the coffee you'd be having it says a second cup of coffee and then down below it says ground coffee dark roast and organic so then when you go a little bit lower down the packaging you notice a couple of things so it has a little coffee brewer on it each of these packages kind of shows you the best method of brewing these coffees so as i mentioned before these are all for drips so this is a drip brewer it has a slightly lower acidity it's a little bit below the halfway mark it has a full body at number four and it is a number four in roasting which i'm just assuming means it's a dark roast coffee uh this is over a pound of coffee which is quite a lot usually when you go into most specialty shops they'll be sold in increments of about 12 ounces which is it's 12 ounces right not 12 grams how much coffee do you use 19 grams so this is 1.1 pounds of coffee uh which is 70 oh it just says 17.6 ounces this is slightly slightly more than you will be getting if you're going into a specialty coffee shop now the second one i got is this purple bag right here the main labeling is the same says stay in the moment a second cup of coffee it is ground press coffee dark roast and organic now you go down here and instead of having pull this back instead of having your little brewer you have your french press symbol so this is for a french press uh it has a slightly higher acidity it's a three so it's slightly above that middle marking this one again as we mentioned before is a two it has um a slightly heavier body and it also is a number four on roasting so these are both dark roasts i know ikea makes a medium roast as well i'm not totally sure about a light roast but this is all my ikea hat so this is what we're going with now one thing that i did notice when i was looking at these is they don't have the origins of coffee on them it does say on the back that these are 100 arabica beans it does say that they are from small-scale coffee farmers in the countries well it says countries like mexico peru and honduras so i'm not clear if those are the only countries of origin they source from or if that's just what some of them are oh but one really cool thing is it says on the side and on the back that you can trace your coffee so you go to utz.org ikea you input one of the label numbers the best buy date and you're able to trace where your coffee's from and i found out that this coffee is from honduras so that's kind of cool it probably makes them a lot easier to package and ship out very very quickly but you still have some degree of traceability to your coffee so if you're interested in that that's where you can find out let's talk about the rest of my ikea haul real fast because of course i got two of each of these coffees i got the very famous ikea french press all right so i also picked up this nifty little set which i actually think should be pretty useful we're just gonna give it a test uh this is a coffee scoop as well as a coffee bag clip i thought this looked really neat i hope it works because if it does i'm just gonna keep it and use it for my regular bags of coffee i also thought because it's ikea we should test out the milk frother if you can hear the cats say hello to the cats anyway so i picked up one of these and i also picked up one of their steaming slash pouring pictures i figured since we're making coffee we might as well enjoy it so i'll be steaming up some milk and we'll have like a little olay sort of thing that's gonna be delicious and yes ikea doesn't explicitly sell coffee brewers like a drip brewer so hang on i'm gonna be cheating today this is my drip brewer that i usually use every day it's from bonavita i love it it's not sponsored but uh if they want all of these bags of coffee that i have are pre-ground so just something to keep in mind um i have not opened this yet i've not tried any of it uh because i thought it would be a fun surprise for all of this now originally when i picked this up in store it is it is dense like i don't know if you can hear that it is it's a solid block and my brain originally thought did they just like freeze dry or like vacuum seal just like a cube of coffee um someone pointed out to me someone who is slightly smarter than me pointed out they probably just used a box which makes a lot more sense so let's find out which one of us is correct um i'm correct spoiler alert this is just a this is a vacuum sealed cube of coffee look at it i don't know if i can explain to you how dense this thing is like i feel like i could club someone over the head with it so it's not pretty um but it is something this is why we have this tool because i can imagine if you don't seal this off you're gonna have coffee everywhere i'm slightly scared to open this up i'll be totally honest i don't have a good track record of opening bags and doing it in a clean way so i'm just gonna okay so fun irregardless we have a bag of coffee right here smells like coffee all right our water is just about finished boiling i have my scoop i have my coffee my lovely scale and i'm gonna start off with about 27 to 30 grams of coffee this is a four cup french press that's just kind of what i use for the most part of course recipes and brewing variations will totally go person to person that's just what we're doing and we'll see how it turns out see i'm gonna do a nice rounded oh the water's done i'm gonna do a nice just kind of like flat scoop here and let's see how much all right so each one of these scoops are about seven and a half i'm gonna add just a little bit of water in just to kind of initially wet all the grounds or i'm gonna give this a stir just to make sure all those grounds are sufficiently damp nothing's kind of floating around or too dry hey google set a timer for four and a half minutes we're just gonna go for about 30 seconds starting now we're just gonna go for about four and a half minutes and then we will see where this ends up maybe i need to use more coffee before i can do this and then like just kind of slot everything in there okay it's not beautiful but uh it does work we have in total a minute and a half left this smells nice i will say this very much smells like a very classic like diner coffee which is what i often associate with dark roasts they're very comforting they're very like i always describe them as like coffee that tastes like coffee you're waking up you're going to like deadies or high hop and this is what they serve you and it's great it goes with cream it goes with sugar and all that stuff so we'll find out if it actually tastes like that but that's like my hope because i've got like a sneaky little weakness for like delicious diner coffee that goes with cream okay that uh that looks like hot coffee to me it's got a very very light smell to it it isn't super fragrant i will say quite dark very chocolatey almost a little bit nutty as well it's not it's not a very complex coffee it has kind of like a one note like you taste it it has this kind of initial burst of dark chocolatey roasty tasting coffee and then it's just kind of gone there's nothing that really sticks around i will say though this does not have a lot of acidity to it's not bad it's just kind of basic is the best way i can describe it as um however i am very curious to see how this acts with milk to see if it has a better flavor profile when paired with something that's a little bit creamier so i'm gonna get out that pitcher i'm gonna get out that little hand frother thing and let's just see how this goes we have ironically two ikea double a batteries they make it as easy as possible for you to never have to leave their shop for anything else will i remember how these go in probably not wait am i not supposed to use double a's i thought i was okay wait no how do i fit two of these in two double a batteries i'm phoning a friend here phone a husband that's one of the choices right you just put them in he says that easy it looks like you're struggling a little bit here i'll get the other one maybe we can tag team this and see who gets done first ah okay ah it works so thank you thank you yes okay success so excited these things are always so fascinating to me they aren't in any way near as good as steam wands but they're not half bad either i will say there was a point in my life where i judged these little hand frockers but i think they're pretty great now as a milky drink i think this coffee is pretty lovely it's not super intense it's not a complicated coffee but it is comforting it is tasty and i'm not super mad at it i'll be totally honest now that was just with french press we still have one more coffee to go which is going to be our drip coffee so let's hop onto that real quick and we'll see what we end up with so this is another low acidity coffee says it has a pretty rich full body and is a dark roast okay let's just go for it all right so i'm gonna be using this bonavita brewer right here i'm gonna be brewing four cups of coffee so very comparable to what we did in the french press i'm gonna use about 30 to 32 grams of ground coffee in here because that's what i like doing when i use this every day for most coffees that tends to be a pretty reliable ratio of water to coffee and we'll just see how it goes there it goes enjoy some coffee asmr enjoy the sound of milk boring everyone we're doing great today if you make messes just clean them up it's okay again it still smells a lot fruitier which is good that's what i prefer it smells a little bit more complex than the past one did it doesn't have that kind of like one note just like roastiness and that's it so that's hard to say roastiness this one almost has a more milky flavor just up front um i would describe it as being like a softer coffee if that makes sense like instead of that kind of like punchy more kind of like bitter dark chocolate i would describe this as having more like milk chocolaty notes where it's the flavors are a lot softer it kind of feels like it has a more rounded more like full bodied feel to it so i'm going to add a little bit of milk to this and we'll see how it tastes with the milk added just a splash no need to go crazy milk pairs nicely with it all in all here are some of my final thoughts i think that if you are at ikea and you're getting furniture and you happen to have another errand afterwards that involves you picking up coffee i think it wouldn't be the worst thing if you just grabbed these instead they're pretty one-note coffees again they're not super complex but they are not disgusting that might not sound like high praise but what i mean is they're very comforting they're very much like a classic dark roast coffee and if you serve this to me pretty much anywhere i wouldn't really question it i would have no idea that this came from ikea the packaging is kind of fun whoops i like the idea that there is some traceability behind that um but yeah raiding not the worst thing now i'm gonna do my best to go get my hands on the espresso grinds of this coffee because there is a whole series that is made especially just for espresso and i know i've seen this online they also have whole bean coffee so for another video i'm gonna see if i can hunt those down and we'll talk about them i think there's gonna be a lot more variation in the espresso than there would be in drip because overall i just prefer espresso i have a lot more experience with it drip coffee is kind of it's good you know it's yummy it's a classic um but for me i don't find it nearly as interesting so we're gonna go find the espresso grind and i'll be back hopefully very soon with it but for now have a great rest of your day thanks for sticking around with me while i gave this my best go and i will see you next week and probably the week after that feel free to follow me on my other socials if you like i post every day on tiktok and i do some stuff on instagram other than that have a lovely day drink lots of coffee and i'll see you later", "scTC4S-9t08": "[Music] hello fans this is BMC and and this is my quick review of tales of how the gates rich Italian coffee beans and I have reviewed this one before previously many well I say many a couple of years ago when I first started reviewing coffees and they just fought a tub of sort of re-evaluation of it because I remember being quite disappointed with it the first time I tried it now Tesco at the moment I'm not sure about such that well testicle at the moment have got the sailors of Halle gates and two four six pounds which is a pretty good deal because the norm of the Gulf had about three pounds 75 four pounds a bug in Tesco these ones they also picked up the sales of Halle gates in Garnett Ugandan ground coffee which I haven't reviewed before so I'm looking forward to trying that one what I thought that openly rich Italian fest now in there two for six pounds they also include the single origin cacao soup here you get I think it's called and that goes felt on its own about four pound forty five four pound fifty and I was tempted to include that one in the two bags rather than gone for this Italian and roast well anyway let's get on with the review let's take a look at the bag sage roasted and sealed could extraordinary flavor which is debatable little tallien lotion before rich and refined coffee beans this was 227 grams description on the back is cow Chow and Michi offend others this elegant coffee takes you to the cobbles of northern Italy inspired by the local blog style it delivers rich flavors of dark chocolate and almond it's seriously refined and dazzling after dinner and the best before they there is mates went twenty-one so well over a year on the best before date on this one do you tell you how to brew your coffee they're so fine for that special medium for filter and course for cavity air storage instructions it's a hundred percent Arabica this coffee it's a rain forest Alliance certified royal seal of approval for what that's where these days and everything we do at sales is devoted to filling your taste buds every blend is slowly drawn roasted then sealed with a one-way valve the flavor that is extraordinary as the day it was popped each coffee is roasted to its perfect points on a scale at the feet to seven and this four which is say quite unusual for an Italian rose the sort of more the darker roasts usually with the supermarket coffees so let's take a look at the beans and a decent quality but as I say you'd expect the rolls to be a little bit darker with them with its Italian roasts and the enrollment of the beans is a bitter dark chocolate and it's rich too it's slightly smoky which is unusual as it as I say it's not a dark roast and it's nutty as well and that's a very slight floral hint it has a underlying air phoenix there and as I say it smells darker than it looks so take a quick look at the ground coffee quite dark sort of reddish lots of it and when ground it's sweet side comes out along with that almond hints mentioned on the pack the smoky hint is still prominence and reminds me a bit of smoky bacon with this one it's got a nice bite to it as well when it's being ground so taste wise it's chocolatey and sweet slightly nutty and smoky there's no acidity and a slight bitten that's about it don't get me wrong it's a good quality copy but there's not much to it really it's medium bodied but there's just something a bit watery about it I am it's nice enough but if you're used to any sort of complexity to your coffee like me I think you'll be a bit disappointed by this one especially as most Italian roasts are quite bold and distinct this is neither or saying that it is one of the better coffees that are described as an Italian Roasters most of them are really low quality and overall stood cheap nasty coffees where this is good quality and a decent if overly mild taste for an Italian roast and you'd expect a little bit more bitterness and maybe roasted a little bit longer but it's nice enough and my only gripe with it is it's not bold enough an Italian rose so I'll give this one a three point two five out of five if you like a bold and brash coffee give this one a Miss if you like a coffee with a decent that's decent quality but a bit bland in taste this may be where four try I was disappointed the first time I tried this years ago and I'm still a bit disappointed with it today so I'd really like to hear from anyone who's tried this coffee let me know your thoughts on it as I say it's a lot better quality than most its Halim roses but as I say it's just a little bit bland so let me know what you think of it in the comment section below and let me know about Taylor's coffees in general as well and yeah so if you like this video give it a thumbs up and if you want to see more coffee reviews in the

watching bye for now [Music]", "URXrdzfaxE0": "so you bought expensive specialty coffee beans grown on some magical little farm way up in the clouds you roasted them and found the result to be a little underwhelming was that your fault or were you sold cheap commercial beans in a fancy package how do you evaluate the quality of green coffee beans actually it's easy here I'll show you your nose can tell you a lot all fresh greens have a strong grassy smell like hey that's just been cup stale ones have a milder smell more like straw and often a paler color so if a good deep sniff makes you smile and think of springtime and freshly cut grass or hay you've probably got good beans if on the other hand it puts you in mind oh damn wicker furniture or a straw mat they're almost certainly past for a prime of course Naturals will have a fruity esters smell and honey's will have a yeasty mushroomy funk your next set of clues comes from the frequency and types of defects you find severe defects can spoil a cup of coffee you should find no more than three per kilo minor defects probably can't be tasted first up we have insect damage leading to rot this can spoil a cup and should be counted against your total of three major defects per kilo next we have blacks and sours notice that they're discolored throughout not just on the surface they'll be light brown to olive green to almost black now four minor defects this is minor insect damage there's no rot so one of these beans won't spoil a cup here we have mechanical damage broken beans are dead and possibly still some of these are chipped and others are what are called shells or ears one won't spoil a cup but they won't contribute any flavor these are withered beans they were starved of water or exposed to frost they look a bit like blacks and sours except for the color one bean won't spoil a cup but they won't contribute any flavor we've got immature beans here they should have been segregated during processing but weren't again finding a lot of these is a sign of low quality beans one wouldn't spoil a cup but it won't contribute any flavor and too many can yield astringent immature is often have a bowl or spoon shaped with sharp edges they typically have a paler color which you can see here in comparison to normal beans if you have a lot of minor defects the coffee might taste fine but the quality might be lower than you're paying for with washed beans like these you can expect a good green color the smell should be grassy and refresh and rather strong they should be dense because channel washing allows for easy sorting according to density here are some natural these beans were dried completely inside the cherries then whole you can expect some berry aromas and flavors from contact with the cherry juices or Musil \u00e4j-- but you might also detect tropical fruits like mango and pineapple that's because fruit esters are the byproducts of fermentation of microbe metabolism and it can go in a lot of different directions the smell in this case should be fruity and ester II yet still strongly glassy Brazilian naturals are processed a bit differently and really deserved a short video of their own which I probably will get around to fairly soon these are honey's they're pulped before drying but not washed they ferment in piles along with the Meuse lives and this period can be extended for longer than the fermentation period of nach which makes these more funky and fruity although fermentation always produces some fruit esters now some of these look pretty sketchy and might remind you of defective beans like the sours we looked at but look closely and you'll see that the discoloration is superficial you can see the healthy green color showing through in places these beans are actually a very high quality although I'm sure they'd look pretty dodgy to a casual observer because the length of fermentation vary the smell ranges from fruity and yeasty to full-on Paris m\u00e9tro in July but again if the beans are fresh and of good quality that grassy thing will be going on in the background well that's all for today in my next roasting video I'll be cooking the three samples of coffee that we just looked at explaining the best ways to approach them so keep in touch Cheers [Music]", "88cYhrgwvnc": "hello my name is Pete Dryden and I'm gonna show you how to make chocolate covered coffee beans you will need chocolate coffee beans a large pot and a spoon the first step is add your chocolate to a pot now boil the chocolate boiling to keep the chocolate smooth once the chocolate is melted add the coffee beans and stir it around once the beans are coated use your spoon to scoop them out add to a plate let them sit overnight until the chocolate becomes hard and that's how you make chocolate covered coffee beans", "I9GSi6o2UpQ": "how to get through the tough times in life we all go through tough times in life and how you respond to these difficult

complained to her father how tough her life was she was tired of fighting and struggling all the time it seemed as if just as one problem was solved another one soon followed after listening for a

potato went in strong and tough but in the boiling water it became soft and weak the egg was fragile until it was put in the boiling water then the inside of the egg became hard and rigid however the coffee beans didn't change after being exposed to the boiling water instead they changed the water and created something new which one are you the father asked his daughter [Music] when facing tough times how do you respond are you a potato an egg or a coffee bean the moral of the story in life things happen around you and things happen to you the only thing that truly matters is your choice of how you react to the situation and what you make of it i would love to hear from you in the comment box below how would you implement the lesson in this story in your life and until we meet again live fully and stay awesome", "o53Y2Ad13WE": "remember in the movie elf where buddy sees a sign in the store it says world's best cup of coffee and he walks in and he says you did it congratulations world's best cup of coffee have you ever had an experience like that I had that once in Bolivia I went on a mission trip when I was in college and we were there to help build a school building and one morning the missionaries sent before us coffee that they had made and it was amazing and I was like this is like coffee like I've never had before and I couldn't I was just completely astounded and so once I left there I figured wahoo I'm gonna have to search for a really good coffee when I get back to the States and once I got back I could never duplicate the coffee's that I had in Bolivia and I couldn't figure out why and I look for Bolivian origin and I look for whatever it was just never the same and then one Christmas I got a little micro roaster and I got to roast my own coffee beans and there was a little bit of a an experiment just to see what it would be like and as soon as I drank that coffee I knew I had finally found that world's best cup of coffee that I had been searching for all these years and had to do not so much with the beans because there's amazing beans great tasting beans great variety of beans all over the world but it had to do with the roast and the freshness and that was a game changer for me from that time on I've been roasting my own being now my search is not for a great cup of coffee but it's for all the nuances and all the different flavors that you can get alert a light roast versus a dark roast there's such a variety and it's it's absolutely endless but by roasting my own coffee beans I've been able to find that perfect cup of coffee every single time because it's completely fresh all right all we gotta do let's close these beans up [Music] and now we start the stopwatch because it's all about time no more am I going to the store and buying back coffee because think about it that coffees come from the is from the roaster to being bagged up and then sent across the country and stocked in your store and by the time it gets to you it's already aging as soon as coffee is roasted it begins the aging process okay we just heard first crack so another minute and a half or so and we she's done with the nice medium roast by the time you get that first cup of coffee from that bag it's already well into its aging process and typically those coffees just can't compare to freshly roasted coffee so that's the raw green bean and then this starts the roasting process and as time goes on they get darker and darker and wherever you stop it determines your roast until you get right here and this you can see the gloss on this bean this would be that would be an espresso roast bean right there okay here you go and you can see right there those little pieces of chaff the husk of the bean pot that pops off at first at first crack and will blow that off after the bean cools there you go a nice medium dark roast and we'll just let it finish cooling it's really that easy I can do this in less time that I can go to the store and buy a bag it's a pretty quick process it's really a lot of fun and so for me it's been a game changer I've been about roasting my own coffee for more than a year now I love it there's so much variety and you get the best tasting coffee anywhere and so this is the payoff when you roast it yourself the cup of coffee in the world [Music]", "FzKe6JQOXK4": "hello everybody welcome back to my channel

nothing like buying something online or buying something at the grocery store and coming home and being like this is not what I actually enjoy and today we're talking about the coffee label so how does a coffee label help you purchase a coffee that you like [Music] alright so the first thing you may notice on a coffee label is the actual brand itself and basically that tells you who was responsible for bringing the green coffee in taking it throwing it and something like that like one of those Roasters are basically an oven taking green coffee turning it brown packaging it and getting it to you totally and the next thing that you'll probably notice is the name of the coffee so for a lot of companies they'll create a specific blend which is a mixture of two different coffee origins multiple coffee origins and for us most of the time that's actually the name of the producer and the origin country where the coffee came from so personally for us we wanted to make sure that the hard-working people behind the coffee the farmer the producer the origin country name of the coffee was noticed and acknowledged so we did this by putting the producers name on the front of the bag right above the country origin so for this coffee in particular the name is Consuela Gomes which is the wonderful producer that produced this coffee and the country of origin is Colombia in the region of Mourinho that's kind of how we've decided to name our coffees so if you see a foreign name on there it's mostly the name of the person who put in all the work to grow the coffee all right and the next thing you may notice is the process and basically the process informs you on how the coffee seed or the coffee bean was removed from the coffee cherry where the coffee fruit and I think that's a little bit more in depth look as to how the producer decided work on the final product of this coffee exactly and so give us a quick little rundown as to how different processes affect the taste yeah so there's primarily about three different main processes there's one a washed and it's usually combined with a drying method and then there's a like a honey process which is basically a combination of like a wash and then a natural and a natural processed is basically means that the coffee seed or the coffee bean was fermented inside the coffee cherry basically every single processing method brings out different characteristics of the coffee bean itself so not to make a hierarchy of what tastes better it's just different so a natural is gonna definitely taste different than a wash process and they'll have their own characteristics to that totally and I think that's that's what brings us to the next detail on the backk which is the coffee flavors or the coffee tasting notes as you might see for this coffee in particular there's lemon peel vanilla and apricot and a lot of people will actually ask me hey did you guys infuse those flavors into the coffee bean and I'm always excited to say no we did not because coffee is actually a cherry it's a fruit it comes with its unique tasting profile and so depending on which country it was grown in how high of elevation um how it was processed all of those things will in the end change the way the coffee tastes but I also give it its uniqueness compared to all the other coffees maybe on the shelf or or all the other coffees grown in the world all right so a little detail on the bottom of the bag is Bellingham Washington and that basically allows us to tell you that we take pride in where we are at which is the pacific northwest corner of the United States Bellingham Washington we're putting a flag in the ground and saying Mira Coffee Roasters lives row and serves coffee in Bellingham Washington another little detail is the 12 ounce and 340 grams basically that tells you how much coffee is in this bag and that will allow you to make an informed decision on how many bags you need to buy and how long this coffee will last so some final little bits and details about our bag in particular and maybe you'll find that and others is that we decided to add in a little highlighted color to bar at the bottom and this just helps you distinguish this coffee in particular apart from the other things in options that we're offering for this bag we decided to go with the yellow strip just because it resembles the flavor notes more vanilla peel apricot we thought it might be a good idea and finally of course you'll see the row state at the bottom of the bag why is this important well it's the freshness of the coffee coffee over time will lose the flavor notes that you're getting they won't be as prominent it won't be as flavorful so oftentimes you'll go to a grocery store and you'll find coffees that are roasted three months ago six months ago which I would say is not the end of the world but you're losing out on a lot of the beautiful aspects of those coffees specifically we recommend at a maximum of about four to five weeks after that we're noticing that the coffee becomes a little flat bland and not as flavorful well thank you guys so much for making it this far this was just simply our way of saying hey I know coffee labels can get really intimidating what in the world do these flavor notes mean these names mean but simply just to help you make a more informed decision there's nothing like buying something online or buying something at the grocery store and coming home and being like this is not what I actually enjoy so hopefully these details you'll get a better understanding of them so that you can make better informed decisions about your coffee well you guys if he doesn't want more coffee information more coffee videos they're on the way we're

"b537paZQ4jw": "but you've been cotton here from the captain's coffee at the captain's coffee calm we're going to do a quick demo of the genie cafe home roaster machine and it is a fantastic roaster it's really our flagship Roasters the one that I like the most I think it's fantastic really heavy-duty components very serviceable you can actually repair this roaster you can get parts for it it is a really nice batch size just enough at least for my family to gross enough coffee for the entire week the exhaust muffler I call it a muffler here is nice chaff collector also right built into that that right into here all the chap gets collected here you can dump it right out to the trash cans really convenient no mess you can put a small dryer vent hose on this here visit get the smoke out of your house really nicely or up into a range event there's a lot of things about this roaster that I really like especially the amount of control you have it really allows you to do just about any roast profile you want and so let's just take a look first at the front panel and then I'll show you how to roast with it it's pretty simple first you have time right here which is the blue knob and you can rotate this either way to increase the time which you see right there on the left and green and you can do this on the fly any time during your row so you have complete control press the button to turn restoran and off pretty simple nice large buttons easy to use and then over here on the left the red knob is your temperature knob increase that increases the temperature on your readout right there same thing down you can do this any time during the roast and press it to start the roast or to enter the cool cycle other thing is if you want to do an emergency stop which gave if you don't want to use the cooling cycle that for the built in to the roaster you just want to dump the beans into a colander and cool them yourselves you can do that by just pressing this and holding it for a few seconds and it will force the roaster to stop and so you can pull the roasting chamber out and dump the beans yourself works great there's a nice thing about this roaster one of the things that really sets it apart from other Roasters at least home Roasters I on the read temperature readout here will see this when I start the roast this switches back and forth between the time that you've set for it to reach or not the time the temperature that you set and also the actual temperature that it's reading inside the roaster because there are thermocouples in there that will read the temperature inside the roaster and tell you what temperature it is and so you can actually see exactly what's happening in the roaster as it goes along and make changes accordingly so that's pretty great the other thing that this does is when you hit your cool cycle it doesn't do start a timer actually will start a timer but it doesn't stop the roast I've stopped the cool cycle until it actually reaches 140 degrees whenever that happens so you know that your your beans are completely cooled by the time it's done and you're not over cooling and sitting there waiting when you don't need to it's a pretty great feature of this roaster that you don't find a lot of other home Roasters so let's check out a roast on this ge cafe roaster and hope you learn something ok so I've got the roasting chamber out here and the lid is opened and I'm going to put in three are actually two and a half scoops of beans using this scoop that comes with the roaster and I'm using a Guatemala Way way to nangou organic Fairtrade coffee there's one two and a half you notice this line here it says draw process beans that really what that means is if you've got a real Chaffee coffee you're not going to fill it past that line others you can I've got a coffee that doesn't have a lot of chaff to it you actually push the capacity up to three full scoops which gives you a little bit more coffee if you just play around with it you know what you want you'll see when it operates it the way the chaff collection works if you use too much beans or there's too much chaff we obviously choke the roaster a little bit and it'll get too hot this air is not flowing through and you can burn your beans so stick to two and a half scoops and you know if you've got a coffee that you know is not going to produce a lot of chaff like a decaf for example then you can go ahead and go with three and that will work just fine all right so I'm going to place the roasting chamber in the roaster and by the way this stand for the roasting chamber comes with the roaster and you should definitely use it because you don't want to break this just goes in it kind of a wonky angle just like that kind of an angle because you'll see as it rotates it rotates it kind of in a three-dimensional pattern which is nice for your agitation this is this does nothing for you except keep you from I guess jamming your hands down in there and getting them caught it's a safety thing so you know that's all that is I'm going to leave it open for for this so you can see the beans better here's how I like to roast the first thing I'll do is I'll preheat the roaster to 350 for maybe five minutes or so this is the first roast but I actually just roasted some on this on this guy just a few minutes ago so I'm not going to do that but I suggest you do especially in a winter time when the roaster is completely cold and preheated a little bit I'll help you with your with your roast especially in terms of you know having a good starting place in terms of temperature okay so I'm going to go ahead and start my roast at 3:20 I'll do that for five minutes I'll advance the time up to 30 minutes just like that I'm going to let it go at 3:20 for five minutes until the beans start to yellow a little bit we get nice and warm and then I'll bump it up to four sixty so here we go okay so I'm a little under five minutes I've gone by and the bees are starting to turn a little bit yellow enough that's going to show up well on the camera or not but they're lightning what's happening is the moisture is being cooked out of those beans and at the same time they are absorbing a lot of heat which is what we want to happen right now and I can also smell a kind of a wet grass smell coming out of the exhaust on the roaster which indicates that we're right where we need to be it's about time to increase the temperature to really get these beans going for its first crack so I'm going to turn the temperature up to four sixty right there and one thing about this roaster is that it slowly adds temperature it isn't good jump straight to four hundred and sixty degrees from three hundred and twenty degrees but you can watch the temperature rise here on the temperature reading out you can see four sixty is where I've set it and 336 or three thirty eight is where the temperature is now as it increases and you can watch that to happen right about well typically with most beans and then you know this is going to vary a little bit but right around 450 you're going to see first crack start to happen it might be a little bit before that a little after but on this on this roaster typically in my experience 450 is about where you can expect that to happen the thing about this roaster is it's very quiet puff is going to come through on the video the audio or not it's a very quiet roaster the downside to that is it's very hard to hear first crack and hear second crack but that's okay you can certainly smell it and you can see it happened which we'll see in just a second so I'm heading for 460 and let's just watch it roast okay we are right at 453 degrees and you can expect first crack to happen any second notice the beans are nice of ground color and they are about to pop what's happening here is they have absorbed as much heat energy as they can and they're now going to release energy by cracking open the silver skin around the bean is going to come off as chaff and you're going to see a start to the beans will enlarge quite a bit yeah this is definitely first crack and here a couple of those you probably won't be able to hear it on the video but if you look I've got a flashlight here and try to see I can give you a good view back there in the back of the roaster back there you can see some vent holes and chap collecting there with a little wiper that wipes across those events and pushes the chaff through into the chaff collector at the end of the roaster that big black thing at the end of the roaster when you start seeing chaff like that collect that that's the probably the best indicator that you are in first crack the other thing is I can smell we've gone from like a wet grass smell to what I think of as a roasting coffee smell it's sweet sugary kind of like caramelizing sugar which is exactly what's happening in the beans all those sugars in there that have been buried inside that coffee bean are now coming to the surface and caramelizing which causes that smoke and that smell that's very sweet sort of a butterscotch roasting smell yes see there's that chaff in the back of the roaster now this is why you don't want to overload your ge cafe roaster with too many beans or too many very Chaffey beans because if those holes block up too the airflow won't go through and your race is going to get really hot really fast which doesn't taste good number one but also you'll probably burn your batch so you don't want to do that so that's that's why the dosing of the roaster matters all right so now it's just a matter of where how dark new inaros your beans I like to level off the temperature at 460 you can go higher than that all the way to 475 if you like I like like to let it sit for I like to extend the time between first and second crack a little bit this is a nice medium dark roast that's what I like to do I'm going to let it go just a little bit longer with the genie cafe you want to got to remember that you're going to coast a little bit after you hit the cool button so you want to anticipate how dark you want it to be and hit the cool button before it gets there otherwise you're going to go a little farther than you like so here we go who only go ahead and hit it now so now what's happened is the the heater element has turned off and the fan has turned up on high glowing as much cool air through there as possible and you'll notice here a timer start so you get an idea of how long it's been cooling but the way the machine knows to stop the stop the cool cycle is the temperature when it gets down below 140 degrees that's when it's going to stop okay we've reached 140 degrees the roaster stopped and we'll pull them out let's grab this little tab right here with your thumb grab the handle lift it right out set it down now you should probably use oven mitts to grab this but doing a barehanded has never bothered me with before it is pretty hot though I wouldn't touch the glass then you lift the lid and I like to take my thumb and hold that to keep it from closing on me while I'm pouring beans out just like that there you have it nice evenly roasted maybe a little darker than I wanted it but that's okay house multi-tasking so yeah it's this roaster the genie cafe rose about as evenly as anything I've seen especially for home home roasting and they're roasted nice and slow most of the people who buy a GE cafe mentioned that the there's a little bit better body to it I think that's due to the slow roasting it really is a fantastic roaster and produces really great roasts I mean that's just about as even as you can get and I cannot wait drink this okay everybody that's your Jeanne cafe roaster demo", "er2voEn8ZDU": "Welcome to the understanding\nespresso series. A series where we take apart an individual variable in\nthe espresso making process. In the past, we've looked at\ndose in, ratio and brew time. Today, we're looking at the\nmost complex of the variables in my opinion, which is the grind setting. How fine or how coarse you\nshould be grinding the coffee, and when you should use your grind setting to make an adjustment to taste. Espresso is a lot of fun, but it's also immensely frustrating especially when you're starting out. And I would say this variable is by far the most frustrating of\nall of them to work with. And I'll give you the reasons why and there's kind of three reasons. So let's say you make\na grind setting change, going a little bit finer. And doing so, you'll expose\na lot more surface area of the ground coffee. If you think about cutting\nan apple into big pieces there's not that much surface area but if you diced it down into tiny pieces you'd expose a lot more\nof the inside of an apple. And the same is true with a coffee bean. And so far that's good\nnews, more surface area is very useful for extracting\nmore coffee flavor. But when you change the surface area you also change the way that the grounds interconnect with each other. And when you tamp them down\nin your little pack of coffee the finer the pieces are,\nthe better they fit together, and the harder it is for the\nwater to flow through them. This will increase the contact time between the water and the coffee. So you have this one\nchange to surface area that impacts flow rate\nand contact time as well, and that's a bit of a headache. And then for an extra twist, quite often, changing the grind setting is a little bit wasteful. Now this isn't true of every\nsingle grinder ever made but it's very true of many,\nmany. many coffee grinders people use for espresso. They don't perfectly push\nout all of the coffee that they grind every\ntime that you use them. Inside the grinding chamber\nthat houses the burrs as well as the exit chute you'll often find some\nresidual ground coffee and that was ground at a setting maybe before you made a change. So when you make a change, you need to purge out some coffee to push out to these old grounds that are sort of set at\nthe wrong grind setting with some new ones. And that's frustrating\nbecause some grinders need a lot of purging and others don't but either way that's coffee\nthat you never get to drink. That's coffee that you waste. And so changing the grind\nsetting is frustrating but it's necessary. Without grinding finely enough, you can't do the extraction\nwork that you need to, to get all the good flavor out using only a little bit of water. And that's the kind of nature of espresso because you want to use\njust a little bit of water to have a strong, concentrated,\nthick delicious, gooey, sweet espresso at the end of it. Now just quickly, I wanna go back just through how we got to this point, a little bit of history. People worked out pretty\nearly on that to brew faster, you had to grind finer that way, this increased surface area meant that those flavors were more accessible. But quickly you got to the\npoint where there was a problem, finely ground coffee is\ndifficult to get water through. And in the early years of espresso different methods were found\nto increase the pressure that the water was pushed\nthrough with the coffee. Eventually with compressed springs, we got to the kind of\npressures that we use today around nine bars of pressure. It's the equivalent in\nstrange money of 130 PSI but ultimately it's nine\natmospheres of pressure. And that is a lot of pressure. That causes problems in espresso brewing. Generally speaking, you\nwanna go as fine as you can, expose as much surface area as you can before you break the puck. Espresso brewing happens at\nthese very fine pressures and they are dependent on resistance coming from the coffee cake. But at some point that\nvery high pressured water may well find a channel\nthrough which to run an easier pathway. And what happens when an\nespresso puck essentially breaks is that it begins to channel and more water begins to flow\nthrough less of the coffee. Channeling happens in most\nexpressos at some point and to varying degrees. But as you go finer and finer and finer you increase the likelihood\nof these channel forming because you've created\nsuch a lot of resistance to the water pressure. Now, the grind is not the\nonly variable that dictates how good a job your puck does of creating even resistance\nthroughout the whole brew. Obviously the depth of\nthe puck will play a role as does your puck preparation how evenly the coffee is distributed before you tamp it down. Often people will talk\nabout over extraction when you grind a little bit too finer. I know I've done that too, and we associate that word\nwith very bitter flavors coming through in your espresso. Generally speaking, the puck as a whole may not actually be over extracted. The puck as a whole maybe\nunder extracted actually, but, the areas around the channels where water has flowed much\nfaster and in higher volumes, they are extremely over extracted. So they've given up\nmore flavor than we want and they've added that bitter\nharshness to the shots. But you'd argue that's\nreally more uneven extraction than it is over extraction, or just localized over extraction rather than total over extraction. Because again, if you're\nmeasuring this stuff with refractometers and\nlooking at your total yields you won't see a big increase in extraction in that incredibly fine grinds,\nyou'll actually see a drop. And in the past, this actually\npushed people to experiment with a much coarser grind than it's typically used for espresso. In a paper that was published\nand I made a video about that, so you should check that video out up here when you're done watching this one. Now I'm not gonna say, you\nhave to use very coarse grinds because you end up needing\nto use a higher ratio to get a more balanced shot, but you do get a more even extraction using these slightly coarser grounds than you do using very\nfinely ground coffee but your end result does feel and taste and have that kind of different\ntexture and strength to it. So let's talk about using grind in a much more practical way. I would definitely use\ngrind to first and foremost get my flow rate about right. Let's say I'm looking for\nan 18 grams in 36 grams out in around 30 seconds. Well, I'm gonna use my grind setting to get me to that point. But once I'm there, I'm gonna taste it, and chances are, the\ntweaks I'm going to make, If the espresso is good, but not perfect are gonna be two other\nvariables that we'll discuss. If I'm still a long way\naway from good tasting I'd say I'm still very sour, I'm gonna go finer again,\nand see how that does even if it's outside of my original spec. But if I get my grind\nsetting approximately correct then I'm gonna make those little tweaks with dose, with yield, potentially with temperature\nin some cases, but unlikely. But primarily I would suspect with my coffee in and my coffee out. They're gonna let me fine tune\nthat recipe pretty easily. Now, the reason I like\nto use grind like this for the big changes, but maybe not as often when I'm tweaking is actually largely practical. If you're a beginner or intermediate in the world of espresso, then I think making less grind changes is probably an easier thing. There's waste from purging, there's the, just the\ngeneral frustration around making those changes and\nmaking them accurately especially if you have a new grinder or you're just new to the process. So I think a big changes\nwith grind are good, and also if you have a stepped to grinder where the steps between each\nsetting are quite large, then again I would go probably\nfor the finer of the two even if that means dropping down my dose and that kind of stuff,\nbecause I'm just more likely to have a good experience\nthat way than being stuck with a slightly coarser\ngrind that I might want. If I lived in a world\nwith unlimited coffee, unlimited time and resources, then I would use grind to\nreally, really, really, make small adjustments, but that needs a very good grinder, a lot of patience and\nquite a lot of waste. And I'm not sure that's great real world sort of advice or recommendations. So I would say you're more\nlikely to enjoy your espressos and the espresso making process, If you're not throwing away\na ton of coffee each time. So at the risk of repeating myself use your grind to get close,\nget good tasting espresso. If things are dominantly sour you need to grind a little bit finer. If you're finding things\nare getting a little bit too bitter and harsh, or you're\ngetting a lot of channeling then maybe come back a little bit coarser. I'll summarize all this in a second, I'll give you some basic\nrules for using grind, but first I wanna talk about\nthe sponsor of this video, which is Skillshare. Skillshare is an online learning community full of thousands of classes for creative and curious\npeople like you and me. And if you watch these videos, then you'll know that over the years, Skillshare has been very useful for me to develop my filmmaking skills, but there's a lot more than\njust filmmaking classes there.

Thanks to Skillshare for\nsponsoring this video. So to wrap up, I'll give you\na few simple rules to use when thinking about grind setting. So rule one, once again, use it to get in the ballpark of tasty. Fix your recipe, don't vary that just use your grind setting\nto get to pretty good, and then tweak from there using your other variables in the recipe. Rule two, generally speaking,\npush it as fine as you can, before you start to see\nchanneling happening. Now, channeling would be very obvious if you using a naked portafilter and you'll start to see an\neven flow in your basket especially in the last\nthird of the espresso. But you can also see it\nin a spouted portafilter. You'll just be looking for\na sudden increase in flow as coffee starts to gush out of the spouts in the last third of the of the shot or potentially the last half If things have gone really wrong. Channeled expressos tend to taste a little bit weaker than\nyou expect, kind of hollow. They have this acidity\ncoupled with this bitterness that you get in the finish this kind of harsh biting after taste. In the past I've even recommended grinding from some grinders into a\nlittle collection chamber or bucket or tin or something, shaking out any potential clumps and then dosing into your\nportafilter from there for this kind of a reason. Puck prep is really important, but going too fine will produce channeling kind of no matter what. Rule three, only change one\nflow related variable at a time. If you're changing your grind, do not change the dose\nof coffee in your puck at the same time. You won't understand or get insight into the impact of either one that way and you won't know what's gone\nright, or what's gone wrong. So if you're changing your grind keep everything else the same, so you can understand the nature of the change that you've made. And rule four, purging is essential. And it's better to purge and\nwaste five grams of coffee than it is to waste the\nwhole dose that you ground incorrectly, pull the shot off and wasted. So if you are changing your grind setting, with most grinders, five grams, 10 grams, it really depends on\nthe make and the model but just make sure you're getting nothing but the new grind setting\nthat you wanna test to see if it makes the espresso\nthat you want to drink. But now I'd like to hear from you. How do you feel about setting the grind? Does it freak you out? Does it stress you out to\nchange your grind setting? Does it feel like you make\na change and nothing happens and then something happens later on or you just feel like you chase it round and around and around and around and you never get where you wanna go. And I'd love to hear from you\ndown in the comments below, let me know which bit\nof this spoke to you, let me know what you want me to go into in further depth in the future. But for now, I'll say thank\nyou so much for watching, and I hope you have a great day.", "R_dSdbhrp84": "in this clip we're going to learn how to pack the portafilter which is this device right here which holds the espresso full of espresso and then we're going to actually learn about how to hold the shots themselves all right you're going to want to fill up the container pretty full and then what you're going to do is you're going to push the coffee down using a spoon or whatever if you have a tamper that's actually great that would work better so pack it down the reason that we pack it is because the um more espresso that's in there the better chops you're gonna get because it's gonna be stronger and that's the point of espresso you're not trying to get weak coffee you're trying to get a good strong robust flavor all right next now that we have this all packed you want to dust off those grinds just to make sure that you're not getting it up in the head so that you're going to get the clean shots of the best shots that you can all right now to do this we're going to put it up in this situation we're turning it to the right now that we have the shots in there while the espresso we're gonna get this and turn it on now a lot of people um don't know the difference between like espresso beans and coffee beans so you want to know the difference you don't want to just grab like pre-ground whatever coffee and put it in espresso machine you're going to want to get the best darkest roast especially if you want your straw the strongest shots available um and also you're going to notice when it's pulling the shots itself that there's going to be a layer there's going to be three different layers there's going to be a bottom darkest layer a middle later and then there's gonna be a top light golden layer that's gonna be the crema that's the most flavorful part of the shot itself so make sure that when you're pulling your shots that you're getting a nice thick layer of primer on the top and that it's not all just watered down dark coffee", "JcO6fahtYhY": "[Applause] what is going on guys welcome back to a brand new video I know what to find a minute it's okay it's holiday season I got a quick one for you I think you might like see in the background what we got there so let's just something I like to do once a year I like to make myself chocalate covered coffee beans so I like to make a bunch of coffee beans but melt the chocolate put the coffee beans into it and then I forensic Li put it on to the wax paper I like to make myself quite a bit like a like a half a jar - munch on them I'll take one or two every couple days I don't guys this is weird kind of embarrassed to say this I don't drink coffee I don't like coffee but for some reason I was intrigued by the chocolate covered espresso or coffee bean and I tried it and I absolutely loved it so I don't get them all the time cuz I don't like to have a lot of caffeine I might have like one Mountain Dew a month if that so the coffee beans are as far as I go so I'm doing these Christmases like today's Friday Saturday Sunday Monday Tuesday five days away so if you need a last-minute gift this is something you can do real quick mouth to mouth - chocolate put the beans in it put it onto the wax paper so let me show you the product so you use guys show you what I got going on so we got to jeer darling dear dolly milk chocolate the Gina dolly baking chocolate and eight o'clock coffee I actually bought this little bowl in the baking section that our supermarket and this is what I want to show you this pot guys is from the as seen on TV if I think of it while I'm uploading the video I'll screenshot this in the box so you could see what what brand it is and stuff my aunt bought this for me and this is gonna be the first time I'm using and I thought this would be perfect so look you could put your veggies in there you could put your pasta in there and then instead of dumping the pot right out you just lift it out water stays in there I'm about a boom so I'm literally trying to think out of the box with this one and try out this new pot it's gonna be a little uneven but we're gonna steam heat the pot I'm gonna put this pot inside it like so and then I'm not gonna touch the water to the bottom of this seamless steel pot I'm just gonna put enough in the bottom to steam the chalk to steam the bowl to heat the chocolate and I'll mix it and we're gonna dump in one time I did this I tried one at a time too tedious so what I'm gonna try to do is lay this out flat on the wax paper and just spread it as thin as I can get it and pull each being at a time or just cut a little like call it I'll call it coffee bean expresso bean bark might be on to something guys so let me get this set up and ready to rock so I've already put one full cup well this is a 16 ounce cup into the pot we're gonna put this in there like so they turn on I'll put on high and for starters I'm gonna dump half a bag of Eton just about a half a bag guys and do half a bag of premium baking chips I'm gonna be perfectly honest I don't know why I use the chocolate well I know why I use Ghirardelli because this is in my eyes the best chocolate to do this with I like the way it tastes good it's rich but I don't know why I do half of the baking and then half of the milk it's just water heats up I'm just gonna start stirring it and then that's what with this like I said you need a quick Christmas present or you want to bring something to linear Christmas parties a little I don't want to call it a showstopper but something to talk about something a little different bring these coffee beans put them in a little jar put a ribbon on top of them you could paint a jar you can do a little Tupperware that's already decorated for like cookies and stuff think out of the box do something different it's what I'm what I try to do sometimes simple stupid easy so this water is already starting to steam and I want to burn the chocolate so I'm gonna put the camera down I'm gonna start stirring the chocolate so it's so it gets nice guys if you like this video cross that like button subscribe and hit the bell notifications so you know what I'm uploading new videos let me know you did all that in the comments below let me know if you what you like about the video and let me know if there's another video like this you would like me to try I keep looking in there because I don't want the I don't want to miss might miss my shot so here we go the only thing I'm worried about is the basket shakin so I'm gonna I got a pot holder to hold it tight yeah we're already losing guys this as seen on TV pan is rolling guys we're waiting for a nice milky chocolate smoothness the way I got to site off I'm not gonna burn the chocolate which is very nice if you notice I switched over to a spoon it's just easier to do the mouth other utensil is too flimsy so it's kind of hard for me to stir it and hold it at the same time so now that it's starting to actually melt or is melted we're gonna give it some good stirs it's almost there guys look nice we're gonna dump the beans in I'm not sure how money it's a lot of chocolate in there so I'm gonna do about a half a bag actually that's about a quarter of a bag we're gonna do the same thing we just did I'm gonna add some more because there's so some woman I don't want any of the chocolate to be runny look at all them coffee beans so I'm gonna let that continue to run I think that way the chocolate doesn't harden on me when I'm trying to put it onto the wax paper so I'm gonna do a spoonful at a time and we'll see how that works out if it works good we're gonna do it one more time I have priests pots of wax paper so let's get rolling guys hey notice the collaboration slow B New York State hunters only shout-out to their club check them out on Facebook my cousin Fritz runs it it's doing a great job with it [Music] [Music] guys had to turn the camera off because my light above me died so I got some of these beans laid out and I still got one more sheet to do so I'm gonna put the camera on that sheet and I'll show you where we're at I might have made two money check her out I just left that on simmer I left that on simmer so there's still some heat coming out of it and it's not burning the chocolate and it's staying perfect so I have time to dump it onto the wax paper so everything's looking good guys what do you think of this video how many coffee heads are out there let me know you know in the comments below if you like your coffee so those beans right here behind me I kind of copped out a little bit but I wanted to try something different cuz I made a ton of them I didn't mean to make that money I just spread them out as soon as I could and I'm hoping to be able to break them off one at a time or just kind of make like I don't want to call it a brownie brittle cuz that's not what it would be it would just be like a make it like a chocolate bar coffee bean chocolate bar chocolate cluster or whatever so tasting some of the chocolate pretty good you guys you're gonna like it so what I'm gonna do is like he's dry it or like he's harden I would like to be able to put them in the fridge but that's just not a it's not an option guys I wanted to do something a little different and I thought we had confectionary sugar and we don't I was gonna take a little look I even got it out I'll show ya who's gonna use this new french toast connection for french toast sir whatever you want to put the sugar on so I was in I'm in a dilemma and I'm gonna use my head I wanted to run next door my aunt's not home and I was gonna run I was possibly gonna run to the store myself but I got to leave these out on the counter and asked me if I have any trust in my dogs I have no trust in them so that's the last thing I need I'm pooping chocolate and hopped up on caffeine so what I'm gonna do these are still hardening I found a jar no once they hardened I'm gonna put them in a jar and make a little Christmas gift just to show you give you an idea what I'm talking about and now we're gonna wrap this video up alright guys we're back it's kind of it's a little later it's about what did cut me it is 944 these beans are finally dry so what we're gonna do I'm gonna put them in little jars show you the jar and we're gonna wrap this thing up so we got a lot of them so we're gonna have enough to go around so check it out check it out oh so I started to I started to do the coffee bark and it breaks right apart it slice kind of nice so I don't have to have just big chunks check it out break it and then chunk it then you get a big pile so we'll do that one last or I will there's clusters or singles so I'll depending on what you like them and how much you like your caffeine you can do a big cluster or if you do two or just a solo these will last me a long time I have a bag of Trader Joe's ones on my desk at work for my wonderful coworker and those have there are different kinds of chocolate sleep cookies and cream milk chocolate dark chocolate I like to mix the milk chocolate in the dark chocolate just kind of like these ones as you can see the GR Dali milk chocolate and then baking dark chocolate my dad it's baking dark chocolate I'm gonna have so many beans guys I overdid it so watch guys I'm getting tired can you hear in my voice I don't put the seal on it then we're going to go look at take this over the top and then seal it so we turn these into a simple gift no I'm not I'm not crafty but for you copy lovers I think that's very subtle which i think is cool guys look how much I freaking have had that small jar a big jar and then this very here I'm gonna keep that piece just like that so I'm gonna try to break it out put it in the fridge put it on a baggie so you can you big chunks of it if you want if you're into that stuff we're having like I'll bring it to like Christmas probably in New Year's a lot of people munch on so guys that is a wrap simple video simple way to make a quick gift I'm gonna try to get this uploaded before Christmas so this is my Christmas video I want it to be a snowmobiling one but I've had these laying around I've been wanting to make them so we're gonna do this for Christmas and after Christmas hopefully we'll be able to upload some sort of snowmobiling video get up north next weekend hopefully there will be some snow on the route yard to at least ride but if not we'll definitely do the shocks we'll adjust them for my weight and stuff so guys we are in the road right now to 500 subscribers I'm at 358 my goal is 500 and then my next goal 2,000 we have all the video hours watched to be monetized I just need the

for me with your loved ones be with your family be with your friends cherish that time love you guys peace up princess princess by you heard her [Music]", "jSyGpvGLGVs": "you this is all about well I wanted to do a sniff test a chicken I see you back in Lavazza here yes I brought you some super crema okay I have a we have a customer that brought a Jura so super-automatic yep and bought some super-criminal as well but it seemed a little dark yeah so wanted to make sure that a it was okay to use in the machine and then wanted to kind of how dark it could be the question question the answer is yes you can use the super crema so this is what super crema looks like that is a medium roast on the other end of the spectrum these two down here are dark roast and this is the an example of what you don't want to use anything that looks like that and people ask well how am I going to be able to tell you really just have to physically look at it if it's shiny like that and directly that means it's been roasted longer drawing the oils out of the B right and it's sitting there right on the surface yeah what does that do it clogs up the grinder in the machine the brew unit and the grinder ground sensor so exactly well those oils just stick to the burs and the chute and what's a little pieces and that's where you get all that buildup in that clogging honing when you don't have the oils on the surface of the beam the grow the beans actually grind better and the other are kind of flow through the process much so just get something that tastes good to you but it's got to be you know this is as dark as I would go exactly and these beans don't have the oils actually pulled from the surface I think that's why they're acceptable to use if you had little tiny oily patches starting to come to the surface you don't really want to use that in a super automatic either but this is kind of worst into the spectrum and then these are dry beans which means that they're great here's a light roast yeah that is yeah absolutely so any super-automatic not just the Jura steer clear this is the check of approval right here okay gale proves well not Gale a Miranda all right thank you later", "H3SUyMX42Q0": "hey now I know what you're thinking you've probably seen these same five different brands of coffee either at your local grocery store online or possibly even at a friend's house and you probably thought to yourself well is that any good what I even like the flavor what is the price point on that and well I'm here to tell you my name is Chris I'm with hotshots catering comm and this is hotshots TV and we're gonna break down the top five most popular gourmet coffees that are out in the market right now in 2019 so stay tuned sit back and relax and grab a cup of coffee and we'll be right back [Music] and welcome back thank you for joining me today for this list of the five most popular gourmet coffees in 2019 so we put this list together based on other baristas we've talked to other people locally in our industry that we've talked to you to find out hey what are either the most popular coffees that are out there on the market that you would like to know about or these are the list of the different coffees that people drink every single day before they go to work and so this is how we're gonna do this review we pretty much purchased all whole beans of coffee of these different brands the only one that's not whole bean is this one here the bulletproof coffee but the reason for that is what we wanted to do with the whole bean calculation in our review is we want to get the freshest cup of coffee possible and so think of it like a like a fruit or vegetable as soon as you break that whole piece down you start degrading what's inside right the freshness and everything else so same premise here for us we want to see a whole bean we want to grind the beans and then we have the freshest cup possible in our opinion the next thing that we wanted to do is we wanted to get what an average person you know going to the store grabbing a bag of coffee what are they gonna get same thing if you went to a restaurant restaurant what type of coffee would you get more than likely they're not going to do a light roast and they're not going to do a dark roast even though a lot of restaurants you probably get served a light roast but it's a medium blend so that's what we have here the only one that's a little bit higher than a medium is this guy right here this black rifle it's called just black and so I figured you know we're going to be doing a cupping of these we're going to taste them how we typically do these reviews is we taste them all black first and then we add a little bit of cream and then we give you a review on that as well so this one here is a little bit higher than a medium but I think overall you know people who just want to have a great cup of coffee these guys here should be the top contenders so other thing is that we also try to perch these just like you would either online or at our local grocery store so these three right here we actually purchased on Amazon and these two down here we actually purchase them through our local grocery store all of them were bought around the same time probably within the couple days notice and you know primarily these three here that we purchased online through Amazon we also made sure that we purchased them through the actual dealer which was important these two obviously we don't know if they've came through the actual dealer or if they're through another third party but overall that shouldn't change too much now one of the factors that you should always look at when you go to a grocery store is you want to find most of the time now I think there's only one or two of these that actually has a roasted date most coffees that you'll find out of the grocery store they don't have a roast date they have a best buy date and so typically when you're buying coffee just a quick tip is you want that longest best-by date so if it's like 20 24 and the latest other ones that you're looking at that are on the front in front of you on the front shelf might be 20 20 well then get the 20 24 because more than likely they roasted that obviously a little bit closer to the time that you're picking it up at the store so yeah so that's kind of what we got together there and then let me get into the brewing method of how we're going to do this review so we have one of our commercial Bunn units that we're gonna utilize to actually brew this coffee that's probably the closest way to how you would brew this coffee at home so we figured that would be kind of the best way to do this and then I lastly before we start getting into doing the actual brewing and doing the cupping and tasting I just want to be very clear with you guys I have no affiliation with any of these brands none of these brands reached out to me for any contribution or to do this video so here are hot shots we believe in full disclosure with these reviews I want to give you an honest review I don't want to be biased going into it by saying oh hey we took some money and this is what we're doing so none of these companies have contacted me I've contacted them we've bought these coffees all with our own money and so we're bringing them to you so we can really feel that we can give you a good unbiased review so without further ado we're going to brew these up and then I'll be right back and we'll start tasting them [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so we just ground the coffee now we're freshly brewing the coffee for this review but before I go any further what I like to do is do a little bit of aroma test and a visual inspection of each one of these roasts so let's start here with actually the bulletproof coffee now if you remember as far as the coffee goes it's already pre ground so visually I'm not going to be able to tell you much and typically how I do the aroma test is I'd pretty much smell it if it smells just like a typical ground coffee then that's what I'm gonna tell you if what we're looking for is really anything outside the ordinary that I can smell to say hey this has good this type of notes or what have you so so far visually it looks like your regular ground coffee and through the smell test it smells may be a little bit lighter than a traditional ground-up coffee but overall I think it's pretty much spot-on what you typically find with ground coffee now the Deathwish coffee I will tell you first and foremost visually it's very oily and the beans are very very dark they're probably the darkest out of all these ones here they're almost black but they are very very oily the other ones actually aren't very oily at all just from visual first look at now I will tell you - it almost has like an espresso bean smell as well so keep that in mind but other than that you know it's it's pretty much your standard beans of coffee but definitely almost to me reminds me more of an espresso style being now we have the intelligentsia and this is probably the blondest or lightest roast that I see here very very dry looking not oily at all and really it smells pretty light it's probably even has kind of more of a lighter scent than even the bulletproof if that makes sense but yeah very very light light brown color non oily now we got the black rifle coffee just black this one's a little oily not as dark as the Deathwish but probably you like your typical bag of coffee looks anyways now the smell is very similar actually to the Deathwish kind of have has more of the espresso type smell and definitely a little bit darker as well now finally we will go on to the blue bottle now the blue bottle is probably a little bit darker of a roast than this guy here the intelligence yeah but probably not as dark as anything else we got here it might be actually more on par with the bulletproof coffee it's also not oily almost at all it's a little bit slightly more oily than intelligentsia but other than that it smells like your standard a cup of beans so other than that let's move on finally to the actual tasting part of our review okay so now it's time to do our review just for a full disclosure I actually literally just walked in and sat down and how we do this is I have this black silk screen right in front of me here and actually all of the coffee that's in front of me I have no idea what it is so on this side of the black silk screen is actually all the drip coffee's ready to go for me to taste and I can tell you just from looking at them they are all the shades of the same color so I have no idea what I'm drinking but how we typically do this is I'm gonna sip from left to right all the different coffees that are in front of us here and then we try them all black and then actually have some cream here then we do another round where we add a little bit of cream in each one to see if there's any other different notes or different flavors that come out and if so I tell you about it if not I just say hey it tastes the same so without further ado let's get started so this is the first one like I said we're going to start from left and work our way all the way to the right and I'm just going to taste this one so Cheers [Music] okay that's very good that's just a very good cup of coffee that we start off with I will say it's not too strong it's definitely a medium roast maybe even a little bit on the lighter side to me but overall I think it actually tastes really good so yeah I like that one a lot there's not really any any special notes or anything about this one then I can tell not very acidic pretty smooth as well so but overall just a pretty good cup of coffee try the next one [Music] okay now that one I definitely tastes more like a dark or chocolaty notes it's very good as well it's kind of it's a different type of medium roast if it's medium but very impactful as soon as you taste it it's it's pretty pretty bold but very good just a little bit different taste it kind of even has a little bit of a smoky taste I'd say okay so let's put two this next one here [Music] I'd say just a good cup of coffee that one tastes pretty standard to me this one guess in the middle here dot not too dark not too light but pretty pretty just a good medium blend coffee I can say it's probably a little bit less tasteful than the first one I tried but overall pretty good let's move on to the next one [Music] now this one here definitely tastes different I'm trying to trying to put my finger on what the taste is very has a very unique taste I almost want to taste kind of like oaky or something I mean it has say a little hint of a smoky taste to it but it definitely has a unique taste I don't know if I can put my finger on any more than that it's definitely a medium blended or medium roast coffee maybe a little bit more on the darker side but not not too much not as much this other one that I tried but definitely has a very unique taste to it try one more time actually I almost want to say it's more earthy if that makes sense but yeah definitely a unique taste now let's go to the last one here the one on this end [Music] now this one's interesting has a very unique taste to it very earthy but it's almost like a green tea taste if you will this one on the end here a medium blend not very impactful at first but definitely has a note trailing it really tastes to me almost very very green I guess is the best way to explain it very almost like it's plant-based or something but very earthy and very almost like a tea aftertaste like a green tea it's kind of what I'm tasting kind of aftertaste so now let's go through we're starting back at the beginning I'm going to add a little bit of cream in each one and then I'm going to tell you if there's anything that changes if there's any other notes that I taste here so let's start with this first one not really anything different there obviously I'm not really stirring these either so I actually liked that one a lot out of all these I think I like this one here a lot that cream kind of made it very very creamy for one but really brought out some kind of softer notes to it and really mellowed it out almost kind of sit here almost like a creamy tobacco taste if that makes sense but it's very good let's try this middle one here a little bit of cream [Music] that will not like a lot of well I like an actual darker coffee so this one here I like the note that come out of it I can definitely tell a difference when I add just a little bit of cream to it it really hones it down and makes it just tastes like a really creamy dark cup of coffee okay second to last one now that one got really interesting with cream when I added just a little bit of cream it actually brought out this this whole unique taste to it I don't know how to explain it but I like it very light almost like you're actually tasting just the cream but very more of a hint of an undertone of coffee very good though try this last one here this last one as well it's almost like like a cream and a tea almost I don't know what to say about it but it's it's just very interesting all the way around but very good as well let's say my favorite I really like this one right here I really like the middle one as well and this last one is unique I wouldn't say I dislike it but it has a unique flavor to it that I do enjoy as well so so yeah so last thing before we actually find out what these are and see if I'm surprised by anything but you know last thing I mentioned to you is all these coffees were around a price point between $12 and $20 but do you see him here so some of them like the blue bottle was a smaller bag I think that one was around 12 something and then the probably the more expensive ones were probably either the black rifle or the Deathwish coffee so other than that you kind of got a good review I think of each one of these coffees hopefully I can tell you they're all good but let's have a look see what they are oh wow okay so this is a surprise to me this one here is kind of a surprise to me because I thought like I said I thought this one here was gonna be a darker coffee and then we got this black rifle coffee here that's probably my favorite out of all these I'll tell you I really do like it a lot this middle one the bulletproof surprises me because it was such a light color as we mentioned but overall it actually tasted I thought it tasted pretty dark if I remember right this one here was a unique one and then this guy here the Intelligencia that's kind of surprising because it to me these last two almost have kind of a plant-based aftertaste I don't know if that makes any sense at all but to me that's kind of what it would have tasted like like either like a tea base or something like that maybe very green maybe it's something in the roasting process they were also some of the lighter beans if you remember when we want went through them but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this review hope you got something out of it and if you did I really

"coffee two ways my way to make delicious fresh coffee you're only going to need two things you need some fresh coffee beans and some screaming hot water okay so we have everything we need now when I make my coffee in the morning there's a bit of a ritual to it and it might even be considered a bit obnoxious so I taste these coffee beans you put them in the grinder now I'm gonna do a little extra because I'm going to show you two different ways to do it and it has nothing to do with instant coffee or a coffee maker all right I am my coffee maker today all right so we're going to grind these beans this is a lovely sound to me all right beans ground my personal favorite is the French press you can find these anywhere you can find them in discount stores in any old store I absolutely love this but one day my French press broke and I was hurt so we found another way to make coffee I'm going to show you that way too all right so to make coffee with a French press you take the top off and you scoop your ground coffee inside all right just like that super simple and it's supposed to be one cup per scoop of ground coffee so you can grab one of those they usually come in with the grinder so work with that all right next you have your like I said screaming hot water you put that in your French press however much it is that you want that's all I'm going to do today and then you put the top on and you just let that marinate for three to four minutes longer if you like it's stronger less if you like it a little weaker all right so set that aside next we're going to do what is called the drip method to making coffee this is what you do when you don't have a coffee maker on hand but you have coffee that you really want to drink all right you just need a few things we're going to start with the coffee that's in the grinder we're going to pour it into a small strainer into our cup all right next step is you take that hot water and you're going to pour that right over top nice and slow kinda the way a coffee maker would actually do it and you do this nice and slow until you get as much as you want into your cup so typically if you would like your coffee to be any stronger most people would like it stronger than just that one strain you can do that process all over again this time I'm going to do it directly into my mug so I'm going to take the grounds that are already strained I'm going to put them on top of here and I'm just going to give it one more quick strain with this coffee that is already nice and hot and it's going to go through one more time it makes an absolutely delicious cup of coffee and it's a great alternative if you don't have a coffee maker right on hand the way I like my coffee in the morning is I like a little bit of honey I don't do sugar in there so I put about a spoonful honey and a splash of half-and-half maybe a little more in there and that's good that's all you do I give it a quick stir and that's it morning coffee is done and absolutely delicious for the French press method we're going to go back over here you take this French press and you do exactly what the title says you press it down the trick is to do it nice and slow if you do it too fast those grounds at the bottom that you see going down will go up and you don't want them to do that this basically keeps it all those grounds autumn and then before and you mix as the desired coffee two ways my way try it thanks for checking with me today I will see you", "1qfjLCOXMMg": "this machine you see here is a hand-cranked coffee mill you can see it has this drum in the back with these knobs on it and this is these knobs will tear off the flesh of coffee cherry exposing the coffee beans you put the coffee cherry up here at the top and coffee beans raw coffee beans will come out here and you can then set them out in the Sun to dry for a few days this is this is the first step in making coffee is you have to do to process the raw coffee cherries and get the beans out what we're gonna do today is we're gonna make a cup of coffee but we're gonna start from scratch we're gonna start out here in a coffee orchard we'll pick some ripe coffee cherries process them dry them roast them and grind them and finally we'll have our cup of coffee but it's going to take several days so we're going to need to get started right away and it all starts out here in a coffee orchard it starts with these ripe coffee cherries the first thing we're gonna need is a pickers basket let's see if I can figure out how to put this thing on the basket we'll hang off the front off my front and this should go on my back it's a little bit of a tangle but I'll see if I can get it on you see it's cloudy and probably it's going to rain pretty soon this is a perfect climate for growing coffee coffee trees grow at elevation in the tropics and they love rain I don't know how much rain it gets on this farm here but it is probably over a hundred fifty inches a year in fact it may start raining on us now so we're going to have to hurry if we come up and look at a healthy tree you'll see that there's a large stump on the bottom and then every few years as the tree grows it gets cut off and has to Reese Prout from the stump this is done to keep the coffee cherries to keep them coming out and forming if this just was allowed to turn into a large tree you wouldn't get this many of the coffee cherries so this is done entirely for production now here's another stump and you can see how many times it's been cut in the past but it keeps growing and it keeps producing coffee cherries as a coffee picker we're gonna get paid by the weight we want to pick the red ones off and I want to leave the green ones and the yellow ones on a cheaper coffee the temptation is to pick them all real quick to zip them all off the stem all at the same time and of course that's going to affect the flavor of the coffee it's going to have more of a salary taste so pick the cherries off and put them in our bucket all right this represents about ten minutes worth of work on one coffee tree normally when we're harvesting coffee cherry like this there'll be a crew of maybe 10 or 15 people and they can harvest one or two thousand pounds of coffee per day and it will go to a large scale mill up the road he won't go we won't use something small like this but we're gonna make one cup of coffee today so we'll use this Hand Crank mill and we'll see what happens [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay I'm gonna stop for a minute and let's look in the back you can see the husks are falling out underneath the machine this little drum peels the husks off and leaves the seats it separates the two [Music] all right this is what you wind up with you can see the husks down at the bottom here the red Huff's and you can see chickens don't really like them and over in the box you can see the raw coffee beans the next step will be to take the coffee beans and to lay them out in the Sun for a few days to dry all right our coffee sat out in the Sun for four days and is now dry you can see there's a layer of skin on the outside of the coffee bean it's known as parchment so there's basically a green coffee bean with this tan colored parchment on the outside if you're ever going to store coffee this is the best way to do it but if you want a roast coffee you'll have to take the parchment skin off in which case you'll be left with something known as green coffee which we have right here green coffee is parchment coffee with the parchment removed and it's ready for roasting you can see there's a very fine skin on the outside of the green coffee known as silver skin what that comes off naturally during roasting so the next step for us will be to remove the parchment from our coffee because we don't have very much there's some very tricky little techniques we can use [Music] [Music] okay the key here to roasting coffee in a pan is to keep it stirred up keep it moving [Music] it's been about three or four minutes into this and you can see it's starting to turn brown slightly also some of the silver skin chaff is coming off you can see that in the pan as well [Music] [Music] [Music] we're at the stage now they call first crack and you can hear them popping like popcorn [Music] [Music] now I'm not an expert on roasting coffee but this does look like something that I could drink so I'm going to take this and put it into a colander now [Music] [Music] you can see all the silver skin that has come through the colony onto the stove underneath we'll let that cool down and then we'll try some [Music] [Music] and there you have it from the farmers field to the coffee cup some fine Kona coffee tastes great [Music]", "ySBAVyQA-Ys": "hello this is Bart with the green coffee bean arees home coffee experiment and today we're going to be learning how to roast coffee with an air popcorn popper in this video we'll cover preparation the roasting process cooling and storage of the beans as well as some problems we had and how you can correct them when you do it yourself the popper we chose was a presto pop light pictured at right cost us about $20 us and we chose it because it had numerous positive reviews specifically for home coffee roasting for this experiment we chose a Costa Rican bean mostly for its small size we felt like with the small roasting chamber a smaller bean would get better agitation and a more even roast to prepare the popper we filled the provided one-half cup measuring cup with beans and also placed a metal colander under the discharge chute to catch any chaff that was released from the beans during the roasting process from there we simply turned on the popper poured in the beans and began to roast you can see there's quite a bit of agitation in the roasting chamber which is good from the underlying air and should promote a nice even roast that we did decide to give it an early stir for good measure from there we took a step back and allowed the beans some time to develop as you can see we did lose a handful of beans early on in the roasting process but as the beans began to heat and expand this stopped we only probably lost 10 to 15 beans total in the whole process at a minute 15 you can see that the beans are now starting to release quite a bit of chaff into the air so we opted to take help of stir stick put the roasting cap back on to contain some of the mass hopefully get more of the shaft to fall down into the metal colander and watch through the transparent lid the roasting process progressed much more quickly than we expected as you can see at the two minute and thirty second point we already have a nice light roast going with the first crack beginning the first crack is a popping sound almost sounds like popping popcorn as the moisture in the beans is beginning to heat and expand the roasting continued to advance very quickly much more quickly than we had read in reviews for this device and at around the four-minute mark we had already reached the second crack indicating that the beans had approached a dark roast we dumped the colander to clean it out poured the beans into the colander and then stirred the beans outside in our metal colander until they had fully cooled we placed our cool beans into a zip-top bag removed all of the excess air to prevent the oxygen from turning the beans stale prematurely then place the beans on our counter top to give them time to rest this is going to be a process known as degassing for about 24 to 48 hours the beans will emit carbon dioxide as part of their normal development process and you want to typically wait at least 24 hours before grinding the freshly roasted beans though the exact amount of time that you want to wait is a hotly debated subject in the industry we did produce two batches of roasted beans the first batch you saw in the video that produced the darker more French roast as a result of the roasting process accelerating more quickly than we expected and a second batch when we had the timing down a little bit better that turned out to be a medium roast that was our target from the beginning after the beans were stored we used our trusty Dustbuster to clean up the chaff released during the roasting process and then sat down to think about the lessons we learned during the roasting our first lesson learned was to adjust the amount of coffee you're using based on the action in the roasting chamber as you'll recall we originally started with 1/2 cup of coffee and had quite a bit of motion in the chamber maybe a little bit more than we wanted in our second attempt we increased that to 3/4 of a cup still got a very nice even roast but didn't lose the beans and have the bouncing action that you saw during the first video our second recommendation involves smoke control as you recall from the video we generated quite a bit of smoke particularly from the first roast you saw where we had a darker Roach which tends to put off more smoke an improved setup would be something like this where you're located underneath a microwave or flame hood that can actively vent the smoke if you don't have an option like this we'd recommend that you do it outside or in your garage our third and final adjustment would be to the bean selection as you recall our first and second batch turned out quite a bit differently we think this is a function of the small bean while it did get the agitation we were looking for smaller beans are going to roast more quickly than larger beans and ultimately will be harder to control the roasting process use a larger being a moderate sized being it'll give you more opportunity to be able to control exactly the roast level that you get at the end of your process so how much coffee did we make well the 3/4 cup of beans we began with turned out to be 106 grams of roasted beans using the standard metric of 1 point 6 3 grams per ounce of water we would yield 65 point o 3 ounces of brewed coffee from our beans which is approximately 5 small or tall coffees from your typical gourmet roaster I don't know about you but I can easily drink two or three of these in a day so my recommendation for you would be to roast more than one batch at a time otherwise you'll be roasting every third day concluding with our overall assessment the air popcorn popper was a very inexpensive way to get a good even roast on the downside it did roast very quickly which made it difficult to control exactly the roast level that we wanted and it did have a low output per roast which means that you would need to roast fairly frequently or more than one batch / roast so we hope this helped our next planned experiment will be roasting coffee with a cast-iron skillet but let us know what you'd like to see either in the comment section below or by visiting our website at Green Coffee Beanery calm and until then thanks for watching", "DMMdOad60v0": "let's do it can you see me all right hi everyone my name is Byron and obviously I'm from sweet Maria's coffee and you're here to learn about home coffee roasting with one of these and electric popcorn popper and this which is green roasted coffee and people always ask well where do I get the coffee hopefully from us because that's what we do we sell green coffee it would be imported from all over the world and we imported these really big jute bags and we chop it down into smaller bags that you can buy a home on coffee roasting so we sell them in one pound two pounds and five pound bags and you buy them and put it in a coffee roaster in turn brown so I'm gonna show you how to do that today but people always ask well why would I want to do that why would I want to roast mine of coffee at home and the main reason is for quality and taste because you can make amazing coffee at home all by yourself without having to pay twice as much to your local grocery and you get to control the roast levels of it so if you're into light roasts all your coffee can be like roasted or dark roasted or medium roasted however you like it you can do it that way also - you get to choose what variety like so if you're in the Colombian coffee you have choices of all different kinds of Colombian coffees and also - from roasting and small batches because when you roast at home we're here which the maximum size of that you're gonna be able to do as a pound usually it's a lot less like if you're doing it with a popcorn popper we're talking a couple ounces like two point five ounces or three ounces so doing it like that on a Sunday afternoon you're probably going to be roasting a couple batches back because it just makes more sense time-wise clean up and everything so if you buy four or five different types of copies what you can do is roast those back-to-back and throughout the week you're gonna have different coffees to try and that becomes very exciting because what you can do is you can taste coffees back to back so like you know you know like when you leave your clock your favorite coffee roaster you buy a pound of really good coffee and you start drinking it and it tastes really good and then halfway through the bag it's like I don't know what this tastes like anymore because your palate kind of gets desensitized a little bit and you get to the end of the bag and it's just like okay it's time for your coffee get another bag and it's very exciting all over again so with home roasting with cup a couple of different coffees in your pantry throughout the week that process happens instantaneously so you're drinking back-to-back cups and your palate is learning so much as they go along different coffees have so many different types of flavor notes you know chocolate notes of citrus notes all kinds of different things so it's very exciting and you get to learn a lot and in my opinion things other things start to taste better as well like I enjoy beer better now because of coffee and food tastes better and some food actually tastes worse because my palates been kind of educated to taste different things and like I mentioned before home  Roasters a lot cheaper because green coffee is half the amount of roasted coffee in general so when you get it when you get it a coffee roaster you're going to need something obviously to roast your coffee with and we recommend starting off with one of these this is an electric regular hot air popcorn popper you can use a skillet or a frying pan you can use a cookie sheet put that in your oven people use the stovetop popcorn poppers handle on it and those work really good too all those methods work really good but we found for like 30 something dollars this is the best way to go because you get really consistent results it's not perfect but at the same time it's very expensive and it's a really good way to get into coffee roasting and to kind of prepare yourself for the next level of coffee roaster and so when you upgrade from one of these some people don't some home coffee roasters just stick with but if you want to upgrade from this other coffee roasters made specifically for roasting will cost you know between like a hundred and seventy up to a couple thousand dollars so it depends what you want and the main reason why you would want to upgrade is aside from that seismic in rows larger batches it's more for consistency because obviously these aren't made for coffee roasting the wiring inside isn't as robust as a more expensive appliance and you know if this is going to be exposed to ambient air temperature which really affects your coffee roasting so a machine made specifically for coffee roasting will give you more consistent results meaning that you can do back-to-back batches and kind of get the same roast level every single time what this is going to be a little bit different every time it's gonna be good every time if you you know if you kind of know what you're doing but it's gonna be a little bit different so that's another good reason to upgrade but let me get back to this let's say you're you ran out to Target or something we sell these on our website also but if you ran to the store and got one of these popcorn poppers you want to look inside and kind of see see how the bottom is kind of flat right there that's the kind you want to get because what happens is on some of these popcorn poppers there's a mesh bottom and what happens is the chaff I'll explain a chapters later on the chapel actually gets sucked up underneath and gets stuck underneath the mesh and chaff is very flammable once it turns into the little puck that stuff underneath the mesh and that in combination with all the heat the popper is producing is going to be a bad situation eventually and you don't want to burn down the kitchen so with these they have these really big vents in the side of the cylinder and those events actually you're going to get some shaft sucking up through the bottom of the popper and those men to actually allow a lot of the chaff to kind of work its way out of a popper so you don't have a lot of buildup in there we put a lot of research into determining which was the best model for a coffee roasting and we found oh is this one made by nostalgia and there's a company called West Bantam that makes a older model I think is from like the mid seventies called the popery tube and that's like the holy grail for  crows because if you go into eBay people are selling them for a lot more than what they actually paid for them back in 7 ISM because you can just get a lot more power out of them and they heat up a lot better but for now this in our opinion is the best way to go so let's get started let's say you ran out and got one of these and you're like wait a minute Byron didn't tell me how much coffee to put in when I start off and that's because every situation is a little bit different meaning that ambient air temperature will make your coffee rose faster if it's warm if it's cool than it's going to take a lot longer to roast if you're plugging your popper into an old 1940s apartment in New York or something it's gonna roast a lot differently than if you plug it into a brand new outlet in a newly made commercial building so you need to let the fans be dictate how much coffee you're gonna put in so what I'm gonna do it is I'm gonna turn the popper on and then I'm gonna start pouring green coffee in once the green coffee stops turning from the power of the fan that's my batch size so what I would do is I would which this stops turning and then pour that out again and that amount of coffee either by weight or by volume and let's say it's 2.5 ounces 2.5 ounces is gonna be your go-to backed size from then on you know plus or minus a couple grams here there but that's where you want to start every single time so let's get started turn this on and I'm gonna try to talk loud so hopefully y'all can hear me once I get started here I'm going to kind of talk a little bit less just so um kind of watch this going on it's gonna trying to hear me over the motor so I'm gonna start pouring that in you see how fast all that spinning in there you want to keep pouring until the coffee actually stops burning and you can kind of see how there's still motion in there there's still motion in there so we want to keep pouring until it stops moving so right around there now let's say that a I pour that out as 2.5 ounces that's my batch size in the very beginning as you can see the coffee isn't moving very fast at all because green coffee is very hard and dense and heavy so we have to kind of agitate it for the first few minutes of roast because a lot of the beans in the bottom are getting heated up a lot faster than the beans in the top obviously because they're touching hot metal more a lot areas of building underneath them so we need to give them a little bit of shape in the beginning maybe like every 10 seconds give it a shake and that'll kind of get the beans in the bottom up to the top but once the beans start to roast which they'll actually get bigger and lighter which means they're going to increase in volume and decrease in weight and that's a good thing because the fan is eventually going to start being able to turn the popular zone if you go ahead and take a look in your baby in the oven the coffee's changing colors a little bit and the fan is having an easier time moving the coffee around and you can just kind of see here if you get a look at the table this is that chap I was telling you about and chap makes a mess of your kitchen and I'll smell you how to wrangle that after the roast is done but for now we're going to kind of watch how the colors are changing and it's no longer that great green color it was before and now it's kind of changing into a you know like a yellow tan color and the next thing we're gonna actually listen for is called first crack and when that happens we'll going on Coffee Roasting happens actually pretty quickly we're talking like maybe six or seven minutes for a batch sometimes what you want to do is you want to get the chaff away from your work or you want to get the chaff away from your work area like that because you don't want excess chat getting stuck underneath the copper just because you don't want to risk it building up inside of there and starting a fire and sword but in general like I mentioned before these poppers are really good at expelling that chaff to who's Vince and we're starting to get into the beginning of first backhand first crack is kind of an audio cue the hockey gives you to tell you it's getting into a light roast level and essentially every single coffee bean is going to snap and crack and it's not hard to hear will about 30 seconds actually right now is starting silent you listen of course when I stop talking and backing stops - here we go start alright that is the sound of first crack the reason why it's club first pack is because there is a stage called second crack and we rarely ever recommend roasting to or beyond second pack because at that point coffee becomes very dark you start losing some of the flavor nuances of it so basically what we're gonna do with this roast here is we're gonna wait till first back ends and then we're gonna take the coffee out and cool it I'll explain the importance of cooling when I do that the way you know first crack is over is this because we will notice a little more silence inside of your rose there's a certain first time you try a roast temperature honey rose time someone asked a question but most time is a bit of time that you're trying to achieve in general is popper is kind of a big face face of living room with time so we're talking between like five minutes and if it goes beyond like nine minutes and it's taking a little to talk too long you might consider that your popper is introduced kind of shoot so yeah I'm kind of in between there maybe like you know for four or five to like nine or ten minutes that's a good sweet spot so first crack has ended and I'm gonna take this out and cool it what I'm going to do is actually pour the coffee out before a time machine off like this right out the back now the cool thing about hot air popcorn poppers is that they get kind of warm around here when you're roasting with them but coffee roasters got lucky that whoever designed how much of popcorn poppers designed them with this little little fits a handle for coffee roasting so this part of the cocky roaster stays cool all the time so you can touch this part and you had to dump the coffee out cool it you want to get the reason why cooling is important is because you spent so much time and energy getting your coffee to a specific roast level like this year would be kind of a light medium roast level you spent so much time and energy and attention to getting it to that roast level you wouldn't want it his turn to pop her off and let the cop kind of coffee kind of sit in a really hot environment because what happened is once it comes into contact with the metal that's already very hot it'll start burning on the edges and you see a lot of smoke coming out of there because until that point the coffee was actually floating on a bed of hot air so that's what's keeping the coffee from burning it's always circulating the Lord's it stops and starts sitting on hot metal it will start burning it's kind of like spaghetti in a sense where if you're if we're boiling spaghetti at home and you're tasting it as you're boiling it and finally it's perfectly al dente you wouldn't just turn the fire off and walk away and say yep that spaghetti is done because it's gonna continue to cook in the pot and it'll turn into mush because it's if it's gonna be in contact with the hot water until the time you take it out so you know you want to pour it out the cold water over it and stop it from cooking same thing with coffee you want to take it out of here and stop it erosion and you want to do that you want to pour it into something that's gonna kind of take heat away from the coffee so anything like metal bowl or even like a cheese plate looks good this is just kind of a cooling tray so we had an office from another coffee roaster but metal the polymers were really really good home coffee roasters love them because you can get two of them and pour the copper from one end to the other and use any air temperature to remove a lot of the heat from the coffee beans so once this gets that room temperature you can put it away and store it the interesting thing about freshly roasted coffee is that it does not smell like really good coffee it actually smells like nothing right right out of the roaster the reason for that is is be it hasn't started to D casts co2 yet so once you store this and put it away for like the next 12 hours or so after that that time period it will start to smell really really good but for now I wish we had smell-o-vision that you could smell this and smell how it just kind of smell like smoke a little bit but tomorrow morning this will smell and taste amazing let's see what else was I gonna save here oh yeah umm when you store your coffee obviously you want to wait until it cools down to a point where it's kind of room temperature and you can use one of these you can get like a fancy storage container that has a one-way valve at the bottom and the one-way valves are the things you see on fancy coffee bags when you go to the supermarket or you go to your favorite coffee roastery they have that little little one-way valve on there and same thing there and what that does is it allows carbon dioxide or actually any any kind of gas or there's oxygen or co2 that's inside of the bag or container to escape but it doesn't allow air to go in that's why when you go to the market and you squeeze these you get to smell all the good coffee moments that are coming out but it's actually not that an oxygen in because oxygen and sunlight and excess moisture are kind of the enemies of roasted coffee because once you start exposing your roasted coffee to those three elements the flavor will degrade a lot faster than if you were just a stork properly if you're roasting small batches paper bags work just fine tuned especially if you're gifting to friends because that is the worst part about a home interesting is that your friends and family cold start to think that it's really quick and easy to knock out a couple pounds on a Thursday night so you can bring it back to work and hand it out to everyone on Friday morning but you're gonna end up having by Figueroa Street so well yeah if you're gifting coffee with friends of paper bags are really good they don't do an amazing job of keeping the co2 in and oxygen out but smaller batches it doesn't matter all that much especially if you're drinking drinking coffee on a pretty fast rate because if you're going to go through this in a couple days like a compact that's big in a couple of days preserving it past that point doesn't matter because you already drank it all that's why a lot of people use just like Ziploc bags or Tupperware and keep them in their pantry and those work just fine I mentioned the degassing of co2 and if you're gonna put fresh fresh roasted coffee in a ball jar and fill it up to the top and cap it the next morning you would see a lid kind of pop up a little bit and that's all that co2 coming out so the first night if you're storing in a ball jar you might want to leave the lid open just a little bit to let the gas come out and after that all the main degassing is done with so you can kind of cap it tight after that let's see oh yeah people always ask about storing a coffee in the freezer or refrigerator if it really small batches putting it in your pantry is the best way to go especially if you if you're in a good like mellow environment like we are here to California where temperatures don't really get too far above 80 and they don't drop too far below 50 it's pretty stable so you can store your coffee like that in your pants good to go but if for some reason you did roast a lot of coffee and you want to preserve it freezers are better than refrigerators because you don't have all that moisture in your freezer that you do in your fridge the bad thing about freezers is that if you put like let's say you did three pounds of coffee put it all in one big ziploc bag you put it in your freezer and you're taking it out every day to take a couple scoops out slipping it back up and putting it back to the freezer you're allowed you're allowing moisture to condensate on your coffee and it's gonna keep freezing and you're gonna have a freezer burn on your coffee it's gonna really kind of degrade the taste of it so what you want to do if you're storing it in your freezer to store it in small batches like maybe get a bunch of small Ziploc bags and put those all in there that way you can take one up at a time and not have to damage your coffee as it's coming in and out yeah so I hope you're still wondering about how to keep your kitchen free of all this chap here because it makes a total mess best thing to do is to roast outside in your backyard the weather's nice it's really fun and easy to do but most of us who you know we have jobs we need to be at work during the day and we're roasting at night or during the wintertime or whatever it's raining and whatnot you want to keep it checked out of your kitchen so you're a popcorn popper we'll come with one of these plastic hoods and the butter tray just put this on your popper like that and you can put this on the edge of your sink and at the bottom of your steak is a little bit wet all the chapel's stick to the wet surface and your kitchen remain relatively chat free or you can give like a pot put a little bit of water in the bottom get a paper towel and wet it and drape it up the back of the pot and let the Papa blow hot air and chaff into that and all the chaps stick to the water at the bottom and then you're good to go one thing we didn't see because of the air flow here is all the smoke that home coffee roasting produces if we did about three or four but if you do about three or four batches in a row in your kitchen and you turn around you're gonna see your kitchen is full of smoke so if you turn on the fan above your your oven above your stove that'll take care of us with the smoke a lot of people roast with the fan crossing over the top of it blowing out a window and that works good too more expensive coffee roasting machines have elements on them and then burn away some of the smoke and that helps a lot as well but basically as long you have a good airflow or a fan of some sort you're pretty much good to go for roasting indoors but like I said if you can roast in your backyard your plants are gonna love the chaff let's see whales oh yeah um in a perfect environment your copy will roast in a couple minutes but if you're just starting with starting off and you plug your coffee roaster in your popper into the wall and it's taking too long like let's say it's taking 12 minutes and you put in the right size - it's just not getting hot enough you know this hood will raise the temperature there by a couple degrees so that could make or break your so always roast with this on if you feel like your coffee isn't getting up to temperature also - one way that hack that is to add more coffee in because in the beginning as you saw that the coffee was a good range which means it's insulating a lot of heat in there so the more coffee you add the more heat actually builds up in there meaning that you'll actually get to a higher temperature in your entire BMS so you can actually roast you can get the first crack a lot faster if for some reason you're roasting and you're getting the first crack really fast like in two minutes and and first crack a second crack would start to blend and do into each other and it's just a big smoky mess you can slow down your roast by using an extension cord or a power strip I've had patricians argue this with me but it works like a long extension cord a power strip will kind of cut out a lot of some of the Tris people into your popper and that'll slow things down a little bit also - roasting outside in colder weather will really really bring down the temperature what's going on in here one thing we don't recommend but a lot of people do is rewiring the inside of your popper so some people will actually unscrew the bottom and there's a little thermal thermal thermocouple there was that thing that sticks onto the side of the the roasting cylinder and some people will pop that off and we wire it so the safety feature here doesn't turn on because a lot of times the reason why some people can't get to first crack is because there is a thermostat that you're shutting the heat off and that's just a safety measure that the manufacturer adds in here and ninety percent of the time it's not an issue but if it is some people have been known to take that off and remove it it's not the safest thing in the world but if you go online onto home coffee roasting forums you can see how to do it we don't recommend it the home a lot of folks actually will rewire this and connect a dimmer switch and a two different switches one actually controls the heat one controls the fan speeds so if you're savvy with with products that can be a lot of fun - one thing we actually do recommend is drilling a little hole in the top of the butter tray and dropping a the bottom of a candy thermometer down into there that way you can read the temperature of your bean mass and that can be very helpful because once you start roasting with these and you learn where first crack stars when second crack starts and let's say you want to cool your coffee 30 seconds before second crack it's like how do you know when that is and you can always use temperature to determine where you where you are in your roast it's also engaged to tell if your coffee is roasting like slower than normal or a lot faster you just get a lot more information to learn about the progress of your coffee but at the same time if all you want is good coffee just use your senses and kind of go for it and one thing I did want to mention is that by no means do I do to say that all types of coffee roasting is this basic and simple well and very detailed too so if you if you're that type of a person computers it's perfect for you as well so yeah like I mentioned before this coffee needs about twelve hours to rest and once it rests it'll taste amazing we can actually grind and brew this right now and it would taste really really good but if you have the patience wait until tomorrow morning is the best way to go and it'll smell really good too you can store roasted coffee for a while not as long as you may think we're talking like maybe week and a half until you'll start to notice the flavor kind of drop off a little bit but if it's good quality coffee and you did a good job roasting it even if you store it away for a month it'll still taste good but it won't be as amazing as it was the day after you roasted it green coffee actually has a much longer shelf life and that's mainly because of how hard and dense it is it's not affected by humidity as much or by sunlight as much but still you want to keep it away from those things when you do buy green coffee so don't be afraid to buy a couple pounds at a time it'll store for months on end some people say a year and a half some people say a year but in general you don't have to be in a big rush to really pop this in your roaster and given with it you won't notice a huge difference if you store it away for a few months but at the same time to keep it in your mind that you have green coffee your passion that needs to get roasted once you grind your roasted coffee you want to brew that right away because what you're doing is actually uh chopping the copy betta mm little tiny pieces and that has so much so much surface area for the gas to the gas from meaning that all the good stuff was actually going to be dissipated into the air all those messy Roma's and the oil will come outside and get rancid a lot quicker so we're talking within a couple minutes it's good to brew your coffee and that's why when you go to your favorite cafe they always grind their coffee before they Ruth it and you can imagine how old coffee is it becomes in those vacuum-sealed tins because what I mentioned about degassing earlier companies put it gas out imagine how old coffee would have to be for them to be able to vacuum seal it when you open a container and oxygen sucks back into the container so always try and grind your coffee before you brew it before I forget for those of you watching got a coupon code here 15%

Express and I just add mother grinder recently and so today's video I'm going to review I don't want to say we do you but I'm going to try out Laberge a super crema so so far I try their Rosa and grand crema and today's supercrime us see what this tastes like so before I'm going to make coffee I'm going to clean out the grinder I'm Bruce Express so I like to clean before whenever I switch beans anyway just make sure there's no [Music] so pretty much it I got my and now I can make some coffee let's talk about the packaging here I just received the last night and man this nicely a vacuum pack and there's pre airtight here and then the funny thing is they don't give you a roasted date they only give you our when they expire so this one expires let's see here C expires can find it I know it's expire sometimes anyway it's not that important so you can sell from Amazon I think I pay $14 for it for 2.2 pounds for the money this is great value okay so let's make some coffee yeah let's do this no test Smurfs pretty good and their beans okay is as you can see from here it's like more like medium roast Isis the oil is still releasing and I mean I like medium light medium roast personally but again I mean $14 for 2.2 pounds can be the price can be the price alright so so this morning I'm going to make some americano so I'm going to use a pressurized I'm sorry I'm going to use our single our baskets non-pressurized I'll be using 18 gram of grind beans and see what happens so I'm going to put 18 gram so by the way I'm the ground setting is that number six if you guys liked now so I hope that's the right setting if not we have to make some adjustment so I got my handy-dandy homemade phone right here and they you got some crumbs there so I just made this homemade The Dig climbing tool it does work okay I mean if you guys don't like to deal with this just use the double wall also known as the pressurized basket so you don't have to worry about this this is a 18 gram supercrime on the ground sitting on number six and that we are going to do a double shot [Music] okay so it's too fine it's choking right now [Music] yeah it is yeah I think it is too fine I think it is too fine so what I'm going to do is I'm going to change to a coarser setting so now I mean six I'm going to change to number seven and see what happens so now we're gonna now we just adjust to six to seven and grunge setting let's try one more time [Music] [Music] hopefully when I get better result this time [Music] so far so good the Kramer looks really good okay 47 hours so about 47 hours so about one point I'm sorry 47 grams is about 1.6 sound's so it's not too bad so I have a hot water ready and yeah I'm gonna narrow the Smurfs good and the color easy looks really good as well and how about taste smooth and clean is bright I'm it's a good coffee I have to say I mean the Lavazza makes pretty good coffee overall the rosa to grain crema this is super crema and this is really fine coffee I mean this is not as good as my home roasted coffee but still for the price this is wonderful I mean I can't wait to try making a latte with this anyway so this overall this is fantastic coffee I mean I like it I like it a lot it's very clean and it's really good for the you know it's just really good by the way thank you so much for spring my China I just saw past 200 subscriber a few days ago I mean it's been it's been fun journey over last six month no making coffees and tinker with it it's been fun I mean I really been enjoying the making videos anyway hopefully you guys like the video and join my channel and see you guys next time", "HLchFfgSr8U": "hey folks everything new under the sun this is going to be an unboxing review of the nesco coffee roaster and i'm going to tell you why this is pretty much the best and easiest way to roast coffee beans and i've had a baymore one pound roaster before myself and i've roasted on cast iron all sorts of things so here's the unbox and i'll give you my uh review of it once we get it tested so it looks very much like the sr i think 300 sr 500 but it's cheaper i got this from wayfair for about 123 dollars plus tax it's by far the cheapest automated roaster uh that i've ever seen most other roasters start at 300 400 500 even more than that and and they're a lot more manual as well this is super nice it's got three buttons dark medium and cool down you can press cool down at any time if if it's at the crack that you want or at the roast level that you want but otherwise it's pretty basic to use you put your beans in you measure them out and you press the medium or the dark and like i say if you want to cut it off early you can do that the manual briefly is very simple um it is tra it seems like it's translated translate it comes with the parts list comes with the how-to what to do and then it comes with a roasting uh tips page which tells you about first and second crack and all that kind of stuff which most of you should know already here's some close-ups of the buttons very very simple to use it's a sturdy little unit so you have to measure exactly four ounces if you do more than this you get a lot of beans flowing up over into the top chaff collector and you'll see that in the upcoming video slash pictures i went to using a more a finer measurement tool in the next roast here i was just using a really cheap one and i think i had a few more beans and four ounces so get your measurement right that's the key part and then this will do a medium and a dark roast exactly as needed now the manual says each mode medium and dark are both 20 minute timer modes i'm not sure what the difference is maybe the the dark mode increases the wattage or the heat i assume because the length of time between doing a medium and a dark seems to be no different to me so that was interesting one of the things that you get on the sro i believe it is 500 the bigger brother of these nesco units is that you get a fan control as just one one option is along with the temperature control i believe a high low temperature control but the thing about it is you can see here the beans are hardly moving they are moving but very hardly it would be nice if there was a bit more airflow but as they start to roast they actually do pick up and start bouncing and because the collar is designed for a specific amount of beans if you have any more beans and four ounces exactly all the beans will or a lot of beans will skip over into the chaff collector so that's one thing so here's a look at at it when when all the light when all the buttons are blue that means it's ready to go they're flashing blue if you click one it turns red it'll do its 20 minute timer and go into cooldown mode automatically for either the medium or the dark so now we're just going to talk through what i found with this so i have had a baymore 1600 before it did a pound of coffee which is is a fair amount this one like i say it only does about four ounces of green beans it's all you can put into it it's enough for probably a day and a half two days of coffee depending on how much and how often you drink but we use a fresh press and that should be good enough for that it's nice to have a little handle on the top because this whole unit gets very very hot the metal gets hot everything gets hot and it does put on smoke so if you're doing it inside you will need to um open some windows i like that it has that here's a look at the inside about 11 minutes in there so you can see them getting brown they're moving a bit faster as they get lighter they'll move a little bit faster but not a ton of airflow would be nice to have an airflow dial like you have on the bigger brother of this unit but uh it's very nice it's kind of nice to have a big handle on the side of this it makes like a big coffee mug um so that that's a neat uh feature of it obviously it helps you uh dump out the beans as well uh once once they're done uh overall um i think uh the unit for the price is a no-brainer like i say you cannot find another roaster for under say 300 and even the bigger brothers of this which are three four five hundred dollars they don't do a lot more if any more than this roasts in a batch what's interesting about this however is i've roasted with cast iron i've roasted with popcorn makers i find that the popcorn maker that we have actually roasts it in about six or seven minutes versus a 20 minute length of time for this particular unit on either medium or dark so it takes quite a long time so you're not going to be roasting one pound bags for your friends real easy because it takes 20 pound 20 minutes for a quarter pound so you'd be into an hour and a half before you got a pound worth of coffee in this now i got first crack at about the 15 minute mark my timing wasn't tough perfect but i could certainly hear it doing first crack now the first time i did it i put too many beans in and it never really got to second crack which is where i like it to be kind of just starting second crack and so the beans were a lot uh a lot lighter more light a lighter roast than i preferred but as soon as i put in the correct four ounce amount uh then it worked very well the side like i said i got it from wayfair it shipped in about two weeks and again i've never seen an automatic roaster for cheaper this is the by far um the best cheapest best for your money roaster and it's really a set and forget now you're not supposed to do it the the instructions say don't uh stop it or don't uh go away from when it's roasting so the the cool down roast our cooldown starts automatically there as i was saying you can see the green the medium button is blue right now not green it's blue and that means it's cooling down so it cools down for two minutes now here while it's going it's not that loud but you can see the buttons shaking they're just plastic buttons and they're just kind of rattling at the base so i'm i mean you get what you pay for at about 123 canadian um you know the buttons are going to rattle but overall it did look good and i did find when i put the right measurement in uh it was mostly chaff in the chaff collector here's a look at again the first roast where i i put too many beans in and there was just a ton of beans up in the chat collector again as soon as i went down to a proper measurement and actually weighed it accurately um that problem went away so accurate measurements and uh and then with this thing goes uh very well and then of course you gotta uh clean up or chop afterwards now the box isn't very large there's not a lot of things that come with it except you do get a little coffee scoop so four scoops equals four ounces exactly i found with my green beans i'm roasting honduras marcola beans here i'm putting it into a colander uh so that i can kind of shake it out you can see the inside there it's just effectively just a um a glorified uh popcorn machine for sure except that it has a nice little timer on it so i'm dumping all the beans back in there i'm going to go outside and and blow the chaff at it but it worked it works just like it's big brother i think the sr 300 and 500 and here's a look at the beans outside and so you can kind of see how much chaff is left in them what the crack uh looks like etc here's a darker roast i did a look at it you can see that obviously looks darker than the prior roast i did this inside so i had to shut the fire alarm off a few times if you can do it outside definitely do it outside you can see the beans there they look a little bit more uh roasted which is obviously what we wanted and much better than the first batch because i had too many beans in there anyways so now we're now it's looking real nice and here i give an example of uh the medium roast versus uh what they call the dark roast and of course the medium roast is on the right side the dark roast is on the left side and so it's pretty obvious the difference there and a nice difference in terms of uh the the quality of the roast it's not incredibly even i wish there was an air control so you can uh get a better better turning of the beans while it's roasting but it doesn't do a bad job and once it does get uh once they do start cooking the beans do start flying a bit more so you can see again the difference in the lighter side on the right the medium roast and the darker ones the next thing i did was i took it outside and started roasting outside and it a lot better in terms of smoke etc and not sending out the fire alarms so i'm dumping the cool beans into some coffee bags i had i had a company called fussy beans uh fair trade uh organic coffee and so i used to sell bags of beans using my baymore 1600 so that was fun for a while so now i just do it for personal use and uh for friends and family so here it is outside um i don't know if you saw it but when i was roasting the first batch there was uh smoke coming off not a ton uh but there is some smoke come out but not as bad you know because it is a bit of a bit of a lighter roast now what you could do is if you wanted a darker roast yeah you could go in under the four ounce mark and then then those beans would obviously roast a little a little bit darker even more so if you kind of play with their numbers and how much they want you to roast you can get darker roasts you're just going to be roasting fewer beans at a time so final thoughts on this it's a great little automatic roaster it's a push button anybody can use this and it's purpose-built it works much nicer and much easier than a popcorn maker although it takes about double the time of the popcorn maker but i guess maybe the slower roast is better in some cases it is definitely by far for the price the best roaster you can get out there and because it does have a cool down button you can always stop the roast anytime you want so you can you can get you know if you want to stop it a little sooner than that 20 minute mark you certainly go ahead and do that so if you want to control the medium roast put it on hit the dark button and you can monitor it and at the right time you can click that uh cool down button and that's what a popcorn machine for example doesn't have that cool down option where it starts it turns off the heating elements and just blows cool air through it which is what you need to stop um the roasting of the beans so all in all i give this two thumbs up five stars again i got it off way for it wayfair rather wayfared at ca shipped out of the united states although it is of course it is chinese made but yeah it it has pre-programmed options fully automatic you can you know if this is outside you can effectively walk away for it for 20 minutes and it'll uh roast your beans and what more to say yeah it's a great little unit and it just works so thanks for watching i hope you enjoyed it let me know if you have any questions about this unit and we'll see you guys in the next video foreign you", "qR4rfcE7KdU": "hi welcome to home rose Coffee calms simple roasting directions for beginners using a whirly pop popcorn popper we start by gathering a few items obviously the whirly pop popcorn popper we find this is the best brand of popcorn popper of this type to use for roasting coffee we like to have our home roast coffee roast leg to record our results we put down the date the time temperature coffee roaster used coffee used we also have our simple coffee roasting directions our roast level sheet that shows us the different roast levels of coffee so we can take a look at what's in our popper compare it to our sheet and select where we want to pull a coffee from the heat today we'll be using our home roast coffee colombia supremo it's a screen 17-18 bean it's our home roast coffee plus brand it's a premium select lot we also like to have handy a hot pan wooden spoon for stirring measuring cup small kitchen scale small fan a roasting pan a large funnel and a stand up pouch with a ziplock and a one-way valve for storing the coffee we'll start by measuring out about 8 ounces of coffee you can use a little more if you like but we find that a little over 8 ounces of lead early popcorn popper here we've got about eight and a quarter ounces will work fine and we'll add that to our popper then we'll simply take our early pop popper to the stove for the next section a couple of additional items that we like to have handy when we're roasting with a whirly pop if you have one available a infrared thermometer these are used by mechanics right now it's about 80 degrees here in the green coffee getting ready to roast an hourly pop and a timing device so we're going to start the oven stove set it on about medium heat maybe a little Bo medium let's start our timer here then we simply keep track and check our temperature start stirring we'll check the temperature about every minute or so maybe a little more frequently events we get well into the roast you can stir a little faster or slower you can also stop if you're by your side do this by myself plate often and it's perfectly fine to stop for a moment to take the temperature right down results or shake it if you have to every once in a while a bean will get stuck on there the stirring mechanism the first couple of minutes are similar to watching paint dry there won't be much change in our beans where it about a minute take a look here you're still grain temperature on use them all 197 to be so far doing well not much smell we're waiting essentially for the coffee to make its own noise it will make what's known as first crack and second crack if you wait the second crack you can take it off during or after first crack first crack is going to sound a bit like toothpicks being snap it'll last from a minute to about two minutes you know really pop there should be a slight delay before we get into the second crack sometimes the one will follow right into the other but second crack will sound a little bit more like crispy rice cereal when it pops we're about just about two and a half minutes here on our roast we're still pretty green some of the mains are starting to get brown we're looking at 275 degrees here so far some folks will drill a small hole in the lid and add a candy thermometer a metal candy thermometer to the really pop just be aware that that gives you a temperature that's always a little bit behind the bead temperature if you record it consistently it comes in real handy for your ghost but be aware that it's is not going to be real accurate when it comes to the actual temperature of your beans so it's going to be a little below the temperature that your beans are actually at we're starting to see just a little bit of smoke coming out of the whirly pop right here you'll see it coming out of the vents and it smells rather grainy like hot brass hot drain some of the beans are starting to turn a light brown the lid is hot we're at 334 degrees so far the even though beans that are still green are becoming light tan as the beans reach about three hundred and eighty degrees ish they'll start first crack normally when we host indoors we use the vent fan on the stove and open a window here we'd like you to hear the crack so we're going to hold off on those today first crack is beginning at four minutes and twenty seconds smokes increasing let's take a look here 371 degrees like candlelight Brown smokes increasing we're still in first crack five minutes we'll check that temperature again that read four hundred and eight degrees and I think we're scoring a second crack increase smoke it's a pretty roasty smell well in the second crack we've got the crackling sounds we're looking at about four hundred and seventeen degrees plenty of smoke and this is about the point where we like ours we're probably getting into a nice city roast here so we're going to stop now and go outside and put our beans into our roaster and cool them down so we're going to remove from the fire here at the 635 we're going to pour our beans into the roasting pan you can see that the chaff has been separating from the beans okay this is why we do this outside or near a sink so you can collect the chaff we've got some beans that are pretty black and shiny some that are still pretty Brown looking like probably about a full city roast here maybe a little beyond on some a little next we may have wanted to stir a little faster on this roast but we really wanted to keep the noise down so that you could hear the cracks it doesn't take long maybe a minute for the the beans to cool down to room temperature or outdoor temperature at this point simply pour our beans into our zip pouch chaff is the fine skin of the green coffee bean that separates when we roast so you lose a little weight that way you lose a little weight and moisture well we've ended up here is a real nice roast of our Colombia supremo HRC Plus probably got about what do we have here wait six and three-quarter ounces we started with about eight so you lose a little in moisture and chaff but there's your roast you want to let that rest for four to eight hours at least use it within about two weeks and you've got very very fresh Colombian coffee easy to roast this

we've got a lot here at the minute we've just had a new order in each of these sacks is about 65 to 70 kilos so alex and i well mainly alex but i've helped a bit i have just moved all of these um sacks over from where they come in and the roller door over to here so it's a good workout but have a look in here these are green beans so this is again the beans are different like the the color of the unroasted bean is diff depending on where they've come from and how they've been processed but um this is a kind of it gives you a good indication of the of the color they are before they're roasted and they're the way they feel everything is quite different to after they've been roasted there they kind of like have a a nice smooth feeling um and they kind of have the i guess like almost like a smooth pebble kind of thing like they've got quite a density to them and then once they've been roasted the obviously the color and the density changes", "aYy47C0Xw0I": "So I wanted to show you very quickly what happens to coffee as it's roasted. This is green coffee Coffee is the seed from the fruit of a flowering tree and it's dried...it's processed and dried...out of the skin and it becomes this very dense, green bean. It's not really a bean, it's a seed... but we'll call it a bean, because everyone does. As you start to roast the coffee, it goes from that, to a slightly pale, white color. What's on the outside here, is Chaff, it's also called silver-skin. and it comes off during roasting and the next stage... So it's turning pale at about 2 to 3 minutes into roasting. Some roasters a little bit faster, in an air roaster, now we have kind of a tan or orange stage, where it's definitely losing some heat, losing some moisture content, The coffee is becoming a little bit lighter, moves around a little quicker in the roaster... And this is the tan stage, this is very slow, this early development, From the green to the tan...you know, in some roasters that could be ten minutes of development until you hit first crack, so it's still quite a light colored coffee, not what you'd want to drink It would taste very grain-y if you drank it. Now here we're approaching first crack, which, like i said, could happen anywhere from, in a real fast roaster, several minutes... in a drum roaster, maybe as long as 10 or 12 minutes. And you see this very highly varied surface texture, and this pale silver-skin, chaff in there... Now here's where we've actually gotten into coffee that could be considered...you could drink this coffee. This coffee has gone through first crack, so there's been this audible, popping sound In the roaster, and that's kind of your clue. Once that finishes...the popping... That coffee has gone through first crack, we call this City Roast. It's a lighter roast, and looking under the strong light you see all that dark surface texture in it, but this could be a very good roast for coffee that you want to be a bright, lively cup. This is a little bit more roast, but you notice that this bean has puffed up a little bit more it's opened up that crease, it's not quite so flat on this side. The silver-skin is a little darker. So that's a City Plus Roast. We'd call this one a City plus, too. Now these last stages since I started showing you the brown coffee, these are pulled at 30 second increments or less, so in the first part of the roast, from green to yellow, things happen really slow. and then it's quite a fast process so you really have to be there watching the coffee. This is an excellent roast right here, a great roast level to not get that charred taste, but have a really sweet and refined cup. That's a City Plus Roast. Now here's a Full City roast. We're right on the verge of getting into Second Crack here, which tells you the coffee's getting into dark roast territory. Notice it's more puffed up, and the chaff layer in here has changed color. It's a dark color now. Now if you like Starbucks, this is what you like. This coffee has gone fully through the Second Crack, And in fact, it's so explosive, this crack, that it's releasing carbon dioxide that's formed during roasting, within the bean, It's actually blown off a piece of the bean right here. And then finally, we're at a VERY dark roast, now, This is very fresh coffee, I roasted this, actually less than an hour ago, But you can already see some oils starting to develop on the surface there. All of those last three roasts I've shown you, if you left them for 3 days they'd have oils on them. And, in fact, you know, if you leave them for months, they'd be glazed in oil and that's what old coffee looks like when it's Dark Roasted. So that is, briefly, the changes in color during Coffee Roasting.", "5BCDIas33y0": "Hey guys Andrew here with stay roasted\ntalking about grinding coffee specifically what coarseness of grind is\nappropriate for which brew method so we have some examples here starting at my right here we have coarsely ground coffee which is excellent for a French\nPress so in general the longer the water is going to stay in contact with the\ncoffee the coarser the grind. So in this case we're going to have water and\ncoffee together without much movement for about four minutes in the French\nPress. The second grind we have here is a medium coarse grind excellent starting\npoint for Chemex you really have sort of a hybrid of both the grounds sitting in\nwater as well as flowing as well as the water flowing through the grinds on a\nChemex through that Chemex filter. So, medium coarse grind for a Chemex - \nexcellent place to start. The third one here we have a medium fine grind.\nExcellent starting place for a pour over method. In this case our v60 where we're\npouring water directly across the coffee beans it's not sitting there for\nvery long so we really want a finer grind than say a French Press because\nthere's really not as much time in contact with the water as you would have\nin some of these other methods. Then finally we have the espresso grind or\nfine grind. With espresso water is under pressure going through the coffee  between 25 and 30 seconds. So very fine grind on espresso and there you\nhave it. We have four different starting points for grinding your coffee and\npairing the grind with the brew method. So tell us what you think. How do you\ngrind your coffee? We'd love to know  - hit us up in the comments let us know how\neverything is going and we'd also love to answer any questions you have about\ngrinding your coffee until then thanks for watching!", "BlbAFXWs4so": "[Music] all right okay welcome back again right uh this is the second part right the first part of the video is actually uh the roasting part and now it's actually the uh sampling of sampling of the roaster bins so as you can see this is actually a very simple v60 setup right and of course i'm going to use uh the main right hand grinder from san antonio industry right so let me check whether i've got the setting correct right i'm looking for about 50 clicks one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten one two three four five six seven eight nine ten that's 40 okay that's 50 clicks okay let me drop about i will just be using about 10 grams right exactly 10 grams now my water is about to boil too so now i'll be starting to dry right once the meal right grinder has been seasoned in right you can see that the grind is almost effortless right it's really very pleasant to grind right and 10 gram actually grinded quite really fast right it's already done okay my water is about to be ready too okay nice okay so as usual we'll fold the paper along the edges open it up right pull it over and now we're going to rinse the paper so that we can carry of the paper taste okay or be generous when you do this right make sure that you rinse out the paper right i always get a container to stand by right because i'm actually going to use this water to heat up my cups uh my cone my canister right as well as my two cups here let's start my weighing scale right let me get the grind out exactly about 10 gram 10.1 grams right so again zero this right 10 grams so i'm actually using about 150 grams of water right let it bloom for a while for about 30 seconds all right it's about 30 seconds now so i'll continue to add water um try to control the amount of water adding on do it slowly right i will do a one okay from the center i'll usually round uh go in a circular motion right i'm aiming for about 150 grams of water the cake there's about 150 grams i'm using at one is to 15 ratio right by right should be doing a carbine right but uh nevermind i think i'll just do a v60 brew to check the taste of the coffee that we just roasted right from the grind you can see that the grind size is very very consistent right and that's about the meal right hand grinder right i think it's definitely comparable to the high-end hand grinders such as commandante and ginu but i've i've yet to compare against them i'm still trying to get some of my friends to loan me their commandante or kino quinoa clinics so that i can actually come to a comparison okay the drone down has been completed in about two minutes right so now let's try the coffee all right so chase smells great wow i think this is uh from the smell elite smells a bit it's very floral very pleasant right i can remember the previous two batches of rose id on m10 i almost over roasted it it almost turned i actually rose past about end of first crack up to second crack so the coffee was actually very uh pretty dark and i started to become oily right so normally i will not roast until um second crack right but i was actually experimenting on the roast itself so now let's try the coffee wow very fruity hmm ah it's really like juice it's really really pleasant coffee in fact i can't even tell whether this is coffee or tea it almost tastes like a fruit tea oh it's really very good i'm definitely going to save this profile wow the the acidity is the definitely the pleasant kind of acidity it's the fruity uh not as acidic as lemon right if you think about lemon's acidity right the citrocity from a lemon to about maximum of 10 right this citrocity is about maybe three or four of the lemon cup of acidity so the acidity is actually very pleasant the body of the coffee is really very good ah it's really very pleasant wow oh this is a definitely a very good cup of coffee sorry i keep praising my own coffee i will now go on to the second stage whereby i will try the the bean roaster on the m2 okay so now i'll be preparing for the second batch of this roasted from the m2 right so same thing i will be loading about 10 grams right just to share with you right this is the quality of the bins from the m2 right this is actually from the n10 right it's really very even rows so let's load about 10 grams into the this is also the quarter mala bean okay 10.1 grams all right so same thing i'm going to grind it still using the mill right hand grinder okay it's done okay let me wet the paper okay so i have a second cup here heat up the cup let me push this away so it doesn't get wet okay now i'll be just drop the pins inside i really love this mirror hand grinder well i can smell the fragrance from the grinder beans that's the joy of doing own rows right so now the temperature of water is about 95 degrees all right same thing i'm gonna i'm going to bloom for about 30 seconds same thing 1 is to 15 ratio right i'm going to use about 150 grams of water okay there's about 15 150 grams of water swirl a little bit uh both uh both rows done on m2 m2 are the light medium rows the cd plus right the complete drawdown takes about one minute 35 seconds right let's taste the coffee right this is the uh coffee from rosa from m10 right still the guatemala beans my frequency is almost identical it's really pleasant now okay so um very very flowery kind of smell very pleasant right it's a it's a shame that um you can watch this right but you cannot smell or taste this okay let's try to drink it hmm okay i will say that the rose done on the m2 is not as exploding right the smell of the taste is a bit mellow right it's not as exploding as the m10 the citrocity of the coffee tastes better on the first one which is from the m10 this is more flat right the body is not as good as the m10 it's interesting but it is still a very good cup of coffee excuse me yeah okay the the both both give a very good aftertaste right um the very pleasant aftertaste of coffee right if i if i have to drink this first right uh before this i think this will be a very good cup but as compared to the first one right i can see that the m10 is definitely doing a better job it's definitely brighter right same grind size same kind of bins right uh roasted on two different roaster right so um this is based on my own experience and my own judgment so this is only for myself and i can see that m2 the first crack is actually happens at a lower temperature than i expected so i expect the first crack to actually happen around 175 to 180 degrees but i think it happens around 160 plus or 170 degrees right later on i will go back and check the video to see whether i'm right uh so that could be the reason why the flavor of the coffee is not being uh expanded out right whereas the uh the control of the temperature of the m10 is definitely better right it's able to reach the temperature that i want it to be much more precise and much faster so in terms of reaction i can actually react faster right the machine can give me feedback also faster right but of course there's a pros of cons if you uh m10 tend to roast a bit too fast right m10 will you can take your time right to slowly develop the profile on the m2 right so uh that's all i have for you today right so thank you for watching and then thank you for joining me today and uh accompanying me uh in the roasting process on both the m10 and the m2 and to actually sample the coffee so i hope um you like my video content and if you like to see more of this in the future right please leave the comment down below let me know any feedback any improvement you want to see on the videos i make or any directions i should i should adopt in my future videos right um please link in the comment down below right so um remember to subscribe to my channel and like my video and of course ring the bell right if you want to stay updated on the most recent video that i've done right and once again this is ui my channel is all about having fun making coffee right thank you for watching and see you very soon [Music] you", "QMROzWaj28U": "today we are looking at the solimo coffee beans these are the second choice when you do a search on coffee beans on amazon and this is part of my top 10 coffee beans so we're going to be looking at this today we're going to be grinding it on the safe roaster express and we're going to see what kind of espresso we can get and what settings are required if you check out my last week's video that was on some lavassa beans so i'll leave a link to those if you're interested in those but these beans are certified um arabica beans arabica rebecca i never know how zone and three between three and five so it's a three so it's gonna be a quite mild coffee um packaged in a protective atmosphere roasted and packed in belgium rainforest alliance certified so you're getting you know a lot of coffee for your money you're getting two big bags it's two one kilogram bags for just under 14 pounds which seems pretty crazy really i don't know how they're doing it but obviously it's amazon so you know i'm sure they're doing it in some special way by buying it in massive bulk with 6 000 reviews on amazon and they all kind of vary depending on the type of coffee you're after and that's the thing about coffee it's all subjective to your flavor and palette so as this is such a big bag and you are getting two bags what i recommend is you probably freeze one of your bags until you want to use it because otherwise your beans are going to kind of go stale so 18 grams weighed out in our coffee i'm now going to put this into the hopper and we'll get this extracted all right so i've got my 18 grams of coffee ground and in the portafilter my coffee settings my grind settings were on a six so i always start off around a five or a six and this is a very dry coffee so i reckon it's gonna have a pretty decent pull but we'll see so i'm gonna hit the double shot and what i'm gonna also do is on my scales i'm going to start the timer start timer and press the double shot and see what we get on pressure's building up you want to get around here obviously and that's way way too watery hardly any pressure so that is massively undistracted i mean when i pressed the button it was a few seconds after so it would have been around about 22 seconds so that as we know is under extracted uh from our last videos again go and check him out if you don't know what i'm talking about but there's too much volume in there he came out way way too fast so cheers it actually doesn't taste too bad um considering that was massively underextracted it's not bitter it's quite sweet it doesn't have any harsh aftertaste so i'll be interested to see when we pull a better shot with this what it's going to taste like but that's pretty good for start the starting point so again a lot of the times you can use these espressos don't throw them away even they don't meet the signals that you normally expect it's completely drinkable it's fine it's absolutely fine you can drink that and you'll be happy next time you do it you can save yourself a bit of money and you can use reuse your espresso beans and actually dial them in a bit more so let's get this dialed in on a two this time uh because we were on a six last time and this was massively under extracted so i'm going to switch this down to a two on the grinder and we'll regrind and rebrew again so for this shot we have now got 18 grams again as normal and we have now ground this to a level two on our grinder so let's just see what kind of shelf we get the pressure's building up much more pressure than last time still a little bit fast for me so again that's 24 seconds this time it was pretty quick so i'm going to want to dial this down a bit more i'm going to think i'm going to go down to a much finer grind setting so let's try we're going to put this down to the finest setting this time it's coming out similar actually to that last um the vasa coffees beans that i used i'm going to use the finer setting and i'm going to use the same amount of coffee again because to be honest the filter was slightly overflowing with the amount of coffee i'm using even with 18 grams so let's try again maybe that's the best we can pull with this and we'll see how we get on [Music] looking good so this time it was about 26 seconds which again is slightly short but i think that's the best we're going to get with this particular coffee brand let's just see what this tastes like so here's the shot we've pulled really nice crema on there but that might not be a bad thing let's just see how it tastes tastes really good i'm actually impressed with that for the amount of coffee you're getting for 14 quid or just under that two big bags of coffee tastes nice it's a nice smooth taste it's quite mellow hasn't got any bitter aftertones at all um this is actually a really nice coffee and i would drink this on a daily this would be a really good coffee to have on a daily basis um the extraction itself was a little bit tricky obviously having it on the finest setting and you're pulling quite a large shot but it tastes good it tastes really good and so um if you've got any questions or comments let me know if you find these videos useful please give it a thumbs up please subscribe to my channel i will be doing the next coffee next week and i'll show you how to extract that and go through the settings and check out my other videos you might find useful on getting the best out of this machine catch your next video", "jom7AR9NUiY": "[Applause] everything new Under the Sun how to find green beans for roasting so if you follow this channel and you'd have to follow it probably fairly closely I haven't got a ton of videos on it but I do roasts my own coffee bean we drink coffee at least twice a day and I've got a French press and I do grind my own coffee and not only that but I also roast my own coffee now I started a couple years ago actually sold coffee commercially and so I bought a bay more roaster let me see if and I'm on this is once that you can go to to find a green bean erinc PA this is for canna there's lots of places you can find green beans but let's see if I can find the Roasters here see yes let's see my internet is slow but I just want to show you the the roaster uh that I have not not commercial roaster coffee makers commercial toasters last night Sean coffee commercial Roasters no si coffee grinders servers special machines coffee makers weird let me search this site here Bay more it's a bay more a roaster and last I knew they did sell it okay they have the Bay Mar 1600 upgrade so okay there it is there's a bay moroso this is what I roast and this is uh it does one pound and I think I bought it for about $400 originally and this is an upgraded this is a plus version which rotates the Jama bit faster but anyways you can get roasted you can get small quantity Roasters you know from all over the place eBay there's lots of them that that kind of roast kind of a you know a couple beams at a time and it's very easy so you obviously get the freshest coffee you need to roast your own beans and it's very easy to get the green beans they pretty much last not forever but you know for many you know they'd laugh a couple of years anyways green beans lungs are stored in a cool dry place but where to find them that's kind of a point obvious and maybe I should do a video boat Coffee Roasters in the future where to find them though so you go to a website like green bean or HP and there's there's sites across Canada and their second u.s. as well and these will usually sell green beans you know pound at a time couple of pounds or even what they call a bulk or a wholesale green bean so I want to show you there's some options here if I go up here and just look at the shop menu on green berry so you've got your roasted beans they saw roasted beans but they also sell on roasted beans and this menu isn't working for me probably because I'm recording the screen but so let me go one second I'll say I'm going to go you can look on the side Megan here wholesale on roasted beans I'm going to go to be unroasted beans here because that's what I want and I want the bulk because if you're buying one pound or two pounds well your pot you're paying premium the dollar for that you're paying you know eight dollars ten dollars per pound if you buy twenty or thirty pounds at a time then you can get that number down to six or seven dollars a pound and then you can even once you do that once you start buying wholesale you can actually go upscale a bit get kind of a fair trade organic beans which is what I always do and you can also get a little bit more expensive beans because if you're buying bulk at the price per pound comes down so just to look at some of these beans here and you can go through them and there's you know they all have different flavors let's see let's look at the Colombian fair trade here fair trade organic Colombia so Columbian is kind of the bean and everybody knows and so it tells you the price of it and this is for a twenty pound weight so you can go to so every time I generally buy about thirty pounds at a time and it's going to cost you know anywhere from twenty to thirty dollars to ship it it is fairly heavy and of course the larger quantity you go the cheaper it is per pound something to remember that is in the bottom here in this section it tells you kind of what it tastes like so if you if you like the more vibrant tasting coffees versus a more mellow medium coffees well this this gives you an idea for what it tastes like and then it gives you some specifics about some specs if you will of it and flavor a light a light leaf rooted sweetness golden raisins in the light roast is a primary attribute in this beans dry fragrance with milk chocolate appearing as a roast levels near full city and it goes on and it usually tells you how what sort of a roast range you know can it can it stand a light roast - a dark roast and so you see down here roast city-to-city plus with lighter rows preferred darker roast proffered a more bitter quality that overlaid on the fruit didn't work so well so some beans give themselves well to a range of roasting some are better for a lot more lightly roasted beans and some are better for darker roasted beans or expressos and that sort of thing but green beans they'll try and they'll tell you it all on the on the website here so you you wrote it up you know 30 pounds and that's it and you get it and you can roast it in a popcorn maker I did that for years you can roast it in a frying pan I've done that I've done videos on that I'll try and put the links to the videos I've done on that in the description what else can here you can do it in the oven I've done that as well just on a front you know a cookie cookie cookie pan cookie tin whatever you can do that so there's many ways you can do you don't have to buy a fancy roaster although if you want to you can get a roaster for not a bad price All Things Considered let me see if I can find the Roasters here in just giving it just two real quick over you I'm not gonna do any reviews on this but again at Green Bay near Beanery CA I'm not getting paid by the same fwrite but I just use this for literally years I've used green greenery and did you just update to their site actually and then so this is one of them this is a hand crank Henri electro roaster you put it over basically I think Oh an alcohol burner put it over an alcohol burner you put your beans in the drop menu you manually rotate it until they're roasted to whatever you want first crack in a second crack or whatever and then if we go down further you have another home roaster and then this one this is a fancy hot top groceries quite expensive mm $2,300 they're selling it for here this is an advanced roaster with a cooling tray which spins around this is kind of kind of like a commercial roaster packing a little small box what I don't like about a lot of these home Roasters is that they roast such small quantities and it's the same same for this one but this one you can hook up to a USB and you can see real-time graphing and logging on your computer that's kind of neat another one is the genie cafe roaster again it does boat I think it's a what is it a third pound or something of green beans at I'm not a large quantity like the the bay more row so that I have does a pound of coffee now mine is older it's pretty dirty so I'm only able to roast about less than half a pound no no more than half a pound but I do about 12 ounces and that roasts down to because the water content decreases roast down to about half a pound so I can't put a full 16 16 ounces or a pound of green beans in there we're going to choose your much smaller but these are may be easier if you've never roasted before so the genie cafe roaster is 780 and then you get into these this is a more commercial on solar automatic coffee roaster you know for $10,000 that's obviously pretty expensive it's got more the more the hot tops there I'll click new and use ones and then various components so that is that I think they have a whole section oh there's there's the bay more against before for kick that's the one that I have which does a brand new one will do about a pound most people don't do that they know they know it doesn't do that but putting left on a panel do them you don't have found the green beans at a time that's how you like it I like to do a roast as much as many beans as I can on time I'm actually roasting right now I could smell the coffee in the air it actually gives me a headache sometimes it's so strong because it gets my brain thing and I'm going to check a whole bunch of coffee but yeah I roast my coffee and I have to do roasts in this one I do I roast about a pound of coffee I run it twice basically with about 12 ounces of green beans in it at a time that gets me about a good pound of roasted beans and though that lasts me about maybe a week week and a half and then I have to do that all over again roast roast a couple more times there and that's what I do with that and this is another one that I did have actually this is a more affordable one but 300 you can find these on eBay from you know two hundred bucks much less price you can see this line here this is the line in this one where you fill it up to so this is about a half cup of green beans that you fill this up and this is an air pumper this is effectively a popcorn machine that has a chaff tray in it this works really well I had the this actually I had the SR 500 this is the SR 700 500 even cheaper and it just works it just blows hot air up into the green beans and cook some you do have to turn it off when you're done so you get to watch this thing the the bay Mar is automatic in that it will time the row so you can have up down 20 21 minutes of roast it will automatically go to cooling once it's done that timer but they obviously never suggest that you leave it alone so yeah there's lots of lots of ways you can do it if you have a couple of bucks to spend you can get one of these one of these Roasters here and and these guys do these work you know really great so as a one-time any little last year's if you keep it clean so amortize the price of it if you're worried with that let it get you the premium coffee not only that does it not only doesn't get you the best tasting coffee the premium coffee but I think if you buy your green beans in bulk 350 pounds eggs-it you know the price per pound averages out over the length of time you're drinking it and it's not that much above you know buying buying little beans from your Sobeys grocery store and grinding them yourself and you know the grinders are negligible for price so you can get a burr grinder you know for twenty thirty dollars and really being ourselves as well so Greenbay nuri basically sells a whole caboodle if you want to get into this it's but it's really if you have a popcorn maker you can start trying roasting your green beans on that I would say buy a pound of green beans and try try roasting it on your stovetop or in your oven or in a popcorn maker see how you like it see how you like the fresh taste of it and there's loads of videos about you know teaching you how to do it I'm not going to do that here I think I may have briefly covered that in previous videos but I'm not going to cover that here I just want to give you an idea where you can get it and how you can start and it's really easy to start like I say go to Green Beanery dot CA el celular your green beans looks like your roaster those failure burr grinders will slightly express machines all sorts of products they have it's a one-stop shop if you're looking for how to get into this they do sell roasted stuff as well but hey I definitely recommend trying your hand buying a bag of green beans and trying it it is the best taste the freshest coffee that you can get and if you do it in about quantities you can actually get the price down to where it's really not costing you any more to do it except your time so I thought I would put that out there for the coffee lovers or Coffee Roasters in on my channel and maybe I think I'll make a playlist also you want to make a playlist about this because I do have a number of videos about it and check out the other videos I have I've I've done videos on roasting the popcorn maker on the stovetop I've done videos also I have a number of videos out there already so get check it out watch the playlist and let me know let me know what you think and let me know that if you decide to get into it that maybe I helped to convince you to get there that would be pretty cool so thanks for watching guys we will see you guys in next [Music]", "3kMKRY9AN4U": "[Music] for all the attention paid to coffee today how much do we really know you've seen your coffee beans roasting but do you know how they get their start how is it planted who farmed it how is it picked I went to Armenia Colombia a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its importance to coffee and while a small farm might seem like the purview of your small coffee shop we actually went along with the Nescafe teachers choice team to learn that the journey of Colombian coffee more often than not starts on a family farm no matter what brand it ends up with Colombia is the number one source of Arabica beans meaning the good stuff but the journey of a single bean takes more time and has more hands involved than you might think we started at a nursery seeds are planted and sprout for two months until they become a plant with then they're washed to prevent potential diseases and then they're planted it's delicate work to keep them properly planted they stay another three to four months in the nursery before they're ready to leave and no matter whether you're Columbian coffee comes from a huge brand or a small artisanal coffee shop 96% of Colombian farmers have less than 5 acres and it's often a family affair once the sprouted bean is planted then it's still another long wait two years until you get a crop the plant flowers becomes a green bean and then finally turns into the red bean that's ready to pick each coffee tree grows for four or five years until it's cut back after 18 months or so it's ready to produce again for another three to four years until you repeat the cycle a coffee tree can have a lifespan of around 25 years when the beans are red they're hand-picked and then pulse so that just the beans remain it sits in water for 12 hours and then dries from there it goes to a mill a farmer arrives and the mill does an analysis both physically and by machine to determine the quality based on size weight dense in color Colombia only allows a certain standard to leave the country so once they pass the test they're ready to be back their challenges facing Colombian coffee growers global warming younger generations wanting to leave the business groups like the Nescafe plan are attempting to train farmers to grow sustainably and get the most out of their crop so the next time you pick up a cup of coffee from Colombia think about the journey it took from seed to plant lit to tree to a mill and that's all before it leaves the country to be roasted ground and into your cup", "9zpIt67RG_U": "[Music] [Music] so [Music]

approximately seven minutes into the process great little machine with the hoppers [Music] we will into the first crack I'm not sure you can hear it but we find this No fairly even roast still have a few cracks that you probably could hurt there you're there but no vinegar it's been approximately fifteen minutes now I can see some smoke coming up everything is starting to go fairly quickly there's a strong smell of burning burned something in the air and if you look you can see the smoke coming up I will open this quickly starting to look very very good check that out I will close this again

cracks going on that's perfectly fine so what I'm doing is somehow getting all of this I don't know why I use that there's handles on it look at all this that's flying everywhere and while I'm doing

test these babies and we're doing our testing on the Breville barista Express by all accounts my absolutely favorite coffee machine I added some beans to the harbor and normally you're supposed to wait three days but because this is such a nice chest and the cover being looks so good I figured we would try it anyway so usually I get like [Music] normally I don't drink from a shot glass or a

Elena although by definition it was his prison it couldn't have been too bad of a way to live out his twilight years indeed he began cultivating coffee so the Saint Elena coffee brand is a direct result of failed world domination by one of the most infamous military leaders in history to this day it is still cultivated on the island and shipped all over the world due to its remoteness transportation costs are high which certainly accounts for some of the expense however the main reason people are willing to pay so much for st.

Luwak is grown in indonesia particularly around bali the area is inhabited by a large number of wild civet cats that absolutely adore eating raw fruits of the coffee beans straight off the tree the coffee fruit passes through their digestive systems and ferments in the process the perfectly conditioned beans are then picked out of the animals excrement washed roasted and then distributed due to the fact that this coffee has become so popular there are many horrific practices now taking place by unlicensed and unregulated local businesses many Indonesians have decided to capitalise on tourists hysteria by capturing civet cats caging them and forcing them to eat the cheapest coffee fruit they can find this is not true Kopi Luwak if you're interested in trying this unique and

cultivation method also makes it entirely unique much like the Kopi Luwak coffee black ivory coffee must be plucked from excrement this time though it's from the dung of elephants the black ivory plantations are situated in Thailand and work in conjunction with elephant sanctuaries the Arabica coffee beans are consumed in huge numbers by the giant mammals during the digestion process the elephant's stomach acids will break down the protein in the beans and create an utterly unique robust flavor the reason that these coffee beans are the most expensive in the world it's because the cultivation method is very inefficient most of the beans consumed will be completely broken down by the elephants in such a way this coffee is always high in demand because it is so rare the flavor is intense dreamy and unlike anything else in the world if you're visiting Thailand we adamantly recommend visiting the plantations and trying some for yourself but be ready to pay upwards of 60 dollars

tell your story", "f6J0M9G7Igc": "all right hey guys welcome back and this is going to be my first in a series of beginning guide to coffee and what I'm wanting to talk about today is the coffee itself what kind of stuff you need to get to have the best and these are kind of my top four technically five things I look for in coffee when I'm going out trying to find the best stuff as you can see behind me this is just some stuff I picked up in my travels and some of it's still awesome some of it is not and I'll kind of go through why but the first thing when you're buying coffee is you should buy whole being coffee and grind it right before you're about to brew the coffee and I don't really have any grinds but I've got a static anyway why you want to get whole beans is basically oxygen is like coffees killer it destroys the good stuff of coffee once you've roasted the bean and then expose it to air everything that makes that coffee awesome slowly is fading away and they the experts I guess they claim that coffee is good for about a week after it's roasted I don't know about that because I've had some pretty dang good coffees a month or two sometimes maybe even three at most is it as good as the first week after it was roasted no but is it terrible not really so get whole beans because once they're ground up whole beans you know you've maybe got a couple weeks if you just let them sit out exposed before they start going stale if you grind them up you're looking at within hours even being enclosed in a bag you're just it's basically like more air is hitting more surface area of the coffee which is making it speed up the process of going back so buy roasted whole bean coffee secondly is the rose state now none of my coffees really are store-bought except for this one Pete's coffee and I only get this really for my espresso machine because it makes really awesome espresso and most copies when you go to the store they have a I don't know if you can see that best purchase by date and they'll tell you it like this one says eleven nineteen fourteen but when you're going to like a Starbucks or your local grocery store and you're buying coffee like Bulger's eight o'clock whatever who knows how long that Sussman sitting on the Shelf honestly for a couple reasons one they're mass roasting this coffee and so you're not getting the clip the best freshest stuff by the time it hits the store so that's one problem and the second problem is it's been sitting on the shelf for who knows how long and then the other thing is if it's got a best purchase by date that's according to them when it's not necessarily bad to drink it past it but the coffee's not as good or whatever well honestly it's now probably been three four five six months or longer and a lot of these stores you go into they do not rotate their product so you'll find the fresh stuff up at the front the older stuff sitting at the back and then if they haven't restocked it in a while your debt grabbing the stuff that's been sitting there for a long time and that's bad so I always try to find stuff that locally roasted somewhere in town I find at a coffee shop typically a bunch of hipsters are hanging out there and they roast on site and you can talk to them and and what they'll do and this one actually does it says roasted on and that's actually pretty old coffee for me on August what is that 21st but it'll do what I needed to do for my espresso it's more for testing than anything this isn't too far out this one says roasted on September 16th I always try to actually buy my coffee roasted within days of when I'm buying it so that's a little harder to find sometimes but if you can find coffee that was roasted the day of the day after whenever you bought it within that week time frame you're gonna get amazing coffee like this stuff smells awesome still because it's fresher than this stuff so you're gonna get a better coffee than that of this one even though this one's okay and then the second thing I've kind of got a list because my in-laws went to Seattle a while back and they said hey we want to get you some coffee so hold on before you just grab some coffee let me give you some list here of what to look for and this right here is just a personal preference is a lighter roast and the reason why is I think a lighter roast kind of reflects the actual coffee it highlights the notes of what the copy's supposed to taste like like if it has for an example like a Yirgacheffe that's a kind of coffee has a blueberry note and if it's really fresh and roasted right you will actually taste blueberry in the cup of coffee so I like the lighter roast and the other thing for instance major Dickinson's blend they call it full-bodied now I don't know all the ins and outs of Pete's coffee but a lot of these companies that will say full body French roast dark whatever what they're really doing is covering up for the fact that they've bought some bad beans and you've got two kinds of beans you've got Arabica and you've got robusta Arabica is what you really want robusta is kind of the lower grade coffee and a lot of times they're covering up for the fact that their beans are not the best so they roast it darker and then market it to the public hoping we're stupid enough to buy into their marketing and they say it's a French roast it's a dark roast when all they're doing is burning all the good stuff out of the beans and now you're just left with bad chalky coffee so that's just a personal preference I have had a few darker roasts that I actually like but I really don't like getting super dark on coffees because I think you're taking away the good flavor of a coffee like this that's got all these bright awesome notes that you're just missing out if you burn the coffee so and then secondly is just kind of where the coffee's from and really this is preference but a lot of coffees I like or guatemalans some Brazilians Panama Ethiopia Yemen what else is there Costa Rica El Salvador any of the African countries South American countries and there's a few countries kind of in the I guess the islands what was its imatra and stuff they do make some but those aren't my favorites if you find coffees that are like that or blend of those in Mexico make some good coffees Hawaii some of them are pretty awesome but the thing to note is coffee is a produce so when you're going out there looking for coffee feel free to just experiment and try from different regions because you'll be really surprised at the flavor profiles that change one will taste more earthy another one will taste more fruity another one might taste real smooth and dark and kind of chocolatey so it's really cool to kind of try different coffees and lastly if you'd have no idea what to look for go to your local coffee shop where all the hipsters hang out and you know they roast their coffee go up to the barista say hey what coffee is the best if I just want straight-up coffee and they'll tell ya and if the coffee is really good I always say if the coffee is good itself you should not have to add cream or sugar to it it will be naturally sweet on its own it will not be bitter if it was made correctly and roasted right and yeah so ask a barista and that's pretty much it for a beginner coffee so buy whole beans find out if it actually has a roast date on it try a lighter roast it might not be up to your taste and look for certain countries like Colombia Ethiopia Guatemala Panama El Salvador Costa Rica any of those countries produce amazing cups of coffee look make sure it's Arabica beans not robusta and if you're not sure ask a barista so that's pretty much my beginner series I'll talk more in depth on grinding size particles and stuff like that and different brew methods as we go along but to start you out don't the good stuff is not gonna be found in a box not in a box store anyway like a Walmart or local grocery store typically it's gonna be at a local farmers market and a small coffee shop that they wrote their own beans or you might have to order it like charming beard coffee and where is it some coffee these two were ordered by my sister and mailed to me from them and it was awesome it was like super fresh when I got at two days after they roasted it and that's what you want so those are gonna be the best coffees not Folgers not 8 o'clock not next low house not even Starbucks or Dunkin Donuts I'm sorry those are not gonna be the best coffees as far as freshness goes so if you guys have any questions feel free to ask but I thought some of this information would help and I hope I made it clear and I hope you guys have a blessed day and drink some awesome coffee so have a good one see it", "njzOPNhNPw4": "what's going on guys so today I'm gonna show you how to make a pen out of coffee beans this is a really cool process and the Pens look great when they're finished so let's get at it I'm starting off with some stabilized coffee beans now these are stabilized to using a cactus juice resin and vacuum chamber and this impregnates the coffee beans with a resin that is then baked to harden the coffee beans and make them a little more durable once I had the coffee bean stabilized I added them to the silicone molds that would be used for the pin blanks and tried to make sure they were even across all three molds I'm going to be using some total boat to crystal clear and some KP pigments for colors and making three different banks at once now in this particular video I'm gonna make two of the three blanks and depends but I started off wanting to make the green and the red and also mixed up a really beautiful carbon blue and pour it in and I will make this into another pen later on when you're mixing up colors like this make sure to completely mix in the colors and stir them really really well as the more you stir them the more the mica breaks down and the colors become more complete now another thing is that when I get these poured I will be using a pressure chamber and this will remove all the air bubbles from the blanks and from the epoxy and give me a nice solid casting another thing is that the colors themselves when you do castings like this they seem to darken just a little bit so keep that in mind when you're picking your colors for whatever projects you're doing when you're duke pours using light objects like these coffee beans one thing you have to keep in mind is that they're going to float some now for me it didn't bother me as much because I didn't mind that differentiation and almost a hardened line where the pen would have coffee on one side and more color on the other but if you want to keep more of a uniformed mix of the color and coffee beans you need to completely fill up the mold and then do like you'll see me doing and add something to hold the beans down and I did use the stir sticks from where I mixed in the color and some packing tape to hold down the coffee beans some just to kind of keep them a little bit past the halfway point but this seemed to work just fine and give me the effect I was looking for after getting the stir sticks taped down to the mold so they would hold the beans where I needed them in the epoxy I had moved the mold over to the pressure tank and let the epoxy cure under about 55 pounds of pressure after the epoxy was cured I removed the mold from the pressure tank and then removed the blanks from the silicone mold now these are release really easy and then after that it's on to the lay you then get to turning [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] connecting lines is what [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] brown white so now that the green pin is together I'm gonna work on the red one and now this is going to be a really cool-looking one that the coffee beans are really dark in the ridge so it should look good together that being said keep in mind when you're casting things with epoxy if you can do more than one at the time you might as well in my opinion if you have the materials there to do it why not do more than one not only that but when you're doing epoxy pores and mixing epoxy the smaller the amount you mix the harder it can be to get a ratio correct you can't get 1/3 of an ounce dead-on without a pump system which total boat does have but I usually just mix using the mixing cups for the larger pores that being said when you're turning on the lathe if you're using a lathe or a carbide lathe tool like what I'm using here from Rockler make sure you have a nice sharp edge out front to give you a super clean cut and don't try to get too aggressive make lighter cuts and multiple passes and it will chew through the epoxy superfast this carbide cuts extremely quick through the epoxy as you get closer to your finished turn size slow down use your bushings that's what they're there for there to guide you for the finishing diameter at the ends of the blank are the ends of the tube so when you press the hardware into place it fits nice and seamless after that also make sure to wear a respirator if you're doing a CA glue finish or any kind of chemical finishes it will kill your sinuses I've had this happen and it's a horrible horrible feeling so make sure to wear a respirator and safety glasses be safe about it have some fun make something cool after it's all turned and polished up it's gonna look really cool all you've got left is to put it together using the pen press and that's all she wrote so let's put this thing together one thing to keep in mind when you're using a pen press and I don't have to screw it down or anything is it's nice to just kind of lay everything out this is a slimline type pen I'll have to look up the exact name of it it is a kit that you can get off of Rockler and it's really cool kit but it's a twist pen design so it has a tip a transmission a collar your actual pen cartridge your pocket clip and a butt cap now this particular one uses a little bit wider section at the center for the barrel to line up for the correct width as it does for the tip but that's fine that's what your bushings are for so to use a pen press it's really simple this is something that you can pick up at a bunch of different sites online I'll put a link in the description but there's also a million different styles whatever style you use it all pretty much works the same way when you're doing a twist pen like this you want to pick the section that you're going to have as your tip which in this case I want this as my tip and you're going to install detail or press the tip into place first for this particular one I should be able to get away with just like that there's a hole in the end of this rod that that holds the tip in place and then you just lightly press it make sure to not go crazy with this my first pen I'd ever did I got a little overzealous and I warped barrel the barrel of the pen by pressing way too hard with the pen press so make sure not to do that after you get the tip in for these twist style pens you're going to put in the transmission now this is the transmission this is the piece that actually pushes the ink cartridge out the end of the tip as you twist the pen so the brass end here will go into the same end of the same barrel excuse me on the opposite end of your tip and this line this indention here on the transmission will be your stopping point that will be your depth gauge for how deep to press the transmission into the barrel of the pen so just like with the tip insert into the hole in the barrel make sure you've got enough room to fit it with the pen press and for this one you might have to kind of guide it and keep it from flexing or turning because it will try to flex around sometimes sometimes they fit without a hitch other times you have to stop them from flexing a little bit so make sure to don't let it twist or pop out like that as you can see even people like me have trouble with it sometimes and I'm gonna clean out the back of this barrel as you can see it's a little marred just from being on the from being turned so I'm gonna clean this out just a little bit alright so I just used the drill and the flattening bit that was used earlier to clean out the inside of the barrel and that should yeah that that's fitting much better there was just a small bar bar inside the barrel and that can stop your transmission from seating into the barrel of the pen and cause you a lot of problems so now again don't let the barrel twist you want to hold and make sure it doesn't flex and then it will just slide into place and when you hit that indention once the indention is lined up with the edge of the barrel that's as far as you need to go now what you're going to do is you're going to install the center collar over the transmission bar and you're going to install the pen cartridge this simply slides into place in the back and then twists in and now just like would the other one do too this one has a larger end than the other you want to find which one is going to you want to make sure to keep these lined up to where the larger end is fitting as you can see there's a big lip there this is designed to line up with the butt cap this end is designed to line up with this collar so again the collar goes over the transmission the transmission that will fit into this piece and again I'm gonna have to clean out another burr here yeah I'm gonna clean out this bar here so I cleaned out this bird just like with this and it was the larger ends so this that bushing is maybe got a rough spot or something that is pressing a bar out of the brass barrel of the pin and as you can see now that just slides together now to install your pocket clip and butt cap you want to kind of keep in mind where you want the pocket clip if you have any defects if you have a certain side that you want to show more than others or anything like that you keep that in mind when you're lining up the pocket clip because that will determine pretty much where it seemed because most people are not going to be looking at the pocket clip they're going to be looking at the rest of the pin so just like with the others line it up into the press line up your pocket clip where you would like it to be and press it into place and just like with others don't go crazy putting a lot of pressure I've got two fingers on this and that's all it takes to put one of these together now you test to make sure it comes out correct as you can see the tip comes out just fine so we're good to go so guys there they are the finished coffee bean pins these are really cool-looking and I've enjoyed this project too hard if

system now during this video keep an eye out for links like this one they're an easy way to go directly to videos with more detailed information or get to any of the supplies mentioned in this video now for the most part you can use just about any type of whole bean coffee in your machine but we've got an exception you should be aware of right you need to be careful when it comes to dark roasted beans which have an oily shine on their surface now a small amount is okay what we're really talking about is those that have a continuous oily film covering the entire beans those super oily have the potential to clog your grinder so it's best to stay away from using them and here's a bonus fact dark and oily beans are often roasted that way to cover up an imperfection in the coffee a couple of things to be aware of with the water using your machine first espresso and coffee well they're made up of mostly water so the quality of your source water has an effect on flavor in your cup second most water contains some minerals now it's going to vary quite a bit by source but over time those minerals cause scale deposits in your machine especially in boilers which heat the water left unchecked scale deposits reduce machine performance and can eventually clog internal components the solution to those problems is to use a water filter as recommended by your machine's manufacturer they remove chlorine and other chemicals which can taint flavor and they capture some of the minerals that cause scale buildup that scale buildup is one of the most common causes of problems so we always recommend the use of water filters you'll get better flavor and performance and reduce descaling frequency in fact for some machines use a filter is recommended and you can eliminate the need to descale check your manual to see if that's the case for your machine otherwise to scale your machine at intervals as prescribed by the manufacturer some machines alert you when it's time to scale and it's often based on factors like an initial water hardness test and use of a filter if your machine has the functionality be sure to enter that information when prompted into scale when alerted to do so now just about every machine has an adjustable grinder and we're willing to wager that most users will just set it and forget it and the thing is you could be getting better flavor by adjusting based on factors like beverage being made roast level of your beans and of course the ultimate indicator the flavor in your cup now at some point grind adjustment is a subjective judgment but here's some general advice use a finer grind for espresso in coarser for long coffees you can also use the raw level of your bean as a guide and grind finer for lighter roasts and coarser for darker roasts on most machines you should only adjust the grind when the grinder is actually running this is especially true when adjusting the grind finer right that's going to try and move the burrs closer together any leftover coffee between the birds can make it difficult and lead to damage of the adjusting mechanism so only adjust when the grinder is running the brew group is the heart of the super automatic machine yeah it's like the little mini barista inside your machine doing all the work now thankfully you don't have to leave your brew group a tip but you do need to keep it happy mm-hmm and making it smile means removing it once a week or so and giving it a good rinse with room-temperature tap water there's no need to scrub during this routine maintenance when you're done just let it drip dry and replace on some machines especially those from Jura the brew groups are not removable to clean them you typically use a manufacturer specified cleaning tablet applied through the bypass doser if your brew group is not removable check your manual and clean it using the procedure is specified whether your machine has a more manual style auto frothing wand for working with milk a detachable carafe a cappuccino Torrey or a pickup tube system the key to good performance is keeping it clean of course you want things to be sanitary but for good froth components need to be free of any built-up dry down milk deposits no matter what type of frothing device your machine has they all work by injecting metered amounts of air while heating milk deposits can easily clog the passages these devices to keep them working well use the auto cleaning function if your machine has that feature even if it does it's still necessary to take components apart and clean them by hand after extended use an auto frothing wands give extra attention to small air intake holes is they easily clog and reduce performance when cleaning be careful not to lose any of the small parts after cleaning be sure to properly reassemble and fully seat all components in their proper position now if you keep those five things in mind your machine will provide you with years of delicious service we hope

probably five years ago I wrote a really brief blog post describing some of the common fallacies or misnomers about loyalty coffee and it's turned out to be basically the most popular blog post we've ever written and so I wanted to use this time this morning to talk through a little bit of what that blog post says and kind of expand on it a little bit so when you think about oily coffee you probably think about dark roasts maybe coffee you get from your local coffee shop or from the grocery store and a lot of times people associate that with a good dark roast coffee or even with um an espresso bean and frankly that's a misconception what I want to talk about today is what makes a copy oily a little bit what makes a dry coffee perhaps better and then some of the problems with having oily coffees what makes a coffee oily inside of the coffee is without getting into all of the chemistry around it there is a lot going on inside of the coffee as you start to roast it and we've talked about this in our coffee roasting videos the coffee bean starts to crack and pop and you start to let some co2 out of the coffee and if that hits oxygen and some of the other sugars inside the coffee that actually oxidizes and creates an oil and that oil comes out of the beam as the continues to oxidize over a longer period of time the coffee gets oily an oilier and oilier and so if you roast it longer you're gonna see that second crack you're gonna see the not just the exterior shell of the bean crack but the interior shell of the pink crack you're gonna get a lot more sugars hitting that oxygen and you're gonna see a lot more oxygen and oil on bean itself and that is an indicator that the coffee has probably been roasted to a darker level where the inside part of the shell is cracked and become oxidized that's why you think of oily coffee with dark rose coffees there's also a time element to that the more time that the co2 releases from the from the bean and it connects with oxygen the more likely you're going to get oily coffee and so you're going to see a lighter Roques coffee might sit on the shelf for a month and start to get oily because of that oxidation process so it doesn't always mean that it's a dark roast coffee sometimes the coffee can be oily just because it's been sitting on the shelf for a long time how do you get dry coffee um frankly you just don't roast it that dark and you drink it super fresh I think I'll talk about this in a later video but we'll talk a little bit about the life of a coffee bean and how that co2 is actually released from the coffee bean for up to 42 or 70 to 48 or 72 hours after roast is called a degassing period where the coffee actually develops better flavors as time goes on you start to lose some of that the flavors inside they start to oxidize and some of the richness of the coffee goes away I personally love coffee somewhere between that 72 hour period and really about 7 to 10 days after roast it starts going past 10 days I feel like some of what makes that coffee grape starts to go away that doesn't mean you need to throw away your coffee every 10 days you need to buy a new copy every 10 days I get that call a lot it's all up to our palates you'll start to notice when the coffee starts tasting worse that to you is when it's time for you to move on to the next coffee but during that period of time it's also going to oxidize and become oily so you might buy coffee from sagebrush have it sitting on your shelf for a couple of weeks open it up and see loyal and be like wait man you said these were dry beans well that's the oxidation process that's time going on and affecting the flavor of the beans and so what makes oily coffee bat why are people avoiding it there's a lot of super automatic coffee machines out there that in the first page of the instructions that said do not use oily coffee with this maker why not frankly because it's a mess but oil on it is sticky it ends up clogging your grinder it could clog the super automatic and some people don't like the flavor of it it does change the flavor profile of the bean and so some people don't like it it kind of is bitter and so that bitterness is some of what people try to avoid when you're looking for fresh roasted coffee you're not gonna get this bitter of a flavor and really that's just the lipids inside of the coffee oxidizing with the the air and over time that becomes bitter and so you want to avoid that really it's kind of hard to clean like when I when I have some old bean sitting around and and see the oil sitting in the container we have he doesn't do wipe out it's harder to clean because it's not as great so people don't like oily coffee and machines that you may not be able to submerge in water don't like oily coffee because it just makes it hard to ends up clogging up the Machine and makes the wear and tear of the Machine last a lot shorter when you're thinking about oily coffee and you're thinking about what coffee you want to have I generally try to avoid oily coffee I think the oils are bitter I think it means that it's not super fresh or it was roasted a little bit darker than it probably needs to be and doesn't have some of that natural flavor there is a segment of the coffee drinking world that loves that bitter rich flavors if that's what you like go for it run at it there's a lot of good oily coffees out there but know that you're not getting fresh roasted coffee I also want to talk a little bit about D Capps so most of our decals are Swiss water drain cap the Swiss water process basically submerges the green bean in water it has a chemical reaction to the water where it actually soaks the caffeine out of the water and then they soak it back in they remove the caffeine get back in the water and and that becomes your Swiss water process coffee that reduces the strength of the outer shell of the bean so when you roast a decaf coffee you're not going to get a crack so what you do because the shell of the bean has kind of been soaked away that also means the decaf coffees will tend to look darker and produce oil a lot faster than a regular coffee you may get a decaf coffee from safe direction say wait I mean you said this was a light roast and it looks dark or how come this is oily I thought it was supposed to be fresh and I've had decaf coffees look oily before I can even get them in the bag and we roasted them like because the the outer shell of the bean itself is is a lot more weak so that reaction the coq comes out faster the lipids transfer with the Aqsa oxygen you get the oxidation faster and you might see everything that takes two or three weeks to happen with a regular cup coffee bean happen and we pour in a day with the decaf coffee bean and that's frankly why probably be kept don't always taste as good for as long not because the bean itself as I said we've had decaf coffee so we sold the regular coffee as well the beans are great sometimes you just have to drink them faster keep that in mind as you're buying how much decaf you have if you have a cup of coffee every night before bed you might want to get you know your normal amounts but if you're looking to have one or two a week you might want to get as little as you possibly can I think that's it when it comes to oily coffee if you have any questions go ahead and and comment down below and I'd love to answer it like subscribe do all those great things keep informed on what I'm putting out there I'm trying to post something every couple of weeks on our YouTube video and I hope to even speed that up over time thanks a lot", "WV-RL4gjXmM": "wikidot easybib.com such ezvid wiki before you decide ezvid presents the 10 best coffee beans let's get

"M9tr5S_zD30": "hey guys good morning at Genki prepper I thought I'd make a quick video on a couple questions that I've been getting a lot of lately number one how do I store what's the best way to store green coffee beans and number two would be what is the shelf life what's the approximate shelf life of green coffee beans you can think of green coffee in the same way that you would think of any seed your garden seeds or flower seeds I like to keep my coffee out of direct sunlight that's probably the most important factor and then after that you want to keep it in a place of at least low relative humidity or at least a consistent humidity you don't want high humidity or someplace that's wet both of those factors are going to take away from the shelf life of your being and or you know ruin the product coffee is stored all over the world in big warehouses open-air warehouses in fact some of them just have a roof just to keep the Sun off them and they actually are able to breathe that way I'll leave this video with a warehouse of coffee that I recently visited to pick up some product just to go and show you how they store their coffee long-term shelf light for coffee that's arguable you probably you know if you want the most potent best coffee that you can get you probably want to consume green coffee in in the first year at least like anything you know after the the plant is is picked and processed it's going to degrade from there just like tea will or any product for that matter but coffee has been extracted out of mummies tombs that we're talking thousands of years old and it can still be roasted up and it still tastes like coffee that's the great thing or that are the prepper side of it and I love coffee so you know I pursue this because I want the highest quality product that I can get and that's why I do this but from a prepper point of view it has a lot of advantages for shelf life you could keep you know if you keep it out of sunlight and keep it in a relative low human it has you know a shelf-life of years and years you know as opposed to keeping roasted coffee even if it's vacuum packed it's going to taste like crap you know in a very short time think of roasted coffee as fresh bread you know you got about a week after you roasted it changes the whole product after you grinding coffee think of it as freshly sliced bread you know you can leave it on the counter for a couple hours in its stale so green coffee has a shelf life of of years roasted coffee has a shelf life of maybe a week and ground coffee has a shelf life of you know about an hour basically so to keep your green coffee or round this up keep your green coffee out of sunlight you know on a place of consistent humidity preferably very low and shelf life well I would say you know you won't have to worry about it for years and years that's that's one of the best things about green coffee in general anyway wanted to address those twos real quick I'll leave you with this vid and how coffee is stored in a coffee warehouse green coffee you you", "d3ZA5Eg9wfg": "alright there's lots of ways to roast coffee green coffee but I'm going to show you three ways today two of them anybody can do it's probably the two most common ways that people roast coffee at home the first one I'm going to show you though is this colonial roaster it's an alcohol roaster very rare and I want to show you that one just because I love firing it up and also to show you that you know this is the way Americans roasted coffee for the longest time over a hundred years then I'll move on to showing you the popcorn pumper and the heat gun method in the last vid where I was roasting coffee I showed you how to roast coffee over an open fire using an antique Arab coffee roaster you can replicate that for about fifteen dollars that's what this cost it's a fireside popcorn maker the idea is you get your fire going or you're camping you stick your oil in your popcorn in there and you can replicate that process with this this will roast coffee well 15 bucks wanted to mention that to you before we go any farther though let me talk about green beans storage and just mention a few things to you coffee beans grow they call them coffee trees but it's more like a bush and they grow in a berry together like that can you see that those two halves together and it looks like this on the tree when they're growing there are no machines that have ever been developed that can pick coffee beans they have to be picked by hand that's the only way they can get them off without damaging them and there's two different ways that they process the beans before sending them out basically they have to dry them out but they're done two different ways one like the South American beans I have here this Columbia are washed it's called the process of washing and they soak the beans almost in these pools of rain water until the berries float up and the beans drop to the bottom and then they drain the pools and collect the the coffee beans then they'll put the green beans out on a patio and dry them the way you see them here on the right you can see there's a color difference here these are Sumatra in many Indonesian beans and I'm speaking relative here you know I'm trying to you know without boring you on trying to paint with broad brush here many of the Indonesian and African beans are dried processed that's where they just pour all the berries out on the patio and let the Sun bake the husks off them then they just rake the husks off or blow them off and they collect the dried berries there's a certain amount of moisture even after drying left in the berries and it's best it is said it's best to not store your beans in airtight containers because there is a certain amount of moisture even after drying in in the berry itself the coffee bean so it's best not to have them in a you know a vac pack or a can for a long period of time they store best just left out in the open in the dark in a dry area the shelf life for green beans and this is especially an attracting feature considering I'm a prepper is the shelf life the shelf life for green beans is over a hundred years I mean I have heard that people have taken coffee beans out of mummies tombs and roasted them up and it still makes a decent cup of coffee so it's it's really probably unknown how long coffee beans will last on the show it's a very long time longer than our natural lifespan so it's a good item that you can buy ahead of time and keep all right let's fire this up this is actually a German manufacturer and brought over to the States for sale alcohol in there I'll try to turn down the lights a little bit so you can see that flame because it's it's actually pretty cool it I like to heat it up preheat it a little bit so I open the door and then let it sit over the flame for a little bit let it heat up when you first start out roasting especially when you first start out roasting don't try to roast a lot of coffee that's the number one tip I'm going to give you just use a handful at a time a handful of coffee actually turns into a lot of coffee you'll be really surprised just start with a handful at a time until you get good enough don't waste a bunch of coffee in big batches because you don't know what you're doing yet it takes practice however roasting coffee is I mean anybody can do it and I'm going to give you some very short quick tips here at least it from a beginners course I want to look out for and what to do you want to think with two elements when you roll some coffee one is time okay and the other is heat and you want to use the least amount of heat and the least amount of time to get the best batch of coffee so heat time heat and time and you want to find where that crosses with the least amount of heat and time that makes the perfect roast for full city ok that's hot preheated I'm just going to use you know maybe a half a cup not even that for this first batch this opens up its really cool because they even put like fins in there so the beans won't stai rate you know if there weren't fins inside the colander they would just line up and roll over each other whereas the fins make them tumble it's very important for roasting coffee pulls it up I actually really like the roast with this because I can still listen to the roast at first when you begin roasting you'll be using you know you'll using your watch if you're using your eyes looking at the rolls to see where it is but after a while when you start to get good you'll be able to smell it you'll be able to use your your sense of smell to know where the roast is and it's it's a really cool thing I don't know that's that's part of what I really get into this you know I the intensity of the smells what's happening in the roast of the time and then you begin to listen because the beans will actually change the way they're hitting the sides of of the colander you can tell in the beginning when they're hard as time goes on they'll sound softer it's really a cool process I love it like right now it's been about seven minutes and it's just starting to pop that first pop at first crack and I can smell the sweet grasses I love this I can smell the sugar caramelizing it's it's just incredible all this going on inside that bean you can kind of hear it popping right now it's letting out some smoke sweet grass and sugar that's what I'm smelling it and it's okay to look see I think that's done I felt where I want you got that second crack you hear that dump it out and then we want to shut it down as fast as we can we'll stir it if you don't stir it and cool it off right away it will continue to roll inside the bean it's there's an a reaction an actual reaction going on in there that will create its own heat and it'll keep going for quite a long time and that was probably less than 11 minutes right around 10 to 11 minutes and already it's you know after stirring it for a little bit it's it's safe to touch that's your product beautiful and you can tell it's not over roasted because I've still got some weight to it you can kind of tell this is after a while you'll know you know when you gain experience the roasting you'll know if you've overdone it or not this has still got some weight to its right and burn everything off inside kind of hear it even me dropping it if the coffee is over roasted it'll be real light almost like popcorn here's a good example this is where my my camera fails me I think but oh there you go you can see it see that yellow in the middle there a little bits of chap left that means I didn't over roast it it still got that meat in the middle you can see the the chaff in there another thing we're looking for is we don't want the oil breaking through the surface that is bad in fact the next time you go to the store and you pick up crap coffee if you do and you open it up and you see the oil on the surface of the coffee that's bad that means it's old and they've burnt it during the roast process so it's lost that membrane and the end the oil is starting to seep out see that I didn't do that it's got almost a satin finish to it that's what you're looking for just like that and the skin of the bean should be smooth so this is what I started with and that's what I ended up with see how it grew and this is you know it's almost like got a rough skin to it this grew and it's nice and smooth now that's where your that's what you're looking for at the end of the roast a satin Sheen to it you don't want oil coming out oil comes out when it's burnt or old or both and then you still want some weight to it like these have this is actually a very nice roast if I don't say so myself now I'm going to roast a batch of coffee on the popcorn pumper this is a very common method for home roasting these are very popular for home roasting as well they're perfect and the reason why they're perfect is because of this see the inside there's it has those vents on the side and it spins around and that's what you want you want a hot air popper that has a spinning cylinder that's what makes these so popular these were built in the 80s I have the 1250 watt model there's 1100 out there I would avoid that you need the heat get the 1250 model if you could find one this time I'm going to use Columbia and again just a half a cup you're spinning methods one if you have too much coffee in there it won't let it spin getting the beans are tumbling on one side now we're going to see a lot of changes as this happening right now the bees aren't coming as much because they're the heaviest that they're going to be you can put your food in there put them around yourself already I can smell the beans starting all right I'm being honest here this is the perfect way to start out it's cheap and I think I picked this up for like 10 bucks at a secondhand store there's a lot of them out there here's the problem I have with it because I think it's because you know of where I'm coming from you hear that noise I don't get to hear the beam even the smell is different because it's blowing you know I don't get I don't get to experience all these things that I do when I'm roasting coffee the old-fashioned way so this isn't as popular to me but this is by far the easiest way and it's cheapest way to home row it's really fun to spin a little faster the bees are threatening to go from green door more yellow and basically that's all you have to do is stir a little bit you look in there and after about ten anywhere between ten and fifteen minutes your beans will be done so you're you're roasting by sight really and by time 10 10 to 15 minutes your beans will be done they couldn't cookies in the oven the other starting to tumble in there now before they were just kind of spinning around they're getting light enough to tumble and they'll start to grow in size okay it's at least been a full 20 minutes and going by my sense of smell I would say that that's pretty close to being done took a little closer is this you can hear me better - I'll see you again we've got a satin a satin shine to the outside of that beam it's puffed up not as puffed up as I'd like it to be but by the smell of it I would say that's done in full twenty minutes and that's a you know kind of the cons to the the popcorn pumper rarely will I even catch a bean popping in the popcorn bumper so you don't you don't get to see those types of reactions with it and it's very dependent upon the ambient temperature of where you're using this like for instance I'm out I'm out in the shed and I would say the temperature in here is probably 50 degrees so that's probably why it took longer than you know 10 minutes its usual 10 minutes but 70 or 80 if it's 90 it's going to take shorter amount of time because the air comes in through here and you know it's going to take longer at 50 degrees to heat it up to where you want it so again if I'm looking for that if you're imagine those needles again if I'm looking for the least amount of heat and the least amount of time you know this is taking longer with this I have no way to really turn up the heat or turn down the heat with this one I can turn it faster and that keeps the beans away from the fire and with the let's say the popcorn maker or the Arab coffee roaster you know I can raise it up obviously out of the fire with this one it's just you know whatever amount of time and then by looking at it it is very hot I know that's done it's a nice-lookin beam you know I would say it was a decent role but those are some of the pros and cons of it it's very easy if you're just starting out this is a very easy way to roast coffee the cons of it well for you know especially for a guy like me I don't get to go through all the steps but it's a great way to learn it's a cheap way to start out okay last but not least and probably the most simplistic way to home roast coffee beans is the heat gun I've just got a real cheap Black & Decker heat Pro I've had here and then I just steal one of my wife's stainless steel bowls it's that easy this is probably the most manly way to roast coffee beans again just a half a cup put them in your bowl start your heat gun that's it brought these round again this could only take you know between 10 and 12 minutes I do like this method because you know I guess I've got several heat guns just sitting around the garage it's one of those items that are are pretty common anybody can get a bowl and a heat gun but I also like it because it's not as noisy again it's important to me to hear you know what the coffee is going through and with this method I really just I get to go through all the stages and enjoy it so about four minutes into it I can tell the beans are starting to soften up and I can hear the way they're striking the side of the stainless losing that hardness stir and soften up a little going from green to yellow you know all this is taking place in that first five minutes this takes a little practice but I think it's a fun way to do it starting on the first crack after about seven seven minutes and you start smelling those sweet grasses need to go through all that I love that part of this like the hardest part about the road thing this way is trying to do it evenly but with a little practice you can get pretty good at this this will impress the hell out of your buddy doing this in the garage once in a while a beam will get caught up in the heat gun itself and burn I should figure out a way just to put a screen around this to muzzle it and stop that what you're hearing now is the second crack getting a totally different kind of exhaust it smells like coffee for that that's coffee you can smell it you can tell the way it's exhausting and put it in and kill that rose you know it's minutes I said this before keep this in mind it's minutes to bring it up to that point into the second crack and then it's just second you want it you want all those beans to turn but as soon as they turn you want that one moment where you dump it and shut that roast off so I just turned this these green beans into this three different batches I have the popcorn pumper and this is probably the most even roast you know there is no dark and light ones that you can see together that's because that that's one of the pros of that way of roasting at tumbles that being constantly but again that the you know the cons of it is that you really don't get to go through you know the whole roasting process with it it's a timed method that that one took me 20 minutes next time may take me 15 you just kind of you know you got to watch the beans this one was the old colonial alcohol roaster which is a pretty good roaster it works well so you can even see that it's a little bit uneven there's different color beans in there because some get trapped a certain way or I don't you know I don't keep up a steady tumbling but it's still a great roast turned out awesome you don't see any you know oil sitting on the surface of these beans and this one over here is the last one that I did with the heat gun which is actually you know an excellent way to roast that that's a great roast this this is the same kind of bean that's Colombian and he doing it with the heat gun actually I got a lot like a lot more it's more smooth the bean surface is smooth I got a lot more size to the bean I really developed it through the roast compared to using the popcorn pumper so if you have a heat gun and a stainless steel bowl you can roast at home an old antique roaster will work the popcorn pumper from the 80s you know you can pick up the second-hand store it's that easy and you know in the next video I'll get into different varieties of coffee the next vid that I do about coffee I'm so backed up with videos right now I've got you know winter camping and skiing and I you know snowmobiling and you know I got this solar shack I want to show you I picked up these great kerosene lanterns I want to do a bit about that I'm all over the place that's that's the problem you know I always feel with my channels that I don't have any I don't have any order to anything I'm just bouncing around I hope that's okay right now I'm really excited about this coffee thing and going into this with you so I'm going to show you you guys are especially buying the beans that's what this is for I want to show you you know different ways to roast and how easy it is so remember you're looking about 425 degrees in about 10 to 12 minutes but don't get good you know don't get caught up in that exact timing because roasting coffee really isn't about time you want to shoot for that window but what roasting coffee is all about is right here it's what it looks like it's what it smells like and you'll know you'll know if you under roasted because it won't taste right and you'll know if you over roasted because you'll taste that that charcoal that burnt these are this is a nice full city roast anyway guys I'll talk to you later you", "55PC6CfBrwE": "okay we're gonna talk real quick on cooling coffee beans after roasting when you're roasting coffee you're gonna be hitting temperatures at 450 degrees potentially 500 degrees for the taste of the coffee and a necessity there is the cooling the cooling factor so once you're done roasting you're gonna want to cool the beans as quick as you can you can use some colonies to just let them air cool normally but to speed up the process to get a quicker cool what I was able to come up with is I found this and this is strictly for home roasting you know this is not commercial use home roasting process so I found this that which came with a double boiler for your kitchen and this happened to fit right down into this bucket that I used to use to store some of my coffee beans for my personal use this is just the this is a bucket I got its food grade but it's plastic and it fits right down in there so mmm what's your done roasting the beans go right in and what I what I used was this is a air bed pump a regular old air bed pump what it did is I took a Forstner bit and I drilled one inch hole on the side of this stuck this through drilled a hole through here stuck a little dowel rod in between the hold it in place it's pretty snug so once you put your beans in the air this pump is going to pull the air out it's gonna pull it down and out its gonna come out of this outtake area here where you can find a little one-inch hose to then route out of a raster roaster box if you do that but at least you can point it away pointed away from him so the air is gonna be blowing away from you and out so it's gonna be hot air and smoke that it's that's being sucked out once you're done roasting cool thing is this comes out so when you're done cooling you just pull this out and dump it into your coffee bag or glass jar or whatever you keep your coffee in works awesome cools cools beans at about two minutes sometimes less depending on you know if you're roasting on your garage or outside depending on the temperature the time of year etc different cooling times so this is this is a great way for cooling at home and this is actually this is a secondary cooling bin that I made if you notice I put this in a place on the bucket that is just under the bottom of the metal pan you're going to get the best effect there some people and I've seen other people do this with some other mechanisms etc so people put it there put their air pump down towards the bottom which I don't really understand you that leaves you a big space for for that air to grab so if you put it up high yeah it's you can that pumps a little heavy so this this tends to tip a little bit you can even put something on the bottom to kind of hold it down and you can secure it drill it down whatever you want to do the one inside the Rose box is secured I have that secured and with just a little screw here so that's secured down it doesn't move around you can see that's a different type of pump so that's a little little different but that's the way to go if you want to start cooling and well start cooling if you wanna roast and cool your beans quick easy it's pretty cheap this bucket is probably about seven eight bucks like a Gordon food service place or something like that or you can order alone one Amazon I think has these buckets you can actually put ten pounds of green coffee beans if you use these buckets for storage these will hold ten pounds of green coffee any bean pretty good so I thought I'd just go over that real quick any questions on that if you need any help in building one or anything let me know glad to help cheers for now thanks", "KBUrljAyBmU": "[Music] hello my sugar plums welcome back to my channel today i'm bringing you three giy in one i'm gonna teach you how to make 3 coasters using epoxy resin real coffee beans in real lemon slice yep that's right thank you so much for stopping by guys a tea for your new year welcome don't forget to subscribe to my channel people I come to be notified on all mini upload and if you like this video don't forget to like it if you're ready let's just go ahead and jump into that tutorial now guess the first thing that you're gonna need to be doing is make sure you have all your stuff ready to start now the first thing that I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and do is mix my epoxy now the one that I'm using is the 1 to 1 ratio now also those mold I got from Amazon so guys I'll be living the link below if you want to go and purchase them as well now we're gonna go ahead and use a real coffee beans and then we're gonna mix some epoxy in it make sure that you use enough epoxy so every single one of the bean is perfectly coated then after that guys we're gonna go ahead and add some epoxy into a mold I mean I'm gonna go ahead and use my heat gun to remove as much bubbles as I can but for this particular coaster I wanted to have some bubble left in it now after that we're gonna go ahead and add our coffee into the mold and then we're gonna set it aside and then we're gonna go ahead and do the same thing for or second a mold and I'm gonna be using coffee as well for it [Music] [Music] okay guys now I'm gonna go ahead and personalize the square coaster because I'm making it for my husband so I went in right down his nickname into like a regular piece of paper and then I'm gonna cut it because you know making it as simple as possible I'm gonna go ahead and add a little bit of a taxi in the middle where I want the name to be in me and on top of it I'm gonna add a little bit of epoxy just to seal the whole thing now because they have a lot of bubble there and I don't wanna use my heat gun to move the paper I'm gonna go ahead and use regular match and then we're gonna pump the bubble with that now for the round coaster we're gonna go ahead and remove it from the mold because it was completely cured I'm gonna go ahead and add some more epoxy in the mold and then I'm gonna flip it upside down so that way I have both side of the coaster completely smooth out so I'm gonna go ahead pop the bubbles in there and then flip it upside down put the poor devils on top at the bottom and then let it cure you know again for another 12 hours okay guys now after it's cure we're gonna go ahead and remove it in and I'm gonna go ahead and over over the whole thing with a 120 grit sandpaper and I'm gonna set the whole coaster and then after that I'm gonna use a tiny little bit of clear epoxy again with a small brush I'm gonna go ahead and use that clear epoxy all for the coaster to give it a shine back to it so that's what I'm gonna be doing I'm doing right now guys after I'm doing that I'm gonna go ahead and set it aside and let it cure and then we're gonna be working on the other coasters okay now this coaster is completely dry I mean cured we're gonna go ahead into the same thing but because for this coaster guys I wanna have some air pocket in it basically I want the air bubble to pop creating like smaller holes and I want that to be all over the the top part of the coaster because I was planning to put like drop heads of or you know color epoxy into it but I had changed my mind after that but anyway this was I'm gonna go ahead and do a put it and then I take a little bit to give to create some air bubble at the bottom part and hopefully I was hoping for the air bubble to pop so after that I'm gonna go ahead and add some more epoxy on top of it and then you know making sure that everything is still in completely smooth out I'm gonna go ahead and use my heat gun again to pop any bubble that was in it and then after that we're gonna set it aside and then we're gonna start working on our third coaster which is the lemon slice epoxy coaster [Music] okay now you can see I have like real slice of lemon and cut them in you know tiny little slice and then also have like some other English small flowers and also I have like a mica powder it's a bright pink powder I'm gonna be using as well now I'm gonna go ahead and put my proxy into my mold and then I'm gonna remove the bubbles making sure I remove some bubbles and leave bubbles in it because I was trying to make it look like a either like a lemonade you know drink or hard candy lemonade so that's what I'm gonna be doing with this coaster now I'm gonna go ahead and add my sliced lemons and then I'm gonna go ahead and pop the little flowers in between the lemons and making sure the petal are stuck into the epoxy and then after that guys we're gonna go ahead and add more epoxy on top of it and then we're gonna go ahead and pop as much bubbles as I can and then I'm gonna go ahead and focus focus my heat gun into the lemon making sure the lemon become like almost like whitish and I should say like almost like you all look like almost like you have like sugar stuck on top of it and then after that I'm gonna use a tiny tiny tiny bit of pink epoxy in and I'm gonna use it and make like some swell you know into my coaster and then I'm gonna go ahead and use my heat gun to move the pink one and then I'll be back to show you the next step for this coaster [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys now my epoxy my coaster is completely cured and we're gonna go ahead and flip it upside down and so I can create my right or bottom side of it now I'm gonna go ahead add some epoxy into the my mold again I'm gonna remove some bubble in it and then guys I wanted to create some very big air pocket basically I wanted like part of the top part too doesn't have any epoxy in it and you'll see what I mean now that's when I put the coaster and you know into my mold and then I just push one side of the coaster in that way it will create like a pocket of air so that pocket of air will not have an epoxy stuck in it I'm not sure to xfinity but guys you'll see what I mean now after we use her if he'd gone on it we're gonna go ahead and let it sit again you know until the whole thing is completely cure now you see me using some matches again because there were some bubble that was showing and I didn't want to use my heat gun too much so I use some matches and it's a good tip guys if you don't have like you know you know a heat gun or if you don't want to move your your epoxy too much you can use either lighter or matches if you have that okay now we're gonna go ahead and let our coasters completely cured and then the next morning and believe ya there was next morning and went and remove them from the mold I'm gonna be showing you what they look like and then we're gonna be moving to the next step after that now as you can see my clear brown one is completely cure and this is what it looks like and then for the squirrel coaster that I customized with my husband name you can see the little pocket of air bubbles that popped and then left the loss in the hold in it but it didn't have enough hole for me to put my low you know color in it in my husband liked it that way so I went in lift it that way now for the my lemonade coaster when I flip it over you can see the giant beautiful almost like a laser-cut you is showing the pocket air pocket that was left in it and I was so happy with that because this part you can flip it you know the other side in each one of the side look different now we're gonna go ahead and make the bottom part for this coaster now I'm using form sponge I'm gonna go ahead and cut it in the round shape that the cursor is in and then I'm gonna use some heavy-duty glue to glue the coaster on top of it now after that guys I'm gonna go ahead and send again the the side of it to make sure that I flush the epoxy coaster with the foam itself then after that we're gonna go ahead and go over it with some clear epoxy to seal everything you know up completely making sure the foam is not gonna come out anytime soon and then we're gonna go ahead and move on to the other coaster guys we're gonna do the same thing using a wet 100 in to an increase in paper cannot send out the whole four sides of them leaving the top part and the bottom part untouched and then we're gonna go over them with clear epoxy a little bit later to make sure that we fill out everything okay now to for my personalized coffee cluster I'm gonna go ahead and use some yellow pearl to create some length for it because I wanted all three epoxy coasters to look completely different from each other now for the round one we created the bottom part using some foam sponge for the coffee epoxy to have my husband name on it I'm gonna go ahead and create some leg on it that's what I see me doing right now basically you use a little bit of glue hot glue and then take the mm pearl or whatever you want to use to create the leg you know put it in it in any loop stuck to it now this lemonade epoxy coaster I'm gonna lose I'm gonna use it as is because I want to be able to flip it you know it's so whatever side and be able to use it that's why we make the each side completely different now guys you're gonna see me right here using clear epoxy again to seal the side now or this a coaster and make sure that I put the epoxy as well a little bit on top of the red sponge to make sure it's completely still now we're gonna be doing the same thing for this coaster as well I'm gonna put the epoxy on the side and I'm gonna run a little bit of epoxy on the top as well because I was touching the top too much and because it was getting a little bit cloudy so I went and put some clear epoxy on top of it making sure I remove any epoxy dollars and you know that drip into the hole because I wanted those hole to stay like this that was part of the charm of this question and I wanted to make I'm gonna be doing the same thing for the lemonade coaster as well and then I'm gonna make sure that you know the part that I had like this big cut in it and make sure that I put epoxy inside them brush the epoxy inside them I should say so that way they will be shiny but completely empty so I don't finish doing that guys we're gonna let everything seal out and dry out and cure our completely and then we'll come back to show you the finished result [Music] [Music] [Music] okay guys now this is the finished result and I was so so happy with the coasters that I made because they are so unique they are beautiful there are different and you can see each one of them look completely different and guys you can make anything you know with epoxy and then it would be so much so so very beautiful this coaster my husband loved it so much and he loved the little pocket hole that was in it and the lemonade coaster of course those big cut that look like it's almost like laser cuts it's like so beautiful and I'm so happy that I can flip you know you know whatever site that I want in you all look completely different and of course a very pretty clear round coaster with a bread bottom it's very unique in its own way again all the coasters come out guys looking unique and different and that's exactly what I wanted to accomplish thank you again guys for stopping by maybe if you liked this video guys don't forget to give it a thumbs up and if you haven't done so go

found when visiting a local Wegmans they have an amazing collection of wines and cheeses so let's find out if the same is for their copy the first coffee we'll be looking at is bogus classic rose focus is one of the most popular coffee brands and this Wegmans retailed it at 399 for 11 ounces at the proud of Lea cheap price this blend is a split of Arabica and robusta beans and it is popular in part because it's a cheap way to get caffeine however for the more discerning drinker the blend of Arabica and robusta doesn't quite cut it focus beans don't come from a single country with their suppliers scattered all over the world additionally foggers likes Fairtrade certification my rating for foggers classic roast is 2 out of 5 of value and 1 out of 5 per quality try to avoid if possible the next brand we're going to consider is also a mass-market brand maxvill house original roast at the Wegmans I visited Maxwell House was available 395 but 11 ounces the good thing about Maxwell House is that their coffee is 100% Arabica a pretty solid value at the price however it's nearly impossible to tell where the beans come from they also don't have any sustainability fair trade or organic certifications amongst mass-market coffee brands we recommend Maxwell House over folders as the pure Arabica beans give it a leg up on taste I scored Maxwell House original roast the 3 out of 5 the value and a 1 point 5 out of 5 for quality next up is Death Wish Death Wish touts themselves as the world's strongest coffee so you can probably guess that their coffee tax and insane amount of caffeine at 1799 a pound it's many times more expensive than either focus or Maxwell House but it is USDA certified organic Fairtrade certified and grown and Peru and India the blend is a mixture of Arabica and robusta beans so despite the inclusion of robusta beans people describe the flavor is strong yet smooth and infused with notes of cherry and chocolate interestingly the Wegmans I visited offered this at a cheaper price than the brand's own website so I'm rating Deathwish a 2 out of 5 value and 2.5 five per quality next let's consider Starbucks Pike place first Starbucks Pike Place roast is a flagship coffee blend for Starbucks and as ubiquitous both Starbucks cafes and in grocery stores everywhere Pike Place is a medium roast and has a nutty flavor with a bold smooth finish even though some other Starbucks wins are fair trade and certified organic Pike Place isn't the Wegmans I've visited offered a 12 ounce bag at seven dollars 19 so quite a good deal I'm rating Starbucks Pike Place plan a 3.5 out of 5 of value and 3.5 out of 5 for quality countercultures 46 kicks quality up a few notches higher with its organic sustainable and ethically sourced blend the blend comes mostly from Guatemala and Ethiopia and has a smoky full-bodied taste with a kiss of dark chocolate the Wegmans I visited had a developer at $11.99 for 12 ounces so a high price point but one that is justified by its high quality I'm giving counterculture 46 a rating a four out of five of value with our highest score of five out of five per quality with 46 counterculture has one of the better blends available on the market and I definitely recommend it next let's consider major Dickinson's blend by Pete's coffee this plant has a dark spicy bold and multi-layered taste Pete's coffee is generally a little bit more expensive than Starbucks but it's in my opinion a superior product and major Dickinson's blend is a go-to for me when I'm looking for value when visiting Wegmans I observed the price of $7.99 through 12 ounce bag so that's a price that will allow many to make it their everyday coffee I'm giving major Dickinson's blend a four point five out of five of value so the highest of these are reviewed copies and a four out of five for quality the last frame we're considering is lot : Corsica la : definitely makes good coffee and their flagship Corsica blend is no exception they have big on fair trade and organic certifications and sustainability 1194 a 12 ounce bag it may seem pretty expensive but Corsica definitely warrants trying this blend is sourced from Brazil Colombia Honduras and Mexico and has notes of baker's chocolate red wine and spices I'm scoring Corsica a four out of five value and a four point seven five out of five for quality Wegmans has a quality selection of coffee offered at very competitive prices nevertheless I think they should consider broadening this election to include single origin options to match their upscale wine and cheese offerings overall Wegmans makes for an excellent choice if you want to find quality coffee at bargain prices thanks a lot for watching make sure to LIKE subscribe and visit our blog at gr threads comm for all your coffee resources and recommendations", "iwHdm5GtNHI": "so you've got your new grinder and semi-automatic espresso machine but where to start how do you make a good espresso hi mark here from whole latte love today I'll take you through the basics of how to get the right grind size so you can make a good espresso grind size is critical when making espresso the process of finding the right grind size that's called dialing in to dial in you time how long it takes to pull a given liquid volume and make adjustments to grind size to change that timing your goal is to produce a double espresso in 20 to 30 seconds from first drip from the portafilter spouts now I'm gonna keep it simple in this video if you're an old hat at espresso you know things can get a lot more involved in simply timing shots for those new to making espresso this basic technique it's gonna get you in the ballpark and then you can make refinements from there before your start make sure your machine is fully warmed up with the Porta filter locked in place so it seated as well depending on machine type warm up can take anywhere from ten to thirty minutes you'll also want a good holding coffee now any coffee can be used to make espresso but if you're new and learning it helps to use a coffee that is known to make a good crema rich espresso three of my favorites Lavazza super crema Marella's or fiha and coffee mio officio all three are very easy to work with they're Italian style bean blends which produce crema rich shots when the grind is right the Lavazza and Marella's are roasted in Italy and when stored properly they hold up really well the coffee mio is a 100% Arabica blend that's grown organically it's roasted in Australia and then air shipped to us on a regular basis so it's very fresh assuming you're working with a capable coffee the key to making good espresso is control of variables as you pull a number of shots and dial into the right grind size you want all other variables to remain the same we only want grind size adjustments to affect the extraction so when dialing in you've got to be consistent with the other main variables which are dosing wait tamp and brew temperature your goal when dialing in again it's to produce a two ounce that's about sixty milliliter espresso in twenty to thirty seconds from first drip from the portafilter spouts four and this will grind size adjust your grinder to produce a coffee particle size that looks and feels like it's just a hair finer than granulated sugar so run your grinder for a few seconds get those fingers in there feel the grinds and make adjustments and repeat as needed to get that slightly finer than granulated sugar consistency now depending on your grinder there may be some grind retention so as you make adjustments the first grinds that come out may be at the old grind size so after an adjustment run the grinder for a few seconds to flush out the old grinds before you judge the effect of your grind size changes for weight of coffee dose I'm gonna suggest you 16 to 18 grams that's a typical dose range for a double espresso y doubles and not single as well doubles are really just a whole lot easier to pull as you fill the filter basket you want a nice even distribution of ground coffee I'm using a Giotto EFI feed grinder which does a good job of distributing the grounds now if you don't have a scale no problem just over feel slightly and use your fingers to level the ground coffee in your filter basket be careful not to press down as you level just loosely overfill a bit and gently swipe off excess ground coffee to make it level with the top of the filter basket with most double shot filter baskets feeling like this should result in a 16 to 18 gram dose and if you use the same fill and level technique each time that consistency again you should be within half a gram or so of dosing weight shot to shop use a quality tamper to compress the ground coffee in the filter basket the most important thing when tamping is to produce a smooth and level surface actual tamping pressure is not really all that critical you can use a light tap or a hard tamp what is critical is using a similar sir each time you tap you want your tamping pressure again you want it to be consistent I'm using an S Pro calibrated tamper it gives a little when tamping so it's easy to get that consistency shot to shop place your tamper gently onto the coffee then press down evenly you want all edges of the tamper to remain parallel to the edges of the filter basket as you compress the coffee my personal technique is to tamp firmly then spin the tamper lightly to polish the surface tamp firmly again and polish the surface again after tamping have a look at the surface of the coffee if it's lower on one side the tamp is uneven and it's gonna leave an area where brew water can run through the coffee faster that uneven tamp can cause channeling and throw off the timing of an extraction if you end up with the tamp that looks like this you need to discard that coffee and try again now before you attach the Porta filter in start and extraction you may need to flush a bit of brew water this is commonly required in many single and heat exchange boiler machines to get rid of an initial shot of overheated brew water flushing requirements are gonna vary by machine type and for some like the more expensive PID machines you do not have to flush I'm using a profit tech Pro 500 it's our most popular heat exchange machine and is one that does best with a short flush before brewing not sure if you should flush well let me know in those comments what machine you are using and I can give you some advice a clear indication you do need to flush is if your machine puts out steam or turbulent water flow when put into brew mode without a Porta filter attached if you're unsure about flushing just go ahead and do one it'll clean any residual coffee from the shower screen just turn on till brew until there's no steam and the water flow is smooth this shouldn't take more than a few seconds with your portafilter loaded and the machine ready let's pull a shot again we want about two ounces of espresso in 20 to 30 seconds from first strip I'm using a rattle wire shot pitcher to measure volume and timing with on my smartphone I start the timing with the first drip and as you can see it's coming really fast I'll have two ounces way faster than twenty seconds so I'm gonna need to adjust my grind finer so I turn my grind setting to finer and try again now I'm not really sure how much finer I should set it so I make a gas and turn the adjustment this far here's the next shot with that adjustment looks like I made the grind to fine this time I'm barely getting any drip at all no way I'll have two ounces in under 30 seconds so I just the grind about halfway back toward the coarser setting I started with clear out any residual grinds fill the Porta filter level tamp and try again this shot is still on the slow side I'm at 30 seconds and still under two ounces so one more grind adjustment just a notch or so further toward the core setting and here's the end of the shot after the grind size change now that's what we're looking for with two ounces coming in the twenty to thirty second range now it's not unusual for dialing in the grind size to take a few shots so I'll be ready to use some coffee a few tips first be consistent use the same coffee dose weight and tamping pressure for each shot as you dial in it takes some judgment to determine how much adjustment you should make each time but as you zero in make smaller adjustments a couple other things to be aware of first as beans age or if you change the coffee you are using you will likely need to tweak your grind size a bit a grind setting that works for one coffee doesn't necessarily work for another if you have any questions about dialing and grind size or anything coffee use those comments and I'll be sure to get to the answers I'm mark thanks for watching and I hope you'll subscribe and come back soon for more of the best on everything coffee brought to you by

[Music] hi i'm joel from RTC coffee roasters and I'm Luca modesta coffee roasters today we're gonna answer some questions around ageing of coffee one big question that we get all the time is is fresh best look I would have to say fresh is not best to serve your customers coffee why is that okay so when we roast essentially we're going to change the actual structure of a bean and in that process we're gonna get a lot of carbon dioxide and it's actually gonna be really gassy very volatile and give a really light citrusy style flavor in the cup so what sort of Ages are we looking to start using coffee okay so guys so naturally that actual coffee will let that gas come out through the one-way valve at about 14 days as a wholesaler how do I manage that on a week-to-week basis it's always best to be prepare ahead if you can have some stock sitting underneath out the back wherever you need to and have that planned out at least two weeks in advance you're gonna have a much better cup of coffee great and so with the bags how do I know the age of the coffee sure so the easiest way to look that down every bag has a batch tape and a manufacture date on there so off the top left hand

backyard I'll show you how to roast your own coffee beans at home using an old-fashioned stovetop popcorn maker nailed it I think it's good enough what you'll need is a worthy pop stove top popcorn popper Wow so that 5 times fast a gas or electric burner to use outside unroasted green coffee beans a thermometer this is optional a baking sheet for cooling and an airtight container for storage air pair tert air popcorn Whirley Pop popcorn popper okay first we're going to preheat the whirly pop until it reaches about 400 degrees Fahrenheit 204 degrees Celsius if you don't have a thermometer just preheat it for about 5 to 10 minutes next we're going to add one cup of unroasted green coffee beans to the whirly pop and start cranking the handle to keep the beans moving now it's time to roast and there are 10 stages of coffee roasting the first stage is called the green stage the first few minutes the bean will remain a greenish color the second stage is called the yellow stage and the bean turns a lighter yellowish color and it mitts a grassy smell next is called the same stage in which the bean starts to steam as their internal water contents start to dissipate next is the first crack this is an audible cracking sound where the real roast starts to begin the sugars begin to caramelize and it actually sounds a lot like popcorn right after the first crack is called the city row stage and this is where the Rose can be considered complete at any time according to your taste next is the City Plus roasts where carmelization continues oils migrate and the bean expands in size this would be a good place to end the roast after that is the full City roast when you are on the verge of what it's called the second crack now after that is the second crack at which point it sounds a lot like popcorn but more intense a few pops into the second crack and you get a full City Plus roasts next is the dark roast as the roast becomes very dark the smoke is more pungent and the sugars burn completely and then finally you hit the burn stage the burn stage is when the sugar is completely burned and the roast will taste like charcoal do not enter the burn stage once you've reached your desired roast quickly remove from the heat and spread the hot beans on the baking sheet to cool down fast shake the sheet to help cool the beans down faster being outside should help and then finally we're going to store the beans once you have the beans cooled down store them in an airtight container like a mason jar now if you roast it your beans really dark I would wait about 12 hours before storing the beans so that they can gas off so that's all you need the equipment is actually pretty cheap and you can roast your own coffee beans at home and within 15 to 20 minutes you could be grinding that coffee and drinking it for yourself and it's a very gratifying feeling so if you have any questions please go to rose tea coffee calm until then enjoy enjoy", "YV0YeY36dHQ": "so my name is Zach if you haven't caught that yet I work for echo Asia impact Center in Chiang Mai I work with echo but I also have a second job where I work for the top of the coffee company that trained me they have a farmer network that I manage as well as helping run training classes for them that's called torch coffee so this is to give you an understanding for how Arabica coffee is evaluated and graded so why do we grade green coffee a lot of times the purchase contract is set according to the grade especially in specialty coffee the Specialty Coffee Association of America specifies that specialty coffee is any coffee that is green graded without defect and cups tasted and given a score of 80 points or more we'll talk about that 80 points and what that 80 points means but there's a way of tasting coffee giving it a point and SAA says anything 80 or above is specialty coffee and when it comes to specialty coffee that this a lot of times is defined in the actual purchasing contract if you're signing international purchasing contract this will most likely be stated in the Contra defect count being size standard there's different industry standards across the world but there are some that are used more internationally like the Q grading system quality grading system we'll get to the actual defect and look at them that's way more important quality control you want to make sure we grade coffee because when people are buying coffee internationally they want to be sent a sample of your coffee before it's shipped they want to be able to grade it and then when they receive the shipment they want to be able to take a sample grade it and the grades need to match if they're not matching then they're thinking maybe somebody's trying to rip them off or mix their coffee with corn or you know whatever it is that people do the sca a standard is pretty internationally recognized and the Q grading system actually uses the SCA a standard as it's protocol the Q grading system is run by the coffee quality Institute and is used all over the world that's the most internationally recognized but regionally they will have their own standards as well especially coffee Association of America yes yes there's - there's many coffee associations in the world the Specialty Coffee Association of America is very large in much bigger than America and the second biggest would be the excuse me to Specialty Coffee Association of Europe however about two or three months ago these two associations voted to merge and are going through a merging process and they will become the dominant coffee leaders internationally when that happens all the rest of them are quite small and don't have much impact outside of their home countries premiums earns for high quality meaning people are willing to pay more money for specialty coffee so if we grade coffee and we can prove by grading that it's specialty we can get more money for the coffee there's 16 different types of defects within green coffee six primary defect and ten secondary defect so specialty washed coffee is no primary defects and up to five secondary the specific details of primary and secondary may seem like oh well that's the sca a standard and if I'm not going to worry about the sca a standard that shouldn't matter but the NCAA made these primary and secondary defects based on how they impact the cup so the primary defects will have a more serious impact on the flavor of the cup than the secondary defects and according to the SBA you can have zero primary defects in order for it to be specialty coffee in 350 grams of cost so the primary defects are full black full sour dried cherry pod fungus damage severe insect damage or foreign matter so the Specialty Coffee Association of America is saying if they take a sample of 350 and they find one little stone it's not specialty coffee that might be a shocker to a lot of people in Asia we're finding a stone is pretty common in your coffee the secondary defects have different skills that they're rated on so like a partial black is three to one so they say specialty coffee can have up to five secondary defects but it takes three partial blacks to make one defect and it takes ten slight insect damage to make one defect so essentially you could have 50 being of slight insect damage in 350 or 49 rather you could have 49 coffee beans with slight insect damage and it still be specialty coffee because slight insect damage just does not impact the cup nears but as bad as severe insect damage by the time it's severe insect damage to be is completely destroyed all the flavors are gone and just organic material and nothing else so the wash process was developed as a strategy to get rid of these defects wash office is where it goes through a mechanical process of being stripped of the cherry fermented in water and washed process one of the strategic things about the wash process is at different stages it's immersed in water and these defects because the bean is is not in its entirety healthy they'll float for the most part and when they float to the top you can sift the coffee off meaning at the end of the day the coffee that you produce has less defects in it has a cleaner cup that's why the wash process was even developed to begin with but it took a lot more money and an investment in order to be able to do it but the product at the end of the day was a much cleaner cup flat things like black bean and sour bean come from harvesting practices when coffee cherries are left on the tree way too long they're not harvested when they're right and they get moldy or frumenty can cause a black bean or sour bean also the partial black the partial sour if one of these ends up in a cup of coffee you will want to spit the coffee out it's it's really really bad fungus damage happens mostly from coffee cherries that are picked off the ground it can also let from chairs the same as black and sour it can be from cherries that are left but mostly coming from cherries that are picked off the ground foreign matter is very straightforward it's if the coffees not sorted properly since they're just owner if it ends up with sticks cherry pods rock things like this depending on what a rocks not going to impact the flavor of the coffee but it will break your grinder so it's a pretty serious it's a pretty serious defect and and coffee buyers coffee buyers that buy big quantities if they if they get a sample and there's a rock in it they're going to walk away from the purchase broken chips cut this mostly comes from two different places within the processing if it's going through the pulper and the pulper is not caliber calibrated properly we'll talk about that when we look at the pulp or downstairs but your your your pulp er needs to be calibrated so that the screen size and the drum size match the actual size of your coffee and are pushing out they're not squeak causing too much damage to happen to the coffee bean they're not too tight they're also not too loose that just allows everything to go through it but the primary cause of this is from going through your DRI mill when it's not your coffee is not properly dried so if you haven't properly dried your coffee to ten to twelve percent and you send it through the parchment puller then you're going to get a lot of broken or chipped this is a secondary defect but it can if there's enough of these in your coffee it can it can taste like old coffee it can taste woody and not have the natural flavors of acidic bright flavors that your coffee should have in mature beans you get a lot of immature beans if your coffee was overloaded with way too many cherries or your coffees not properly being fertilized the way it should be you'll get a lot of beans that look the cherries look fine and they look right but inside the bean is not fully developed you can notice this because these edges here you don't really see it they're very sharp so if you look at a coffee bean it has a normally coffee as kind of a rounded on the flat side here it should be more rounded going around to the back but this will actually sink in a little bit and that edge there will be a sharp edge and that will mean that the coffee bean is immature and that also can give very astringent flavors to your coffee cup and that's why it is considered a secondary defect but these float really easy that's why when you wash wash your coffee they'll float to the top this is a good time to maybe mention as well it's very common practice to to when picking coffee to not worry as much about just to get within a certain range of ripeness and so it's very common with in Thai coffees to have a range of ripe to just beginning to get ripe and because of that there's a lot of astringent flavors and coffees so I know a lot of coffee buyers in town that say this is very common and so they aged their coffee to get rid of that astringent see but essentially they're getting old coffee they're making old coffee because when coffee gets old it will no longer have that astringent flavor but it will start to lose some of its natural good qualities and become more of a flat woody type Coffee straw like coffee I mean obviously you can't say that for every farm in Thailand but it's common practice with a lot of people that I've talked to withered you'll find this an insect damage if there is just two or one hole in the bean you will call that slight insect damage but if it has three or more holes in the bean then it's going to be severe insect damage and when it's severe insect damage it won't just mow the time it won't just be severe insect damage it will have started to go moldy or or black because the the insect damage was so bad that the beam is just susceptible to microbial growth and it will not look that clean so here's a good example you can - this is quite dark and black in here and and just for fun I highly recommend anybody working on the farm that comes in contact with stuff like this - save - always save a bag of different defects and that way to show the people that you're working with or maybe your harvesters what it looks like and you can't even roast these and serve a cup of of coffee only made from this and you it's a great teaching tool when somebody drinks a coffee that's only made from this they'll want to spit out what you hope they want to spit it out if they don't want to sit it out then maybe there's a new market you haven't discovered yet so parchment so it means it hasn't been milled properly shale has anybody ever experienced finding a piece of parchment in their coffee and do you know why this is dangerous this doesn't affect the cup actually if it actually makes it into the cup it can taste papery but the chances of it ending up in the cup are very very unlikely because it gets burned up in the roaster and it can start a fire in your roaster so 10 to 12 percent is the sweet spot for coffee for storage for longevity if you drop below 8% really but can say 10% but really 8% is like the very bottom line if you drop below that the embryo inside the coffee seed will die and when that dies that embryo is keeping the enzymes and the things in the coffee is keeping it alive and keeping all the flavor molecules intact if that embryo dies then the coffee seed dies and you lose all of that your coffee becomes old and you lose the flavor if you go above 12 percent then your embryo wants to be active and it wants to eat up all the sugars and everything and destroy your coffee seed that way so if it's too moist service to dry your coffee seed is going to be destroyed and not last were you asking a question people determine that a moisture eater when you process coffee you should have a goal of taking your coffee and slowly reducing the moisture content until it reaches 12 10 to 12 percent and then you want to keep it there until you roast if at any time before you roast your coffee is exposed to humidity or the elements and it raises in moisture it will activate the embryo and break down your coffee seed and your coffee seed will become old very fast when you roast it you're roasting all of the moisture out of it so you're taking it to 0% moisture when you roast it and then after you roast it you also don't want to add moisture to it until you're ready to drink it proper storage is essential to maintaining value of your crop you want you want you want to store it if you if it's not being stored properly you're going to lose a lot of money if if it's done well coffee can last up to 12 months yeah that the grain grain Pro is the kind of international standard for shipping coffee internationally if you buy if you ship coffee internationally the purchaser wants to see that coffee and like something like grain Pro are you familiar with grain Pro essentially it's a really big ziploc bag and but it's a name-brand they can be expensive you get knockoffs in Thailand so it all just depends on where your coffee is going having a roof that doesn't leak and having a way to get the coffee off the ground is paramount airtight is really important I mean different countries have different standards for export the big problem with it is if you use like the Hessian type bags or even like the normal grain bags and you have plastic inside and people that are transporting this don't know it a lot of times we use hooks to move it and if they don't know there's like a really good grain Pro bag inside they'll rip it open so sometimes if you do have an outer bag like that you have to mark on it ya know no hooks or whatever the hotter it is the drier it needs to be the colder it is you can't allow some humidity because it it contracts together so so the hotter it is the drier it needs to be if it's really hot and really humid like Indonesia that's probably the worst like place to store coffee and I would think something like grain Pro or plastic bags would be critical in a place like that in Thailand I'm not sure what you guys use plastic but a lot of the guys that are up in Chiang Rai just use the normal grain sack the same ones you put corn maize or corn into but they'll make sure it's never exposed to rain directly it'll be in big sheds or barns or something and those bags are reusable or can be a lot of times included in if you're selling a contract of coffee can be included in the in the contract and people there is not enough specialty coffee in the world today to meet the need of specialty coffee so if you're providing a quality product people are willing to pay the extra for bags and things like that when you grade the green you're supposed to take note of the color but it's not necessarily graded on the color but the color could tell you the moisture content beam density age processing method exposure to sunlight so generally your your your deep darker colors blue green is desirable your faded light colors are undesirable you want to smell green coffee I've smelt green coffee that smelled like diesel sometimes if they're transported in these potato sack cloth bags on a truck then also transported diesel that will get into your coffee and it will affect the flavor of your coffee non-food grade jute bags proximity to fumes or smoke petrol improper drying storage so here's an example of mildew improper drying of naturals this is really built mildew is really really bad for you and when importing into the United States the US Department of Agriculture does not want to see any mildew aren't coming into any ship exceptionally high moisture risk and mildew mildew or mold so if you're looking at a specific variety of coffee like let's say you have a bag of coffee and it's all coming from the same variety same farm and you have different bean sizes the smaller beans will be more dense than the larger bean but if those are coming from two different varieties that are mixed in the same bag it doesn't necessarily mean that the small beans are more dense but it will impact there's one other thing that has a big impact on coffee when it comes to bean size does anybody know what that is roasting roast uniformity buyers that are that are buying in big quantities and doing a lot of production on a roasting a lot would desire to have a more uniform being size when they buy their coffee because if they don't they're going to have to sort it out themselves according to bean size because two different sized beans roasting and the roaster at the same time will roast to two different roast profiles and is extremely difficult to control your roast that way it is true that there is hot there is greater potential for the coffee at a higher elevation is less susceptible to disease and insects there's cooler nighttime temperatures you guys understand like the coffee belts so here's the equator and coffee is basically from like 20 degrees to 20 degrees coffee is generally growing here so coffee wants to have cool nighttime temperatures because when it's cool at the nighttime is when it can turn the sugars into acids and create the unique nice flavors it also slows down the growth of the bean and makes a more denser bean which is proven to give more complex flavors in coffee so with that being said the hottest temperatures are here the hottest temperatures are here along the equator so in order to achieve that they have to have be at the highest altitude but the further away from the equator you get you can be at lower altitude but you also can't freeze so there's a point of which you're coming this way so when it starts to freeze and that's where you can no longer grow coffee Thailand used to be the edge of that Thailand and southern China but they're finding in the last 10 to 20 years that coffee is growing much much better in these areas than they have historically with with temperature temperature change global warming that sort of thing so ultimately higher elevation is better up until the point where you're too high and then everything freezes but your need for Heights and elevation in nighttime temperatures depends on where you are on the you don't want to defrost yeah you want it to be warm enough and sunny enough in the day for the plant to get the Sun it needs to photosynthesize if the acids are where your flavor is the acidity is where your flavor molecules are stored and what gives your coffee its flavor sorry that's one aspect of the flavor acidity coffees with higher acidity would generally be noted as having better flavor than coffees with low acidity brighter the other place that it gets flavor from is the carbohydrates sugars in the roasting process there's there's a there's a Maillard process of which the the sugars start to die off similar to decay that starts to give you some sweeter flavors and then when they hit carmelization and the sugars start to cook that will give you flavors as well so you get acidic flavors and then you get your like your sweet sugary flavors in coffee the acidic flavors are more enzyme attic volatile by nature destroyed in a darker roast found more and a lighter roast and will be more floral or vegetable E or something of that nature her believe and coffees that have this characteristic for the most part are graded as good yes there's such a thing as bad acidity there's an astringent C that comes from picking unripe beans or you know improperly harvested coffee will add a sharp sourness that is negative but that's different where that's not talking about the same thing as acidity that is found in coffee that might not be your favorite flavor and coffee but if it has it it means it's a well developed comp all right thank

on all my characters and tumblr users its RF Mike and tonight we're gonna kind of go over a something I want to try with coffee as in grounds or whole bean itself so first off me set my camera down here first off I actually have some coffee here hand over down to it we have some some entre organic this is a Sam's choice this is ASA Matra coffee and the reason why I wanted to talk about this whether you're somebody that uses a pot and you're boiling water you're doing fresh pour over grounds you're doing a craft for like a French press like I have back there or whether even if you're doing your own grounds like we have here inside a k-cup if we're doing our own grounds to put inside a reusable cup when it comes to your coffee you definitely want to keep your grounds themselves whether it's whole bean or already ground like fine or medium ground you want to keep it properly sealed and contained and when it comes to your bag you get it in example my Starbucks bag here obviously I've chopped down I put inside a ziploc bag to help keep it only one place and hopefully keep some aroma but I even sucked out the air out of this by hand and that obviously wasn't enough cuz you can see this is not flat at all or it looks like it's been air sealed so bags like this don't work you're losing your flavor and same thing you've gone with clips try doing clips on a bag yeah you might not be keeping much of your flavor in your beans coffee beans might dry out more so if you ever read the back of your bags or a can if you get it in a can I just picked this one up just because I haven't gone to Costco lately to get a big bag of coffee because that's normally how we buy ours and it lasts us longer but if you never bothered to read the back side of a can here storage instructions for best results store coffee and an airtight container in a cold dark cool dark place so obviously this container would work but when we're doing with the bags like I showed you that's not a good idea so one thing I picked up that I want to give a try because I've seen these in use for food but you could use them for storing your grounds are these type of containers here me never camera around so this container we have here is a vacuum insulated stainless steel food jar and this is one that I had actually picked up at Walmart and says Walmart calm this is their own brand this would basically be like a thermos that you would keep for putting your your food in for when you give kids some to eat for lunch or if you're gonna pack something hot and you want to stay warm container like this would work great and this is a vacuum insulated stainless steel double wall as it says double wall technology keeps food hot or cold for hours widemouth opening durable 18 by 10 food ste food grade stainless steel bpa-free and wash only with this one it says on here keeps food cold for 10 hours keeps food hot for 5 hours and this is wet and everything because I had actually already started washing this out but it is a nice rubber gasket sealed lid which is what you want for your coffee grounds and on the inside here we can see it is a nice very wide mouth so it is a good thing so I'm gonna give this a try actually for holding my grounds so I'm get all this wiped out and use it but just as an idea this is something even if you're using ground coffee this is something new you guys might want to give a try to help keep your if you really want to keep your flavor of your coffee this might be something to really think about so I'll include the link in the video description of where I found this one I don't know if yet he makes one I didn't have a chance to look it up and see if Yeti makes their own and I know Arctic actually does too so I am hoping to get an Arctic version as well so if you guys have any comments or questions about anything coffee related please let me know I am gonna go and get more Keurig type of pods some cured coffees because I know I've had people asking and saying hey get back into doing Keurig coffee as well I found a couple of different companies I want to check out for Keurig coffee I might even order some solid whole bean by Green Mountain or a couple other companies let me know what you guys found that's a good dark roast flavor that's something my wife and myself like there's some dark roast when I get strong especially if we're gonna do a cold brew so cold brew that's the other thing too you guys know I'm doing into cold brew as well so yeah this is the coffee related video if you have any comments or questions hit me up in the comment section down below like comment subscribe and I will see you all in the next one have a great night", "Ay0ei5Pz7Mo": "hey it's press lovers mark and aj here from whole latte love aj we're going to take a look at some new coffees from carrara we have italian bean blends we did a lot of tasting yesterday and what what happened to us yesterday right yeah so we tried all of these and i was definitely feeling it by the end but it was it was good to really take tasting notes and kind of get to experience each of these and we're going to share that with you that's right so i mean some new interesting coffees to try really cool one here that we'll get to in a minute um that really really surprised us a lot and is really worth a try but tell us how we did our tasting we got some stuff up here that we used yeah so we just went down the line and we were we're grinding everything on the chiato e37 sd single dose grinder so we could try each one individually without the impact of old grounds in the chamber uh really isolate the flavors of each one pull a shot 18 grams in a one to two brew ratio 36 grams out on the rocket chin guantanado arch and cuanto right and and when we uh as we're talking about these coffees we'll get a visual look at them right so you can see how they pull now visual isn't everything right so we have some that are really prolific crema producers some not so much but that doesn't mean everything right yeah as long as it tastes good that's what matters i mean it'll look great either way but it's if it tastes good that's that's what you want okay so in basics cararo um we're carrying all these coffees they've been roasting in italy since uh 1927. these are all blends all of them have some robusta in the mix which is pretty typical with that style of coffee um and again really one you gotta try here but we'll get to that so we'll start off over here this is the safe choice right the crema espresso um it's what you're gonna get in a typical blend right yeah i mean for me the crema espresso is the beginner's espresso it's if i was new to espresso or maybe didn't know if i liked it or what i liked i would start there it's the safe choice that's not gonna be too overpowering in any aspects of the taste it has a nice persistent crema i'm looking at some of my notes you know it's got the typical chocolaty stuff that you get in these sorts of coffees um smooth it wasn't mild you know it doesn't bang you over the head with anything it's just really nice and it's going to do well in milk right yep yep totally it's it's not too strong but it those those flavors will come through if you're putting in a latte or something like that so yeah really nice body and that persistent crema very easy to work with that style of coffee so moving on tell us about the uh global verde so we kind of do the italian flag thing here right yeah yeah the green red and uh green white and red yeah we have three globo varieties here so the globo verde is a 50 50 blind of a rabbit coat a robusta beans from africa central america and south america this one definitely had a more robust darker taste to it there was definitely some smoky chocolatey kind of aftertaste that lingered on on this one yeah it is persistent and it says right on the bag it does have a very persistent aftertaste and you know some people really like that a lot um i got a little spice out of that one as well so it was very interesting coffee um so let's go on to the white the uh the white globo here the globo elite um this one you know it was it's it's a more refined flavor i guess there's a good way of putting it i found it you know in comparison to something like the creme espresso a very safe choice over here you know this one's going to be a little bit brighter it's got some probably some more higher altitude uh uh you know other uh arabica coffees in there um that are featured more than the robusto in there yep to me it was a little step up from the crema espresso a little bit it's still somewhat soft but a little bit more pronounced in all the flavors a little bit more pronounced in the acidity uh but but very enjoyable and pretty well balanced throughout so now that the one you've been waiting for the one that we were so surprised by tell us about that so this is the globo rosso and it's a 30 to 70 percent arabic to robusta so when we read that before we tasted it i i wasn't expecting what i got out of it right um and so i took my first sip and it was it was i love what you said yeah it took me for a roller coaster ride really it i took my first step and it was it was a little bright a little sweet and then within seconds it i just went the other way and it got dark and and chocolatey and malty and smoky and it was great of all five it definitely was the most complex to me from beginning to end it was again really really interesting coffee if you haven't tried you know a heavy robusta blend this one this one just sticks out more than any i've had in a couple years i mean it's just it is very interesting and complex totally not what you would expect and you know if you're drinking like you know super single origin really light roasts and stuff you know that's a certain style and this is this is a different style and robusta used to get kind of a bad rap but they have improved so much and now they can be a really really interesting part of a bean blend like this and really it is one of the most interesting i've tried in a couple years i really like it a lot yeah i thought this one was the richest and again the most complex if i were to make a milk-based drink with any of these i would probably try that one first because it the those flavors will really shine through in a latter cappuccino yeah it would really go well with milk i mean you'd expect with that level of a booster it's going to be incredibly bitter it wasn't at all it just had just the right note to really work well with milk and i like it as a straight espresso and if you like the crema you know creme espresso or this one those are the choices these are going to look beautiful and really interesting flavors so last up we have the tatsadoro right um this tell us what you thought about that one so this was actually my favorite of all of them um it's a 90 to 10 uh rapid cutter robusta blend and it it was by far the brightest and the lightest and the fruitiest of all of them which really suits my taste references and i you've been drinking this almost daily for maybe a month or so now right tell us what you're doing with that yeah so at first i was having it just as straight espresso to kind of realize the flavor profiles and what i liked about her disliked about it and then i just started making americanos with it and i've been drinking an americano with the tatsadoro every morning for the last few weeks and i'm going to keep doing that because i love it and what so what is i mean it has a little fruitiness in the middle right is that yeah and i that must come through really nice in an americano and i'm guessing that's why you went there it's just it's got some more complex flavors right yeah absolutely and it's bright and sweet but not not too sour and not too acidic and it's very well-rounded in that um and we're going to be having a video coming out soon about americanos anyway so stay tuned for that because we'll get all into that in a little more depth it is it is a really great way to enjoy espresso you know if you like a larger cup you know if you just don't want to do a shot you want to really explore the flavors for a little bit longer than you know you could with an espresso it's a great way to do it we will be doing that so just wrap up that's the range of the carraros here again if you want to start someplace maybe here if you want to do a sample again this this this really impressed us i mean it's a really really interesting coffee definitely worth a try but all of them have their unique little characteristics and you know hopefully gave you an idea of maybe something that you would like right yeah and these three the globos in the middle we do sell these three as a sampler pack so if you want to try all three you can get them together find out which one works best for you and then keep going forward on that path in the future and that's the best thing you know we get so wrapped up i know i have my favorite coffees and people might know what they are but i get so wrapped up in those and sometimes you know you got to take a step out and just try something a little bit different right yep totally all right guys thanks for watching i'm mark and aj here from a whole lot they love you know if you like this stuff do subscribe to the channel and be sure and come on back soon for more of the best on everything coffee brought to you by whole latte love", "YIKr2EMkm48": "My name is Mike Jones, and I'm a barista at\nThird Rail Coffee right by Washington Square Park in New York City. I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making\nskills. I'm going to show you how to make a French\npress. First there's a few things you're going to\nneed. You're going to need some fresh coffee, preferably\nwhole bean in which case you'll also need a grinder. You'll need a timer and then you'll also need\nthe French press. So the first thing you're going to do is weigh\nout the beans. I like to use 25 grams of coffee for this\nsize French press. Now if you don't have a scale, you can also\njust do three rounded scoops. So you can go ahead and grind this coffee. So this is ground medium coarse. You can play around with the grind setting\nafter making it a couple of times. If it's tasting too bitter and too strong,\nyou might be using a little bit too fine of a grind. And if it's a little bit watery and weak,\nthen it might be too coarse. So you take the French press, and you're going\nto want to preheat it. You can either take water off a boil, have\na nice water tower here. Then you let that sit for a while so it gets\nup to heat. Alright, so after the French press is preheated,\nyou want to dry it out then add the grounds. Now again, I definitely recommend getting\na scale, it just makes brewing coffee easier. But if you don't have one, you just want to\nuse about 12 and a half ounces of water for this size. So I'm going to go ahead and add the water\nto the French press. The first amount I'm going to add is just\nenough to soak the grounds at the bottom of the press. So adding that in... so just that much water\nthere. And then just stir it around to incorporate\nall the grounds with the water and start the timer. And you actually just let that sit there for\n30 seconds. I would also recommend covering it when you're\nnot doing anything to keep the heat intact. Alright, after 30 seconds you're going to\nadd the rest of the water. Now this is either 12 and a half ounces or\n400 grams of water. Once you've added all of that, just give it\nanother gentle stir. And you put the plunger on and then you're\ngoing to let that sit until 3 and a half minutes. So after 3 and a half minutes you're going\nto press the plunger down. And this is another way you can tell if you've\nground too coarse or too fine. If it goes without any resistance, it's going\nto be too coarse. And then if you have a really difficult time\npressing down it's going to be too fine. Then I recommend decanting the French press\nbefore serving, because if you leave it sitting there it will actually keep extracting and\nend up tasting bitter. So once you've done that, you can just let\nit cool down and it's ready to serve.", "uClcYKn-zAs": "hello friends welcome again in my video tutorial how to brew coffee at home for home baristas uh today i will work with quite old coffee beans and they are about six weeks after a roasting date older coffee beans they don't have worse taste than these fresh coffee beans but they have probably aroma and it's much more low aroma of coffee beans mainly if you open it back and you'll see many of times open close up and close so this gas and all the crafted with coffee beans when the sitting in back are gone and aromatics part of flavors as well so i will try a little bit in upgrades this aroma with this that i'm beginning for the bloom if i can call i will just wet coffee grinds with water don't add too much water over this coffee grinds because i wonder that this gas will get out that i don't kill bit too much about this gas and after i will continue after a small stop i will continue of brewing with approx 50 available regularly and at rest 40 percent i will just pour a bit some kind of like um drops to middle uh to extract more of this copy guys but it can be sitting on the side of paper filter so now i will focus on my coffee and i will come back to on the end [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] so my coffee it's now ready before i will enjoy anyway it's good to wait for this three minutes so it will finish and stop down this extraction after it's the best circuit this coffee in a cup and after subs two cups or to one cup depending on how many of you and what i want to say if you want a little bit better armor and other coffee means another one way how you can little bit okay that will grind more fine after uh you will get faster out of this grass and easier from coffee grinds at the moment time so thanks again for watching my video and i hope see you soon and enjoy copying you", "ipB6P1uzNYM": "- [Narrator] That is real coffee, as delicious as the best cup of coffee, you've ever had brewed. - Today, we're gonna talk about\nratios for coffee brewing. How much coffee should I\nuse to brew a cup of coffee in terms of filter coffee? Now I'm gonna talk about this\nin three separate stages. I'm gonna talk about\nwhy I'm gonna recommend a certain type of ratios of using grams per liter, and then I'm gonna talk\nabout kinda finding your ideal ratio. And finally I'm gonna talk about why I might recommend a different ratio for different brewing methods. So first thing, why would I\nrecommend grams per liter? There's a number of different ways people do recipes and ratios. The most common ones still is\nto recommend scoops per cup. There's no international\nstandard for scoops. A scoop can contain about seven grams. It could contain about 10 or 12 grams. Now the problem I have with scoops or cups or tablespoons or teaspoons, or all of that sort of stuff is that they're volumetric measurements. Which means that they'll\nhave massive fluctuations in actual weight depending\non a few different factors. For example, if I were to use, let's say a dark roast,\nmedium ground coffee and I have a perfect level scoop of that, that might weigh around\nseven, seven and a half grams. If I went for a light\nroast finer ground coffee, that might weigh eight,\neight and a half grams, well over 10% more, and\nthat's me being really careful in loading the same volume each time. It's very easy to have small variances in that volume result\nin pretty big variances in the gram weight that you're using. In the day-to-day morning coffee brewing, using scoops will mean that some days your coffee is good\nand some days it's not. Even though you seemingly\ndid the same thing, but volumetric measurements,\nthey're just not very reliable. Then there's the other\ncommonly used ratios of like one to 14, one to 15, one to 16. These break my head, I\ncan't deal with these. They kind of work\ncompletely backwards to me. Those kinds of ratios are pretty useful. If you know how much\nground coffee you have and you wanna work out how\nmuch coffee you can make. That is never a problem\nI have, in the mornings. Usually, I have a desired amount of coffee that I wanna brew and I wanna work out, how much ground coffee I need, you know what weight of\ncoffee I need to start with. So, using a one to 15 ratio. I can't do the maths on that, if I need 500 mL of coffee, I'm not dividing 500 by 15\nfirst thing in the morning. However, if you give me a grams per liter, well, if I'm brewing\nhalf a liter than I need. If at 60 grams a liter,\nthen I need half that, which is 30 that's not, I don't need my phone and\na calculator for that. I can just do a quick little bit of maths. I like it also because typically a cup, an average cup is about 250 mL of brewing or about eight ounces and\nthat scales really nicely. Whether I'm making one or\ntwo or three or four or more, two to the grams per liter ratio. You know I'm using half\na liter, a full liter, three quarters of a liter. The maths is never complicated. And there's one other kind of ratio that deserves a special place in hell. The mixed unit ratio, if you are recommending grams per ounce, get out, get out, go\naway, you do not belong. Just get, that's all. What are you doing? That's the worst thing in the world. Don't, ah, I mean, you know, the Imperial, I have no time for that to begin with, but don't be mixing Imperial\nand metric that is no, stop it. Rant aside. We end up at grams per liter. I think it's a really\nnice, neat way to work. So if it's a 60 grams per\nliter doing the mass with that, that's very, very easy. It's very, very usable. And this leads us into the\nsecond part of this video. What is the right amount of\ncoffee per liter of water? And this is a really important point that becomes a little bit complicated. There is no correct ratio. There is only preference. The ratio of coffee to water you use is really gonna determine\nhow strong the end cup of coffee is, how strong\nyou like your coffee. that's up to you, right? That's, your decision. I shouldn't get a say. I'll give a good starting point, right? Like I think 60 grams per liter is a pretty good one-size-fits-all. Most people are happy with\nthe resulting strength of a good brew, but you\ncan choose 55, 50, 75 that's up to you. But, there's one complicating factor in the world of coffee brewing\nand that is extraction. I'll give a very quick\nprimer on extraction. In ground coffee, about approximately, about a third of it is soluble material. It could be dissolved by water. Two thirds of it pretty much is insoluble. It's cellulose, it's kind of wood. You could steep that coffee,\nbrew their coffee forever. You still have some grounds left over that you would throw away afterwards. You don't want everything that is soluble and available in coffee. You want, broadly speaking, for the sake of easy maths\nin the video to come, about to 20%. Some would prefer a little\nbit more, 22, maybe 23, maybe even more, but let's\nsay for the sake of argument about 20%. If you do a good job\nof brewing your coffee, that will have a nice resulting strength, but if you didn't do a good\njob, brewing that coffee, that 60 grams liter would\nproduce a weaker cup. Let's say, you under extracted it, you ground it to too coarse,\nyou brew too quickly, however it happened, you\nend up with a weak cup. So if you're trying to change your ratio, if you're trying to work\nout your ideal ratio, you only want to change the ratio, once you're really happy with the taste. If you've brewed a cup of coffee and you think that was delicious, I just wish it was a fraction stronger. That's the time to change your ratio. If you brew a cup of coffee and\nyou think that's a bit weak, it's a bit sour, it's\nnot really delicious. Don't change your ratio. Change your extraction. Grind a little finer,\nsteep, a little longer, agitate a little bit more. Those things need to be fixed first before you mess with your ratio. Once you're happy with\ntaste, sure experiment. In my life, I kinda\nwandered around in terms of what I prefer in\nterms of the end strength of my cup of coffee. It's a personal thing. Whatever you like is okay. There is no one answer to this question. This brings us into the\nthird part of this video, which is why I might recommend\nusing a different ratio for different brewing methods. Now you can broadly divide\nall coffee brewing methods into two camps. Percolation and infusion. Now with percolation,\nwater is passing through a bed of coffee. In infusion, all of the\nwater, and all of the coffee are hanging out together\nduring the brew time. A pour-over is percolation. A French press, an AeroPress. Those are infusion methods. Now, I would recommend using\na little bit more coffee for an infusion method than\nI would for a pour-over for a percolation method. I'll explain why. Let's imagine for the sake of argument, we're gonna brew a liter of coffee and we're gonna use 60 grams per liter. That's a good starting point, and in this theoretical brew, we're gonna extract 20%\nof the coffee, right? So it means that of those 60 grams, about 12 grams were dissolved and brought into the liquid coffee. Now when you brew a percolation, when you brew a pour-over, not all of the water that you\npour in, ends up in the brew. Typically, about two grams per\ngram of coffee get absorbed by the ground coffee. That bed still contains\na good amount of water and that water never really got involved in the brewing process. So what you have in the\nresulting brew, is 12 grams of coffee dissolved in round\nabout 880 grams of water. If you take a French press\nand you do the same thing, you brew 60 grams per liter, those 12 grams of solubles\nthat we've extracted, that 20% extraction, that's now dissolved into a thousand grams of water. All a thousand grams we're\ninvolved in the brewing process and those solubles are distributed amongst the whole thing, that\nmakes that brew weaker, even though it's the same extraction. That's why if you want\na similar extraction and a similar strength, I would recommend using more\ncoffee, in my infusions. 70 grams, maybe 75 grams\nper liter of water. If you dive into extraction theory and you start playing the refractometers, you'll notice that the\nsoftware does ask you to specify if it's an\nimmersion or a percolation, because it does affect your\nextraction calculations. But more than that, it really just affects the strength and the taste. So that's why with any infusion brew, any brew where all of\nthe ground is in contact with all of the brew water\nfor a period of time, even if in the case of an AeroPress, you're gonna push that liquid through the bed of coffee at the end. It was still an infusion. Any pour-over I would recommend\nabout 60 grams a liter. Any infusion brew, I'd recommend\nabout 75 grams a liter. I think those are both\ngreat starting points, but they're not the answer. Don't take it as gospel. Find your own way. Find your own preferences. If they are too weak too\nstrong, well change them. Being consistent in how you brew, and that means weighing the\namount of coffee going in and ideally weighing\nthe amount of water too means that you actually\nunderstand what's affecting your morning coffee. You don't have to make decisions, you don't have to guesstimate the amount of water you poured in\nor the amount of coffee you're brewing, especially frankly, before you've had coffee. So, get a set of scales. This is a great starting point. I'd love to hear what\nyou're brewing at home. I'd love also to hear\nmore about your journey. Has this changed for you over time? Have you gone weaker? Have you gone stronger? Are you kinda bouncing\naround all over the place. I'd be really interested\nto hear what you're doing. As always, thank you so much for watching. I hope you have a great day. Dammit.", "-Q--N55f2HE": "hey this is Kevin Carey from coffee crafters we decided we would do another kind of a product review video for you we did one last week on the smaller machine like this and so we've been out there playing with this this morning took us a little bit of time to get used to what it was doing this machine had a couple of challenges one is it's advertised as a 1 to 500 gram machine and we started packaging 12 ounce bags which was 340 grams and that's about all you can get in there because it might hold 500 grams but the way hopper inside of the machine in here 12 ounces is about all you can get in there so that was something we learned another thing we learned I think thanks to Brian Shoop gave me this little tip before we did this was adjusting the gate can you come over here and eat and look on the side of this hopper there's a gate and you slide that thing down farther it helped it weigh out more accurate accurately and the other thing that we found out was also from Brian is that we said it is 340 grams as 12 ounces we said it at a little bit lower a little bit lower because it was coasting past on the fast setting and we found that the slow setting is way too slow the medium setting was too slow so we put it on the fast setting and we have it coming out to one or two grams over 340 carries been checking them on the scales and it's been accurate so far it's accurate enough that you can't tell on the digital scales one thing we found that it did not do well it did not recognize all the different materials so we used these black stand up pouch coffee bags and so I had been using the scoop when we first started trying it out to see how it was going and it was just charging fine discharging fine the photo I would not see this black and so that's why she's got tape across these because we're gonna time doing ten bags when we're done but the photo I did not see the black the photo I also did not see this clear path which is the one I take my coffee home in this 8 by 10 8 mil plastic bag it did not see this either so depending on what you're packaging your coffee in that might be an issue so it did see the silver one yeah I'm going to turn the machine on here carry so this one so right now on the top of here this is where you set it's a little difference of a little machine that we tried last week this machine the top is the weight starts out of zero and it goes up to however many grams you have in there 340 grams is 12 ounces it went just like 2.4 grams over we're just no big deal and on the bottom here this is the bag counter so you can get set that counter at zero and and then you know counting up the number of bags are doing I'm not sure why that's super important but maybe it is I guess anyway so let me show you all go discharge when the silver bag worked fine put up under the phone while they were flying home bye-bye the weight the hopper holds 10 pounds so we roasted 10 pounds put 10 pounds in there which would be actually nine pounds see this clear bag do with the light okay no that was not working so it might have been the shite a light shining through the clear bag that allowed that one to work this time but anyway so as you can see and what I'm gonna do now is we're gonna time doing ten bags so you guys could see how quick it goes it was way too slow doing it on medium and low so we took Brian's advice and we set it a few pounds light I think if I push the thing here on the weight you can see I have it set yeah I have a set it like 300 young most 336 Ram foot three or four grams below 340 and it was coasting past and just about nailing it so oh the price on this machine I think we played 340 dollars with shipping is that one available on Amazon this one was for on sale yeah for sale on Amazon just like the last one we had so Kerry let's go into so what I'm going to do is I'm know we're gonna get started I'm gonna weigh out ten bags we're gonna do a little speed test I'll do the feet and I'm gonna time it on my phone there so this highly scientific test we're gonna see how long it takes to do ten that no on the bags what Kerry had to do for me is all ten bags she had to put a piece of tape across it so the photo I would recognize it so it's definitely something to think about so just say when you're ready okay let's let's turn it on come on is it on let me run went through here real quick and we'll see if it is for charge and then we'll spin the button and we'll see how long it take to do Tim back see how accurately it went on your marks get set ok ready ready go all right ding hole doing whole beans is kind of less messy than later than ground coffee huh I would not do ground copying p.m. you can still take the top off to clean up though right just pick the top off this is not why they do have these machines out there without the latches and the whole topper comes off I would not get one of those too so it would be a mess inside [Music] that's right overtime yeah yeah it's been very very accurate that's definitely the good thing that was a good thing to learn about it compared to the other ones it was still one of the things I didn't think about we got it 1 to 20 gram machine for doing the k-cup pod I didn't think about doing crack packs with the machine so I think we might order the medium-sized one and see if it works on k-cup and frack packs because if it does then you get by one machine to develop ounces and would also be able to see if the middle-sized machine one of them there's close to a frat pack max so there's three sizes there was like 5 water machines see if we can answer that question for you guys so that you don't have to buy the Machine and find out that it doesn't work on take-up them maybe after waiting for the pieces completely stop [Music] it's always one of the concerns with one of these machines from China because oh there we go but that's not the machines fault what I should have had it in there so yeah we dump these beams on the floor just to show you guys work it out yeah one of the things I see concern with this machine is if something doesn't work right are you gonna get the turbines yeah area yeah you might want to clean this up when we're done we'll walk again perfect okay well okay when one said that lives you'll only still okay yeah whatever I said we dozen operate a scale there we go so that was it would have been about three minutes for ten bags right yeah yeah yeah three minutes for ten bags so okay for four time this was definitely not as easy to use as the k-cup machine it took a little bit more to get it dialed in and this gate down inside we still got beans in there so you really can't see it but anyway the gate down inside you have to adjust it up and down the lower is a little bit better it doesn't allow so many to get over at the same time and any gift you can come over here and look down inside of this that's the white hopper the way vessel that the beans go into when this thing fills up with twelve ounces it's all the way up to the rim of the vibrating conveyor if you try to put 16 ounces in there it would be backed way up I don't think it would weigh those accurately so this might be 500 gram machine but I think 12 ounces is probably the maximum coffee I you'd want to put in there so anyway I think I'd probably give it a thumbs up Brian said what he was doing is because if this machine's not going to work well on powder weigh the stuff out if you're doing your 12 ounce bags of ground dump that in your grinder put your bag under it and just use this with something like our scoop here that we use ground coffee or hole being in here put it in the grinder that would probably be a good way to fill up the bags I don't know if that's faster than you guys are doing it by hand but you can kind of extrapolate that so I could do about ten bags and three minutes so it would be easy fill the bag come over here seal it and use a little sealer slap a label on it and you're good to go yeah so it's about 80 bags an hour all right anyway cool all right well that's it for this Friday on a Thursday and we'll see we can do something else we are gonna order with that mid-sized machine test it and see if we can get one that will do k-cups through frack packs in one machine that'll save you some money of not having to get two different machines thanks",

here at that beta ports and I'm going to go ahead and get this started for you to go down in there little company those bees buzzing so check this out really cool how the time look right here you can see that green coffee is you see it turning right there let it heat up and gets hotter and hotter you'll see the beans start to expand that's where the chap comes off once a chest comes off to get sucked back through some piping here down into a hot box that where we get access to the right wall which we check out coffee roasting in action okay so the puppy here is going to assistance they just moving around in a drum first one is the drying stages of the development stage that's when the coffee goes from green to brown [Music] and as you can see here some of that skin is starting to develop and kind of remove itself from the rest to be [Music] starting to pull off there there's McAfee [Music] other things can pick up that crappy knife as we can [Music] all right so here we are the roasted coffee is ready you can keep writing they're going to drop it out you get to see the roasted coffee coming out Maxine so there we go here's the coffee that we all know and love but at this point all the chapters can remove it's back in the hot box and it's going to cool down here for a while and we'll be ready for you to go so back here is where the coffee channel burns up which is to be here vacuum pump get the chat down in there at this point let's take a peek oh yeah there's plenty of chaff in there as you can see we got a handful of chaff right here now this is the stuff that we use this is the ax factor in our product this is the stuff that normally gets chucked out but here it is it's starting a new life bringing it back into the future not send them off to the landfill we're going to make some awesome fertilizer with this and put it back to work coffee ways that work yeah alright here we are we're done grossing the copy everything down machine empty every problem every cup of coffee post-rehab it's not a small coffee shop that child coming Chatham County cows got measles more coffee back up again never-ending process you'll shot back after but here's large and go in there clean this stuff out get the top operatives more escape that coffee chat is going to go to for Mars garden and they have here so they're actually putting to use most conferences out there jumps thirty-four million dollar cotton chest producing less bone as far as we know most of that just gets trash is really don't be a program down here to do it even that's what we're settin in the development for us accomplished at the back to work [Music] alright we're back so here's the setup code we started with the green coffee right little chapped skin on the outside roasted the whole thing up here for most of conference another chap is gone there's the chance so this was originally on there came off there now it's here so this is the starting point for our product it's really where we get excited this is the stuff that winds up in the landfill that broth is the source it's the beginning of everything that gets us excited Java cycle so when we take this you need some some

everything you have to know me so when we're done we can all write stuff together this is our self right here pellet format as you can see got great texture to it bridge structure acts like a sponge sucks up the water slowly really soft it up slowly keeps working that process you know when you're all done get a lot of carbon here carbons but those microbes need microbes need carbon they eat that stuff they live they try they crank so there's a whole bunch of venues that come out of it it all starts with a gigolo coffee being right here and all the stuff that we know up right down to a fertilizer those wonderful things to your garden", "IlFOd5mx8Vo": "we're here showing how you can roast coffee in a hot air popcorn popper so you could buy one at a thrift store or get one at Target for 20 bucks and start roasting your own coffee the best thing about home roasting is you get a selection of the world's best specialty coffees and it's super fresh so with no fancy equipment you can be enjoying any kind of coffee from all around the world the bay area has a great roasting of coffee tradition and sweet Maria's is really happy to be here right by the Port of Oakland so getting shipment right now from Ethiopia Sumatra Rwanda all over the world you know it's so it's cheap to get a piece of you know a piece of equipment to roast but also green beans themselves cost about six or seven dollars a pound so we're specialty coffee sells maybe for 20 bucks a pound or you might pay 10 bucks even for a half pound you can buy a pound a coffee for six bucks and roast it and it's the same quality as any of the other fine coffee places", "tT9xjpSWIf0": "good afternoon everybody if you find yourself ended up with some almost expired coffee beans and there are very lightly roasted you can actually improve this quality again by roasting for about three minutes we will roasting this like heroes the copy beans with popcorn machine power up with a comma to prevent the coffee beans from flying all over the place almost three minutes Oh and be careful the machine is very hot you have to protect your hand with some gloves as soon as these beans cool down you take about half an hour you can actually start to ground them out and make your first cup of coffee and I can show you the quality is much better than before thank you for watching", "bgJ8E6e8rko": "here's another quick tip from whole a tale of markets a question we get all the time something like I've got two brats a virtuoso grinder what setting should I use for press trip and espresso right wouldn't it be really easy and nice if we could just say use a 3/4 espresso 24 drip and 34 press hey coffee lovers mark and Morgan here from whole lot sale of calm today will help you zero in on the proper grind size depending on your brewing method and learn how grind affects flavor and if you're in the market for a new bird grinder use the link up here anytime during this video to see our recommended favorites so even though most burr grinders have some reference numbers for grind size the problem is they don't transfer between grinders so you can't just say if you have grinder X you should set it to so and so for making drip coffee even between the same make and model of grinder calibration can be different or burs might be more worn so those numbers don't transfer and even if they did the grind size that makes what you consider the perfect cup may not be the same for what I consider the perfect cup so the best we can do is visually compare grind sizes and make some basic suggestions about what particle size works for different brew methods now the finest grinding is done for Turkish coffee call it extra fine extremely fine in fact when making Turkish coffee the finer the grind the better it should be almost as fine as baby powder moving up in size for espresso and Moka pots you want to find grind a good starting point is something just a little finer than granulated sugar grind size for espresso is perhaps the most critical of all the brewing methods for espresso tiny changes in grind size make for big changes when pulling shots and that's why espresso lovers are very particular about their grinders moving up in size we're into the medium grinds this is the range for drip coffee and brewing methods like pour over siphon and vacuum brewing now a couple tips for medium grinds first four methods using a filter like drip and pour over use a finer sort of medium grind for cone-shaped filters and a coarser medium grind for flat bottom filters and second you can use grind size to make subtle flavor adjustments so if your cup is a little bitter grinding coarser can help to correct that moving up again we're into a coarse grind used for French press coffee what you're looking for is something close to or maybe a little smaller than a coarse salt for particle size our last grind size is extra coarse it's what you want when making cold brew and it follows a basic principle of grind size which is the longer water is in contact with coffee the course of the grind right and cold brewing coffees in contact with water for 12 hours or more that's opposed to the fine grind used for espresso with a pressurized water contact time of around 30 seconds and a couple of final thoughts on grinds always grind as close to brewing as possible and invest in a quality burr grinder and stay away from those blade grinders right the blade grinders hack up coffee and to randomly sized bits ranging from dust to chunks it's very difficult to get consistent particle sizes that leads to uneven extractions with poor flavor and those yucky muddy yeah we hope this video has helped you out I'm Morgan and I'm mark thanks for watching and we hope to see you back here soon for more on

flavorful cup of coffee you've got to grind the beans right before you brew coffee beans start to lose flavor and aroma within one hour of being ground what's the best way to grind coffee we tested 16 models of coffee grinders to find out now coffee grinders basically come in two styles blade and burr blade grinders work like tiny food processors with a spinning blade that chops coffee into smaller and smaller pieces you hold the button down to grind shake the machine every now and then to redistribute the beans and then stop when the coffee is grounded on the size you want blade grinders are compact and inexpensive burr grinders are a little bit bigger and a little fancier they have three parts a hopper where you feed in the beans the grinding chamber and a removable bin that captures the ground so you can transfer them to the coffee maker now instead of all the dancing you have to do with a blade grinder with a burr grinder you just switch it on and it goes to work whole beans are pulled from the hopper through to gear like metal rings called burrs that spin against one another to crush the coffee kind of like the way a pepper mill grinds peppercorns the setting you choose determines the space between the birds and that changes the size of the grind now burr grinders are the gold standard in the coffee industry we tested ten burr grinders all with at least eight grind settings and they're priced from about thirty to 200 dollars we also tested six blade grinders much cheaper just 15 to 22 dollars now our plan was to find the best grinder of each style and then compare them to see what you really need now whatever the style a good coffee grinder should be able to grind beans to precise sizes the size you want depends on how you plan to brew your coffee now in general coarse Coffee is for French press medium for drip machines and fine for espresso think about how it's going to be exposed to the brew water for fast brewing like espresso you want small particles so the coffee has plenty of surface area to give water fast access for a slow French press style where the coffee sits in the water bigger coarser particles are better now first we tested burr grinders grinding coffee beans to coarse medium and fine sizes and we repeated this with both light roasted beans and very dark roasted beans because they have different densities and we had six testers from novices to coffee experts grind beans and rate the grinders on user friendliness now almost every model was able to grind those sizes the problem was many were confusing or annoying to use if you sprayed coffee everywhere while they ground the beans others had totally cryptic controls or had to be viewed from specific angles to be legible some had grounds containers that were teensy so they quickly overflowed her they were oddly shaped so we made a mess when we were pouring the coffee into the brewer and then there were more problems one with a built in scale it promised to dispense the exact amount of beans we wanted but our lab calibrated scale confirmed that that was inaccurate it missed the target by 10% every time even after we tinkered with it a second copy of this grinder missed by 6% yeah another grinder rattled so violently while it was working that it changed its own grind setting and another had a coffee grounds collection container made of glass when we accidentally bumped out off the counter it shattered now unlike those bad examples the best burger minders were easy to use and they had sturdy plastic grounds containers they could withstand a morning drop and they ground coffee neatly without making a mess so then we checked grind performance we're always hearing that burr grinders produce and extremely even grind since each beam only passes through the burrs once compared to that repeated whacking they get in a blade grinder we ground measured amounts of beans and then sifted the results in a crude sifter this is a device used by coffee professionals to separate large pieces called boulders from medium size or ideal pieces and then the dust like particles called fines we repeated this test on each grinder tweaking the settings till we got the maximum percentage of ideal pieces from each one now the worst grinder is achieved just 28% the best gave us 88% now at this point we had a favorite burr grinder that was easy to use and produce the highest percentage of ideal pieces of ground coffee per batch but what about the blade grinders so we went back and did all the same tests with six different blade grinders now some were too small to hold enough beans for a full pot when they were packed so full they struggled to grind all the beans and spilled when we open them once with innovative removable hoppers sounded great but they didn't work well grounds often got under the hoppers and we liked models where you could see the beans while you worked without buttons that made your hands cover them or hard to see through lids it's critical here because you have to know when to stop grinding and we learned a very important trick you need to shake blade grinders all through grinding not just at the end or some pieces get over ground while other beans stay whole our most successful pattern was to shake the grinder between one-second pulses so Paulsen shake pulse and shake that really helped even out the grind even with shaking a design factory made some more successful the blades sat lower in the bowl so coffee beans couldn't escape them we found spaces under the blade as tall as 14 point 1 millimeters and average beans are only 10 millimeters our favorite had just six point four millimeters of space under the blades so we never found whole beans and huge chunks left behind now after sifting we found our six blade grinders coffee ranged from 30 to 46% ideal particles and that falls pretty short of the nearly 90% ideal size that we got in our top rated burr grinder okay so then we wondered does that gold standard of evenness actually matter we brewed three batches of coffee using beans ground in the most even and least even burr grinders and in our top rated blade grinder 21 tasters tried them in a blind tasting the result was really surprising we found flavor differences but each made a good cup our tasters were even split on which ones they like the best so we brought in coffee tasting experts baristas coffee shop owners and Roasters and we did more blind tastings and every time these experts are split on which coffee they preferred and they came to the same conclusion that we did that they all made good coffee so if the evenness of your grind doesn't really matter why is the coffee industry obsessed with burr grinders it's because the machines work hands off with specific settings so they can guarantee consistency day after day in a way that a blade grinder can't ultimately we think a good burger is best for home - because they're easy to use and they take the guesswork out of grinding and even though grind evenness isn't the most important factor we still gave an edge to grinders that were more even since they didn't leave so many big chunks of unprocessed beans that's just a waste of good coffee so our favorite burr grinder was the Barossa encore at $139 it grinds very evenly with a dead simple design and no fuss operation you just choose the setting add the beans and you're done it has 40 grind settings so you can really customize your cup our best buy the capresso infinity conical burr grinder at $99.99 is also easy to use but it has just 16 settings and it doesn't work well with small quantities like when you just want to make a single cup our favorite blade grinder is the Krupps coffee and spice grinder it's incredibly simple to use and has a roomy grind chamber that holds plenty of beans with a crystal-clear lid for checking progress but we still prefer burr grinders for their consistency and their hands off grinding we found that you can truly get a great cup of coffee with a blade grinder and at just $17.99 our top choice is a real bargain [Music] you [Music]", "jk40W_BrWQU": "hi everyone its Tish with naptime creations welcome back to my channel today we're gonna be making these coffee bean coasters so let's jump in and get started I'm gonna be using some new molds today these are by crown made and you can get them on Amazon I'm gonna be pouring these coasters in two layers the first layer I'm gonna be using clear cast 7,000 resin and that resin is a 1 to 1 ratio so you just pour Part B into your mixing cup part into your mixing cup and mix it up for 5 minutes these molds I would say they hold about a little over 3 ounces each I would say like just about 4 ounces the colors I'm gonna be using today are molten gold epoxy paste Beiler s-expressions artisan mica powder in bronze espresso beans and clear resin so I have my resin all mixed up I mixed up my pigments in my resin off-camera if you want to see an exact tutorial on how to do that if you're new to resin I will link one down below in the description and put a I card right here just click that and it'll take you straight to the video so I'm just pouring a little bit of clear into the molds as you can see going in with my heat gun to pop any bubbles and I'm gonna go in with my espresso beans just pouring them right in the middle just like that and when you heat these up they actually smell really good which is fun it'll make your art room smell like coffee so now I'm just going in with my bronze by artisan it's a really really nice shimmery bronze color I made two cups of this these are just little three ounce cups and like I said I'm gonna be pouring these in two layers so I'm not filling them up all the way and the reason why I'm doing that is because I didn't want to fill them up all the way and then have the coffee beans float up and then have to do a top coat so what I'm doing now is just pouring in clear see how when you pour the clear in it kind of just pushes that pigment to the side that's what I wanted I didn't want pure bronze coasters I wanted you to be able to really see the coffee beans in there so see if you just if you if you're wanting more if your colors are starting to take over just save some clear to the side whenever you're making coasters that's what I always do and you can always pour more clear on there and it'll kind of push everything out to the edge so here I'm just going in with some of that beautiful molten gold baila rez and I'm just kind of outlining the coffee-bean sections you can get this gold epoxy paste from Laura's art corner on Facebook for if you're in the US I will link her store down below in the description it's a really really beautiful gold and if you heat it up sometimes like if you're doing a bigger art piece the gold particles will float up to the top and it just gives you a really nice pretty reflective gold so here I'm just going in with a little bit more gold and then what I'm gonna do is take my popsicle stick here and just swirl the gold around just kind of blending everything together and when you do that you want to make sure you don't push all the way down to the bottom of your mold just work on the surface of your resin because you don't want to scratch your molds I know I say this in every video but just in case anybody that's out there watching that's new to resin these molds are pretty delicate if you scratch them then they're gonna show that scratch and everything you make after the fact so be really careful with them just adding a little bit more gold and then I'm going to use my heat gun just a little bit make sure I get any bubbles popped then I'll cover them up and we'll be ready for the next step and like I said I got these molds off Amazon I'll link them down below if you want to get them they're a little bit different than my just for you online uk molds they're really thick which is nice if you're looking for a thicker mold so here we are it's 24 hours later and the resin is all dry so what I'm going to do is take a gold pasta pen and just outline the beans in the center here and then I'm gonna let that dry for I would say like six hours I ended up letting them dry overnight but I would say six hours is is enough time and then you'll be ready to pour your clear layer so it's the next day and now I'm ready to add my clear topcoat I'm gonna be using the liquid diamonds for that this resin is a two-to-one ratio and the reason why I'm doing the liquid diamonds is because it's really crystal clear resin it gives you a really nice crystal clear finish so I'm going to be mixing up six ounces I just poured in two ounces of my Part B and now I'm pouring in 4 ounces of my part a because it's a two to one ratio resin mix it up for five minutes and what I'm gonna do is after I'm done mixing I'm gonna take a piece of wax paper cover it up and let it sit for thirty minutes and when you do that it'll de gas on its own and pop bubbles on his own on its own see there's literally no bubbles which is nice I like to do that with the liquid diamonds I like to let it sit out for a little while then it because sometimes when you mix it you can introduce bubbles so just let it sit and then you'll be ready to pour it so I'm just filling these up to the top super simple and easy and then what I'm gonna do and taking a little toothpick cuz I had one tiny little bubble pop that and I'm gonna spray it with rubbing alcohol now that's another fun way to pop bubbles if you don't want to use heat in your molds rubbing alcohol 91 percent or 99 percent will get those bubbles popped if you just spray it on so I'm gonna cover these guys up and let them dry and then we'll be ready to demote them so here we are it's about 24 hours later and they are ready to be demolded these molds I did kind of struggle a little bit to get the coasters out but they ended up coming out fine but I really like how you can see the clear it just gives it some fun depth see that one almost went flying out of my hand and on the back there's a lot of fun texture and on the front too I got some really fun texture so these ones are pretty simple to make like I said I poured them in layers because I wanted to be able to make sure you know the coffee beans weren't going to float up it's just easier to fill the molds up halfway and then add a clear topcoat then de molding them and then taping the back or doing the liquid latex trick on the back and then doing a topcoat it's just easier to do it in layers for me anyway but what do you guys think I think they turned out really fun and I wanted to show you guys to a few videos back I meet some holographic evany Sparkle coasters and I tried to do a sand dollar and one of them too and it ended up just not working out the sand dollar turned black which was really sad but if you guys wanted to see this so I'm showing you super sad but I might still figure out something to do with it I'll link that video down below if you guys want to check it out and see what I'm talking about with the sand dollar but here they are here's the nice close-up of them I think they turned out really fun and pretty that molten gold just gives you such a nice little hint of gold in there and the artisan mica powders are really really fun - they're so shimmery and sparkly I like the backside - I think the backsides awesome what do you guys think let me know down in the comments thank you guys so much for watching this video I hope you liked it and if you did go ahead and leave me a like or another thing that would help me out is if you go check out a few more of my other videos or even a playlist I will link a resin coaster playlist down below and put a I card right here just click it and it'll take you straight to the video thanks again guys I hope you're doing good and you're having a great day and I will see you guys on Monday for another video bye", "NaN0pEeGW3I": "[Music] so let's talk a little bit about green coffee beans green coffee beans last in their green state and of course depending on the conditions whether you've got humid or dry or whatever they can last a year or more they can last several years if you've got a nice dry environment to keep them in you do not need to put them in the freezer in fact you shouldn't freeze green coffee beans um so don't keep them in the freezer so you can buy green coffee beans in bulk because they won't start losing their flavor until after they're roasted so let's talk about organic coffee beans and buying them online now these are already roasted coffee beans that i'm showing you first i just went to amazon and i'm taking a look at what the prices are like for organic coffee beans i did read that coffee is chemically treated quite heavily so that's why i buy the organic so i know that i'm not getting um extra amount of chemicals in my coffee beans but take a look at amazon here and some of the prices for their organic coffee beans and this is just like page one i just opened it up page one you can see that you've got a two pound bag of already roasted coffee and remember you don't know how old the roast is but notice that um this particular brand a two pound bag is uh basically 62. i like to look at this part 62 cents an ounce or it looks like about 10 dollars a pound for these organic coffee beans you've also got anywhere from 62 cents an ounce over that up to like two dollars an ounce this kind right here i don't know how special they think their coffee is but only 12 ounces is 19.95 so it's just crazy expensive to buy organic roasted already roasted coffee beans now let's contrast with some places that you can buy green coffee beans online the two sites that i am going to go over have differing shipping costs but the cost all together for five pounds ends up about the same and you'll see that in a minute one of the best places that i have read about and i have not actually bought from here but this is a place called sweet marias.com so if you look at the price per pound here you've got six dollars and 40 cents now one thing you need to be careful of when you're buying green coffee beans online is the shipping cost some of them are just over the top crazy on their shipping cost and it could actually end up costing you just as much as if you went and bought and bought a pound of already roasted beans the flavor might not be as good but it might cost you just as much if you don't watch the shipping cost so i contrasted this watermelon organic however you say that but it's a guatemalan organic coffee blend at 625 a pound on sweet maria's with another website and i'll show you the difference so the second website that's sweet maria's the second website is coffee bean corral so in coffee bean corral you see the prices are very similar there may be a little bit of difference but not very much so you can buy organic coffee beans they have a larger selection it looks like in stock on coffee bean corral than at sweet maria's but it also depends on what they're getting in in bulk and that's kind of the fun of it too is trying all the different kinds of organic green coffee beans so what i did just to show you is i went through the checkout process um with sweet maria's and i also went through the checkout process with um the same price per pound so here i've got five pounds and let me tell you if you buy one pound you're going to be paying nearly the shipping cost as if you would buy five pounds so buying in bulk is your best option if you're buying them online it ended up being 27.19 for the coffee and if i scroll down here you can see the shipping is dollars and 25 cents for ups ground it's the cheapest rate they offer and you see my total with the shipping is 39.44 on sweet maria's now let's go over to coffee bean corral coffee bean corral i did five pounds of one that is the same price so here you've got my totals so i've got 3125 for my five pounds and then i've got the shipping at 9.70 so they don't charge as much for shipping but my order total is about the same it's only a dollar fifty difference and if we round that and we say you can get five pounds for about forty dollars you're looking at eight dollars per pound and at eight dollars per pound that's about 50 cents an ounce and actually quite a bit cheaper than if you bought it in the store and roasting your own coffee gives you a more flavorful and fresh cup of coffee plus they will last a year or more or maybe several years depending on your conditions let me know if you roast your own coffee beans maybe you do it a different way or maybe you have a particular one that you like please leave that in the comments i would love to know that soon we're going to be having an update on the chicken coop dan is now working on the inside of the walls so we'll take a look at that coming up soon have a great day you", "RN-vzamHLGs": "- This is just too much,\ntoo much coffee here. There are so many ways\nto brew coffee out there. as a certified coffee nerd snob. I've tried nearly all of them, but for people who\naren't coffee obsessives, it can be really confusing. I'm gonna walk you through some of the most common\ncoffee brewing methods the pros and cons and who I think each one is best for. (soft drumbeats) The first method is a pour-over. A pour-over requires a brewing cone with a paper filter that you pour water over and it funnels through into\na decanter or a corral. There are a number of different\npour-over brewers out there. This is the Hario V60. Some other popular ones\nare the Kalita wave and the Bee house brewer. Another kind of pour-over is the Chemex. has a similar method of making the coffee with a cone and a paper filter. With the Chemex you're doing\na very similar technique to other kinds of pour-overs, but you have one single\npiece of equipment, which makes it a little\nbit more difficult to clean to get in there and wash out the glass. Some people absolutely love Chemexs, some people it's just a\nlittle bit too much of a pain. The pros of a pour-over are that you can really extract some\nvery high quality coffee out of your beans if you\nknow what you're doing. That's why coffee nerds love it so much. You have a lot of control\nover all the variables. So if you like to fiddle around and find exactly what works for you, the pour over is great. And another pro is just that\nit's a very gratifying ritual. Doing a pour over every\nmorning kind of lets you focus. It's very meditative and\npeople kind of love that. The cons of a pour-over are that it really takes a lot of practice. It's not super easy. It's just hard to get a consistent, perfect cup every single time. Another con is that doing\na pour over might involve a little investment in some extra gear, such as a digital scale. So you can get the dose and\nthe ratio of coffee to water exactly right. Also a gooseneck pouring kettle like this, which lets you pour a\nreally even consistent flow of water over your coffee bed. Some people don't think a gooseneck kettle is absolutely necessary, but it does make things\neasier and more consistent. So who is the pour-over for? Well it's for coffee\nnerds first and foremost, you're obsessed with the\nquality of your coffee. If you wanna learn and experiment, pour-over is a great method. Next way to brew coffee is\nthe classic French press With a French press, you put your coffee into this glass carafe but it's steep, which is what's called\na full immersion style of brewing coffee. And then you simply press\ndown on this metal filter, which strains out the grounds\nand gives you your coffee. That you can just pour it into a mug. Pros of a French press are\nthat it's very easy to do. It doesn't require a whole\nlot of special knowledge. Just a bit of timing. There's also no paper waste. It does not involve any paper filters. So if being environmentally\nfriendly is important to you, the French press is a great way to go. The other pro about a French press is that it's fairly cheap. French press brewers cost\nbetween maybe 20 to $40. They're really not expensive. And that's really all\nyou need to get going and you don't have to\nbuy any other extra gear. Cons of a French press are the type coffee that it really is suited to brew. Which are more rich, heavy body copies. It's not great for brewing\nlighter tea, light coffees. And that's because you're\nusing this metal mesh filter instead of paper. And the mesh filter does tend\nto leave a little bit of sand or sediment at the bottom\nof your coffee cup. Some people really hate that. Some people don't mind it. The last con is that it is a\nlittle bit of a pain to clean. You can't just dump a paper\nfilter with your grounds. You have to dump the grounds\nout of your French press, clean it out each time. It's not a huge deal, but it is a definite con. So who is the French press for? Well it's for people who want convenience without a plugin machine on their counter. It's also for people who really like those rich heavy body coffees. Let's talk about espresso. Espresso is kind of its own beast. It requires a lot of equipment. It's very different than brewed coffee. Pros of espresso is that\nit's very versatile. You can make a lot of different drinks with an espresso base. Especially milk drinks\nlike lattes or cappuccino. Espresso just also has that\nunique espresso flavor. Super concentrated, super rich. It really feels like\nsomething totally different than regular brewed coffee. The cons of espresso are\nthat it's very expensive. Great espresso machines can cost hundreds if not thousands of dollars and you need a very good grinder. You need a lot of accessories. So it's not a cheap thing to get into. It's also pretty difficult\nto get really great, consistent results with\nan espresso machine. People devote hours and\nhours and years of their life to mastering espresso. So if you really wanna\ngo down that rabbit hole, just be forewarned. It's not easy. And the last con of espresso is that you only really get a\nsingle serving at a time. You can't brew a whole pot of\nespresso to serve at a party. Each serving requires its own process. And it just takes a bit of time. Who is espresso for? It's for coffee fanatics who\nlove the purity of espresso, who love experimenting and getting down to the highest quality\nespresso you can get. It's also for people who love milk drinks. If lattes and cappuccinos and\nmacchiatos are your thing, espresso might be the way to go. Then you have the ubiquitous\ndrip machine like this one. Drip machines are one\nof the easiest methods because it's all automated. You just set it and forget\nit and let it do its thing. Believe it or not if you invest in a good\ndrip brewing machine, you can get really high quality results. Companies like Bonavita\nand OXO and many others are making really high\nquality drip machines. So you can get great quality coffee without having to resort\nto a manual method. Cons of a drip machine are that you kinda give up the control. You're at the mercy of the machine. You can't change up the variables. You can't fine tune the\ncoffee if that's your thing. And while drip machines are\ngreat for making large brews, they're not super great at\nmaking single serving coffees. So if you live by yourself, if you're just making coffee\nfor you every morning, the drip machine might\nnot be the best choice. So who is a drip machine really for? It's for people who want automation, who don't wanna have to dote over their coffee in the morning, they just want an easy, quick cup. Drip machines are also great for people who are regularly\nmaking large batches of coffee for large groups of people. Next we have the AeroPress. AeroPress is a really unique, interesting kind of coffee maker. And it kind of has a cult following. What you do is you put\nyour coffee in here. There's a paper filter at the bottom. And after your coffee brews, you press down and squeeze the coffee into a mug sitting below. Pros of an AeroPress are that\nit's really customizable. There are hundreds of recipes you can try each with their own\nvariables and variations and it can be really fun to experiment and get exactly the kind\nof brew that you want. It's also really portable. AeroPress it's collapsed\ndown to a really small size. So if you're traveling and you wanna bring a\ncoffee brewer with you, you really can't beat the\nAeroPress for portability. AeroPress is also a pretty fast way of making a single serving of coffee. It takes around two,\ntwo and a half minutes to brew your cup. There are some cons about the AeroPress. Number one, the difficulty\nlevel I would say is medium. It's not super easy. You have to do a little bit of fiddling, depending on the recipe you use. It's not super hard, but it's definitely not the\neasiest way to brew coffee. And the last con is that it\nonly brews one fairly small cup at a time around 200 to 250 milliliters, which is a little more\nthan an eight ounce cup. So you can't use it for brewing\ncoffee for multiple people. So the AeroPress is great for travelers who wanna bring some\ncoffee here with them. It's for people who\nreally only need to make a single serving of coffee at a time. And it's for people who love experimenting with different recipes and variables. Next up is the moka pot. A lot of people think the\nmoka pot creates espresso and that's not technically true, but the coffee you get from a moka pot is very espresso like. It's a small quantity. It's very rich and very strong. The pros of a moka pot are\nthat it's the best method for creating an espresso like coffee without actually going down the road of buying a giant espresso machine. It's also really great for milk drinks because you have that richness\nthat marries well with milk. And it's a very unique method. There's a romance to it of\nputting it over an open flame and seeing the coffee\nkinda sputter out the top. It's a fun process. The cons of a moka pot only\nmakes a small quantity. So it's not great for\nlarge groups of people. Another con is that\nit's really only capable of making that concentrated\nrich type of brew. So if you don't like that, you're out of luck with the moka pot. And lastly it does require\na stove or an open flame. You can't just use boiling water, you have to have a heat\nsource underneath it. So that might limit you in terms of where you\nwanna use a moka pot. Who is the moka pot for? Well it's great for campers. People who wanna make\ncoffee over an open flame and is for people who really love that richest espresso like flavor and texture in their coffee. Moving on to the clever driver. The clever dripper is\na really unique device. You place it over a cup of\ncoffee and it sort of combines the French press and a pour-over. Put the coffee into a paper\nfilter that sits in this cone. You let it steep in a full\nimmersion style of brewing. And then once you place the\nclever dripper over a mug automatically drains out. The pros of the clever dripper\nare that is pretty cheap. Also an easier version of a pour-over. It gets you almost the same quality, but you don't have to worry\nabout technique as much. The cons it doesn't create quite\nas crisp and clean a flavor as a pour-over. So you're almost getting\nto pour over territory, but not quite. It also only brews a single serving or the amount of coffee\nthat can fit in this cone. And the last con is that\nfor a single serving brewer, it is on the slow side. (sips) Can I get a bit more coffee? In this day and age we\ncan't talk about coffee without talking about a\nKeurig or in espresso. These single serving pod-based coffees have their pros and cons for sure. Pros of both of these are that\nit's the quickest, easiest, fastest, most convenient way\nto get coffee into your mouth. And really that's the reason you would buy a curator and espresso. It's not great for good quality. It's not great for freshness, and it's not great for being\nenvironmentally friendly. But if speed is your primary concern, and you just want a quick\nfixe as fast as possible, a Keurig or an espresso maybe for you. Then we have a siphon\nbrewer or a vacuum pot. These are really crazy contraptions that not many people brew with, but it's worth mentioning\nbecause it is out there. And a lot of people wonder about it. Siphon brewing is known for creating the absolute clearest cleanest, most clarified kind of\ncoffee you can make. Cons are that it is a\nvery involved process. It's not easy to do right off the bat. You really have to\nlearn about the science. And the equipment is fairly expensive. Ranging from 80 to a $100 and up. Who's a siphon really for? Well it's for science nerds. People who love to make a\nshow of their coffee brewing, people who are obsessed with that really clean, crisp flavor. Of course, there are many\nother ways of brewing coffee. There's cold brew, iced coffee, there's Turkish coffee makers, Vietnamese coffee makers, percolators. But hopefully this gives you an overview of what's popular, what's accessible. So you can make your own decision and find the best cup of coffee for you. If there's a coffee brewing method that you're curious about, let us know in the comments.

being such a long time by having put out reviews and stuff but we're back on track now and we're going to keep doing reviews and also remember our coffee shops as well and also our we've got our food and drink channel as well that we're going to do some more food related items as well and looking at the hot pro um sorry hot mix pro proportion yes yeah basically so because there's loads of stuff we can do with that we just i just haven't got around to doing it yet and trying it so we're gonna crack on with those things but enough of that for the moment uh today we're gonna be looking at another coffee is another restaurant-based coffee and so we did costa before and coffee house and now we're doing pretty much things again not much information about these beans on the internet i looked on the website um and they're actually they're grown that it is a blend and they're grown through a blend of farmers in peru honduras sumatra and ethiopia so so is it an arabica blend it's in our 100 arabica blend just from different regions so you will there will be slight variations i mean ethiopian beans you can't beat them they're awesome i think ethiopia is a really good being produced probably just because of the heat of them well they also have the maximum number of varieties so you know like if you want to know which is probably the origin of something you kind of find out where you find the maximum variations okay yes and so you know ethiopia is one of those places where there are maximum varieties of beans in a short you know sort of geography yeah yeah yeah yeah it's uh i mean you've got some other good ones there as well honduras i find honduras is a really good um bean producer as well isn't it yeah um and sumatra but i think for me the mo and you've got peru but i think the two there for me honduras and the ethiopian beans but anyway there's a nice mix of all of those they're all organic and don't know about the processes they couldn't find much information on how they're processed um whether it's i doubt whether it's a natural product well i i believe when when they do something like a blend and they want to keep their name i believe what they will be concentrating on is not so much um on you know finding the nitty gritties but the end taste they probably want to keep the end taste end result consistently yeah because also um it's kind of different from the people that we get the coffee beans from so we buy from somewhere called coffee compass and you can get that's right yeah green beans you roast yourself but you can get some really good different processes that they've been through you can get those natural um processed ones that i really like that come out all fruity and sweet and yeah you can see our other reviews for yesterday i think we have one that we'll be doing yeah yeah probably not today yeah yeah um but yeah there's i think yeah there's quite a variation in in those results are you trying to say that there is a huge difference between buying ready blends and roasting yourself is that what you're yeah i guess that's where it's ending up i think just from the point of view of taste and processes the process is so important to the end taste of that bean as in how even when they come over and they're imported raw yeah not even roasted i think those processes make a big difference whereas i guess if you're mass producing yes you're going to get the best you can get for the price and maybe those beans that are naturally processed do tend to be more expensive because there's more to that yes process that's gone in um i think what emma is also trying to allude to is the the commercial companies who are uh using micro growers what you call it micro producers yeah small farms and naturally processed beans are the micro roasters yeah like um what's that uh revolution modern standard um union direct that is at least in the uk yeah so those two they're pretty good on that because they are micro yeah yeah rice yes in some ways people like brett could have gone that route and try to concentrate on taste rather than on other but we'll we'll find out doesn't it yeah let's see how it is i think they're saying that they've got a graph in the back what's that i think they're saying it's as good as the shop one that you can get in the shop so that tells you the predominant flavors so it's going to be dark chocolate molasses and nutty okay well we found that costa was nothing like what they serve in the shop uh when we reviewed the costa we found that uh the what we are able to buy as the coaster beans in a supermarket is is totally completely different from what you drink in a costa coffee shop you can ask for espresso in a coaster coffee restaurant and just get a delicious uh espresso i've had it many students yeah it's fantastic in fact i i was thinking it is actually very good the one we reviewed wouldn't even get onto our top 20. yeah you know and we've reviewed a lot we've done a lot of different companies we've even done little audi yeah um you know tesco's white road sainsbury's whereas they are saying you know whereas pretomanja is saying that's the same beans they serve yeah or at least it tastes similar or something of that sort what's their words exactly you said something like you get the coffee yeah so it's got our espresso beans are hand-picked blend grown by a small hold of farmers in peru honduras sumatra and ethiopia just like the espresso based coffee in our shops oh okay so that's just like that's okay so it isn't the same so it might not be the same well they have said they haven't said it's the same it's not um so they're telling you this grind size um so for espresso it needs to be fine the filter is medium and for cafeteria of course d have we got it on the correct 300 is that too coarse well let's try okay um and it's a roast level so you've got lovely little charts on the side there yeah and it's a roast level five okay so right it's gonna be a dark there's another stars falling down i don't know what that is size guide grind size guide medium cafeteria oh that's what you said earlier espresso fine okay yeah that's surprised uh i have a feeling it'll clog up let's see the beam i don't think it'll be fine for espresso [Music] i mean no wonder compared to cafeteria espresso grind has to be finer but within espresso there is a huge variation of grain sizes so it's pretty user-friendly it's improved you can open it without splitting and spilling a bean everywhere any way to re-seal it no no so i don't know it seems sticky there i think they mean for you to decant it into this probably so i have a sniff of that you know strong very strong that's oily very oily that's gonna be oily i would expect that to be quite full-on actually all right so 300 grind size we could go with um 300 that's very close for this look at that that's dark well strong everything about it oh that feels very strong yeah quite dark strong full on my husband right so i'm gonna [Music] [Laughter] quite a manger right enough for that durability let's see if this works okay so i'm gonna start off on a gentle nice was it hazelnut chocolate dark chocolate molasses and nutty there we go let's uh let's see cheers it's not bad actually quite like that that's a nice blend that's a really palatable blend it's got quite a strong aftertaste however if you had that with milk or cream that would be really oh yeah yeah that would be really you could just sit and drink that that's actually quite drinkable that would go on to our top 20 i think yeah it's a good blend yeah our top 20 is a tough list to get into but uh this can edge it there are no defects like i don't taste anything medicinal no there are no bad things in there um i'd definitely go with the dark chocolate i don't know so much about the molasses but no it's a it's a bit of a nutty and a dark caramelly sort of you could say chocolate but um okay so when you get down the bottom and drink yeah so when it's settled slightly you get all of those flavors yeah there yeah i really like that that was a really good buy oh that's one thing how much did that cost i don't know well it wasn't uh it's also a big packet so it did cost 100 grand okay uh a lot 450 grams 450 grams yeah maybe eight or nine pounds i have to i'm sorry i don't remember that's fine so you're paying for a nice quality bean there so if you really want to if you want to treat yourself um you want a lot of bean um that's a really pleasant taste i'd go for this one actually and i think that really deserves to go on to the top 20. yes for a supermarket off the shelf blended beans that is fantastic and as for one of the ones that's kind of on that whole coffee shop and vibe that go you know starbucks pretty much and yeah stirring all of those that's i think that's the best out of all of them i've got to say the only other ones that was was starbucks blonde i was going to say the blonde on the starbucks would be yeah that probably will beat it but i know but it's slightly different yeah it's a different it's going to be slightly different but just for quality and taste in that line i think yeah i think the starbucks blondie is a good one i liked that one as well i'm starting to get the aftertaste it is fine this one's very pleasant it's a yeah it's a good um off-the-shelf coffee no defects and normally with the dark roast you i'd expect it to be a bit earthy or like nutty but you know when you get like that it's didn't it was really pleasant so obviously if it can be even it's an espresso yeah so really nice espresso is the ultimate test so in a way so if it's yeah that's good with an espresso then uh definitely with any yeah yeah yeah any kind of uh coffee drink it should be fine so it's a [Laughter] so yeah i think um yeah brilliant so definitely on the top 20 definitely worth a buy i'll go and get that um as a nice even as a nice standard coffee to keep in your cupboard because you could have that any time of the day and that would be really delicious i think isn't it yes yeah any time of the day would be really really nice so yeah thumbs up for the predominant espresso blend um all really good places that they've blended from as well yeah yeah peru honduras etc they're all very good ethiopia they're all very good places yes yeah to get your beans from and sauce beans from yeah um so yeah for watching yeah remember to subscribe we're going to be doing loads more videos so all right brilliant thanks bye", "G6E9aYEQVa8": "How to Grind Coffee Beans. You don't have to do everything the easy way. Coffee tastes better with fresh-ground beans,\nand it doesn't take long to learn how. You will need Whole coffee beans and a coffee\ngrinder or blender. Step 1. Measure out the coffee beans you will need. A good rule of thumb is one tablespoon of\nbeans for each six-ounce cup of coffee you want to make. If your first pot is too weak or too strong,\nadjust your measurements. Grind the beans right before brewing for the\nfreshest tasting coffee. Step 2. Pour the coffee beans into the grinder or\nblender. The finer the coffee granules, the stronger\nthe coffee. Coarser grounds produce better flavor and\nless bitterness if you're making drip coffee or using a French press. If you're using a blender, choose the \"pulse\"\nsetting. Step 3. Run the grinder or blender for several seconds,\nthen check the beans. Grinding for too long generates unnecessary\nheat. Step 4. Once the beans are as fine or coarse as you\nwant them to be, brew some coffee. If you've never had coffee using freshly ground\nbeans before, you'll notice the difference! Did you know When coffee was first introduced\nto Europe it was called Arabian Wine.", "qHRyyZxdGeM": "[Applause] okay so she just saw a number of competitors in the recent war bursted championship in Seoul had been making use of Christopher and Anne's latest research he found that coffee ground at negative 79 degrees Celsius or lower physically reacted differently to the grinding process coffee ground at this temperature resulted in a more narrow and even grain size distribution this means that there will be less of fines and boulders which will lead to a better and more even extraction giving you more sweetness and flavor clarity so for today we're gonna put the results of that research to the test we're gonna first calibrate the coffee to be slightly over extracted and have a bit of bitterness and a finish and then we're gonna take coffee that's been frozen to negative 79 degrees Celsius in dry ice for at least three hours if the resulting grind profile from the frozen coffee is the improved and better we should see the initial bitterness from the ova extraction disappear but while we're carrying out the experiment we also noticed a few observations the first one is that after grinding the coffee was still very cold this will undoubtedly affect the extraction so we decided to run an additional test where we allow the grinds to return back to room temperature before we pull this shot we also do did an additional trial where we did a double grind process pioneered by Mickey Suzuki so that means we first ground it at the Costas setting on the EK 43 before grinding it at the calibrated settings then we allow the frozen grains to return back to room temperature first before pulling a shop so let's get straight to the experiment and we can we can discuss the results at the end of the video [Music] you [Music] you [Music] you okay so we've got some of the unfrozen coffee here we're just gonna calibrate the coffee first so that we know what calibration settings to use with the frozen coffee later so I'm just gonna grind it go ahead and bring this and purge some of the coffee first grind the rest of the coffee [Music] okay so we've calibrated the coffee to grind size 1.6 on ek 43 but doing an 18 is to 42 grams shot that's 95 degrees so the coffee has a little bit of bitterness just in the finish but otherwise it's pretty floral and sweet so if the frozen coffee does in fact create a more even grind profile we should see that bitterness disappear in the next shot okay so we've got the frozen coffee here we're gonna take one out oh cool okay am I'm gonna grind this straightaway back into this container okay so we've just ground the frozen coffee we're just gonna keep it in here back into this little container and let it cool well not cool but warm back up to room temperature before we actually pull the shot so we're just gonna set that aside here and then we're gonna take out one more this time we'll grind it and pull this shot immediately [Music] you [Music] papi here long back up to room temperature it's about 83 point degrees now so it's good to go [Music] you okay so this time we're gonna do a double grind so we're gonna grind it at the Costas setting on the EQ 43 first and then we're gonna grind it at one point six which is the grind size that we pulled the espresso on just now so the rationale is that this coffee would grind much more evenly if it's going through a double grind process so as you can see it's pretty coarse okay we're gonna put me grind it before you gonna grind it really fine now [Music] [Music] you you you [Music] so we're gonna measure the extractions now and then we're going to share the results with you right here if you want to read about this experiment in more detail head on over to compound coffee comm slash experiments I'll see you there okay so the coffee that we used was if you've been portrayed so watch the process and it was ten days off first when we're carrying out the experiment Ektron colors are 53 on the whole bean and 67 minutes ground okay so for the control shot I'm sorry in the video I said 42 grams but when we pulled it we decided to do 41 crimes because that was the calibration okay we have a 0.5 gram tolerance in the shot yield but as you can see most of it are within two 0.2 0.4 grams okay so for the first control shot we did 18 grams just a 41-point to measure the TDS it was 9.4% and 2.3 2% extraction it was sweet and floral but that was also distinct bitterness in the finish now when we moved on to the coffee that was frozen for these three hours in try ice and then we pulled it we ground it and we pulled the SS pressure so immediately we got 18 grams to 41 grams and lo and behold the TDS did go up it's not a huge number but it is significant enough with did multiple shots of this and all of it had a higher extraction percentage the one that we've shown here is the average it was an average of about 0.1 percent higher it may not seem like much but when we tasted it it was four oh and sweet and it had a more round body and the bitterness and the finish was reduced I wouldn't say it was completely gone I could still detect it in the finish but it was definitely better then because we felt that the coffee grades were very cold even after grinding we decided to do another experiment where we let the coffee go return back to room temperature just so that it can extract but I felt like maybe that grinds was so cold it was not extracting properly when the hot water hit it because the average temperature is decidedly lower now this time we did 18 grams is 41.2 gram shot the tedious surprisingly remained the same but just that 0.2 grams of additional yield push the extraction to higher it's now twenty two point five six when we did very important shots there was a significant difference the shot did indeed have a high extraction percentage regardless of how many times you pulled it so we tried about eight to nine shots and it all had the same result I'm just showing this one here that even though it has the same TDS they sure must higher because of the higher yield the tasting notes was floral sweet and this time there was no bitterness in the espresso at all it just really surprising so this is a better way so but unfortunately in the competitions there was no way to allow the wines to return back to room temperature because it take too much time but for those people competing in the Brewers Cup you've got something on your hands now but I mean could sip the grinds as well it probably give the same effect so you don't really need this now for the frozen coffee Mickey suzuki also did a double bearing process so she ground it cost first and then she ground it to the calibrated settings and we did that by we add an additional step by roulette it returned back to room temperature as well as just based on the results of the previous few Charles we got an 18 grams to 41 point four grams short TDS was somehow lower so we were not expecting this I thought that based on what she said it should have increased the extraction it should have made things better right but somehow the tds was consistently lower and the extraction percentage was also lower for the tasting notes it was slightly sour in the start which leads me to think that maybe with this process we actually have to go finer we can't use the same calibrated grind as the previous few coffees it could be because the grind profile is different and it's it's going a little bit coarser and there's less fines to slow down a shot or something I don't know but it had we use the calibrated grind and it consistently provide other were ten years in extraction and it did feel under extracted so I would say that we have to recalibrate ever using this process it has slightly sour start but it still retained a lot of the floral and sweet notes probably not as sweet as previous shots but at least there was no bitterness in the shot as well okay so those are the results if you want to read more details about the experiment please head on over to compound coffee dot-com slash experiments we write up a lot more about their what we intend to do next there will be a part two to this experiment if you want to know more about the equipment that but using the calibration how we're pulling everything he's going there to read

coffee this is a subject that most people don't know about they have to search online and there are a lot of misconceptions I think online because there's a lot of hype recently about mycotoxins about how coffee before it's roasted can is susceptible to mold and can actually ruin the the green coffee so most coffee after it is picked it is dried and it's dried to a moisture content of around 11% once it's at an 11 percent moisture content this coffee can be stored for weeks months years and it actually gets better with age as long as it's stored in a fairly dry environment away from a lot of moisture out of the sunlight so what I do is I take this green coffee which has been dried to 11% free of any micro toxins and put them in a bag like this this bag can be stored in the kitchen not in the refrigerator or the freezer but at room temperature or in a cool place out of the Sun this is what it looks like the green coffee and when it's stored like this again it's going to get better with engines so what we can do if you don't want to store it in this bag you can store it in a jar like this dump the whole thing in close it up leave it out of the Sun and that's it you're storing your green coffee properly and there's no risk of any other deterioration micro toxins mold getting on the coffee that's it this is hot coffee this has been coffee University you get one credit for this

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you", "KLhEk7et9YQ": "[Music] what's up everyone welcome back to the channel van foresight here former professional MMA fighter and brand director for eighth corner coffee hope you're all well I'm here today to do a short little video on why you should grind your coffee fresh so made a few coffee tutorials in the past I'm kind of the number one barrier to entry that I hear and see the most is that people don't want to grind their own coffee at home it is a little bit tedious I will admit and maybe you don't want to go ahead and buy a grinder so it's all that make this short video to maybe convince you that you should be going in your coffee fresh but I don't think this topic requires more than a short amount of time so I'm gonna aim to do it in 90 seconds so I'm gonna start a timer and go okay so if you remember when I made my first tutorial one of the things I spoke about was climbing your coffee fresh and I briefly spoke about the reasons to do this but I'll get into it a bit more now so when you grind coffee this surface area obviously goes from a little bean to be much much larger so the coffee is then exposed to three things that may deteriorate so those three things are air moisture and then the escape of co2 so when you expand the surface area of coffee it's obviously way more exposed to these things with air it's able to get into the coffee much more easy than when it was a little coffee bean this is gonna just take away some of the flavors that you would have probably preferred to have in the coffee I know you're thinking then we're mooster that you're not gonna get the coffee wet but there's actually moisture in the air already so even this can start to kind of dilute the coffee on a micro level you might don't even see it but it is happening and then co2 is a really important element in making coffee and actually contains a lot of the flavors and aromas and just deliciousness that that your coffee contains by grinding the coffee up and allowing the co2 to escape before the brewing process you might not get as good of a coffee that you would have got if you had of grounded fresh to add to this I'll also say that a huge reason why you should go into coffee fresh is that if you buy pre-ground coffee it's only going to be grounded for one specific use espresso or maca pots are super super fine whereas the French presses or drip coffees are really really coarse each one of these requires a different grind settings so that you get the most optimal grew out of it so by grinding your coffee fresh at home you can actually make it in many different ways depending on what you want to do I will say that if you really really really don't want to get a grinder and at least go to your local coffee shop buy a bag a coffee off the shelf and get them to grind it for you for the specific method that you want to make at home it's still not ideal but as long as you're using this coffee within about a week you're gonna be good and oftentimes if the shop has really good equipment the grind size on one of these grinders is gonna be much more uniform so similar which will give you a much better cup of coffee and maybe a cheaper home grinder that you may have had okay that's it for now I hope that you found this video helpful and that maybe I've convinced you to buy a grinder if you like this video make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel if you like my content and you want to see more I'm gonna go hard into these coffees tutorials now that's what I'm gonna

"9slyW3WWuG0": "all right just a quick video on coffee bean storage at home there's a there's some debates out there on what's best we're going to tell you any one of these if you want to store your coffee in burlap in a cotton muslin bag to let the beans breathe this is a good idea for any long-term storage depends on how many beans you're buying how many roasting this is a way to keep them long term when I say long-term I'm talking you know a year plus if you're consuming coffee quite frequently you can buy your beans some beans are gonna come into plastic bags like this from the importer and these are fine some people will say well if you keep them in there they'll mold or whatever they'll mold if you keep them for keep them around for three forty years of course I mean there's moisture in those beans that's going to release into the bag etc I drink a lot I roast a lot for myself when I drink a lot of coffee so I like to use these plastic bins food grade plastic I can store up to ten pounds of coffee in these right now I have probably about four four pounds in this right here this is probably pound and a half of coffee in there that's a that's a yellow bourbon espresso from the doTERRA farm in Brazil and I've got some Columbian coffee a little bit stored in here so and that's that's long-term I kind of pack away that I use that for blending more than anything but either way the burlap is probably the number one way to go pad Muslim or any one of these is going to work again long-term storage short to mid-term type storage on these and depends if you use these what you want to do every once in a while if you want to use these for long term open up the lid every once in a while just shake them out maybe leave it open for the day and then just seal back up don't keep your coffee in 90 degree humid weather you know keep them room temperature as best you can and that'll be fine so any questions on that let me know thanks for tuning in until next vid

going to take you guys with the process of buying specialty coffee on Amazon so let's start and let's start with going to one day yes the project is far away from Spain soda Roasters that he's offering our Spanish Roasters if you put specialty coffee I know that burst on Monday is offering coffee from nomads which you can see over here and where coffee from tudjarow it's open here so that's what I'm gonna buy here you can see the different coffees that they have so there's caffeine aloe so decaf I was scared CAPTCHA TCO and Nana bina I'm gonna go for elbows K which is the regular espresso that they have at the moment when you're buying on Amazon just make sure that the coffee is fresh you cannot see the roasting date on Amazon which is a pity so I I cannot guarantee that and we'll see that when it comes to my house I mean buying on Amazon that's very easy I never use Amazon so it's a bit difficult because I don't know that well the website was in general buying things on Amazon is very easy just present and again you just order it and they will deliver it so that's pretty easy so now I'm going for the potato I'll put you as a bland Columbia and Ethiopia which is filtered so I already have the it first of all no one so I'm going for the ATO peon filter you cannot see when it was roasted as well so that's the only thing that concerns me I'm gonna put it [Music] and I have no that's it let's order okay it's done so the order is completed I'm gonna wait for it it will arrive probably into two days and then I pick it up let's see how it arrives which which roasting data is how the package looks like so what I've been doing now is that I've been checking the price difference so I've added one bag of coffee the Nomad webshop the bag of coffee the regular espresso is nine euros well if I buy it on Amazon it's 11 so there's three euros extra the costs of sending the shipping costs are four ninety so to OB 13 90 let me check check 90 plus I've been checking out one infiltrator put yellow the back the same Ethiopian coffee is 11 euros while I was on it's 1250 and the price for sending shipping costs are four euro so the total is 15 so it will be 28 90 [Music] 2949 so yeah you have to pay a little bit more in Amazon actually the only thing is that you don't have to do two orders you can order on the same time but it is a bit more expensive Here I am again with my Amazon package and it's open it ok so here I have the coffee first one is normal coffee frosting day five of February so that's 10 days ago that's okay with shipping and everything and then I have potato there's a roasting date of 29 of January that's like two weeks it longer that's I mean I would use the coffee for the maximum one month so both coffees I can still use it for two weeks it's so bad I just don't know what kind of roasting that you would get if you order this coffee directly in the webshop off the Roasterie so all the webshop know what or on the actual potato this is the end of this video I'm very curious what do you think about buying specialty coffee on Amazon let me know in the comment if you have any tips for me or there's something you would like to know about coffee online please tell me do you know what to do and you like my video very easy just put the thumbs up have you subscribed on my channel already it's very easy just press the subscribe button it's for free there's nothing to worry about and I would be very happy so thank you guys for watching see you next time", "SIzFhnZ32Y0": "but you just were you just said just work today we're going to review smart coffee scales this review I thought would be easy I was just gonna buy these sets of scales do some basic testing on features and declare a winner that isn't what happened that's not what this review is going to be what we're going to dive into the world of smart scales now briefly I want to tell the story of scales in coffee I think going back to 2012 was when the sort of the the Harry o coffee scales launched right when we started to get really serious about weighing our pour of is our V 60s whatever we were making now I confess I had a little bit of a hand in these the reason that they have varying levels of accuracy but they're they're kind of 0.1 at zero to two hundred grams or 0.5 at 200 to 500 grams that's that's my fault that was my suggestion I own no money from these I was never paid for this advice to Harry oh but but it was my suggestion as a way to let you go all the way up to two kilos but have accuracy where you needed it to make it point one gram accurate all the way up to two kilos would have made it much more expensive than it was so this was the kind of compromise that's by the by this thing was a set of scales that was designed or focused on making coffee and along with your weighing function you had a timer function and that's kind of what sets coffee scales apart from other things but this was the beginning and these work like just about all kitchen scales work you have a base here and then you have a way pan here and connecting the way pan to the base is a piece of metal called a load cell and as that piece of metal bends under weight you can measure the varying current across that piece of metal and you can convert that into a weight that little load cell is probably the same in pretty much all the scales here although cells are very simple things the software what you do with that information that's where things get tricky now no question the game was changed when a kiya kick-started their first set of coffee scales home the Pearl set of coffee scales and they did something kind of interesting they took this little way pan on top of this little base and they just turned it upside down so suddenly your weight pan was your base and your base was on top is where everything was and this means that the scales were kind of spongy because everything you pushed was pushing down on the way pan but it meant that water would run off the edge and down and couldn't get back up inside to mess with the electronics in most sets of scales having it this way around with the way pan on top left the electronics exposed to water and that was bad now here in front of me I have seven sets of scales most of which I've paid for thanks to the support of patreon that people support me each month on patreon giving me a budget to go out and buy these things and therefore have an unbiased opinion about them and that way I'm not relying on manufacturers giving them to me and I'm not spending the money out of pocket because there's about a thousand dollars worth of scales here which is which is a lot here I have the Tim amore black mirror scale it's about 99 euros 100 euros I think I paid for this here which I already owned is the scale this I have because it connects to the decent but it is a smart scale worth talking about this is $99 this is the Brewster smart scale I think this is about a hundred pounds this is the Felicita incline it's about a hundred and fifteen dollars here is the new Akaya pearl Model S which is a hundred and eighty five dollars or about 195 pounds in the UK and on the end is the heroic Jemmy which is about two hundred and seventy pounds or I think like two hundred and eighty-five two hundred and ninety dollars online in the US which is a lot initially we're going to do two tests we're gonna do a boot up test which is how long does it take from pushing go to being ready to weigh and then we're going to do a test to see what the lag is like so I'm just going to dose about 30 grams of coffee onto each scale and see how long it takes to register the correct final weight then we're going to talk about apps but we'll come back to that in a second so let's just dive into those two tests first of all so now we need to talk about apps because apps are the way these things become in theory smart so each of these does have an iOS app or that I have downloaded onto my phone I think most of them support Android but I'm not sure how well I'm not gonna make coffee with each scale because that would be reasonably wasteful and I tried to waste less these days I'll just be pouring water from pouring capital into a brewer to mimic the kind of pouring you would have with a be 60 it should let us see how the apps work and I'll let you see what I see on my screen so let's start with the tim'm or black mirror so that's good news and it's crashed immediately and there we go let's try that one more time and crash right what an auspicious start for a smart scale we finally have an app connected to the phone which is terribly nice only took deleting and reinstalling the app which is perhaps not the ideal user experience now what you can see from the app is that you have some level of pre-loaded recipe in here and if you jump into the settings it'll let you play with your ratio which is very common thing here a lot of them won't do that kind of 1 to 40 1 to 15 thing which I have said I'm not an enormous fan of then what's frustrating to me is that I might want to brew 30 grams to say 500 but because I'm stuck in a ratio slider I can't actually get it to do that the closest I can get us 510 now you can select your bean really quite an odd selection here you've got mandela guatemala a weirdly spelled Yirgacheffe saddam oh but no ethiopia you've got yunnan which is good but also pak'ma'ra which is a variety blue mountain geisha Kona Kenya I don't get it I'm really a little bit confused ok so we're ready to brewing a brood just over here to try and prevent too much sound of brewing coming through on the microphone so let's go let's let's start with a loud beep so what you get here on the screen is a pretty typical kind of blueprint I think that's a hires term for it but a sort of simple chart showing cumulative weight over time so you have like a bloom phase you let it run for a while more and then add more now one thing where the scale is it will tell you off if it thinks you're brewing a bit too aggressively loudly will tell you off I don't really know what triggers it there's not already an obvious setting to control that it obviously just thought I was pouring my water too quickly but it doesn't beep to tell me I've hit my target weight seems odd and it doesn't really care that I've got in there too quickly just if you hit a certain g/s I think on the flow rate then that's that's bad let's save and I get to comment is it excellent is it good average poor bad let's talk about that later there's some flavor descriptors here you could add them you can use theirs there's pretty limited choices I can track which device I used then you get your blueprint down there and I can save that as a record and you can share it but into WeChat which is something that a lot of people outside of mainland China are really using and there you go you've brewed that is the that's the black mirror when it when it works so a little bit buggy I know it's really just kind of just out of beta but certainly a slightly frustrating experience there to start with and I'm not hugely sure that the way is trying to guide me into brewing is particularly intuitive or helpful and now we have this scale app which has I think the ugliest app I think I could think of it looks like someone who's designed this has done like a bad job porting it to iOS from something else the layout is all screwy and messed up they're kind of mixed sort of typography and and everything else it's it's not it's not much fun now you've got a few little things here you've got a timer it's got a it's got a kind of unit function which it might be some sort of brew ratio thing I don't really understand but anyway let's start and all it's doing is is sort of tracking weight and tracking time which is pleasantly simple frankly there's no charting of this data it's just a simple graphical display it's just an ugly one if I'm honest so as much as it might be smart it's not it's not hugely smart there's a start-stop for the time where there's no option to save anything here but that's that that's the app it's not remotely intuitive to me it's not particularly helpful and it's not in any way beautiful yeah it's more good okay next up on our list is the Felicity incline let's open up that app let's open up this scale give a little boot up and something's crashed or hung I don't really know it just is saying Felicity on the scale are you annoyed do you put weight on you so secret here apparently is to to open the scale first and then open the app which seems to me probably like a bug not the first so again a pretty minimal app a little bit more beautiful than the scale app though essentially showing you the same data at the beginning there is the opportunity to build out a rest why this is black type against a dark background I have no idea again we've got a weird selection of origins which come with to protect oh no can we take multiple what's happening here we've got a misspelled Columbia always a win Brazil Pama I don't understand Salvatori I assume is supposed to be at El Salvador Cameroon let's pretend with brains to go from Cameroon we can track their brute tools and our kettle I don't know why I track those things I guess if I was tracking everything I might and then let's add some coffee in here oh goodness me that's an unpleasant way to put it in data now it's quite easy to miss tap the ok' button and then end up moving your ratio out there and again i can't change my water to be what I want it to be I'm stuck with a fixed ratio thing deep breath and let's hit go let's see what happens so a hot water injection that's happening here oh my lord this is hideous and confusing this chart is the least intuitive thing I think I've ever seen so you're getting a blueprint but at the same time this ridiculous sort of very large brew rate I guess pour rate flow rate display that looks like it was designed in the mid 80s let's go with that I mean that orange and blue combo is delightful the pixelated nature and the slow refresh rate it's it's all bad don't I don't feel good it's steaming oh wait we're blooming but it's not blooming its steaming so not smart enough to realize that I poured my entire water weight in here but now it knows that I've paused its pause the timer which is particularly weird because you would usually include your bloom time in your pour time and in a moment eventually when we're done steaming in so many ways we can begin again the coffee is good the coffee is good click Save I presume that's just touch the button when I get a blueprint and I can edit my remarks it was a flowery and nutty no it's either flowery or nutty it's a little bit of a mess I'm not sure why ruff deserves a beam symbol either that's kind of weird and let's save that and there we go I'm now back at a screen where it's telling me to click Save again but we know I'm done if I click Save when I go back to here but it's lost all my data so let's just come out of there I've saved it where does it go red where does it go get your recipe is saved somewhere magically that you can't access anymore did I just lose my mind I'm done I'm done with this particular scale for today this app is also bad so now before we dive into the suite of acai our apps we're going to talk about the Hajime the most expensive scale we have here so let's try turning it on first good let's open I'm Jimmy our friendly app and we're greeted by yet another reasonably an attractive screen you've got espresso mode pour-over mode training mode and display mode I'm not sure where the letter J is is there to represent display mode but but that's essentially just gonna mirror what we see here on the phone which for a scale with the remote detachable thing I don't know why you'd need the whole point of this scale is that you you know you got this thing to put where you want to be and then also have your phone I don't know when I would need to have two displays at any one time let's look at training mode now this will train you to pour at a specific flow rate we're going to train for 30 seconds at 5 grams a second let's start training so how skilled am i at the old flow rate so aggressive there we go six grams well I guess score we can compete and see who is the slow careful pouring champion thing I've got a four out of five score well done me and you get a little brew printer that's quite pretty actually I've got to say this is a nice looking blueprint to style thing I'm not going to try again I think I'm done now we do also have a spresso mode just to Jupiter that quickly now here it's kind of problematic because what your choices are with these three espresso states are the way that the timings on starts as on or stardom that kind of stuff so you know auto tare auto start none of this is useful because none of the starts will correlate to your pump being switched on it'll be correlated to liquid hitting a cup in some way or a cup going down on a scale and only being tare doubt but none of it connects to your actual pump starting which is the correct time to track your espresso from so I don't really understand the why of this here which leaves us with poor of a mode we've got a previous brew in here let's design a recipe we Liberty 30 grams we're gonna brew a ratio of 1 to 17 but I can edit my water which is nice I can brew 30 to 500 so here we've got a suggested to thing where it's gonna give us a two-to-one and then a 20-second bloom and then to pause of to varying speeds let's see what happens so we get a little flow rate thing here again let's go oh it aggressive it says slow down and then I'm an old bean fills up and I know to stop and then it counts down the appropriate time to bloom that's just fast-forward that now it's distracting me to brew at four Mills a second here which I probably didn't notice when I was designing that recipe is actually an incredibly slow brew rate let's go with quicker let's make it cross oh it's red it's angry I ran out of water that's okay we're done we're done and so now we've actually got a sort of tracking of what happened and then you can choose to save it if you want to and the record is now saved there's no tracking of did you like it did it taste fruity or nutty or floral or any of that sort of stuff it's just a track of this is a brood that sort of happened that is broadly speaking the hajime and now onto the Akaya which is gonna be tricky now of the apps in my little coffee apps folder four of them belong to a kya which is an interesting reasonably frustrating choice and they all do different things and some of them are more focused on this scale which is extremely feature-rich and as I said I'm not gonna have a chance to go into all of the things this thing can do but I'll make sure there's links down below so you have obviously an update which is not hugely important right now you've got a nakiya app a brewmaster app and a brew guide app let's begin with just the Akaya app you have a feed of kind of social media stuff that I'm just not going to go into and a very simple tracking type thing so let's hit play and then we can track water going in can we hit play no we can't I don't know why I can't hit play just let's reset everyone here let's tear you out let's go to a different app and here is the problem and this isn't actually a Caius fault this is actually the way iOS works you would think of that my phone and this scale are now connected and so if I open let's say a different app like brewmaster then this this app would be able to access this scale but it can't it can't because that connection is locked up inside the previous app so if I try and add a scale where are we settings slaves and I cut a scale there are no scales and range that's because this scale is no longer visible because it's connected to a different Akaya app there's no way around this you got two choices I could turn the scale off and back on again which would kill the connection or I can kill my previous app or it could kill my Bluetooth on my device all of this is ugly all of this is a hacky unpleasant feeling thing to do in this case I'm gonna turn it off I'll turn it back on again lo and behold it's here inside my my scale choices and I can connect to it I can see it I've got my information about all the stuff there and we're back and we're ready to go with our with our brew so now we can have we can have bring that you're not connected anymore why are you not connected can't connect to scale but you just were you just said I'm connected Slate's on the car scale there are no scales and right how are the no scales range we just went through this we just connected deep soothing breaths deep soothing breaths so now we're ready to brew we're in that the log our brew section so we can hit start and this will produce a hope a nice little graphical portrayal of what's happening here so you have a logged bar chart a flow rate and then you've got a kind of cumulative brew that produces that kind of group print that is I think their term they coined it belongs to them I don't for other apps but it's it's their thing I think and and again very similar to everyone else is you can see a nice little graph and everything is great so there we go that's done so now we can save it we can name it we can do a whole bunch of stuff that's good we can add lots of things a little smiley face temperature brew time all of that camp stuff is there oh here we go there we go I can take a photo there we go and that will be a tremendous photo to have in the future I'll know exactly what that was at that point so there is the app called brew guide so one particular feature of this thing is that you can upload a recipe into the scale itself the scales large display at each stage will prompt you to do the next thing and in theory you can have this kind of prompting in the mornings without having to open an app now of course I can't connect these two because they're still connected with a previous app so let me just kill you there we go we're back again tremendous and now I can go in and I can select my app upload okay and then this this guide gets uploaded and then there is a brewing mode where I would invoke the guide and everything would be great and it would do the prompting for me and that's it it's surprisingly slow to upload I've got to be honest this is ticking along pretty slowly I can't imagine there's actually a ton of data here but there we go we're done we're done so the scale now knows what we're doing and that's good and it talks to me on a subtle display and that's nice but can you feel the lack of enthusiasm emanating from my body well let's let's do a wrap-up in just a second here I do need to talk about the Brewster which claims to be a smart scale but does not connect to your telephone and in doing so I'll begin to wrap up and do a quick talk through each device before telling you which is the one that I think is the best let's talk about the Brewster it is the the simplest of them it doesn't connect via bluetooth it is rechargeable via a nice little microUSB at the back it is a traditional way pan scale so you have a solid base it's real tactile buttons those are good things in a simple way pan the smartness of it revolves around some level of calculation around or ratios every time I use this I have to go back and get the instructions out because it just defeats me with the way that it thinks it drives me a little bit crazy whispers these are these are the instructions that come with it that tell you how to use it and despite the fact that I've tried and failed many times so auto mode so place the brewing scale on the platform after three seconds it should zero out oh it did that took some time that's not an intuitive thing there's no countdown there's no timer this is not particularly obvious so now I can add my coffee let's pretend I've added ooh 33 grams of coffee and now I push the ratio button no yes okay and then that calculates for me my 1 to 16 ratio which is great so the cab like honors here and I can start brewing and the timer should start automatically the timer should start automatically the time we should start timer no I don't know what I've done wrong I don't know how to make anything do what I want to do I just so defeated by these things they're just I'd be just very stupid I can't got the instructions in front of me I'm just not having a good time and and ah look look I must operate right now these are all examples of technology that exists because it can not because it should I don't really understand who they think is using these scales in these apps sure there are some people that want to track every brew but there has to be a better way than fighting a Bluetooth connection before you've had coffee in the morning why we can't just have a scale that connects to Wi-Fi securely and then just has a log button on there you know what I mean like if you want to record it just push record and from that point onward to the scale records what you're doing until you say stop or you take the the brewer off or all that sort of stuff that's easy to detect I don't want to have to find and use my telephone before I've had coffee I don't and I figure most people don't either and I would say most people that have a smart scale don't use the app measure at the time by having these feature-rich scales that have two buttons that have to be used at a bunch of combinations you make people feel stupid I often feel stupid I've often found myself stuck in a place where the display is doing something I don't understand and I don't know how to get back because because there's no guidance on the scale I can't remember the button combination I'm supposed to use it's not natural it's not intuitive to me it's frustrating and that's the case with all of these things so I'm gonna run through them quickly and I'll share my thoughts as a quick summary on each one I'll track you become so the black mirror it has no markings anywhere on it and that frankly is extremely frustrating trying to find the power button to turn on is incredibly annoying it also has the single most irritating beep I I don't want to hear that beep that early in the morning I will be printed to Akaya they do a nice beep this beep it's not a good beep I just wish the beep was less annoying the scale I think is again a little bit confusing the two button shapes aren't particularly helpful it doesn't feel particularly expensive and it's not I think it's the cheapest of all the scales here the app is terrible I the only reason I have this scale is it because it connects to my decent espresso machine and that will be viola reason I keep it for any amount of time though I know that John a decent is working on his own set of scales for the future this is all-in-all difficult to recommend it's ok it's just it's just not very good on paper I quite like the Felicita in clan scales they're simple they can be set up to do two things which is time and weight or just weight if you want to the app is not particularly good but that's okay I can do most of what I need to do with it it's just there for a pretty expensive way to do it I'm kind of using the same features I would have in the original hairier scale at close to twice the price I can't recommend this in good faith though because Felicita frustratingly completely ripped off the shape and design of a Caius lunar scales and that is not OK so these are kind of out of the contention from that perspective the Brewster smart scales I don't think are particularly smart they're not particularly intuitive I appreciate having a base and tactile buttons that we don't particularly like the buttons on this that much it's ok it's just built to do a really specific thing in a way that I don't really get on with if this totally fits your workflow you might have a nice time it's interesting that for the same money as other scales here it's about a hundred pounds it doesn't come with more features that is not necessarily a criticism is just notable that it's the same price without the same kind of feature sweep there's no price of app development or maintenance going on behind the scenes here it's ok it's for poor overs and really nothing more and it's kind of a shame you know like by confining the way it works it reduces its broad usefulness and then we have the Harwich Immy this I think is actually interesting because they took a risk and they did something new and they had a scale where the display disconnects and it's magnet so you can mount it on top your espresso machine if you want to pull shots with it but having it this way having these sort of 5 pin connectors here mean that neither part is waterproof it's a traditional base and way pants of so a style model which again means electronics are exposed so yeah you can brew espresso with this but bear in mind you could damage and destroy an incredibly expensive thing and that is so much money for the money I would expect a better app for the money are expected to be waterproof for the money I would expect a longer battery life and this currently gives a respect that they've tried to do something new the build is great it feels solid it feels reliable it's cool but it's also nearly 300 pounds or dollars that is that is too much money that is just too much money and I can't strongly recommend something that's just that expensive when I'm not sure that you get two to three times the features of other scales and that leaves me with this the Akaya scales and I would say Akaya have set the bar for smart coffee scales they changed the game with their original set that kick started a few years ago and they continue to really lead the pack it's frustrating that they have so many apps in the nature of app connection is is that way it's frustrating they spend a lot of time and dev money on features that I don't think personally are hugely useful if you really want to track your Bruce if you want to chart everything and have that data accessible have that data available to share this is easily the best choice it's probably the only choice I think but I still just feel like they're doing things that don't need to be done that creates a more cluttered confusing frustrating experience as a normal user I would be very hesitant to broadly recommend smart scales to everyone if they fit a really particular need that you have then yes go for it and I would say the Akaya is the best in class right now but if you just want to make coffee in the mornings then I'm not sure you need a smart scale I'm not sure you want a smart scale that's my rant that's my rant on the topic I'd really be interested to know your thoughts too in the comments let me know do you have a set of smart scales already do you use the apps that come with it all the time did you use them a few times and then stopped did you never release them at all do you think that there's something that I've missed about some of these scales do you think there's some features that I didn't talk up enough that I was unfair I'd be really interested to know your thoughts share your comments down below I look forward to reading them and as always thank you so much for watching we had a great day [Music]", "wKpjgVwd9o8": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] we've got the Aldi blends we've got to choose from Guatemalan blend and the to Pichu blend the three that's what's going in the blender very nice that's a good smell so let's see alibi guy just gonna get it without destroying it no scissors needed a lot these brown paper bags and that's my little bit quite a light roast then quite a nice light roast they look very nice I'm gonna bring him in alone nine let's get in ground down took down some great results for these howdy beans these are the machupicchu blend I got the right it cooks this morning there's a lot I can't stop pickle pin but we're talking out of that would nearly use the old bag sock safe so some great results I'm going to find a few more in the blender I'm gonna put a letter out and we'll just show you that quality because it's really nice Rick oh god it cooks really not now these little fellas they're a mild roast on the description they're saying they're Peruvian yeah growing our crops in the Peruvian the Peruvian Andes sounds nice tastes not joke about the way the original was a nine on the grinder and I'm still sticking out I tried they're just an either way but nine seems to be the best one and we can pipe quite nice camera on these get a decent a head on it lovely with a latte [Music] like bash down only like tongue I'm not been going for the fool just a light tongue and that pot now it's beautiful and smooth the coffee grinds up very fine it's lovely let's go through the night a glass so you can actually see the crema coming out [Music] rising to the top beautiful it really does come out nice I put a lot of been through this blender grind up machine and there's not many that you can get ahead like that with so that's a good stop it's a good base to get some steam going up just let this warm up well that just settles it still settling still the creme still rising to the top there's always that point now if you leave it too long where it starts this dissolve again and gets thinner and I'll just let this sit let steam for me it's got a really nice smell to it it's quite a fruity smell this one now this one is saying it's got chocolatey nose citrus almonds almonds and chocolate dark chocolatey maybe maybe I'd say as it is straight out as an espresso it comes out of course is quite a strong taste but when you put that I'd say down there it's beautiful [Music] my Paul in terms of that they are but look at that it's not scribble but the proof is in the taste for this one [Music] it's so nice it's a really smooth really smooth taste subtle now this just really bored it in with the milk I've got to say it that's one of the best beans we've had it's really nice really nice there's no bitter aftertaste now you can with the milk in there you can taste that it's a bit dark chocolatey I can't get the nutty taste coming through but it is a really really smooth nice flavor I'm trying to think what it can best compare it to to what we've what we've had in the past and I want to say it's a bit like the Lavazza crema that's a crema aroma I think it was called and it tastes very similar to that one yeah that is good hmm it just sits on your tongue really nice like say no it's not bitter it's very smooth it tastes it takes a really good quality it really does taste like a quality being that I'll be keeping mock me out for a few more we've got the other Aldi been to try which is crap in this one open Charlotte the Guatemalan blend which is coming into this is science of for I don't think the number is actually associated flavor strength or anything I know I think he's just to say it's a four in their range and yeah so this one socks at least when the Machu Picchu was the Peruvian the coffee beans in our Machu Picchu blend on growing the crop tips in the Peruvian Andes in the column bomba and mera new areas of the aroma River which is nearby me to beat you all my pronunciation as a great angle enjoy soft creamy mouthfeel with citrus and milk chocolate nose and sweet roasted almond on the finish a guy with this is soft and creamy yeah I love laughing that spot-on citrusy milk chocolate I say I think he's a bit dark he's too kind of got dark chocolate it's got lovely aroma to it as well really smells nice so with this I'm gonna put that last plane out there that is that's definitely up alongside that Lavazza Raza and quite a mild bein yeah it's nice it's not done all sorts with this one's well we've done the so the lactase I've added espressos mixed it up a bit and it seems to come out and all all fronts tasting really nice how it does it again with a decent thing a decent product yeah can't wait to try these get them in blend one out do another another taste with you on that hopper to go though so we'll get cracking on with them it's not one lie let's look at the pork so I was out really easily everybody as you can see it's got a really good saturation through the through the blend it's gone right through so we've got a really good extraction there which you can tell when the creme is coming out so well you know you've got a good extraction so it was a mild tamp I don't on the nine blend I've done it on the nine grind on the rocky grinder if I if I went to an eight or seven it was just too so it was too slow on into extraction I've tried light in the tamp up a bit more but it wasn't right so the nine with a light amp is the best results I've had with this with this blend so it's funny how you can adjust you can adjust all your little your tamping pressures and your groin levels to get that flavor just wrong and I don't think I'm far off without I think that is a really good beam that's a great a great flavor that's been of any use to you tell me a thumbs up like subscribe got me a comment if you're just trying to know sir so let me know thanks for watching I'll tell you all it's a great cure for hiccups cause they've gone so if you've got it pops and you can't get rid of them the match of pitcher blend is for you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause]", "hM6XSfaNDRo": "well here we are look at that mythical beast million good mythical more welcome known to hypnotized mythical beasts worldwide well it's not a swirl it's just concentric circles me I look at this for three hours yes if you're hypnotized by concentric circles you just need to get more rest yes so we changed the packaging for a couple of reasons we changed it because we're kind of every single thing that we're selling you know our our beauty products like the pomade and the beard oil grooming products they're all going to have a complimentary packaging and the first one that's been made over is the pomade but also this is much easier to access we actually got some feedback that people said that getting into the pomade of course it's sealed for your safety I can't get into it right now and I don't want to unseal it but the first time you use it you should take that seal and put it in your hair right you can actually use the seal to apply with as a facial lotion but baby dissolves said that they can get into this in a better way which I think the other one was I mean I didn't have trouble getting into it but this is a more traditional packaging also doubles as a drum until you break the seal great for drum circles yeah very small just small drum circles like you and nobody else those are the best drum circles the ones that don't you know noise pollute public parks you got another one try it whose have been anybody here been in a drum circle like for real I really committed to it came out oh there's a baby and then there was a forest fire and they had is they lost all their drums wasn't that the same story like somebody was getting married and then there was a camp you were camping there was a forest fire all the drums burned up a pair of home safe yeah the thing about a drum circle is I understand and actually people say that there's something psychological going on that there's like a drone level thing that people are like their brains are getting in sync and stuff like that but the thing that bothers me is that I sometimes I'll like walk past park and I'll see like eight people in a drum circle and then I'll come back by the same park at the end of the day and the same eight people will be in a drum circle while they get in a zone literally and it just makes me worried for them well you seem to pay for those drums should be worried for us because um unless this is a good idea coffee beans and rice it's not a good idea we thought about coffee beans and Franks I thought about look at that Valentina you think this is big enough you think this bottle is big enough we got a lot of people around here that like hot sauce so we were trying to figure out how many coffee beans equals a cup of coffee in the caffeine and a cup of coffee and chase just said that three coffee beans well three coffee beans is 36 milligrams of caffeine which is about the same that's in a in a you know coke right but then coffee has 95 milligrams so about nine coffee beans eaten straight is like drinking one cup of coffee in terms of Kathleen he's hedging it depends on the bean don't quote me on that I mean it's not just a bean spot it's not my fault well then I'm gonna eat three beans get some rice no I'm gonna mix it in there I don't want to get proportion you remember that stint beans and rice face beans and rice face and where we would go to Bojangles and you and we were like you know what not getting fried chicken we're just getting beans and rice you order like a signle style of pinto beans in a dirty rice family-style dirty rice family-style dirty dirty beans dirty means and we'd pour them both out on the plate no I mean a big plate and then you put Texas Pete hot sauce all over it I want to do that right now and then I don't want this I want that but I remember very quickly as we're eating it we're like we should get like some chicken and then we don't want to eat so much fried chicken we want to be healthy I'm sure that was your ID no it would be good I never have an idea to be healthy the beans and the rice together and then you get the the chicken tenders from Bojangles and cut them into pieces and mix that into I think we do though now here let's not forget Lester let us not forget let us not forget that the dirty rice has chunks of sausage in it so it's not like we weren't eating meat true that oh good and you know what leftover dirty rice from borrowed anger the next day it's better it's even better it's even dirtier the next day is so dirty so wrong it becomes nasty so right yeah dirty the nasty then it gets naughty naughty right naughty writes on the third day Lori Lori and then Yanni I didn't gotta throw it out and afford that naughty now D oh you they soak the beans I was waiting for a crunch like they're erosive they're not roasted they're just boiled for safety oh man I can't I can't I can't figure out when I'm chewing a bean and when I'm chewing rice I can it taste like mmm tastes like a felf taste first into a folger spill this is not this is not meant to be it's not meant to be you guys if you were testing this on us the testers say no hmm hmm I mean if you ate this whole thing you'd be wires all wired mm-hmm remember that in those days well you like got wired because you had something to do I don't do that anyway I never did that I drank the King mocha told my story many times I never did that so shots of espresso so I could prepare for an exam stay safe thanks for sticking around for good mythical more if you want to watch more well we don't have good mythical more more we do have a lot more videos here's two of them also click the circular channel icon to subscribe", "tD-mySiaAyY": "[Music] Seattle is giving birth to a brand new type of coffee it's called a Tomo and its coffee made without a coffee date so let's go check it out and see what it tastes like this is what a timer calls molecular coffee it's made from all natural ingredients and the proprietary formula looks like a regular cup of cold fruit and yes it still has caffeine so here are a couple of those raw materials in a very early prototype and I can feel it the texture is quite cost but it has a very similar properties to a normal ground coffee that where you would put in any of your pour overs or your arrow presses taking a sniff very earthy this is not representative of what the final product will smell like it smells pretty good so I'm very excited to have a taste and see how it all comes together [Music] so what goes on in this lab there's a lot of moving machines and some concoctions in front of us yeah sure so this is a this is our what we call our roasting lab right and while we're not roasting beans we are roasting some plant based materials that we end up using in our formulation the vials in front of us are different components that make up what we call the big five in coffee right and that's the body the color the aroma the flavor and the bioactives so so the first pot that we have right in front of us right there this is what we call our base so if I smell these it does smell like a good start put it on here put on there and then there we got a mixer in there and we're gonna create a beautiful vortex that we're gonna end up using to mix up so this first element is got some characteristic bitterness that you have the coffee now one thing you should note is our first cup of coffee we are aiming at an ultra-smooth cup coffee so not very acidic not very bitter the idea is we drink it without the cream or sugar yeah which means you can whether you were a coffee drinker or not a coffee drinker this should be pleasant for you I want you to pick up on some of the aroma that went in there too because there was some aromatic compounds that were in there too and you can note it started to take the shape of coffee actually smells a little bit more nutty yeah like I got a little bit more of that because before it was just like a burst a little sweet there was some other stuff in there yes I see okay all right next compartment you'll see it start to take life I see some texture for me you'll see some color thing you'll smell those aromas oh yeah try that whoa that really smells like coffee now mmm that smells really nice I can't smell any bitterness or any of that sourness either it's quite rich actually yeah the last element now that looks like coffee right yeah yeah it's got some of the remember I said some of the color components that we associate with coffee and then we'll give it some time for everything to mix together and everything to mature together and then we'll take and we'll go do a tasting sounds good [Music] hey Andy it's time for the taste test now yeah welcome we have lined up for you some of the most popular cold Brews out there and we want to see if you can pick out which cold brew is ours oh okay this is this is interesting because it's a it's a blind test umekes I haven't seen which ones you pull it however I did smell the breed that we just like you've an advantage right okay I'm gonna stop from anywhere doesn't start out anywhere yeah you can cleanse your palate in between if you wish um it's a very traditional cold brew a little bit bit of mm-hmm definitely taste it just tastes like a coffee yeah this one is smoother definitely smoother a little bit sweeter this one is sweeter I can tell instantly that one's is very like caramely very smooth as well mm-hmm hey cleanse again this one's a little more sour than the previous one a little bit more again that's nice it's not better than I like that one okay lucky last let's see this one smooth it has it's kind of like a combination of all of these three oh now I have to see which one I think is one is that which one I think is your coffee okay I I think I'm gonna narrow down to two it could be I think it's either this one or this one mm-hmm I think it's this one is it is it that one you are correct okay but here's the thing I did smell it beforehand right and it does it smelt a lot I look like what I had smells but this one's are pretty good yeah this one is definitely like I wouldn't be fooled completely because it's it's coffee it's just not with a bingo [Music] this is our almond mocha okay so this is almond milk in it and this is essentially the same brew and the nature is very similar base to it but it also has cocoa in it that's not from the cocoa okay mmm that's smooth it's nutty well that could be your afternoon that's an afternoon drink that's your little dessert okay so I've got my bean list from morning to evening absolutely right every step of the way okay I'm gonna have to take a couple these so why do we need a coffee that's not made from a bean like it it seems like a problem that doesn't necessarily need a solution it many people don't understand the problem that coffee is facing around the world and the problem is is that climate change in global warming there's really affecting the coffee growing regions so coffee can be grown in a very narrow band and that band is really sensitive to the temperature because the beans actually if it's too hot the beans mature too quickly and when a coffee bean matures too quickly it doesn't have all the aroma and flavor so what we hope will happen is that farmers will continue making great coffee but as the demand for coffee increases and as they can no longer support the growth that they can transition to our coffee so what if I'm a coffee lover who loves a variety of different blends from different regions like how are you gonna try and emulate say a kenyan or an ethiopian coffee yeah each one of those coffees has a unique signature to it whether it's more acidic or more bitter or kind of roasty-toasty you can actually mimic those qualities exactly so down to the molecular compounds and say let's create a kenyan today or let's create the oken so what about espresso grinds is that something you're working on too so we know that baristas love to have the whole beans and so for those baristas we want to supply that whole bean for them hang on so your reengineering coffee without a bean but then you're turning it potentially into a bean at the end it's right that's how crazy we are yeah that's that's crazy [Music] so it turns out the coffee make without the bean actually tastes pretty close to the real deal thanks so much for watching if you liked the video make sure to give it a thumbs up and if you want to try this very fine coffee for yourself it's gonna be available in 20/20 in cold brew for [Music]", "HxUh8YJgDT8": "oh that's good you know what's really good about it i actually roasted this coffee myself and you can too so this video as i mentioned before is the departure from video games but lots of coffee fuels lots of video gamepl and we do the roasting in our backyard in a machine and i'm going to talk a little bit about our journey through this so today's video is not sponsored by anyone i will mention a couple of companies that have used in the past to actually purchase the beans and they may not be the best and if anyone watching this video is into the coffee selling business the wholesale i'll pop you in the description just send me a message put it in the comments happy to do it or if you yourself roast your own coffee i'd love to have your comments in there so this episode on brew united is actually about roasting your own coffee it's not giving me an exclusive uh in-depth guide on what to do but what i can tell you is maybe it's something you want to try so stick around and find out [Music] okay so if you're still watching this video first thing you're probably going to be asking yourself is all right how do i do this okay well first thing you got to figure out coffee beans you got to figure out where to get coffee beans okay so i'm going to go through one place that i've been using and it's called sweet maria's so they sell coffee from many different places all around the world they have tasting profiles so you can figure out what you like and you can then order direct so it comes to the house and then you have yourself a one pound bag of green coffee beans you can have yourself a five pound bag there's a ten pound bag and let's show you the big one there is a twenty pound bag of coffee so wow i need a lift 20 pounds of coffee is a lot to go through now what would the average two people drink in a week well if you're like my wife and i we roast about 12 ounces of coffee per week and that lasts us roughly six seven days now sometimes and you may be this person you're out there going you know what i drink more than that okay so you might so what what does this cost all right why would you do this well for one there could be an economic reason to do it so five to six dollars per pound coffee is very doable on this site and with shipping maybe it's a little bit more so buying in bulk 20 pounds we actually have like 100 pounds downstairs that's a different discussion but you can actually uh save money so what's the average bag of coffee going for pop it right here your average run of the mill let's just use starbucks right starbucks right here so for that price a little bit of kitchen math and you can say all right if this is five to six bucks per pound by the way it could go up to 18 to 20 if you're looking at really exotic beans we're not going to touch on that in this particular episode but what we're talking about is pretty cheap savings now you're going to need something to roast it and here's the funny story of how we started out on a popcorn air popper now i thought we were like this really bohemian type setup right we weren't lots of people actually start out roasting on an air popper it was really good because we've tasted for the first time fresh coffee now there's lots of now micro roasting coffee houses that are out there we have one locally where i live and their coffee is actually pretty good but typically they roast it more like for starbucks for me they just roast that way too much but typically every place roasts too much me so i like a nice medium coffee where you can get a really nice flavor coming out of it so that's what actually i like and my wife likes now everyone around me seems to like really dark coffee and then get good for you you know that's that's great okay now that we've gotten where to buy the coffee out of the way and we've talked about the air popper roasting let me actually show you the process and i'll show you kind of some of the things you should look out for and we'll talk about some of the terminology right here so one of the first things you're going to want to do is to get an accurate scale to make sure that you're getting whatever measurement of coffee you want to do so our machine can do a pound of coffee that's not actually what i've found out it's rated for that but really if you want a solid roast you want to make sure you can either take it from medium to dark you're going to want to do a little bit lower so instead of 16 ounces we actually go with 12. so the machine we use to roast our coffee is the baymore 1600. we've had it for quite a few years it's battle hardened you can see it's got some discoloration from the coffee roasting over the years i could say after hundreds of roasts and even the fact that i really don't maintain it well it has been an absolute beast as far as roasting coffee after you hook up the machine to the power you're basically going to want to take the coffee that we pre-measured and you're going to want to put it in the roasting cylinder it's pretty easy to put it in there one thing to notice though is that hinge if you're trying to shake off the coffee at the end one of the problems is you better hold both ends because that door will go flying open and all your nice roasted coffee that that latch holds will go flying out so one thing you're going to make sure of when you first put it in is that the rotisserie basket fits perfectly so it's got a side and it's also got a rotating piece on the left if it doesn't move as shown here you basically are just going to roast one side and burn your coffee and then you also put in the tray to make sure that any of the chaff that comes off which you'll see near the end of the roasting is secure once you've completed that it's pretty easy hit one pound of coffee i hit power one and i hit start and then you can see the roasting basket is moving as we expected very good so there's a learning curve here on how to roast your preferred level this is about 17 minutes to roast at medium and that's going to vary on a lot of things you know outside air temperature if you've preheated this particular device all kinds of things from here our coffee's done so i'm going to hit cool and i'm going to show you the chaff that i was talking about earlier you can see the smoke you can see the chaff coming off the pop coffee beans there is a whole art to understanding when to stop this this video won't cover that i'll pop a link in the description to explain all that okay 17 minutes of roast about 12 minutes of cooling and we are ready let's pull the coffee out let's show you the color and look at that a little bit of chaff coming off but this is actually really clean coffee really impressed and just a perfect roast you can see it's medium i'll just do a little bit of a dive here and show you on my hand the color look at that beautiful fresh roasted coffee okay so i did most of this video from the economic standpoint but let me go ahead and just wrap up with saying it just tastes way better to do it this way it's my personal belief and unless you've tried fresh roasted coffee you really have no idea what you're missing so you can look into some websites that actually do roasting and they actually send in a really short period of time from fresh roasted i guess that would be pretty good you know if you don't want to do this investment but you know what find someone that does this locally you know try it out learn more about it i mean really if you're into coffee and you just keep getting the same run-of-the-mill stuff from the store or you go by starbucks or something try something different i mean branch out that's what this video is about it's about to challenge you the viewer to maybe reach a little bit outside your comfort zone would i try the air popper again yeah if i hadn't done this i would do that i would get like a 10 air popper from wherever and i would try it there's other methods to do it so what i've shown you is the baymore that's actually the one that i roast in again i've done hundreds of rows on this thing and it's worked really well so i hope this video has maybe shown you some sides of coffee roasting maybe it has inspired you to try it yourself or maybe it's just like you know what brew this is good for you but it's not good for me anyway that's fine i just wanted to pop it out there let you see a little bit different world other than kind of the video games behind me and also share with you a passion that i have for coffee so take care everyone i hope you're safe i hope you're well and we'll see you on the next episode of whatever type of topic i'm doing take care", "vFcS080VYQ0": "that's right coffee why well why not when playing a game or watching something it's a nice idea to have a drink nearby some people enjoy drinking tea others enjoy drinking coffee or maybe whiskey and even water why not if you're interested in getting into drinking coffee well I know the basics and the basics are quite enough for you to enjoy a nice cup of coffee so keep watching and by the end of the video you know the basics too there are basically two types of coffee or two types of coffee plants one of them is called Arabica and the others called robusta there are some major differences between the two the Arabica coffee usually has a better taste more smooth when compared to the robusta the robusta has more of that bitter taste that people don't usually like very much but the robusta has almost the double caffeine than the Arabica does so if you're looking for a nice taste you go for Arabica if you're looking for caffeine you go to robusta so the Arabica coffee is usually more expensive than the robusta because the Arabica plant is more delicate it's more prone to disease than the robusta the robusta plant will survive longer and give coffee the whole year long when buying your coffee you can find it on the package if it's Arabica or robusta if it doesn't say you can go by the price if it's an expensive coffee it's probably Arabica and if it's too cheap it's probably robusta Arabica is way more expensive than the robusta but they're both quite affordable if one I have both the taste of the Arabica and the caffeine from the robusta you can find some coffees out there there are mix so there are all kinds of options out there you just have to look regardless of Arabica robusta the coffee's have different roasts they go from light to dark and maybe very dark you can find now the difference between a light and the dark roast is mostly the flavour the amount of caffeine on the light and on a dark roast is pretty much the same it has minor variations but doesn't matter much so don't get a dark coffee expecting more caffeine because it probably won't make much difference get whatever roast tastes the better for you other than that you'll find all the packages things like this coffee has hints of nuts or that coffee has hints of dark chocolate and oranges or berries vanilla or whatever well unless you're a fanatic that doesn't matter much it's more like a trial and error thing you try a coffee if you like it keep buying it if you don't go for another one until you find one or two you really like it never hurts to have more than one type of coffee around it's just like tea sometimes you're more in the mood for a stronger coffee and sometimes you're more on the mood for a smooth one just as important as the coffee is the water the best idea is to use mineral water or filtered if you're going to use a tap water then remember this the quality of your coffee will be as good as the quality of your water there are several ways of making coffee I'll share with you the two ones I like the most as a general rule it's 1 tablespoon of coffee for a cup of coffee you want done you can try using a little more there or less until you find what suits your taste the bad so the first way is the most simple one with a filter just place the filter then place the coffee don't compact it or anything just let it rest there pre warm the cup if you can let's get some of that hot water place it on the cup let it rest for a couple of seconds until the cup gets hot and then get it back the ideal temperature for getting the best days from your coffee it's right below boiling point so when the bubbles begin to rush upwards that's usually the right time if you forget about it and it fully boils then just let it cool down for a minute or so and then go on and make your coffee slowly pour the water that's important and just wait now making the coffee with the filters one of the easiest ways but the paper filter also holds back some of that oil that the coffee naturally has that is why I have the second way of making coffee which is with a French press now you can get French prices from prices that go from ten to a hundred bucks don't worry about that get one that looks decent it's enough again just like you did with the filter coffee it's a good idea to preheat both the French press and your cup then you just add the coffee add the water put the top bark back on and just let it rest for four minutes after the four minutes just push it down slowly and serve if you compare both a coffee made on a filter and a coffee made on a French press you see that the coffee made on a French press is kind of thicker and has some oils on top of it but those oils might cause some problems with cholesterol if you drink too much so it's a good idea to save the French press coffee for whenever you feel like something different and then just add some sugar if you want to get your favorite game or your favorite roll and enjoy", "jVA0YXzxD9w": "thanks for checking in today i've got my rocket fuel today we're talking about roasting your own green coffee [Music] we're going to get right to how you can roast your own coffee beans at home but i wanted to let you know at the end of this video i'm going to talk about where you can buy green coffee beans how much they cost how much money you can save and some things to watch out for when you're ordering green coffee beans so stick around for that now a couple of points that you need to be aware of before you start roasting is that there is a certain amount of smell and there is a certain amount of smoke produced with the chaff burning off the beans so if you don't have a range hood that you can turn on i would recommend roasting these outdoors i do not have a range hood so we will be roasting these outside today on the porch one thing i have seen people talk about roasting them in the oven i would not recommend that and that's because a lot of the chaff will pop and burn off of the beans and then you'll end up having to wipe out your oven at the end my recommendations would be to use a cast iron skillet with a whisk to keep the beans moving around so that they don't burn and they roast evenly or what i'm going to use today is a stovetop popcorn popper i'm going to use the whirly pop popcorn popper and hopefully we'll get a nice even roast with that since i'm going to be roasting these outside i am using my single burner that i bought for canning i just plugged it in outside and other things that you're going to need are just two colanders and some way to store your roasted coffee beans um i store mine in a glass ball jar with a seal and a ring you can also buy sealable bags that have a one-way valve for off-gassing and we'll talk about off-gassing after we're done roasting the beans so stick around for that because it is an important part the first thing you want to do is turn your burner on about a medium heat and you'll have to kind of feel it out the first time burners are different temperatures are different stove top temperatures are different but generally about a medium heat so i let the popper warm up a bit on the burner before i add my green coffee beans you want to let it get a little bit hot so the roasting process starts as soon as you put the beans in and then you're just going to start turning the handle or using your whisk if you're using an iron skillet i've weighed out about eight ounces of green coffee beans the coffee beans will swell as they roast and they'll actually end up losing a little bit of weight maybe like just under an ounce or so of weight as they're roasted and that's because you're losing some moisture out of the bean as you're roasting it you will notice a smell that is kind of similar to burned popcorn when the chaff is starting to burn off it won't really have that really rich coffee aroma until after that you blow off the chaff and the beans are cooled and then once they're cooled when you smell them you'll know that that is a really good roasted coffee smell now as far as time is concerned that just depends on how dark you want your coffee beans when i roast these indoors it generally takes about nine minutes to get to the point where i like them i like a medium to dark roast outside today it about 45 degrees and so it took about 20 minutes to get it to to where i liked it but so it just kind of depends on your conditions there are what they call a first crack and a second crack and it really is cracking it actually sounds similar to popcorn popping so the first crack is when you know the coffee beans have gotten to a usable stage for um coffee grinding and making coffee if you want if you like a light to a medium roast you'll want to stop roasting sometime in between the first crack and the second crack the first crack usually lasts it's popping for maybe a minute or minute and a half and then there'll be a period of time before the second crack and to me the second crack is actually a little bit more violent cracking than the first crack when you get to the second crack you're getting to a darker roast you can either pull it off during the second crack or you can wait till it calms down and then pull it off but you don't want to roast much beyond that or you risk burning the coffee beans so if you like light to medium roast let it do a first crack maybe wait a minute or two and pull it off and you can also open the lid to the popcorn popper or watch it in the pan you can tell how dark the beans are getting if you just observe them so i generally like to pull mine off during the second crack or just right when it's starting to slow down i apologize for the tractor noise in the background i don't know if you can hear it here but it is cracking right now so now i'm going to go ahead and pull these from the heat and i'm just going to pour them into the first colander and you'll be able to see all the chaff flying off at a rapid pace this first pour you want to pour back and forth between the colanders and if you don't have a breeze that day you can use like a fan on low or you could use even a blow dryer on a low setting to get the chaff to fly off if there's a tiny bit of chaff left in there it's fine but you want to blow that all off as much as possible so once you've got your beans roasted you want to um you want to lay them out i just use a paper plate because i only do 8 ounces at a time and it doesn't take long for them to cool maybe 20 minutes or so for them to cool and what you need to know is that these beans will do what's called off gassing they will release carbon dioxide during the first 24 to 48 hours you want that carbon dioxide to go away and you don't want oxygen to come in coffee beans reaction with oxygen is what causes them to start losing their flavor so that's why when you buy already roasted coffee beans in the store it has a little one-way valve on the bag the one-way valve allows the gases to exit and the oxygen to not come in it's a one-way valve if you don't have one of those bags just take a regular canning jar tighten it just kind of finger tight maybe a little bit less than finger tight for the first 24 to 48 hours and then i seal it down the beans are going to have their best flavor 24 to 48 hours after roasting them so that's going to be your best cup of coffee i decided to make shopping for green coffee beans part 2 and there will be a link at the end of this video we'll be talking about how long green coffee beans can last where you can buy them what the cost is like and some things to look out for when you're shopping online for green coffee see you next time [Music] you", "ZgIVfU0xBjA": "You know when you want\nsomething, but you can't have it and it just makes you\ncrave it all the more. And let's say for whatever reason, you couldn't go to your\nlocal cafe right now, and you didn't have an\nespresso machine at home. Well, you might really\nwant a little flat white or a cappuccino or a latte. I'm here to help you. Today we're gonna talk about how you can get some really,\nreally, really delicious drinks without having to have\nan espresso machine. I'm gonna explore how we\ncan take coffee equipment we might already have and\na few other bits and pieces and get to something surprisingly good. Now, that isn't to say espresso machines aren't necessary or useful. The magic of espresso\nis that it can extract all of the good tasting soluble\nstuff from the ground coffee using very little liquid. You can end up with a very,\nvery strong cup of coffee that tastes fantastic, has great texture, got some lovely crema on top. That's the magic of espresso. No other brew method can do a good job of getting the flavor out of the grounds with as little liquid. Let's just say we've\ngot a good burr grinder, but one that can't do espresso, one that doesn't go fine enough to pull traditional espresso shots, like this little cheap Wilfa grinder here. But we can still use a grinder like this to get something great. Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna try and make\ncoffee that's very strong, but about half as strong as espresso. In order to get all of the good flavors out of the ground coffee that\nwe're going to start with, we're just gonna use a\nlittle bit more water. And that means we can\nuse a pretty fine grind, but not as fine, but we need to have some\nsort of percolation. We need a little bit of pressure in there to get the water through the grinds. For that reason, we're gonna\nbe looking at the AeroPress and the moka pot. These are things that lots of people have that can brew surprisingly strong coffee that tastes pretty great. Once we've looked at how to\nget the best out of those, then we're gonna talk\nabout foaming milk at home. Today we're not gonna get overly hung up on the definitions of\nwhat is a cappuccino, what is a flat white,\nwhat is a cafe latte? I just want you to make\nsomething that you like and that requires you\nhave a cup that you like of an appropriate size. Today we're gonna be trying\nto mimic an espresso in a way. So we're gonna start every time with 18 grams of ground coffee. Now, in espresso that would produce maybe 36 to 40 grams of liquid. Here we're gonna be looking more at 65 to 70 grams of liquid, using a little bit more water as a solvent to pull out some more flavor. That means we need some space in the cup for milk on top of that. So something in the six,\nseven ounces, 180, 200 mils, that sort of size is a\npretty good place to start if you like the taste of coffee, but you can go a bit bigger\nif you'd like something a little softer, a little\nsweeter, a little less intense. Let's talk about how we're\ngonna brew some coffee. First of all, let's talk grind size. For our 18 grams of coffee\nthat we're gonna use each time we're gonna be grinding pretty fine. What would be towards the limits of a typical cheap burr grinder. We should have a little\nbit of texture to it. It shouldn't feel floury in any way. It should feel a little bit between, say castor sugar and salt. It'll have a bit of texture. But on a grinder like the Wilfa, you are down at pretty much\nthe finest setting here. If you're using a grinder\nthat can go to espresso, you're gonna wanna be a little bit coarser for these techniques than you would be if you were pulling shots. Though that ground setting will be finer than most supermarket pre-ground coffee. So these techniques won't work super well if you're buying pre-ground coffee, you need a grinder to make life delicious. A quick PSA on the kinds of coffee that you could be using for this. Generally speaking, if you're\nroaster separates coffees that they've roasted\nspecifically for espresso and specifically for\nfilter or drip coffee, you definitely want\nsomething espresso focused. They're typically roasted a\nlittle bit longer, deeper, more developed to make\nthem easier to extract with less water. If we brewed with a filter coffee, chances are we'd never do\na good job extracting it and we'd have a very sour,\nunpleasant experience even when we've added our delicious, sweet milk down the line. Let's start with the AeroPress. Now, I know the AeroPress\nclaims it can make espresso. It can't, it just can't, okay? Espresso is quite a specific thing. This cannot make it. You cannot produce the\npressures necessary. You can't produce the\nconcentrations necessary. Now, this is one of the few times where I'd advocate actually for brewing in what's called the inverted method. The conventional way to brew is just to place this on the cup, add your coffee, add your water, do your extraction this way around. What some people like to do though is called the invert method\nwhere you take the plunger, this becomes your base, and in here you have a chamber where if you add water and coffee, they can't go anywhere, they can't escape. That's what we're gonna do this time. Do make sure it's plunged in\na decent amount of the way. The inverted method freaks me out because it's really easy\nto make a horrible mess and or burn yourself by\nflipping this thing around and things popping out,\nso do be very careful. So you can preheat the AeroPress, you can make sure your\nfilter is nice and rinsed and ready to go. Get your scales, add your 18 grams of coffee, and hit zero. So we're gonna add 90 grams of water now, which will give us about\n70 grams out when we press 'cause some will be\nabsorbed by the coffee. And we're gonna need to stir to make sure all of the coffee is getting wet. Now, it will be a bit clumpy because it's reasonably finally ground. So you do want to be a\nlittle bit aggressive in your stirring. Lid on, filter on. Now, we're gonna steep\nthis for 90 seconds, which seems like a really long time in the world of espresso, but this isn't the world of espresso. We're not looking at 30\nsecond brew times here. We need to do a lot of\nextraction with not much liquid. That's a real challenge here. After 90 seconds, we're gonna invert. I would say cup on first, give it a flip, give it a little swirl to make sure we've got no grounds stuck to the side, and then give it just a\nsecond to have the grounds settle towards the bottom. We're gonna press very gently. If we push too hard, we might\neffectively create a channel in that coffee bed and\ncause some under extraction. So we want quite a gentle pressing. There's no need to get crazy with it. You've got time, it's okay. And usually I would say\ndon't push all the way till the bubbling hits at the end, but here we need every gram of liquid. We want to hear that bubbling hiss. And here we go. We have 65 to 70 grams\nof very strong coffee. Perfect for diluting\nwith some delicious milk, but we'll get to that in a minute. I really like the moka pot, but I don't always enjoy the way a lot of people like to\nuse it to make coffee. You can end up with something\nvery strong, but very bitter. We're gonna be using this\nin a kind of similar way to the way I recommend using a moka pot in the video you can see up here, with a few small twists. Now moka pots are\ndesigned broadly speaking to do a kind of ten to one ratio. If you fill a moka pot to just below its over pressure valve, in this case that would be\nabout 200 mills of water and this basket holds\nabout 20 grams of coffee. We don't want all of that water to go through all of that coffee. In fact, we're gonna dose again\n18 grams into this basket. So here's the twists, we're gonna be using\nthat finer grind setting we talked about, finer than most people use\nwhen they use pre-ground coffee from the supermarket. That means that if we pushed\nall of the water through it, that would definitely over extract. We do not want to do that. We wanna aim for that same\nkind of 65 to 70 grams of water through. So here's a quick run\nthrough, start to finish. Fill it with freshly boiled\nwater to just below the valve, grind your coffee, don't\ntamp it, don't mess with it, don't compact it in any way. Put it all together and\nput it onto medium heat and no higher than medium. Now, you're just gonna\nhave to pay attention. You'll see that slow,\nbeautiful stream of coffee start to appear and it\nwill look delicious. You wanna wait until you\nhear that very first bubble, the very first bubbling. At that point, run it under the cold tap. Stop it as quickly as you can. At that point, you should have around 70 grams of liquid in a brewer like this of that kind of size or\nan appropriate amount for the size of moka\npot that you're using. So far so simple. But before you go any further, before you get the milk out of the fridge or your oat milk or your\nsoy milk or your hemp milk, any of those things, before you go down that\npathway, taste the coffee. Because at this point you need\nto know if you've messed up. If it tastes dominantly sour\nand is a little bit weak and a little bit empty and hollow feeling, you didn't grind fine enough. If it is a brutal mouthful of bitterness, you've gone a bit too fine and you can go a little\nbit coarser next time. What you don't want to do\nis prep a bunch of milk, finish the drink, taste it\nat that point and be like, \"Oh, this is disgusting. Now I have to waste the\nmilk and the coffee.\" Give it a taste. That's what you want, you want balance. There's a touch of acidity,\nbut it's not overwhelming. There's some nice sweetness and texture. It's a little tickle of bitterness but that's gonna be balanced really nicely in the next step with our foamed milk. Now, before we get into milk, there's two quick things\nI wanna talk about.

Thanks to Squarespace for\nsponsoring this video. So milk foaming. I have three options for you at three different price points. And just so you know,\nthis cost about 25 pounds, this cost 50 pounds,\nand this cost 70 pounds. All of them are cheaper than\nany decent espresso machine that might provide you some sort of steam with which you could steam milk. So while they do involve\nspending some money, they involve spending less money. Let's start with this one because it might look\na little bit familiar. This is made by Bodum, the same people who make French presses. And it looks exactly like a French press, but it costs more money\nthan a French press, which I think is a little bit cheeky. Because to be honest, it doesn't do a better\njob than a French press. So everything you see\nme do with this here, you can 100% absolutely\ndo with a French press. So here's how it's gonna work. You add hot milk up to\nthis line and no more. Now, in terms of milk temperature, I'll cover this very quickly now. Milk breaks at about 70 degrees Celsius. Above that temperature you\npermanently, irreversibly change the chemistry\nand taste of the milk. You begin to cause it to break down and create new and often\nunpleasant flavors. It gives you that kind\nof cooked eggy smell. You can't have a really\ndelicious, really hot milk drink. So generally speaking, I would\nrecommend going no higher than 65 degrees Celsius, though I'm aware with something like this, it's pretty tricky to know\nhow hot 65 degrees Celsius is without a thermometer. So if you have one that's useful 'cause you're gonna have to\nheat your milk somewhere else. I trust you to get it right. I believe in you. The principle's very simple. Go like this. And you end up with a sort\nof reasonably foamy thing that's kind of okay\nactually, it's not the worst. I have a stainless steel pitcher here that's used for pouring latte out and I'm not gonna claim\nthat I'm gonna be able to pour beautiful late\nout because I'm not, this is foamed in a French press. But the texture's okay. Nothing fancy, nothing special. You could pour kind of\nlike a simple Monk's head or something like that quite easily. Your Rosetta would not go well. How does this taste? Actually, like the foam\nisn't perfect by any stretch, but it's got a nice moussey\ntexture that would make for a reasonable cappuccino. There's a nice pleasant,\nstrong coffee taste here as you'd expect from a drink like that. Not bad. With a French press and a\nmoka pot or an AeroPress you can get a really surprisingly good cappuccino like thing that\nI think you'd really enjoy. And again, at this\npoint, I will reiterate, you can use oat milk, soy milk, any of the other milks you\nwant to alongside dairy if you don't want to do dairy. What I would say is definitely go for the barista style\nversions of those things. They tend to foam better and\nhave a better texture when hot from a kind of replication\nof that fatty richness that whole milk has. Let's move on to some fancier things. Now going into this I thought this next contender\nwas just ridiculous. It's 50 pounds and it\ndoesn't do that much, but I kind of like it. I like it more than I thought I would. The way that these work is interesting. You have essentially a kind\nof kettle with a hot jacket and inside it, there's a little\nspinny frother mechanism. This one's driven by\nmagnets inside of here, which is kind of cool. It's kind of like those\nlittle handheld whisks you used to get combined\nwith a kettle or all in one. And the way it works\nis you put your milk in up to your desired level. I'm gonna go reasonably high. Put your lid on. Push go. Now this does two things. It both froths the milk, it whips in air with that little whisk, and heats it at the same time. And by combining these actions it's a little bit frustrating. You have no control over\nhow much air goes in. You just get as much as you get. That's the one downside of these. They tend to produce more\nfoam than you expect them to. But the quality of that\nfoam genuinely surprised me. Oh yeah. It is a bit too foamy. So what I would say is\nperfectly acceptable. Get the nicest spoon you\nhave, I've got a fancy spoon, and just get rid of that foam. You're in a kitchen in the morning, I'm sure you can find a use for milk foam. Don't just throw it down the sink. Make fancy cereal or something. And then we're gonna\ngive it a little swirl and decant into our jug and see if we can pour anything with it. Now, again, it's a tricky\ntexture to pour latte out with, but you might get something\nlike a little tulip or something like that out of it. Cheers. Very good. Now, I'm not sure how much I'd advocate for you spending 50 quid on this unless you liked foamy milk drinks and you wanted them to be as\neasy as possible every day. It will heat milk without foaming it. I don't know why, I guess\nif you didn't want any foam. And it will do cold milk\nfroth too, but it's 50 quid. There are cheaper ones, there\nare more expensive ones. I was probably very anti-these. I am a lot less anti-these than I was, but it's still 50 quid. That's a lot of money for a slightly fancy kettle and a whisk. There's one more option I wanted to get and look at and talk about. And this is called the Bellman. All this does is make\nsteam for foaming milk. That's its whole purpose. It's 70 pounds online and it\nworks in a reasonable way. You've got a lid and\ninside you put your water, not too much water, not too little water, put it back together. Once it's tightened up\nagain, nice and tight, you put it on the heat. And the water inside\nboils, turns to steam, the steam gets trapped and then\nyou can just tap it off here to your steam wand with\nyour little steam valve. So far so good. This is the only option really\nthat will let you separate foaming, adding of air, from heating. The way the steam ones work is that when you're steaming with them, at the start of the process, you have the wand right on\nthe surface of the milk. When it's there, you'll hear it's there. You get a kind of slurping\nsound as it whips in the air. You can do as much of that as you want to create as much foam as you want. And then as quickly as possible really, you wanna get the wand under\nthe surface of the milk and have that steam act to\nsort of move that milk around, roll it around, smash the\nbig bubbles that you made at the start down to being so\nsmall that you can't see them. On paper this is the most\ncapable of all of the ways in terms of producing the\nbest possible texture, producing the best latte art\nif you wanna do that at home, that this is definitely it. But it will probably drive\nyou crazy before then. This thing is a little\nscary, a little frustrating, and a little bit just awkward all in one. First things first, this\nis a pressured vessel. Pressured vessels are scary things. Fear them. In your life look after\nthem, treat them well. Moka pots are pressure vessels as well. This is a much, much\nbigger version of that. They say put it on medium\nhigh heat for five minutes. There's no gauge here. There's no information. You have no idea how hot this thing is. You have no idea how much\nsteam pressure is inside of it. You have no idea when you\nhave enough steam pressure to steam milk. I, while I was testing this, would regularly just open\nthe valve a little bit to see how much steam was coming out and try and kind of gauge\nwhether that was enough to foam good milk from, you know, having used commercial machines for years and years and years. Often I guessed wrong. There wasn't enough steam. I would start to steam a pitcher of milk and it would go wrong. There just wasn't enough\npressure inside of it. I just didn't really enjoy it, but you could probably get\nsome very good results from it with a little bit of work\nand a little bit of effort. So it works okay, I just\nwouldn't strongly recommend it. Now, as a final little FAQ,\nwhen it comes to coffee brewing you could use other methods, but I would always recommend something that has percolation\nand a bit of pressure. Using a French press to\nmake very strong coffee doesn't really work, using a pour over to\nmake very strong coffee doesn't really work. It tends not to taste very good and I haven't really\nfound a way around that. More importantly, I'd\nlove to hear from you. What did I miss? What should I have covered? What do you want to see\nme touch on in the future when it comes to making\nbetter milk drinks at home? I'd love to hear from you\ndown in the comments below. But for now I say thank you for watching and I hope you have a great day.", "okBrettKsvQ": "hello and welcome to green coffee school at sweet Maria's I was using my macro lens on my film camera to get some nice close-up images and I thought well hey let's shoot some video and see if we can just look at some different green coffee and talk about it a little and I'll tell you what I'm seeing this sample here is a Colombian sample from call this region and it's a looks like a very beautiful green coffee but actually it has a smell like grass and chlorophyll it's um a very fresh sample I measured it at eleven point eight mooster content and what it is is a it's a pre-shipment sample on a coffee and it's really even too fresh to cup at this point very difficult to judge a coffee when it's this fresh the moisture contents way too high the coffee hasn't been rested properly and you can see on the the real chaff reappearance here this is the kind of look that you get on green coffee when it's milled with a high moisture percentage over on this side is actually an arrived sample of coffee which contrasting the colors looks dry and ugly and you can see that it has a lot of silver skin which will become chaff in the roaster but technically it's called silver skin it's the exo start carton pick so carp excuse me of the bean b2 that lays between the parchment layer and the the seed this sample is you know quite a lot of it but that's actually what we like to see because in the old days and in some of these current days people used to polish coffee in here I'll show you a sample this is the coffee that I think has definitely been polished even though you see something like this a good majority of them are are completely pretty pretty chaff free so that's great for roasting nobody loves chaff but it's really not good for coffee quality because it heats up the coffee when they polish it and anything that heats up green coffee whether it's a shipping container or whatever is not very good for quality now comparing this arrived sample of Columbian which is a micro lot from to Lima that's actually really good with a coffee that arrived last year which was terrible this coffee is orange Borbon you might know that if you know sweet Maria's this was a coffee from a de bottle and in in El Salvador and you can see it it's a honey coffee because you see this real red silver skin we used to call foxy beans which doesn't affect quality it just means there's a lot of miso a lot of silver skin still in the bean and it's got this reddish color which means it's got some honey coffee involved in it that's one confusing thing about it because it really wasn't supposed to be a honey coffee and what you see here like especially if you look at this one that's a real look of a faded being that's uh gives you a hint that this coffee might be baggy and might give off a baggy flavor when it's roasted in fact that's exactly what we did and we had to reject the entire shipment of it which was not make anybody that happy over here we have a you might notice right away from the size of this coffee it's not super fresh coffee but it's puffing really good you can see some aged it's getting a little bit old in here it's still holding up really well because it's all in Grain Pro and this is also kind of an unusual coffee because this is a pak'ma'ra puckum our coffees are difficult to roast and difficult to dry partly because they have many different shapes like here you have a pea berry and then here you have an incredibly flat being here I don't know what that is on it and it's sort of a bent with a canoe like shape and when these goes through the pulper they tend to get damaged a lot so Pok amar is really difficult to process well I think they found that out in El Salvador as stuff you get this real distinction between the clean flavors of flora flavors of pak'ma'ra and then the really tobacco and herbal flavors of pak'ma'ra and over here is another example of just a really nice arrived coffee again if I compare it to the that super green coffee I'm putting let's see right here is the really green coffee this is that fresh super fresh green coffee and then here is the here's the arrived coffee it's a really nice appearance for for arrived coffee lots of silver skin it's not pretty but that's what we like to see and good color it's

pulling espresso hi mark and Morgan from whole lot sale of comm in this quick tip we'll give you the basics on how to get the right grind size for espresso so what's the right rind you're setting for espresso well every grinder is different the setting of a five on one grinder has no correlation to a 5 on another your goal is to produce a two to two and a half ounce double shot of espresso in 20 to 30 seconds that timing and volume is the Golden Rule of espresso it's where most coffees are at their best where they produce the most crema and are not under extracted and watery or over extracted and bitter to get there start with a grind that is a little finer than granulated sugar pull the shot adjust and repeat if your extraction is too fast grind finer or if it's too slow grind coarser this is called dialing in a shot when dialing in shots all other variables must stay the same so grind fresh for each shot use the same dose controlled temperatures of brew water and equipment and tamp with the same force that's the key you only want grind size to change so make sure your machine is up to temperature and ready to brew and keep your portafilter on the machine but not in use so it stays warm when you change grind size run your grinder for a moment to push out any leftovers and measure the dose using the same technique every time now you can weigh it use a measured scoop or just fill the Porta filter and level it but use the same dose for every extraction you've also got a tamp with the same pressure for every shot about 30 pounds of forces recommended the actual force you use is not as important as using the same force every time and that's probably the hardest part it takes practice to tamp with a consistent force you can get a feel for it using a scale or you can use something like a smart tamp which gives you a readout of the actual tamping force or by using a calibrated tamper like this model from an S Pro the key is to be consistent with all other variables

we've been off from producing new videos for a few weeks while we rebuilt our studio and upgraded our production capabilities to bring you even more content now while we were out of production mode I was still answering a lot of questions in the video comments if you have any espresso or coffee questions use those comments and I'll do my best to get you a detailed response usually in one business day anyway far and away the most common question I get is what grind settings should I use so today I'm gonna help answer that question for you it's relatively easy to get your grind right using a process called dialing in I'll show you how to do that in a minute know that after bean selection getting your grind size right is the most critical variable in producing the best possible extraction I'll also have some additional tips with regards to grinding coffee and grind size including how you can stop static and why grind size is not set and forget so do stick around for those now to be clear the technique I'll cover in this video applies to making espresso in standard non pressurized filter baskets if using a lower-cost entry-level espresso appliance your appliance that likely uses a pressurized filter basket with those grind size changes have little if any effect on extraction timing if you'd like to learn more about that use the link up here or down in the description to check

crema with full body balanced flavor and you'll be producing to the potential of your beans the shot to the right that ones under extracting the flow it's far too fast it's making crema due to a forgiving coffee but it's gonna lack body and is likely to be unbalanced with sour flavors the shot on the Left it's over extracting visually it may you know look okay but it's likely to be bitter and unbalanced and the flow is far too slow shot in the middle finished a twenty seven seconds that's within the recommended timing of twenty to thirty seconds that's gonna be your goal when dialing in that's shot in the middle so dialing in is very simple the goal is to produce a double espresso of 60 milliliters or two ounces in twenty to thirty seconds from the first strip of espresso from your portafilter spouts to get there you adjust the grind size over a series of shots until you hit that timing if your shot is coming too fast let just the grind a little finer if it's too slow adjust your grind a little coarser simple right well it really is so long as you keep all other variables the same that means use the same coffee the same amount of coffee and it's gonna be best to weigh the Coffee dose for that have good distribution of grounds in your filter basket even tamping and/or leveling and use the same brew temperature for each extraction expect to go through some coffee as you dial in don't worry if it takes you five or six shots as you learn the dialing in process and how a size adjustment on your particular grinder affects extraction timing but as you get to know your grinder it will take fewer and fewer shots to get dialed in and really focus on keeping those other variables constant so it's only the grind size change affecting your extracts and timing so let me take you through dialing in from start to finish but first some tools to help you control those other variables first is your grind or a stepless model gives you more can roll over grind sighs now I'm gonna be using a burrata set a 270 WI it distributes fluffy grinds very evenly to a preset weight directly into a Porta filter it's essentially stepless with macro and micro adjustment rings lacking a grinder that weighs as it grinds like the set a 270 WI you can use an external scale like this to weigh your grinds or if you don't have a scale you can slightly overfill a double-shot basket and swipe with a finger to level with most stock double-shot 58 millimeter baskets that'll get you a weight of about 17 grams from their tamp your coffee and make sure it's level uneven tamping can lead to channeling of brew water through the coffee puck which will throw off your results actual tamping pressure that's really not all that critical just be slightly firm and try to use the same pressure for each tamp now personally I've gone using Levellers like this one they distribute and compress the coffee evenly and increase consistency I'm brewing on the ECM Classica it's a single boiler PID machine a serious tool for those who are more about the espresso and will do occasional milk drinks that PID gives you accurate and reliable brew temps from shot to shot for coffee I'm using Maroma zorf iya it's a favorite of mine and lots of our customers it's an easy to work with Italian style bean blend with low acidity that produces a rich balanced cup with chocolate notes and lots of crema when the grind is right so to start I'll grind some coffee through looking for a grind size somewhere between table salt and granulated sugar once there I'll grind 17 grams into my Porta filter use my leveler to distribute and compress the coffee and pull my shot now this one came too slow with the 60 milliliters and I'm adding an extra 10 milliliters to account for the crema coming in 39 seconds from first drip based on those results I'm gonna adjust my grind a little coarser in hopes of speeding up the extraction now do note depending on the grinder you are using you to grind off and discard three to six grams of coffee after making a grind size change to flush out any grinds retained in the grinder at the old grind setting my next shot with the slight grind size changed to a coarser setting came in at 17 seconds for the 60 milliliters plus crema compensation I'm getting closer really almost there I want my shot to come just a little slower so one more grind size change just a hair finer and I think I'll have it so lined into the portafilter level and compress and here we go just remember whatever tools you are using consistency is key try to keep everything the same except for grind size now this shot looks like the one it ends up finishing at 26 seconds from first strip with that I'm dialed in a couple of notes timing shots like this is the most basic method of getting your extractions into the ballpark and for some people timing and taste are as far as they're going to need to go beyond that our brew ratios where you weigh the results of an extraction and compare that to the amount of ground coffee used if interested you can check out my video on using brew ratios using the link up here or again that'll be down in the description timing a shot is not the end all I've had delicious shots that ran 40 seconds in the end it's a getting a flavor you like at the start of the video I mentioned some additional tips first controlling grinder static in most cases static as a result of low ambient humidity like you have indoors during heating season a simple fix for static is to wet the beans a little prior to grinding that can be done with a spray miss or like this or just use a damp finger to stir the beans prior to grinding also don't expect your grind setting to be set and forget when you change coffee dose wait ORS beans age you will likely need to make some grind size adjustments if you have questions about dialing and grind or anything coffee use those comments and I'll get you the answers I'm mark thanks for watching I hope you'll subscribe and

These are Columbian, they\u2019re organic columbian\nbeans from the El Tolima Estate. And we have this nice Turkish roaster, we\u2019ve\nhad it for about 25 years. Thing works like a champ, hopefully it keeps\nworking like a champ after I mentioned that. Today we\u2019re going to do about a medium roast. So our beans are in and in about 5 or so minutes,\nI\u2019m going to just check them just to see how they\u2019re proceeding in the roast. I know about when I want to pull the beans\nout. We\u2019ll do that by checking the beans right\nhere; they\u2019re going to come out green. But as we proceed, they\u2019re going to start\nto tan up a little bit. That\u2019s the first crack, where the actual\nbean cracks in half, then there\u2019ll be a second crack and it\u2019s right at that point\nwhether we\u2019re going to a medium or a dark roast. Or an espresso type. You can hear them cracking away. We\u2019ll let these beans just sit over night,\nlet them gas up a little bit. Tomorrow they\u2019ll be nice and ripe; ready\nfor flavor. Organic coffee beans from Columbia. They\u2019d make an excellent, excellent cup\nof coffee. We\u2019re going to add flavor to them and we\u2019re\ngoing to make an excellent cup of flavored coffee.

to be taking a look at the hario bean storage canisters now these hario glass jars come in two different sizes of a 200 and 300 gram jar but don't be filled by their labeling as i did find you could actually fit 300 grams and 480 grams in them respectively as well as 700 mils and one liter of water available in the glass jar with the black lid you see here or in a bpa free plastic with a red lid and you can shop the hario canisters by following this link up above now when it comes to storing your beans or coffee grinds for that matter so that they maintain an ideal peak of freshness one of the biggest threats to this is fresh oxygen coming in contact with your coffee that over time will begin to break down and stale your coffee where you'll first begin to lose those intoxicating aromas and then that lovely delectable sweetness in the cup now the hario storage containers may not be the most technical of devices and this does add to their charm but they absolutely do work to protect any fresh oxygen from getting in and ruining your beans thus prolonging the life of your coffee and by simply adding the coffee into the container placing the lid down firstly with the lever up and then once the lid is on you press that lever down to activate the seal against the glass jar and then that way you create an air tight and watertight seal now no fresh air is going to be getting into these containers and this will keep your beans moderately protected to extend the life of your coffee and more than this having the beans or grinds in a glass jar means there's no real issues of odor attention within that material that's used and along with that large opening to the top of the container there's no issue getting inside to scoop the beans out and they're super easy to clean as they are also dishwasher safe and that's the simple yet reliable solution to keep your coffee fresh for longer that is the hario bean storage canisters now if you have any questions on this product or storing any of your coffee beans at home which doesn't include placing them in the fridge or freezer then throw them in the comment section down below and we'll get straight back to you thanks for

better to answer it then somebody that knows what they're talking about not me right not me so anyway the question seems to be out there people have this conception that if a whole bean is not really black and oily it's not espresso and sometimes when we send them like your bonsai or whatever and it's not know black and oily they're like but this is not espresso so can you explain to the folks what makes for a good espresso blend or single origin or whatever it is from your point of view okay well I would say first off espresso is really the method of preparation it's not really about roast degree at all and then and then it's really about individual tastes as to what kind of rose degree you're going to like but yeah there are some really nice lighter roasted coffees that can work as espresso there's some darker roasted coffees that make great espresso is it does it have to do with the the blend of beans that you're using if there's a blend it's generally designed for espresso like our bonsai plant is designed for the espresso method of preparation so it's a beans from a region or whatever and when you when they taste profiles and they taste but they just end up better to the pressure and the whole deal it's it's more for me like a pretty much any coffee that we have ever can be prepared as espresso right you were telling me I know what you know I didn't really realize Twilight now I love it for drip but you were saying a lot of people buy it for espresso we have a lot of people that buy it either online or we even have a couple wholesale accounts that use it as espresso and it is a darker roast it's not oily feel like a lot of people think of as a darker roast I know it's a darker roast profile yeah it is and definitely not that oily shiny black know in that blend is designed with you know a lot of people with darker rows they don't want acidity that's one reason why they they like darker rows and so we select coffees for that that are low acidity to begin with but that are really dense high elevation coffees that can take a roast mm-hmm and a dark roast and hold up without getting ashy and bitter cool so yeah that's how I've tried to explain it to people it's not so much about the intensity of the roaster how far it's taken to that boilie state where it's pulling out all the oils and making it black in that it's more about the blend and just how it's crafted right yeah definitely blends are fun but they're kind of we don't see as many of them anymore people kind of migrated a single origin but I still think there are a lot of fun there the one time when we got a we get to put our own little signature ya know you can only get bonsai blend from Belton's coffee or you know whatever for whatever roastery so I still appreciate blends although I do probably prefer single origins for my espresso when I'm roasting for espresso what I'm really trying to do is make sure it's soluble mm-hmm if it's too light and it's not properly soluble you're gonna have a really difficult time keeping it from tasting sour or being under extracted so even if we're keeping it light we're developing it so that it's going to be soluble when the water and the pressure hits can give you a strong enough shot yeah yeah well see that that explains it really well I have trouble with explaining it to people because I don't have the terms you know you got it yeah we try no yeah when a yeah for espresso I'm looking for ideally a balance in that coffee whatever it is of sweetness try to get as much sweetness as I can out of it all right and I prefer probably acidity that's a little bit rounded and not real sharp mm-hmm those are tend to be our single origins that we're gonna recommend for espresso a little more approachable but still has all the nuances I'm not a big fan of tasting rose in my espresso mm-hmm so I tend to like lighter in medium rows yep but we also have a lot like I said a lot of people who are still like their new espresso being darker having some of that roast yeah flavor and there's nothing wrong with that well welcome what I kind of understood too is there's different grades of beans right yeah so you could take like a B or a C gray bean and if you roast it further and make a darker you're not going to notice the nuances as much and you're not going to notice that it's not as high a quality of it masks back yeah yeah exactly darker roast covers it right up it's pretty rare for anybody to get like a really expensive thought out you know micro lot of a copy you know that like there's some gauges that are you know 20 30 or more pounds yeah you're probably not going to roast that really dark you're just going to mask all the reasons why it costs what it does I can't afford that so yeah I can't either yeah well thanks a lot for the info and I hope that the folks out there really take that in and listen to it because it's important it's you know it's important information that you don't have to get this black stuff to be through because of super automatics yeah we tell people you can't put oily beans in there well it's an espresso machine well there's some good there our espresso not oily yeah there are some single origins as well that have really low acidity mm-hmm so even at a light roast it's not gonna be a sour bomb you know yep you just got to find the right coffees well you gotta look on Thornton's page right that's a grater you go yeah right all right thanks a lot Belton thanks [Music] you [Music] you", "S_Y80T91GCY": "hello and welcome back if your first time joining me my name is fun my channel is all about making better coffee at home I have another fun video for you today I'm be roasting I got this from this green beans from local roaster in Tucson I have a 1/2 pound of organic beans from the zero I hope this is organic they say they they say there's organic so I'm trusting that so I'll be using the be more 1,600 so if you are new to roasting so the more makes pre-cut Roasters by the way there was 1600 1600 plus and 1600 a B so this is about three generations back but still works great by the way it's pretty cold outside so I'll be roasting outside so problem is it's not gonna get hot quick enough so I'm hoping I'm hoping we're gonna get some decent roasts out of it so my plan is I'll be roasting whenever I hear first cracking sound I'm training out wait about two minutes maybe 2 min and a half until the first cracking is over and then I'll be stopping so use about City roasts more like medium roast there and oh by the way here are some tip for you if you're using be more what I usually do is even though this is only half pounds instead of pushing half pound I press pound the pound gave me 18 minutes and then I'm gonna add another 2 minute and a half so so this is boasting time total of 20 minutes and 30 seconds so give me the maximum on the time to roast you know especially cold outside anyway so I'll be setting up my roaster outside and see you guys see you guys out there [Music] that's it arrest I'm gonna see as an above twelve minutes [Applause] it's time to drying up right now because you're right before their smells like a wet grass and now I can start smell it's definitely doing something there and again the weather is really cold outside so it's gonna take a little while it's if you know 21 minutes about 13 minutes going still I have not I have not heard the first crack yet again the weather is really cold outside it might take a little while but once I want to start popping it's going to have a really really fast seven minutes to go on the timer so it's going to happen any minute now I'm still listening for sound here we go now I'm hearing the first back here so now I'm gonna start set the timer and then I'm gonna I'm gonna write about two minutes maybe two million and a half I'll be hearing for the when first packing zone what is harping on here like popcorn sound but it's about a minute and min and a half going into you now I can still see the smoke coming up it's almost two minutes and I'll be shutting it down now I'm gonna put up the keys will have to cool down very quickly so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use my back was all done by the way do not try what I did at your house okay because it gets really messy and the reason why I did it because I'm outside and you know so I can just blow everything out so it's not a big deal but at home don't so let's take a look here I mean this is very nice I said this is more like city plus as you can see from here very nice and golden that's a golden brown maybe I can't wait to try this so best time to drink this maybe 48 hours 24 to 48 hours I'm it's okay to drink right now but you want you might want to wait a few days to kind of arrested get all the co2 gas out of the day so see you guys in a few days it's been three days I roast my Brazilian beans smells really good the colors here yeah these are like City Plus maybe I mean this is a like little darker then I like to be still but you know overall smells great so let's try like user I got eating red you know what I just got a new toy I got the dosing phone right just got over the Christmas so let's use this see how system work I mean looks pretty good there study put the beans yeah not happy you know what I wonder I can actually put this on the top let's check it out you know what fits right in did it work yeah [Music] [Music] overall shock qualities were amazing smells good okay so here's a problem you guys can see that so this one is more than this one maybe not I don't know maybe yeah it could be the how I distribute the beans possibly but let's find that how it tastes like so this is Brazil beans okay Cheers hmm it's bright very smooth by the way really smooth and I have some great chocolate tone here hmm it's not bad actually some someone recommend me that I should blend pizarro beans with my Ethiopia beans because Ethiopia is a extremely bright so it's got a really nice match with this bean so I think that's what I'm gonna do next time but overall I'm very happy with it and by the way I mean if you guys are a first time using they'd be more I mean I have to say that is pre good machine for the money and I'm very happy with it oh I hope you guys like this video and see you guys next time", "6X92XwJ-guE": "[Music] very high-tech

notification button it will get notified when I go live and you can you can join along but on this channel all's well I also do share kitchen tips and some great deals that I find in my last video I shared a post and a link to buying coffee from Amazon and I finally got it in the mail I ordered 2 pounds and it was an awesome deal $9.99 Canadian for a pound of coffee you can't go wrong especially for this brand it's a great coffee good dark roast I love this one this is kind of my my go to so whenever it's on sale I make sure to stock up when I did do that video though I had a question from someone that viewed it asking me if I ever froze my coffee and personally I don't I use it I go through quite a bit of coffee so there's no point to to freeze it but very good question because a lot of people think that keeping your coffee into the freezer is going to keep it fresher but it's not always the case if you're purchasing coffee at a store a pound at a time that's when most people do these are whole beans these will hold fine in your cupboard for when you're gonna use it now obviously you're not gonna open it up until you until you need it if we've ordered a couple pounds to stock up just open up one and the second one here you don't need to keep in the freezer it's a sealed up these this you'll notice on some bags of coffee there's actually a special little valve that won't let it'll let as the coffee if it if it lets off gas it will release but it won't bring in air so you can just leave it sealed in your in your counter in your cupboard when you do finally decide to open one up this one is still sealed I've actually got one here that is is open you can it will last fine on your on your on your counter just make sure you seal it up and use the Tice to keep to keep the coffee sealed now if you're not a big coffee drinker and you you know only have coffee maybe when company's coming over that's when you might want to look at keeping it into the freezer now you don't want to keep it in the freezer in the bags that it comes in because it's not going to seal it enough for a long period of time so what I kind of would recommend if it's in your freezer is put it into it like a ziploc bag that you can really seal it off that being said if your coffee is not gonna you know gonna be sitting that long you could always seal it in a ziploc bag and just keep it in your cupboard the idea with coffee what can affect the flavor and the freshness of it number one is moisture and getting the air in there and if it's ground too far ahead of time so if you not a big coffee drinker buy the whole beans grind it when you need it but don't keep it in the freezer because what happens is if you're using it quite often you're putting it in the freezer you're taking it out what's happening is you're opening it up you're letting mooster in you're closing it again putting it back in the freezer so it's not that's not a good process to keep your coffee fresh you're better off just keeping it in the in the shelf so kind of a bit of a myth so to speak if you were to have a lot of coffee say you're buying a coffee as a instead of a you know instead of just a pound you're buying a kilogram of coffee maybe a special coffee that you really like by all means you could what you could do is once you open it up divide it into smaller portions put it in a ziploc bag and keep the portions that you're not using in the freezer and then bring it out as you as you need it but leave it out don't keep putting it in and out of the freezer so hopefully that answers everybody's questions on if you should freeze your coffee or not I'm not a person that freezes coffee it doesn't last that long in this house so we buy it a pound at a time but when it is a good deal we'll just buy a couple of pounds or still ensuring that the coffee is fresh when we get it and fresher only brew it it's hopefully enjoyed it again subscribe to the video if you want to see more I always appreciate it and be sure to the notification bell to get notified when new videos are posted thanks so much everybody have a great day and until my next video you can check out these ones

today's video i'm going to talk about some places where you can source coffee beans to sell in your own online store so if you are ready to get started with your own online coffee business but you don't have a roasting machine you don't want to become a roaster you just want to build your brand and you need to source some beans these options are a great way to get started so let's go ahead and dive in i don't have any coffee today but i am drinking a fall uh flavored kombucha drink and it's got like apple cider and turmeric in it and it tastes pretty good i know it's not coffee but sometimes you have to change it up a little bit so let's go ahead and get started with the first slide all right so one of the first options for getting coffee beans to sell in your own online store is to find local coffee roasters in your area and some of the benefits to just sourcing locally is that you get the freshest beans possible and you are better able to establish a wholesale relationship with a local roaster especially in beginning because you may not need to buy a ton of product up front because you're just getting started so maybe you can work out a way where you can order a minimal amount just to have in stock to sell in your store i mean when you're working with locally you may be able to work things out a lot better because you are in the area also when you're using a local coffee roaster first of all you want to make sure that they do offer wholesale beans if they do definitely ask if it's okay to sell their brand of coffee online because some coffee roasters may not you know want the competition they may not want their product sold in another store especially um some people sell coffee on amazon you know i don't particularly care to do that if i was going to start a coffee business i would just have my own shopping cart my own e-commerce platform to sell my coffee but definitely ask what are the do's and don'ts when you're dealing with a local coffee roaster another option to look into is private label coffee roasters and what this means is a lot of coffee roasters will allow you to sell their coffee under your own brand so what you're doing is you're selling another roasters beans but you're using your own branded coffee bags and or labels and so this is another option if you can find a local coffee roaster that also does private labeling then that would be awesome for you because then you are kind of like right at the source of where your beans are sourced from because you're dealing with a local roaster still make sure that they offer wholesale pricing because you're still going to need to buy your product wholesale more than likely you're going to offer more than one type of coffee in your store so you're going to have to buy several bags of each even though they're using your packaging and labels you're still going to have to buy different variations of their coffee so be prepared for that as well private labeling is an awesome way to get started with your own online coffee store because you're not having to sell other roasters brands on your website everything is still under your own brand okay the next option we have is private label and drop shipping so this is a an awesome business model as well but it does have its pros and cons now the pros for sure is that you don't have to buy your beans wholesale and that means no storing your beans either so your customer definitely can get the freshest beans possible with this model there's nothing to ship or package because you only order beans when your customers order from your store then your supplier ships those beans directly to your customer for you using your branded bags or your coffee labels on the bags whichever way whichever option that you choose when the customer receives their coffee it's going to appear that it's coming from your company even though you're not doing any of the packaging or shipping so that's the beauty of drop shipping now some of the things you want to be aware of if you go this route is that's many of the coffee roasters that do private labeling and drop shipping which is just order fulfillment for your customers they all vary and what they offer for example you may not get wholesale pricing so that's definitely something you will need to ask about some private label coffee drop shippers will charge you their retail price per bag so that cuts into your profit margin a lot of these um private label dropshipping coffee grocers also charge drop shipping fees per bag shipped so that's another way that you you know could eat into your profit margin so it's things like this that you have to ask about and be knowledgeable of and i've written a blog post about drop shipping coffee and it definitely details a lot of things that you should ask about before you choose to partner with a particular coffee roaster so i'll have resources to that blog post as well as a video

powerful reads the awesome thing about them is that they are so easy to understand and inspiring today I'm going to tell you an amazing story which will really do get you thinking and even leave you speechless once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that she was unhappy and her life was miserable and that she didn't know how she was going to make it she was tired of fighting and struggling all the time it seemed just as one problem for soil another one soon followed her father was a chef he took her to the kitchen he filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire once the three pots began to boil he placed potatoes in one pot eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the third pot he then led them set and boy without saying a word to his daughter the daughter mooned and impatiently waited wondering what her father was doing after 20 minutes her father turned of the burners he took the potatoes out of the pot and place them in a bowl he pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bow he then served the coffee out and placed it in a cup then turning to her father asked daughter what do you see she hastily replied potatoes eggs and coffee father said look closer and touch the potatoes she did I noted that potatoes for soft he then asked her to take an egg and break it after pulling off the shell she observed that egg was hard-boiled finally father asked her to sip the coffee rich aroma of coffee brought a smile on her face now she asked father what does this mean father explained that the potatoes the eggs and the coffee beans had each faced the same difficult situation the boiling water however each one reacted differently the potato went in strong hard and unrelenting but in boiling water it became soft and weak the egg was delicate with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water then the inside of the egg became hard however the ground coffee beans were unique after they were exposed to the boiling water they changed the water and created something new father asked his daughter which are you when problems knock on your door how do you respond are you a potato an egg or a coffee bean moral of the story in life things happen around us things happen to us but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us so guys which one are you are you a potato and egg or a coffee bean change your mindset to change your life that is all for today if you liked the video please hit like button and subscribe to our channel and hit per like it and share this video

have to buy any kind of coffee fake scent you can use old coffee grounds so it's really cool and I'm gonna show you how to make that now I got this old candle ready and I loosened it all up and I'm gonna go ahead and take out the old wicks and I'm gonna melt it down here and a double boiler okay now the wax is all melted so we need to take it off of the double boiler and we have to just let it cool down that's too hot to pour in my cup and I'll show you this is what we're gonna be using for the candle mold I have this little plastic cup of course we don't want to melt so I have to let the wax cool down to almost solid so we just need to let it sit for a couple of minutes and we'll be back and why the wax is cooling you can you take your cup you can use any plastic cup is fine and we're going to poke a little hole in the middle to put the wick through I'm gonna use the end of my safety pin okay I have the hole ready in the cup and I'm gonna put this wick through it and if you don't know how to make these wicks I made a video earlier on how to make your own candle wicks you can watch that and we're gonna put this through the cup because this is gonna be the top of your candle and this is gonna be the bottom so we gotta get the wick through here and the top part of the wick is gonna be of course cone here okay now that I got it in there we have to tape it down so that this side doesn't leak when we put the wax in there so I'm mixture it's down really tight so nothing will come out okay there we go now inside that Cup is ready the work is ready okay now that our week is ready we're gonna put the coffee grounds in here and you want to make sure that your coffee grounds are free of what coffee I just have the grounds and be pretty dried out so not much water in there okay and just put those in your cup and we're gonna put about a quarter of an inch thick all the way around at the bottom like this yeah that looks good and our candle wax that we melted should be about ready now now we're going to pour a layer of that on top and do the next part if you want you can wipe off your cup with a napkin so that the grounds are just at the bottom because it won't start to show so if you want a nice looking pattern just wipe it out every time you add the grounds in there okay we're gonna pour in the bottom layer of the wax okay I put in about an inch of wax now we're gonna let this dry until it gets solid AB it's not all the way solid but it's solid enough for us to put our next layer of coffee grounds on top and while we're waiting for it to dry you want to make sure you hold your wick up somewhere in the middle okay you can use a spoon or you can use a scissors or something to hold your wick into the middle of the cup where you want your wick to be okay I'm using my scissors so I can kind of press the wick into it so that holds it really good okay so we're gonna wait for this to dry and okay that first layer is dried up pretty good but still a little bit soft cuz I could move the wick around a little bit but it's hard enough that we should be able to put the next layer on top okay so we're gonna go ahead and do that and put another about a quarter of an inch thick layer of the coffee on top of the wax one just to be careful as you go around if it feels like it's going through the bottom layer then you could wait a few more minutes to make sure it's hard enough for you but mine is good okay my next layer looks ready I'm just gonna kind of clean it up so look nice when I put on next layer wax see through the cup can you see that that's about how much I have I'm going to do the next layer okay now we gotta go ahead and let this layer dry and then we can finish up the last layers so go ahead and support your wick again with the scissors and I'm gonna let it dry okay okay now around the last layer here and I did not let this one dry up hardened enough because it's going to be the bottom of my camp since it's hard enough on this part we're going to just put a little bit grounds in there and kind of mix them and then press the wick into it so like this and then go ahead and press the wick down because we don't need this side of the wick to be sticking out because going to be the bottom of the candle and go ahead and pry it down flat okay now we're going to pour just a thin layer over the grounds to kind of seal it in there there and that's it now finish let your candle dry and then we're gonna take the cap off okay now we're gonna untape is the wick from the bottom so just take your tape off and then flip it over and plastic cups you can usually just loosen and make them fall out so go ahead and trim your wick the size you like it on the top and your candle is done", "KRP1kFScjEk": "today I'm going to show you how to easily husk coffee berries after harvesting put them on a flat surface hot surface like this then take a piece of hardwood similar to this and just move them in circular movements over the berries you can press quite hard put the beans inside of that damage this is much easier than doing my hand this is straight after picking berries are quite fresh and I need to soak in water anything like that and

right now I'm actually living in New York during the high tech crowd of artists and we're all quarantine it's must have been great having this thing so that we can have fresh dose of coffee every day I was able to get this rough sir and it flat down bag of green beans before all this coronavirus stuff happened before this is using that Mexico and coffee roaster and this thing's pretty good Iran does get a little bit tired though if you want to roast enough beans for the week if the new several batch is and it just takes a while it's also not too inconsistent in between toast so kind of just quickly show you how this thing works it's pretty basic there's three buttons medium dark and cool mode so if you want to do a light roast or custom sort of roasting profile you would have to his time it and hit the cool button whenever you wanted to end your roast so it's not super fancy does it get a lot of features but it gets the job done and it's fairly cheap at like seventy eighty dollars online so compared to some of the other Roasters that are like two hundred three hundred dollars is pretty good deal and it does a pretty good job [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so yeah that's it I would recommend this thing coffee tastes great does a pretty good job so and the price is not too bad so if you're looking at this thing we're looking for review I would give it a recommend hope this video is helpful and talk to you later [Music]", "3wHHcb-4XNA": "today I'm going to try something different just going to take two ounce of green coffee put in a magic bullet and then just knock it up a little that was pretty loud as you can see it doesn't grind up too well but and it's really loud but I do have some chunks on the bottom here's eight ounce another four ounce of water filtered water grind green coffee bring it up to boil let it simmer for 15 minutes it's starting to boil I'm going to lower down the heat all the way down to the lowest setting so I can just simmer so 15 minutes later turn off the heat and let it sit for an hour so it's been soaking about an hour a little bit over an hour go ahead and train so as you can see that 12 ounce of water decrease quite a bit I'm guessing probably some of the water got soaked up and green coffee just a quick sip oh that tastes horrible", "h3tYycHNCHY": "hey what's going on everybody I hope everyone out there is having a

bean because I'm sure a lot of you might be asking yourself like what is it well green coffee bean it's just a fruit of coffee beans basically just unroasted coffee beans the reason why they're beneficial to have unroasted coffee beans is because they're high in chlorogenic acid right and after we've rose coffee beans there's just a fraction of chlorogenic acid now chlorogenic acid is a widely debated ingredient as far as the benefits they do get from it but it is reported to actually be a very powerful antioxidant for you help you regulate your blood sugar levels possibly help the absorption of fat and also boosting your metabolism as well so there's many different benefits you get from it like I said it's widely debated as far as how effective it is dosages things like that with this right now nature wise did decide to use a pandit form the screen coffee bean extract to actually raise out the chlorogenic acid that is available when you take this and you also get some caffeine in here as well it's about 20 milligrams of caffeine that you get per capsule so it's about a quarter of a cup of coffee now as far as the reviews for this thing it does rate 4.1 stars which is pretty good but there has been over 6,000 people that reviewed this product and when you take in all the different variables of different people's bodies the way they react to it and all the people that reviewed it or point one-star sounds pretty good a lot of people are saying that just plain simple worked as far as helping keep on their weight manage and also helping with some energy for them as well as far as myself with this supplement it really helped me you know I've been taking this for like a week now and usually I drink a lot of caffeine I go I can't lie I do drink a lot caffeine and I've actually used this to replace my morning cups of coffee and it's actually gave me some pretty good energy as far as it's not--there's no jittery energy at all it's nothing crazy it's actually just like a clean like clear mind so it's pretty awesome I take this for the antioxidant effects and the regulating on my blood sugar as well as far as weight management I don't really need to worry about that right now but yeah as far as the things I take it for I do kind of like the subnet it has replaced my cups of coffee and I don't really miss those cups of coffee so I think that's beneficial for myself now as far as a place for this thing it does cost like set in the beginning spot 20 bucks now you get about 60 servings in this they say to take it twice a day as well so it's gonna last you about 30 days for 20 bucks which means it's less than a dollar per day when you take this which means it's pretty awesome it's definitely worth a shot especially if you have a good diet

coffee up here just in little and this brown seems to be the sort of little brand for coffees that'd be dope and so if we take a lot of the pocket-sized roasted coffee beans strength number three smooth with a nutty flavor this is a rain forest Alliance certified coffee and there we go it says minimum 50 percent certified coffee which is a little strange Society and it's a hundred percent of Rebecca and this coffee would was I'm not a hundred percent sure but I think it was one pound 69 and that's for two hundred grams which is a smaller bag than usual but and it's a really cheap coffee it might have even been cheaper than one par 69 I just cannot remember that for the life of me I'll matcha paid for this coffee on the back of the packets got whole roasted coffee in Columbian coffee beans or hundred-percent Arabica it's got preparation instructions the ground cafeteria filter machine maca pot and on the other side storage instructions additional information which is produced produce of Colombia packing Germany and there we go 200 grams and on the side of the packet sees cultivated exclusively after high altitude in Colombia's rich volcanic soils these beams are harvested at their optimum ripeness medium roasted with a rich elegant aroma and the full-bodied finish and there we go it's strengthened with free medium smooth and not equal to the center that effect and there we go there's the rainforest alliance the best before date on this is November 2018 so well over the year on the best before dates on this one as well and that's it for the pack a piece of looking back and not seeing this bum before I've only just getting into shopping at little Fermi coffees they're being quite quite impressed with them so far so if we take a look at the beans they look at decent quality and yeah fine-looking beans the aroma is it's a quite a nice along with this coffee and it's quite quite strong as well and it's not a dark roast but it has the enrolment of a dark roast then this coffee slightly chocolatey slightly fruity and a slight Northey edge as well for this one it has a bitterness to that's more not noticeable when I made a drink using the double espresso we're imaging this one but there is a slight bitterness there so this coffee and we take you over there ground coffee and yeah it's got a it's quite dark for a medium roast it's quite a dark and coffee this one the beans are quite dark as well it's got a sort of reddish look to it and this coffee the ground coffee has a bit more of a sort of perfumey add to it and but I'm still picking off that sort of dark roast aroma even though this is quite a light roast or medium roast I should say and taste wise this is a very good coffee that it's a excellent example of a good Columbian and the name of this coffee is Colombian supremo and I've seen that name before and I think Tesco do a Colombian supremo when I've looked it over it it actually means it's the highest rating for Colombian coffee that vido and like say with the best beans be available for one pound 69 in little well that's that's awful but that's fair and the consumer to decide but they say I I think it's a very fine coffee this one it's well balanced with fruity notes of red apple which gives it a really nice fresh crisp taste in the mouth so it doesn't leave any real nasty aftertaste this coffee and it's quite naturally sweet slightly nutty I'm slightly chocolatey as well or as I say I'm really impressed by this coffee it's it's got a good taste at a cheap price so I definitely recommend in this and I'll probably buy this again and as I say of being quite impressed then by the the coffee's done I've tried so far in Lidl and so yet if anyone's tried this coffee I'd like to hear what you thought of it

whole clans this is the MCM and this is my quick review of livadas cafe espresso coffee beans and on the front of the pack sees this is a hundred percent of rub occur this coffee nothing Celts much on the front take a look on the back we have methods of preparation sips the freshness and in the description it says Lavazza cafe espresso is an intense and velvety blend with a distinctive character as found in the best traditions of Italian espresso this is a medium boasting the blend characteristics our aroma is 5 body is 4 on intensity is 5 and there we go the different methods for making your coffee a non watch on the side of the pack this coffee cost me three pounds for 250 grams normally this coffee is more around the four-power mark but this it was on offered at free pounds so I paid three pounds for those 250 grams on the other side it says Lavazza is synonymous with quality coffee all over the world this comes directly from over a century of passion coffee experience research and innovation on the best before date is January 2019 so well over a year on the best before dates on this one nearly two years on me nearly welfare nearly two years on that set of paths take a look to the beans is quite a variety of shades within these beans I think a mention la on the first review of this aim this coffee and yeah quite a lot quite a wide variety as in quite dark and quite light beans and within this one the bean smells slightly fruity and a sweet sort of chocolatey aroma quite smooth and creamy smell into this one and if we take a look at the ground coffee it's quite all light and more of an orange and color to this one and the ground coffee is the same and with maybe a slight nuttiness other than there or the smell is pretty similar and you'd expect it to be a bit more intentional ground coffee ball in pretty similar small taste wise this is a really smooth coffee here no real bitterness and it's quite sweet I'm really fruity really picking up a sort of red apple taste note with this coffee and it's a nice creamy chocolatey full-bodied coffee this one and it's got a slight nuttiness to it as well and this coffee reminds me of the recent review at that event he was at the tables of having a coffee and this one check out superior Colombia as soon as a drunk disc in cafe espresso it instantly shortly butters the reviewer did that one and I think the to do in taste very slim very similar this coffee is it's really vibrant violently full inflated that bought a little weakened strength I was having to it I was having to drink SS vessels in the coffee to enjoy the fullness of this drink and the caffeine content must be high because it felt awful for so that work drinking double espressos well yeah I really do like this coffee it's really in complex in flavor and I definitely recommend and it's definitely worth a try and so I'd like to hear from anyone who's tried this coffee let me know what you thought of it in the comment section below

"vED2YjsB3cg": "hi I'm Liz from Lizzie's fresh coffee and I'm gonna share with you three tips for storing your fresh coffee okay so you've purchased some amazing freshly roasted coffee how do you take care of it from here what rules you're thinking yep but if you know these three secrets your coffee will be tasty and fresh for up to two weeks from its roasting date the first secret to know about coffee is that coffees life is very short it will only stay fresh and flavorful for up to two weeks from its roasting day so ideally and purchase only when you can consume in that time during the sailing process the aromas disappear and oils oxidize and they become rancid so I'm sorry to say there's no trick on the planet that can stop it from happening completely it is a food and it will get old the good news is that you can be sure that it's as slow as possible so you can enjoy every sip during the short time you have together number two know your coffees enemy they're light air and moisture plain and simple letting these be all up in your coffees business will make your coffee stale faster than you can say yup store your coffee in an airtight and opaque container to keep it tasting fresh and amazing number three coffee hates to be cold or hot finicky little thing isn't it never store your two weeks fresh coffee supply in the freezer or the refrigerator and never store in a hot place like on top of a fridge for any cabinet over the oven in and out of the freezer or the fridge introduce its moisture and condensation and exposure to heat it's the coffee the equivalent of sweaty armpits both situations break down the amazing intense aromas and flavors coffee likes to be a neutral room-temperature right on your countertop or in the pantry so what about freezing coffees we don't recommend the refrigerator or freezer for your daily coffee storage if you're off to a tropical vacation and you'll be unable to use the fresh coffee's purchased within two weeks immediately place the fresh portion that's unusable in an airtight container in freezer once you're ready to consume the remove the entire amount from the freezer and it's a one-way trip so from that point they're going to take it out to keep it out storing it neutral room temperature and using it up daily from there so now I'm going to show you options for storing your coffee which are super simple first option is to store it in the baguette payment here at woodys we package our coffee immediate we have to roast these in foil barrier bags with one ladies two guessing valve that's the little thing that looks like a belly button on your coffee bag that actually allows the co2 to escape but doesn't allow oxygen in it this type of bag also keeps away light air and moisture it doesn't keep away heat so be sure that the bag is stored into the neutral location in your kitchen the bag is a perfect way to store your coffee all you have to do after taking your coffee out is simply roll it down squeezing out the excess air and flip me back the tent entire tape to create a nice tight closure need a little more style than the bag provides grab a coffee back storage container these containers have a simple press button vacuum closure and they do a good job of keeping away light hair and moisture the vacuum closure works the same way as the gassing valve on the bag allowing the gas to seize while keeping the option for entrance they open quickly need weed and they offer a simple design for the copy beautiful looks good in your kitchen one of our favorite products that we sell here at Lizzie's that the air escape storage container it's a sweet stainless steel design that comes in several colors and have a double loop system first lid and you can hear this very tight there's your coffee inside to close it you actually just press it down to the surface of the coffee pushing out the excess air and then lock it in place so the first lid press is BR out of the chamber and it blocks the light and then the second see-through lid creates an additional barrier plus lets you see your contents level inside it's super clever clean and easy to use and it's definitely ideal for use with whole bean coffee storage so those are three ways to store your coffee to ensure optimal freshness but I have one more final bonus tips for storing your coffee today can't make old coffee taste good again by storing it this way once coffee's old it's just old and you're gonna have to accept it either drink it up and you can to enjoy it or well there's one great place to store it in the garbage I'm sorry to say there might be something you can do with it you can make a scrub put it in your garden or compost but this might be the best place for it you will never have to worry about this storage system again though if you buy fresh coffee buy only what you need for a two-week supply and store it properly you'll be enjoying every sip I'm Liz from Lizzie's fresh coffee and I hope this helps you make your coffee at home great", "P5Flcsn-qFA": "everybody welcome back to the channel another short video today I was out of coffee again I know I just did a video I'll link it above I just did a video probably like a week and a half ago where I was showing off some of my kicking horse coffee which I bought on Amazon it's all gone I just poured my last my last cup this morning so timed out perfectly I found an awesome deal on Amazon for coffee you have to keep your eye out for these things cuz they pop up from time to time I'd look I did look for kicking horse coffee again cuz that is my favorite coffee you buy it was back on to regular price so before we got it for $9.99 a pound it's gone back up to about 17 dollars a pound so not as good of a deal still a great coffee not a good at the deal but I found this on sale so ethical bean coffee I've got a couple couple of bright types here they're super dark one which I've had before not bad not a bad roast and then I picked up the ethical bean dark roast bold so I'll be interested to try this for the first time these were on sale these are two pound bags so like double the double the size normal they were $19.99 H that's a steal for two pounds of decent coffee I've had ethical bean before I do like it and so I just want to share I'll leave links to the down in the description below if you wanted to pick these up they might not be on sale when you check it out but if you can grab them for 20 bucks great deal one thing I didn't notice about this when I was unpacking them though which was kind of interesting if you actually go to the back there is a date it actually tells you when it is best best before but there's also which is interesting is a code on the back that you can put in either like the QR code or you can put a you can put a code in on their website so I thought oh that's kind of neat you can because you can actually find out you can trace where the coffee originated and it gives you some more information about this so actually I've never done this before I've never seen it before on on this type of coffee so I thought I will give it a try so if you actually scan it with your the QR code with your phone it'll take you to a website which is interesting that will show you all about your coffee it shows you the date that it was it shows you the date that it was roasted on shows you the best before date it gives you some information on the profile of the coffee if that's you interested but it also does give you the origin of the beans on the coffee and you can actually click through to the different countries that they're in and it will actually show you the company and a lot of times it's the family that has the the the property and where they where they grow it and just some information about their bio and so kind of interesting their own interests in the coffee so I've got to ethical bean coffees here they're both from different different regions so I'm gonna kind of

bean is a coffee bean it's nothing more than a matter of taste but we'll differentiate what's good for espresso versus what's good for any other brew method but there are all kinds of myths associated with what is best for espresso and otherwise some people believe it's a particular roaster blend but these are just all ways of thinking that came about through different stages of the quality evolution that coffee has undergone since it was first discovered first let's discuss the flavor differences between coffee and espresso when you brew a pot of coffee you may notice some slight nuances in your cup based on the coffee that you've used maybe it's sweet and fruity with a rich chocolate tone maybe it's light and tea like with a citrusy kick and maybe it just tastes like a cup of coffee perhaps nutty with a caramel finish if you were to really try to break it down none of these descriptions are a direct indicator of quality but a product of the coffee beans background growing region and processing for example and you can't change these things about the coffee it's part of the beans chemical makeup so when you put a bean with a particular flavor profile under pressure as you do with espresso you're going to have the same experience but the nuances are much more forthcoming and intense sort of like the difference between a blueberry tea and a spoonful of fresh blueberry jam so what's the deal with espresso roasts when espresso was first popularized we hadn't quite achieved the refinement of farming and buying practices that we see today and because of the intensifying effect of espresso flavor defects are painfully noticeable so in an effort to provide a more consistent flavor that will satisfy most palates our darker roast was embraced as darker roasts will break down plant compounds provided dark caramelized sugar flavor and you'll taste where secondary compounds that are a result of the roasting process than organic compounds giving the roaster more control over the way your coffee tastes however this method does tend to create a more bitter coffee as the majority of bitterness and coffee is a result of these secondary compounds created during roasting because of the high standards that specialty Roasters now hold for the coffee's they use it's no longer necessary to use a dark roast to mask potential flavor defects or inconsistencies in fact a light roast will provide a sweeter and more complex flavor profile you're probably saying great amber so why do these specialty Roasters still sell espresso blends or drip blends well but Lee or not the writing on the bag does not have to dictate how you brew at home again it's all a matter of personal taste and perception if a bag state said it's an espresso blend or drip blend it generally means the roaster believes that the flavor profile really shines when brewed in that manner but it can absolutely be equally enjoyable when brewed any other way so take their suggestion with a grain of salt and feel free to experiment with different brew methods to find out what works best for you you can also experiment with single origin coffees many believe that single origins should be left to be brewed in a pour-over but they are worth experimenting with as espresso as well as single origin coffee will typically have a more delicate and complex flavor profile making it very easy to cross the line of over or under extraction so they do require more attention to get a really great shot but you can look forward to a moment of all when you get there and with steamed milk they can be even more decadent and dessert like okay there is one exception to this some Roasters still utilize for booster coffee beans in their espresso blends I talked about the difference between Arabica and robusta beans in a previous video and noted that robusta beans produce a heavy long-lasting crema so it can be worth it to use these in an espresso blend to be fair these are not considered specialty coffees but that doesn't make them any less popular it is worth mentioning that a blend of Arabica and robusta beans is less than ideal for brewing is drip the bold and earthy flavor of robusta beans can easily drown out any nuance is offered by the Arabica bean so they really need to be brewed under pressure to intensify the more delicate flavors that an Arabica bean brings to the table that being said you do you and have fun playing with all kinds of coffee beans see you next time", "Hd5Rr-XT7AA": "I know basically nothing about coffee when I go into a coffee shop most times I have no idea what I'm ordering let me change that so in these three episodes I'm breaking down learning the three most important aspects of making that perfect cup of coffee the bean the roast in the brew next up let's learn about the ropes for help learning this art I turn to the master roaster at dumb brothers Bob it really takes that roasting process to develop the really unique flavors of coffee the aromatics flavor and also part of it is getting rid of some of the flavors in there not everything is desirable and something that humans like to ring so there's a lot of things going on maybe Mother Nature gave us a hundred fifty 200 chemicals in that bean we're going to end up with close to a thousand different chemicals in the roasted product so they're all stated adds chemicals yeah it's all but it's all based on what is in that being how it was grown how it was nurtured how it was processed all this stuff is really important on the flavor of the final product when we roast it you can't make a flavor that's not there so it all seems pretty important very important so I'm gonna coach you here and not let you get too far out of us so go ahead and just throw in your coffee into the feed hopper dump it all in so all we're going to do is pin time against temperature it's just like a clothes dryer in there tumbling the beans will enter through our feed hopper they'll tumble inside of a barrel and the barrel has several ways of presenting heat to the coffee first of all there's burners right next to the drum itself so some of that hot air coming off the burners is also redirected into the drum probably the best way to look at it is maybe that first 1/3 of the roast we're just trying to get rid of the moisture I'm going to use profile that we publish as a guide to help us maneuver through this roast part of like when I evaluate coffees after they come out of the roaster system what part of this that I screw up on you know and then then you start redeveloping that profile says okay obviously I dried this being out way too quickly and you could I could see it happening oh look right here and you can see how we're starting to pick up some yellow it's losing that green greyish color and this is going to this can go pretty quick this is kind of where we want to stretch our drying phase out to the first five and a half minutes oils and now look this should have a pretty much even light yellow color to it once we notice that coffee shifting from green to way just until it gets in that kind of a yellow stage we've lost most of that free moisture and now we're going into another set of very complex reactions now we can start developing aromatics and now look we've gone into our orange to brown color now we're going to start the last stage that finish where we're just kind of putting the shine on this and that starts right about the time we hear the bean crack for the first time now you can smell the deep roasting notes and you hear it yeah there it is so we're going to get a nice loud quick first crack and you can see this coffee's developed a real nice chocolate caramel look okay but it's a little leathery it's a little gangly looking I'd like to see a little bit more structural development and again that's just a visual cue that we've kind of left that aromatic development phase of the roast and now we're to a point where we want to start deciding how we're going to finish this present those floral notes maybe not maybe we'll push it a little bit more and start bringing out the fruit maybe a little more bringing up the chocolate and caramel or we might take it all the way to a full French roast and get those nice smoky smoky notes in it and there it is that could have been fifteen seconds the bean is already swelled considerably larger and was on that last pole and there's that coffee smell I think maybe a few more degrees we'll start seeing a few little wisps of smoke and that's going to be kind of a good cue that it's time to get these guys out of here let's do it this lever goes up switch them up turn your gas off over there down yeah bring that air flow all the way back towards you perfect now we need to cool this coffee a guy could ruin a roast real quickly by not cooling it properly some of it'll continue to cook but in other unique thing will happen is you'll lose sweetness in the cup a properly roast a cup of coffees it has a lovely sweetness all of its own and if someone needs to put sugar in coffee now they might be drinking the wrong coffee so any tips for me for when I roast my beans that first moment that we put the beans in it's critical make sure you know where you're at you know you're composed okay I got my beans ready I got my stopwatch ready I got everything I need once they're in the roaster you can't change any of that and then at that point it's experimentation it's time and temperature even if you're doing it on a frying pan on the top of your stove trying to delay that first color change for about four or five minutes of the roast okay try to slowly develop that color from yellow to orange to brown by that time you're around nine nine and a half ten 1/2 minutes you should start to hear that first crack so you use a color as a cue and then again cool it as quick as possible taste it now I know the fine art of rules but I still don't really know the differences the types of roasts make to the tapes so return to Kathy imports will they have a sample roaster which will let me roll small batches of similar beans compare a sample of four different roles ranging from light medium medium dark to dark roast a little bit of grassiness still it's you know it has some sweetness to it it tastes I kind of grassiness here talking milk it's not too bad but let's let's keep going and see what else we can taste to me this has a lot more sugar caramelize a ssin going on in the roast so what we've done here is roast the coffee in a way that's developed some sugars it's still balanced with acidity I like this roast it's pretty nice try this one they're definitely getting the more roasted flavor little burn yeah so you're tasting the effects of roasting the coffee you know a lot of people do look for in their coffee a lot of people like a coffee that has that roasty flavor I think that's where a lot of the sentiment around coffee comes from a lot of people remember sitting at home with their over roasted coffee very dark it's really dark yeah so does it lose a lot of the sweetness the darker you get not necessarily um I think that there's there's sort of a happy medium where you've developed a lot of sugars where you've developed a siddha tea and where you're bringing out really the best characteristics in the coffee okay if you roast a coffee really darkly you're gonna burn all the sugars away and it's just gonna taste like carbon but if you don't roast the coffee enough it'll taste grassy and not sweet okay I think that makes sense I think with this with the second roast here you hit a point where you developed a lot of the sugars you develop some acidity and you didn't apply too much roast to the coffee to overshadow that sweetness that you're looking for once again thanks to Cafe imports and now it all firsthand what affects the roast has on the case of coffee and I was surprised to learn that I actually enjoyed the medium roast best of all and thanks to Bob at dumb brothers and now I have a clue what a fine art rushing Coffee truly is eventually I'll need to apply this knowledge on my own and I attempt to make a cup of coffee and tally from scratch will see how well that goes but first there's still one more aspect of coffee I need to explore next time to brew the heaven yet be sure to

coffee is going to be a valuable trade to a one-day green coffee beans can store for a very long time these are essentially means and as you probably know beans can be stored almost indefinitely so I'm going to back in pack green coffee beans for a survival food stash now if you're interested I have a video and a webpage which shows how to roast coffee beans yourself you can do it over an open fire over a campfire for example and one day I will do that as well so I've cut a bag I'm going to seal one end now pour your beans into your bag just gonna take a large bag for this and it's very simple leveling off insert your bag into your machine on the tricky part because I'm in a small bag I like to conserve my plastic rolls the tricky part is to get this flat stay in place clamp it down now this is rock hard this has become one solid brick there's no more hair in here and if you keep these cool and dry I bet the last 10 15 20 years just fine", "447fN6IvHCM": "hi I'm George Howell from the George Howell Coffee Company and I want to talk to a little bit about the packaging and freshness of coffee and that starts at the supermarket or the specialty shop it could be a cheese shop or a specialty coffee shop and you will see several possibilities in front of you the first thing you might see our big coffee bins plastic typically where you see the beans actually in the bins themselves I have to say that my old company the coffee connection we had bins like that too they were actually a barrels or bins and and we would shovel out the coffee's and until recently I really believed in that you get the smell it has a great feel to it and it's great marketing on top of that but I have now started to shy away from that because as you get into higher and higher qualities farm single farms single estates what you find is that it can just take a few days especially hours when you've got the beans just exposed to the air continuously like that and you're going to lose something in that process so better in my opinion to skip the bins even though they look like they're the best thing to get and they're less expensive because you're not paying for the packaging and go to a bag so if you go to the bags you have again several choices they're the one to really look for is a one-way valve bag and you're going to find this valve at the top it's not easy to see but it will be there so look for that and what that one-way valve does is it allows fresh coffee to release all the carbon dioxide that is pouring out of those fresh beans once you've roasted coffee that carbon dioxides got to go out one way or another if I were to put fresh coffee in even a metal can it would blow up if there's no escape valve so that's the one-way valve it lets that go out but it's a one-way valve because no oxygen come in so you want to avoid essentially in my opinion unless it has a ro state telling you that it's that fresh two or three days four days that's it a bag like this Brown typically but it could be colored as well with no valve at all this affords very little protection and the coffee is getting stale much faster if it's a couple of days old three no problem I think you'll do very well but as you go towards a week that's much worse but be careful Brown doesn't mean always bad you can have brown bags that do have a one-way valve so always look for that valve when you take these one-way valve bags home with you always stand them up co2 is heavier than oxygen carbon dioxide and it will sink any oxygen in it will go up and that will be forced out the one-way valve and stay away from your beans so always when you're buying coffee also make sure it's not lying down make sure the coffee is standing straight up a big big point you can also find cans that have the same one-way valve concept that you really want to look for this is an example of that you can look at the bottom or the top and if you find a little patch like this it is operating as a one-way valve this little piece here just simply to tear off the the the cover that's that makes it airtight so and then of course in the specialty realm as well you get capsule coffee like this this is a problem that is shared with also bags of coffee that you'll see typically in supermarkets where the coffee has been ground for you one you can't choose your grind and two as well coffee that has been ground you have vastly more coffee now exposed to air imagine brewing coffee beans in hot water you might as well wait 12 hours with boiling water and maybe you're going to get something as you grind it finer and finer more and more releases itself immediate so again this is headed towards a certain staleness you can get ok coffee on the run but you're not going to get the sweetness and especially the body that can be so great in a really specialty coffee for that you really want whole beans and you want to grind it when you're going to brew it freshness is absolutely key so and last thing is you will look for the roast date if you go to a supermarket it's cheese shops and so on really check the roast a tout a lot of companies in the specialty business will have a one year plus date and it'll read good until such as such a date you have no idea it could be nine months ten months old studies have shown that the carbon dioxide in a in a coffee is completely gone by about 90 days in a good one way valve after that it's staling ahead and it just gets worse and worse I would say you want to have it no older than 60 days and a lot of people would say oh you're kidding 30 days less we need to do more studies but that's my recommendation on that level once you open your bag of fresh whole bean coffee what do you do with it how do you store that coffee is a critical point it's going to now start the staling process in an accelerated fashion if you're going to be brewing it only over the next three days or so you should be pretty fine just keep it in a cool not too humid area you know good relative humidity and you should be fine but if you're going to hold it especially longer than five days you really need to consider holding it in a better way than that and I would say freezing is the best method refrigeration involves too much condensation back and forth so freezing you get greater stability with the coffee and I would propose one trying to lock it in as much as possible push all the air out one put it in ziplock bags or something along those lines as well and if you're crazy like I am a real fanatic you put them in everydays brew is put in a separate baggie if you will and tighten that way and then you just need that amount there are other methods that are coming up canisters now that really may be much better than that the jury is still out but to give you two examples we have two here that we're looking at and they both involve creating vacuums inside and and also this one has a one way though so it lets the carbon dioxide release so the idea here would be that you every day you would open it once take out your beans and then reclose it again the jury is out but this is certainly something worth perhaps you're checking out as well thank you very much you", "CHVFJ-Jx5UE": "hey guys and welcome to this tutorial on how to make coffee beans or get coffee beans so the first thing you will need is what will you need this is only for crossbreeding by the way I'll explain what you what you'll need to have for the coffee beans but these are the five things you will need first a hoe some crops a bucket of water glowstone and crop macron are optional but you can do this manual and stuff and the glowstone is for light because it just grows faster when you have a lot of light for crossbreeding coffee beans we suggest to put a layer of iron or a layer of : or and then some dirt on top of that and then that dirt you can hope to get your clothes breathing started in the middle of dirt you put some water with your water bucket and on top of the water you put a glowstone after you've done that we can start with our crops placing our crops in the center of every line you put double crops as I call them you place these by double right clicking with a crop on each corner you put a single crop this is done by just right-clicking with a crop now we can start our cross breathing of coffee we have chosen for another word because there are probably other possibilities but we'll be explaining this with netherwart so you put another word on each single crop and then you just wait until another plant grows in the double crop if your plant is full-grown and you're about to harvest it left click it and you probably get a seed back for a seed back you need a crop analyzer this can read the info of the seed because we are using another word you probably get a crossbreed or in this a copy of the nether wart don't worry just keep them or reuse them if you're really lucky you can get your coffee beans from the nether words directly but in other cases like I had I had to use Orillia and fury by starting a new cross breathing with Aurelia or fury not end you can get coffee beans eventually if your cross breathing was a success and you finally have your coffee plans just right click this time and you'll get your coffee beans to make your good coffee you'll need some coffee powder you can get these from putting coffee beans into a crafting table which gives you one coffee powder or you can simply put a coffee bean into a mass Raider which will give you three coffee powders to get your nice cold coffee just get a mug add some coffee powder and add the water there is your cold coffee of course we don't want a cold coffee so we'll have to heat it up we heat things up with a furnace of course so you just simply put your cold coffee into the furnace and there you have your dark coffee now most people don't like dark coffee so they add some sugar or some milk now in Minecraft we suggest to do that too because the effect is much better there we go we have our coffee now the only thing you have to remember when you're cross breathing have a lot of patience because it took me like some days before I got the coffee beans so have patience don't drink too much coffee and if you liked this video give it a thumbs up leave your comments in the section below subscribe to see more and we'll see you the

we're going to be making a coffee bean candle you're going to need some white wax some coffee fragrance the sent by eyedropper to put that in with a wax wick and a little jar or some kind of container that you'd like to see through so that you can see the coffee beans and some whole coffee beans let's get going alright the first step is to melt your wax and I've already got mine done remember you do this over a double boiler or a pan on low heat and you don't leave it you watch it and make sure it's a safe thing and remember it gets really hot so I want you to be really careful so I've got mine mouth in here so I'm going to put my wick right in here and don't be in the coffee beans that are going to be on the bottom just like that and then I'm going to very carefully get that centered good you know I'm going to very carefully pour this hot wax in here just like that and I'm not going to fill it all the way bit like halfway okay now I'm going to let that get a little hard to hold those coffee beans down and while that's doing that I'm going to put in a few drops of this coffee scent okay there I should do it okay now I'm going to let that get a little hard like you can see this one I don't know if it's hard enough yet or not once it starts getting a little hard you can move your coffee beans around a little bit because I don't know I don't like to have them right next to the wick just in case okay but you can move them around and adjust them however you want for the look of the candle okay okay this is set a few minutes and it's gotten that hard enough so it'll hold those coffee beans down and maybe I'll put a few more right in the air the center handle around the outside edges is where I kind of want to we'll see how this works there we go okay now I'm going to pour some more wax in there there we go and then I'm going to add some more coffee beans for the top two and by doing the layers like that then you're going to get the coffee beans all throughout candle then okay go around in there and then I'm going to use this little skewer kind of move around get them a little bit away from that wick so when your candle burns down you don't have a flame right at the coffee bean and there you go now what I did on this finished one here I add a little jute to it to dress it up a little bit but you can do however you want to do with that but here's your candle all that's left is to let it harden and trim your wick however long you like it enjoy", "-eGHUPOjMts": "we can just smell it smells really sweet malty have a smell my name is Matthew Wade and I am most master master of disaster coffee planet and I am in charge of creating and developing the blends and just making sure that we have the best quality product as as can be so I got into roasting 13 years ago now in New Zealand so I left our college without a job and as most art college levers experience they can't get a job because they can just don't don't help them very much so I ended up working lots of cafes independent cafes up and down the North and South Island of New Zealand and all of those cafes have mostly round coffee because of the location that they're so far away from coffee-producing countries so I learnt the trade very quickly and and then decided to take that skill to London and then have found myself bringing that skill to Dubai so roasting coffee obviously is very important because if you if you didn't most it you won't be able to drink it you know it's a green bean you know it's a it's a raw green bean which is really solid it's really hard there's nothing you can do with it it doesn't have any flavor it's only the roasting that puts the flavor into the coffee so what we do is we we taste the coffee that the farmer sends us and then we work out what the coffee tastes like and how we can enhance it through the roasting for example if the coffee is a light floral kind of coffee we want to keep that we want to retain that and show it off so the way we would do that is a lighter raised coffee so roasting it lighter will enhance the acidity in the brightness if the coffee has a lot of caramel roamers or natural sweetness we might want to enhance that by increasing the caramelization so roasting it for a longer period of time there's a whole load of different things that we can do as Roasters to increase the increase the flavors and the attributes it's up to us to make sure we're doing the right thing so a dark roast coffee would be really heavy and chocolaty cocoa and a light weight will be bright and floral after the roasting phase is the third stage in roasting which is the development stage and that's the most crucial part because that's where we can influence the flavor in the beam where where we get the caramelization etc right beans are starting to really tie up now they're kind of getting as darken a little bit after the right amount of color change here we go now this is a race that is really specific to the region coming from Europe I would never have thought about roasting to this kind of profile but it does actually get some quite interesting flavors come on coming off of it so what I've done there is I've dropped it into the cooling tray and I've turned the fan on so that it's sucking air through the coffee and I need to call this as quickly as possible and just keep it turning

of the coffee beans as we roast them yeah what we're going to start with is the raw coffee beans we're going to put them in the popcorn popper and they're going to go through a progression as they roast they transform from this green color as they lose their moisture content to turn kind of a golden color into browns and then to the nice dark golden brown in between this color and this color there's what they call the first crack which is your first audible clue as to where you are in the roasting process that first crack is going to sound very much like popcorn popping strangely enough as it moves past the first crack there'll be a slight pause the beans will continue to get darker and it will move into what they call the second crack which is similar to the first crack only it's not as loud but a little bit more intense very similar to Rice Krispies and milk we're aware that for being a kid or pine needles burning most people tend to like their coffee right about that point where that second crack is either starting or starting to get fairly intense that's where we normally shut our coffee down and dump it out let it cool just like you would have popcorn you put between 1:30 and two-thirds of a cup of raw coffee beans in pour it into the chamber we use the hood on ours it's not a requirement many people didn't let let the coffee beans roast and what will happen as the chaff which is on the coffee bean which is just the remnant of the fruit that used to encompass the view will just blow out so if you're doing it outside or in your garage you can just let that blow away that's not a problem we like to use because of control over the chat abuse so the actual beans themself aren't going to come flying out of the popcorn popper now every once in a while you get one or two little pop out but almost all of them stay in the chamber and so to clarify you're using a what kind of device here is what kind of popcorn poppers is this is a popper Ritu if you can find one of these at Goodwill or Salvation Army or in your own garage just the pump Ritu or the original Capri or the best for roasting coffee there's a few other older models that will roast coffee most of the newer models won't they just don't get say if you have one of those here already there so we put the beans in there put the lid on and we're going to plug it in again it will take it takes between five and eight minutes in this the first two-thirds of that are just bringing the visa learning now when you're doing the roasting you're doing it by time by smell by sound on the ambient temperature the variety of enior roasting that the agreements have to do it in the we're really good you can do by the smell and total time to roast here is by what in this bunker would be is that a drip roast or an espresso roast or yeah roasted the beam is what we're going when I was talking about those cracks the cracks can indicate where where the beans are you know where you are between that first crack and class most people second practice 50 some people the American girls can be in between the first crack and the second grade citizen American these being right arrow my roast they've been right there Center the Vienna the French that's on your head there [Music] when you talk about Rosalie play for the confident these two points changes pragmatic oh very floral getting better and you're on prep like first learning so right now we're we're we're at a at the first patch that's not almost like it's almost like popcorn there so we're now at the second stage here under here to cool it and you can hear the Technic rack is still going do you want to get to being cool down as quickly as possible to stop that roasting process so how many batches does it take to kind of perfect knowing when to stop and you know kind of getting that point where you're like oh okay we're there batches we'll get you a good idea of what's going to happen with your chosen roasting device determining what level of roast you enjoy the person is going to take a few more batches and that's just kind of just depends on how willing you are to experiment really there's a number of different ways to roast coffee we stop this this is probably a full city you can see there's some beans in here that didn't get quite roasted one of the downfalls to the popcorn popper is it's not 100% even but if you went through and just picked out some of these white beans and you end up with a nice even copy and you know as you're roasting what's the sign that you've got a good routine and a good roast what are the things to be looking at and to know it you know if you're creating quality coffee at home you won't you won't know until you grind this up and brew it up and you that will determine whether it's a good cup of coffee I shouldn't say that there are smells if you if you mess this rose up say for example the period in between the golden copy here and where the first crack happens if something happens and you stall the roast there then these are going to take the coffee is going to taste sour it won't matter what it looks like it could look like a nicely roasted Patrick puppy but it's going to taste sour hmm but that's something that you almost have to try to do it some popcorn poppers will do it for you just because they don't have it up and get the copy all the way to the second crack but it's not a very common problem and if it does happen remedy but until you grab throw this in a grinder and brew it up you won't know I mean it looks like a great cup of coffee to me but the other roasting methods that are kind of a low investment easy way to get into the roasting other than the popcorn popper you can do it in a frying pan you can do it in a worthy bot as far as pasta bishop if you wanted to start with something that everybody has in their home another convection oven orgasm and it's going to be your lowest cost entry point the downfalls of those is the learning curve is fairly steep basically requires turning me bringing the oven up to about 500 degrees putting your beans in for a few minutes and then every 2 minutes after that stirring them until they're roasted so to get a nice even roast it's going to take a little bit of practice that being said we have a number of customers that actually do it and that's their preferred method of roasting coffee be on the oven the next lowest cost we picked this wok up at IKEA for five dollars and we put a couple batches in it now learning curve is steep but not nearly as steep as the oven with a little bit of practice you're able to do a nice nice roast of coffee the benefit to the wok is it's got a small bottom and then steep side so it's really easy to keep the beans moving around to get a nice even nice even roast the next thing beyond that would be what they call what we call a worldly pop or manual popcorn popper I'm these used to be very popular at some point time a little harder to find these days but it's actually got a paddle in the bottom of the pan and that keeps the beans moving to help you get that nice even roast this on a gas oven or a gas stove top is a very effective way to roast coffee and again you're doing it you're doing it by sound again for the cracks yeah what's the with the worthy pop the gas oven you can do kilometers if you were able to get into into the base here then you'd be able to tell where your beams are temperature-wise and it would give you another another way to judge where you are in the rows you can do the same thing with the popcorn popper if you were to google and coffee roasting you would see a number of ways that people have modified the popcorn poppers too to give them more control and more precise measurements of how they're roasting their copy we've always just us take the simpleton version and just roast our copy and popcorn popper", "GuhytaZRYyQ": "coffee bean duster in also called coffee bean baking machine the taster
