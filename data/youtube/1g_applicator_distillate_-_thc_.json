{"eTb7xVO_FE0": "what's going on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "p62i-lwAn8o": "hey guys it's Florida MJ 4/20 here today I'm going to be opening my latest haul from true leaf Panama City Beach dispensary location let's see what we got we've got some 9 pound hammer Rosen man 83.5% TCA and 3.1 percent of THC for a grand total of eighty eight point six and we've got some co2 oil this one we have a Skywalker og and this one gorillas grapes will see the Skywalker og eighty point three percent THC an eighty percent THC on a gorilla grapes last but definitely also least is the I got a little syringe warmer because you know I've been using hot water and all kinds of stuff like that for a long time and I just figured I'd give it a try seems like it might be more convenient let's take a look at the total here they actually forgot to put the warmer on the first time I use my trigger points they let me stack it for twenty percent this time that's the first time I've ever had them do that I don't know if that's a new thing or what but I was allowed to get twenty percent discount from my true liver points and so instead of being two twenty five that came out to 180 so that makes each one of these sixty bucks apiece 60 bucks for the co2 and sixty bucks for the rosin I think that's a pretty decent deal you make rosin at home you're gonna be paying probably forty to fifty bucks or so to make it grandma rosin maybe a little bit more depending on the strain and you know $60.00 co2 oil is just a great deal because usually it's their regular distill it that's at $60 price point and I don't really like the regular distill it that much I mean it's just not the same level as the co2 this syringe warmer right here is $20 normally with the 20% off that 16 bucks total and here it is so this thing right here what you will do is take your battery mod that fits a 5-10 cartridge on it and hopefully you can unscrew it I guess mine's a little bit leaky we have to well there we go whoo yeah that'll loosen it up just enough darn I can't get it here we go finally how'd you get a glove alright so yeah that's the problem is I've got a bunch of leakage right here so I need to get a q-tip with some alcohol on it and cleaning that thing out that can also cause your your mod to stop working I actually found this on the ground somebody just threw it out and this thing was all gunked up and so there you go now it works let's see if this works even though it's still all gunky you just screw in the syringe warmer on your battery mod see if I can feel it it doesn't really have any structions with it smells like it's heating up in there yeah you just take this sucker look how pretty it is I love how pretty the co2 oil is just take this and stick it in there I guess maybe you take off this cap I'm not really totally sure what you do I've never used it and there's no instructions but see if this does anything hmm wonder how long this thing takes there we go it's certainly heat up right here I don't know it might be easier just to do a lighter guys seriously like what in the heck maybe I gotta try it like this take this thing off it doesn't seem to make much sense to me but I'll try it when the heck was that oh there's a spring I don't know the here is like a spring weird okay let's see this is holder for ten seconds to see if that doesn't so the video cut out there right after I held it down for ten seconds but yeah it does it does heat it up you know it's not as fast as a lighter and you have to sit here and hold it so mmm if you don't want to mess with a lighter I guess it could be worth it but yes here we go there it's all it's all melted now it really doesn't take that long you don't get sick all over it you don't have to worry about using all your butane there you go you can just keep this thing plugged in if you want really so it looks like that works pretty well I didn't get any flour because I'm all out of my flour recommendation you know I got caught up in the one plant slash three boys farm ordeal and so I spent my recommendation on that now I mean I'm not regretting it you know it's like it was a really good deal hundred twenty-five dollars for an ounce so 250 for two ounces that's pretty awesome I mean a quarter pound for 500 bucks you know medical grade pretty awesome but you know I I do miss the variety I wish I had I definitely wish I had my recommendation open when I went to the grand opening of this truly Panama City Beach because they had a nice selection of strains they had like four or five strains that day and they also had all the cups I'd use all the cups I got I went back and I only had there yesterday it was just cups of what is it wine wine dream Dutch wine yeah Dutch wine and I just I've already got cups of that so I don't really care about it yeah you know it's good stuff but I like a variety so I should my recommendation should be coming up here and about a week or so so I'll be getting a bunch more reviews on actual flour in here soon hopefully maybe I'll take a couple deliveries from other dispensaries to and branch out with what I'm reviewing instead of just doing and all the stuff that's closed or that I've gotten from before but like fluent I know I can get deliveries from them and possibly vitae can and med men I'm not really sure but yeah I'm ready to taste some variety I've been stuck on the same strains for a while now and that'll teach me something in the future too you know don't get stuck on the big old hype trap if if you might have some new openings coming in your area but it's all good I just got to say that that the employees at the Panama City Beach location seem pretty cool they're all very friendly and polite so far the atmosphere in general up there is really nice you know it's not there's not a bunch of grumpy people I mean it's not a bunch of people arguing or whatever perhaps the limit on minis help that I don't know but they said that the minis I talked to I guess my team in a shift manager I'm not sure but he said that the minis are still selling out and they'll be you know usually they'll be gone by early afternoon even with the two person or two per person limit so it's just a really popular item and you can't blame them when they're you know giving out really fat jars of minis they just baton for social media with those things you know they want to get on in line they want to get their message out they want people who don't have a card and who are getting from a dealer to say hey wait whoa whoa you can get four grams for the price of 3.5 and it looks good you know like that I mean so you know it's a work in progress this is like the Wild West phase that we're in right now once everything gets sorted out you know once the competition gets more firmly rooted wants some acquisitions take place then we're gonna start to see a more stable environment with better prices and better customer or care I think right now they're just you know that some of these people are some of these dispensaries are gonna get snapped up some of them are gonna get bought out some of them are gonna you know have really bad financial problems I mean just depends you know you got to see how it plays out and in the next two years I think we'll see the market stabilize a lot we'll see a bunch of acquisitions and stuff like that and it'll be a lot better for us at that point you know we just got a grin and bear it for now it is a kind of a [ __ ] show you know trying to get flour in this state hang in there and we can do it and you know another thing I just wanted to say I think I'm gonna start adding this as much as I can to everything I say because I just noticed that online we've got so much negativity not just in our forum not just in the medical marijuana community but in America we just in our whole country everyone is so negative everyone is always wants to be right everyone always wants to prove someone wrong everyone always wants to knock somebody down a peg and I'm guilty I'm just as guilty as anybody else or more so and you know we got to just start being kind man just please please please be kind",

glass syringes that we carry these syringes are a popular packaging option for high quality material but they can be difficult to fill so today I'm going to show you two methods that will save you hours of work especially if you have to fill hundreds or thousands of these things let's dive in the first method we are going to cover is the syringe coupler method this tiny white thing here is a syringe coupler we have them available for purchase and they allow you to connect a big syringe to a small syringe which is really cool because that is going to allow you to fill these at a much faster rate you're just going to take your larger syringe and make sure it's filled with your material then put the coupler on it by twisting it on to the luer lock then take the cap off your smaller syringe after it's fully assembled attach it to the coupler and begin your filth by gently pushing material from the bigger syringe into the smaller syringe after the fill is complete remove the small syringe from the coupler place the cap on it and there you have it a filled 1 ml syringe the second method will cover preferred method of filling because it does not require as many assembly steps which saves a lot of time there's a special tool that I'll be using to perform this fill and you can probably find it at your local sporting goods store or Walmart it's ten pound fishing line I have a roll of it right here first we're gonna cut about a four-inch section of the fishing line or whatever you can comfortably hold in your hand some of our clients like to take the fishing line and tape it to a chopstick or popsicle stick to make it easier to grasp but the basic technique remains the same you will still need a larger syringe filled with your material such as this 10 ml syringe I have here or you can even make this work with a filling machine you're going to start by taking the syringe you want to fill with a cap on and no plunger then place it in a position where it can be held upright luckily this is exactly how they come packaged if you buy from us then holding the larger syringe above the smaller syringe gently begin to fill the syringe from the top dead center taking care not to get any material on the sidewall of the syringe above the fill line this is actually really important after filling you're gonna place your fishing line into the syringe like this allowing it to hover right above the liquid then slowly push the plunger down and tell it meets the liquid inside then pull the vent cord out as you can see if this technique is used correctly it allows you to hand fill these syringes at light speed compared to other methods and there you have it a filled 1 ml glass syringe thanks for watching this video please hit us up with any questions in the comment

"5ljRikoZgb0": "uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doo doo butter cannabis goes through a lot of steps to become nice clear distillate like this but you might be surprised by what is actually used to make all of your distillate pins and all your edibles and all your syringes i'm about to tell you how distillate is made right now on the strange show answers to all the questions you've ever had about wheat distillate is a weed extract but unlike other extracts distillate goes through an extensive process where everything is stripped away from the plant except for one specific cannabinoid if you're new here my name is matt this is the strain show and this is the channel for adults and patients where i teach you the answers to all the questions you've ever had about week if you want to learn all kinds of fun facts about weed don't forget to subscribe and you can put some nuggets of knowledge into your strain brain now distill it looks awesome but it doesn't have much of a smell or much of a taste the distillation process removes all of the terpenes and leaves you with only one cannabinoid usually thc or cbd this is a glass syringe with a one-to-one ratio of thc and cbd oil this stuff doesn't have any smell at all and when you dab it it looks super duper clear [Music] and it doesn't have much of a taste either you can't really taste it i mean you can taste it but it doesn't really have a flavor and this sucks because most of the medicinal benefits of weed and most of the high you get from weed is from all of the cannabinoids working together as a team in what's called the entourage effect sometimes they will add these terpenes back into the distillate at the end of the process and sometimes weird things are added to distillate like synthetic terpenes or maybe terpenes from another plant like lavender to give it a good taste but one of the biggest uses for distillate is making edibles almost all thc or cbd edibles are made with distillate and that means that none of these edibles are going to have any of those important cannabinoids or terpenes they're going to be just thc or cbd although the finished product of distillate is pure and potent it's usually made from the cheapest weed leftovers available to the extractor since all distillates look about the same at the end of the process you can use low-grade trim leaves like trim from a trimming machine to make distillate and it won't really matter with other types of extracts low-grade weed will make low-grade hash but not with distillate that's why some people say from trash to hash when talking about distillate the first step of making distillate is getting what's called a crude extraction oil uh that's what it looks like this is what distillate starts out like that looks like a bucket of doodoo butter this nasty crude oil is usually extracted with bho like most other concentrates but since we started off with such a low grade product this is what we ended up with but this crude oil has a lot of impurities that we're gonna have to remove before we can begin to separate this oil down into its specific cannabinoids and we're gonna do that in the next step which is called winterization in this step the crude oil is mixed with ethanol and that mixture is then placed in a very cold freezer for 24 to 48 hours while this mix is in the freezer all the impurities like chlorophyll plant waxes fats and lipids they all stick together and sink to the bottom of the container after a day or two of being in the freezer all the impurities are filtered out and the ethanol is evaporated with something like this rotary evaporator so now it looks good but it's not exactly very potent yet all cannabinoids that are in their acid form even thc have to be decarboxylated before they will interact with your body the way you want them to in the third step the oil is heated to 220 degrees fahrenheit and this removes the carboxylic acid group and that converts your thc a into thc now this stuff will get you high but it's not finished yet the last step of the process is the actual distillation process itself all of the different cannabinoids in the oil have different boiling points and different molecular weights so in this last step the extractors use vacuum pressure and heat in very precise amounts to evaporate off exactly what cannabinoids they're going after and at the end of the process sometimes they'll add terpenes back into the distillate sometimes they have the terpenes from the same weed they made the distillate from sometimes they add terpenes from different weeds sometimes they add terpenes from different plants and sometimes they add synthetic terpenes so if your distillate is flavored like a great popsicle you can probably bet there's some synthetic terpenes in there now that i know about it i'm ready to dab it so i'm about to go right here or if you just want to learn some more fun facts about weed i got those videos right here and yo don't forget to subscribe for good vibes i got them nuggets of knowledge because when you watch the strange show it's like going to weed college", "kC0PG3GqVMo": "thank you too so today I'm going to show you guys how I do my any type of gummies any type of any type of salt cane the way I do this is no fail and it's really easy all you got to do is boil some water mix it really hard and you're good the main idea of my gummies and probably everybody else's but I use a little bit more just to be a little safer is a lot of gelatin so usually for a recipe for gummy bears and anything anything like that it usually calls for one box for tax which is fun you know that really will work if you made some gummies with one box of jell-o and four packs of it will work it's it's I'm not saying it's not gonna work but but now during a hot day or even just a little bit of moisture in the air your gummies are going to stick together and they're going to melt and you're gonna be pretty pissed off so take my advice and follow my recipe and I'm sure that your gummies are gonna hold up in your pocket you're gonna be able to go to work and go on with your day without any worry that something's gonna happen to basically the money you spent making these guns so let's get started so this is really simple like I said all you're gonna do is boil some water and that's it so we're gonna add 1 cup of water now that we had our water will crank go on so this isn't gonna take too long to get hot it's one cup of water so it's literally about two minutes it will probably be there so we got to think fast to move this so what we're gonna do is usually now you can do two full boxes of gelatin and that's only gonna make your gummies last longer they're gonna be a little harder a little more firm but they will last and that's the main idea but I usually like to do seven packs just because it's a perfect amount of like thickness in there so so now we're about to start boiling so I'm gonna add my gelatin sooo some cold water so it does AHS a little bit so when we actually do mix it doesn't get love you not sure if you guys know it's the Spanish shirt I'm wearing I believe design and he's out of Philadelphia PA and you guys like these shirt so I'm gonna be wearing check out his website I'll have a link down at the top lots of hats lots of shirts who's got lots of stuff ok so now that our gelatin is dissolved I'm gonna add our gelatin to the water after I have my gelatin I'm gonna have my gelatin pack then I'll add our additive and we're done so what's that era now it's at our gelatin give this a good a good old stir because you want to break up anything that's happened to not dissolve John says it's fish so this mix that we're making now I have three volts here this one box recipe should almost perfectly cover all three moles so now that our gelatin is combined and there's no more lumps now get out our gelatin so I'll do let's still line add your whole pack you really don't gotta rush this that's the best part about gummies and jello you don't it's not hard candy it's not like the minutes it's done you got the rush and it's gonna solidify on you if it does solidify you can just reheat it it's good again all right so now our jello has a gelatin and it's ready but does it have any good stuff so so it's outer additive and then we'll take the next step all right so now do you added your additive to this thing's ready to go you're ready to have a really fun day so the hard parts done we have it ready now the biggest problem is filling your molds I see people using turkey basters don't use surrogate of turkey basters think about when you suck it in just the two go over here you're gonna lose by the time you're done here you probably lost about seven to eight gummy bears worth of drop so don't use the turkey baster it's a mess and you're gonna lose stuff what I like to use is a squeeze bottle a squeeze bottle you can pour it in perfectly and boom boom boom boom no mess and no loss so let's do this so if you have a big squeeze bottle you can burp the bottle like that so when you tilt it it doesn't shoot out at somebody sitting across the room and you kind of control it a little bit better so you just go over each one how easy was that using a squeeze bottle way better than using a turkey bass boom all I got to do is wait for these is wait for these things are cool and I can be poppin these things all night long feelin really good so we'll check back in a couple of minutes when they're ready we'll see what they look like so we are all solidified see what we got the fact we used a lot of gelatin these things are gonna come out nice and hold your shape and it's gonna be nice so yeah boom just like you went to the store got some gummy bears this time they're gonna get you baked it'll look way cooler they won't melt in your pocket none of it okay go on your daily business don't worry about these but I just got these little molds I got from Michaels and they see more there's so many cool molds that you can do I really want to try the Lego molds you can build Legos with those things just so so cool but that was easy boil some water add your jello add your gelatin add your additive mix it up mold done I hope you guys can tell but I'm freaking freezing it's cold so what I like most about these is you know hard candies they're great when they take too long and you know sometimes you just want to eat some candy really fast and these are really good for it so you could be boom-boom-boom and be on your way instead of sitting there having to suck on some hard candy for a while these are these are great and you guys like what you solo today don't

guys welcome back today i'm going to be showing you guys how to infuse any type of candy that you buy from the store well at least any candy that has a sugar coating on it for example um we're going to be using sour patch kids and sour patch kids watermelons but any other type of candies that have that sugar type coating will work i've also done this with just like generic gummies that you get from the bulk section or anything yeah anything like that will work and this is what they will look like so essentially they will look exactly like they did in the bag and this is what a lot of the time people are selling so like they put them i don't know what they have like there's a different name for it but the logo and everything looks very similar to this and you're you're buying these and they look exactly the same as a store block gummy and the reason why is because it is a store-bought gummy and it's just been um sprayed or um in this case dropped on um tincture um this method is not going to get you exact dosing so please don't do this with intentions to be um like having a perfect dose because it's not really possible to do that but you can get it pretty close but for most people who are just using these for themselves like i am it doesn't really matter in the end so yeah let me show you guys how to make these and i just want to say a huge thank you i just hit 10 000 subscribers this weekend that was absolutely amazing it is my birthday in a couple of days and i feel like that was kind of like an early birthday present to me if you haven't subscribed already please do now i would appreciate it so much here's what you're gonna need some store-bought candy um the sour kind with the sugar on the outside some tincture and a syringe okay so we're just gonna start by getting our surface ready i'm just using a baking sheet with some wax paper you could use parchment paper a plate whatever it doesn't matter and then i'm taking my candy that i have here um i chose sour patch kids the kids and then the watermelons but you can use any candy that has a sugar coating on it it doesn't need to be a sour sugar or not sour it doesn't matter as long as it has that um sugary coating so i've done this before and just gone to like bulk barn and just chose whatever candies i like um you need to have that sour sugar on the outside because that is what is absorbing the tincture so yeah once i have the candies i want to infuse i just lay them out on my baking sheet and then here is my tincture so now i'm going to get my little syringe thingy and pull up some tincture so i'm not measuring how much i'm really using because it's just for me to use by myself but if you want to know how strong they're going to be you could like keep track of how many syringes you use per x amount of candies but anyway so you're going to take your little syringe and you're going to press it on to the candy and not too hard but hard enough that it's not going to go flying everywhere um here we get a little bit closer so you can kind of see what i'm doing so yeah so i have i fill up my syringe and then i set it on top and push down with a steady hand that's why i'm using two hands so i can be really steady with it and then i just push enough that um fills the cat the sugar coating with the tincture but not enough that it goes onto the tray if you add too much it will leak off of the candy and go onto the tray and then you're wasting stuff um so just use less at first to see how much it can kind of hold and just a reminder here this when you're doing this is not the candy itself like the gummy candy the chewy part is not absorbing the tincture it's only the outside that absorbing it so then now i'm just doing the exact same thing but with my sour patch kids now this is what they look like after i did the first round so that means i've only added tincture to one side of the candy and there's those watermelons you can see they've already started to dry um and you're just gonna leave these out with um air circulating so i just have a fan facing them um to help dry them off um but i have kept on having to move the tray because it kept on sitting in the sun so you don't want to be in the sun or it's going to melt as i put them into the sun here but you know that's for the visual effects so has that good lighting but yeah so in the fan leave these to dry until they're dry ish and then you're going to repeat the process of adding more tincture okay now that they've dried which i think that took like 20 minutes not even i'm just flipping them all over and then i'm going to repeat the process so with these watermelons i could flip them over repeat the process and then turn them on their like other side i feel like they kind of have a couple sides they could sit on whereas with the sour patches i can only kind of turn them over one way or another but you can keep repeating this process over and over again so i only put tincture on or i only put one layer or one serving i don't know what you want to call it i only did each side once i guess is what i should say just because i wanted to be able to eat a lot of these in one serving so if i kept on layering the tincture on it would limit how many i could eat at once um but yeah so you're just gonna let them dry after this and then you could flip them over once again and keep on adding and you can keep on doing this over and over again until it no longer absorbs any tincture and i think you could probably do about four or five rounds on each side so keep in mind when they are drying it's evaporating all the alcohol from your tincture which is why you're able to add so much to it but um i think you could also add some more sugar coating to this to allow for more tincture on the outside but i didn't want to mess around with it too much i just wanted to kind of show you guys the simple way to do this um and you know it's kind of guaranteed that this is gonna work um you could also do this with your already infused gummies so if you actually make some gummies with your tincture and then put a sour coating on them you could do this again and that would make them like extremely extremely sour non-sour extremely extremely strong because in this case these ones are only having tincture on the outside whereas if you had a gummy that was already having tincture on the inside you could also add on the outside and that would just be super strong and lovely now i'm just gonna zoom in here so that you guys can see a little bit better about how i am actually adding the tincture without it splashing so i'm taking this little syringe and i'm pushing it lightly on top while still having control of the syringe and once you do a couple of these you get really used to it and you kind of know exactly how much you can use [Music] so they were all done but i guess i decided i was gonna add a little bit more which i shouldn't have done because i got kind of sloppy about it and you guys are gonna see what happens when you get sloppy about it or when you put too much tincture on your gummy and it's not able to absorb it so let's just take a little look closer up so you can see that tincture on the bottom of my waxed paper those little greenish brownish splatters there so that is tincture that is wasted i mean obviously you can lick the parchment but if you don't be so quick and lazy when you apply it it shouldn't happen so if you see my sour patch kids here there is pretty much no tincture that leads off just a couple of little specks and that's what happens when you're patient instead of when i went overboard with the watermelons without letting them dry in between okay now let's just take a look at some of the finished ones versus the original one so here is a finished watermelon um and then yeah that looks good and let's grab a un tincturized un infused i guess uninfused watermelon and that's how it looks so you can see that sugar chunked up and then it gives it that it also have that little bit of the brown and greenish after the um alcohol evaporates so it kind of looks like grubby i guess i don't know i just feel like it kind of looks like dirty but um it's only if you look kind of close up and then let's compare it with some sour patch kids on the left there that's a uninfused sour patch kid and on the right that is a infused sour patch kit so it looks a little bit like wetter kind of it's not wet though um but yeah the sugar kind of clumps i don't know i don't even really know how to explain it but i guess you guys can kind of see on screen there yeah then there's our little watermelons um and our sour patch kids um i guess now that i'm closer with my camera here i can show you a little bit better kind of the tincture that is still on the pan um it's not too bad but i was doing this with one hand part of the way because of the camera and stuff so i was a little bit sloppier but if you guys are careful there shouldn't really be any waste now they are all dry and i'm just packaging them up um they dried like i said for like i don't know 20 minutes half an hour if you want to be super sure they're really dry i would just leave them out overnight and if you want to you can always add more tincture there is nothing stopping you from adding more a day later two days later a week later whatever it's all gonna work now you have a bunch of delicious infused candy that was super simple to make and i hope you guys enjoy this little trick as much as i do okay so now these are finished let's taste them and see how they are i'm going to start with the sour patch kids here so immediately when i open it has a very strong smell and these are going to taste stronger than gummies usually would because the tincture is all on the outside of the gummy so when it touches your tongue the first thing you taste is the tincture whereas if you're making your gummies homemade the tincture is mixed in with the gelatin with the sugar and everything else and it's less of a like direct flavor as soon as you eat it um but once you start chewing it kind of all blends in so it literally just tastes like a sour patch kid with tincture i didn't make mine super super strong so like i would eat this whole bag probably but you can make them so that they're really strong yeah oops very good very strong tasting but that'll be depending on how your tincture tastes so it's just going to taste like sour patch with a touch of tincture okay now the watermelons they're just so cute i love these bags so much i reuse them to be honest they're super super cheap but i'm cheaper um so whenever i use them and they're just like for gummies like this i'll just like reuse it after but i wouldn't reuse it if i was giving it to someone anyways [Applause] um these ones are better not just because i like the watermelons better and surprisingly they like you think they'd be all sticky and stuff but they're not i literally put these in the bag like right after i made them instead let them dry because i'm lazy um yeah they're not sticky at all they're very good strong you can definitely tell that they have tincture on them but yeah thank you guys so much for watching this video i hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave a comment subscribe and give us a thumbs up thank you guys so much for watching and have a wonderful day", "8qHG4h7fPk8": "hi I'm certified nutrition consultant Catherine with foods that heal you and foods that heal you CBD and in this video in our series I'm going to explaining the difference between four different types of CBD oil full-spectrum broad-spectrum CBD isolate and distal eight all right so I've mentioned in previous videos full-spectrum I've shown you the CBD wheel which I'll show again here but full-spectrum means that it has all of the plant parts it has all of the phyto cannabinoids it has all of the plant terpenes it has vitamins minerals all of the phytonutrients it's it contains everything my analogy that I use is it's like eating an apple if you take a bite of the apple you're getting all of the nutrients in that Apple you're not just extracting certain nutrients you're getting all of the coke the cofactors all of the synergistic nutrients in that Apple alright so if you look at the cannabinoid wheel and this is just an illustration this is not all of the cannabinoids but there's over a hundred but you can see that you have CBD is one cannabinoid and you've got CBN CBT and you even have THC and this is where the confusion can come in so yes full spectrum does have THC in it in trace amount it's still legal because it's below the legal limit of 0.3% so you're not going to experience the effects of THC if you're getting hemp derived CBD hemp oil alright so that's what full spectrum is and one more thing about full spectrum just explain between CBD and THC because this does come up sometimes people ask me does CBD have THC in it so no it doesn't because CBD as you can see is one phyto cannabinoid and THC is a separate can't avoid it would be like saying is there any vitamin B in my vitamin C there is not because there are separate vitamins these are separate cannabinoids okay so one's not in the other but they can be in the same plant all right so that's full spectrum and full spectrum is considered to be really the best option because in nature nutrients works best synergistically together and there was an Israeli study that showed also that the full spectrum was superior to these other types now that doesn't mean that full spectrum is going to be the best for you because everybody's gonna need something different you may be looking for something with zero THC in it so there's other options here as I'm gonna go through now the but the full spectrum I also wanted to give a couple examples of full spectrum so that you understand what it can look like it's a full spectrum the the most pure or whole plant extract is gonna look like our pure oil concentrates this is the green label and this is the gold label these are whole plant hemp extracts so this is the as close to the original plant is you're going to get without just grinding up the leaves all right so this is the hemp extract and then what you can do is you can have a full so that's full spectrum you can have a full spectrum drops like our tasty drops because what you can do is you can take the head backtrack add it in to this bottle with a carrier oil like MCT oil or hemp oil which I explained in other videos but you can add it in with maybe a flavor and shake it up now you have a full spectrum tincture drop alright now here's where the confusion could get in that you really need to know how to read your labels so make sure you watch the other other video in this series so you learn how to read the labels but this can be any of these truly so you want to make sure that if you want full spectrum you know how to read that label and you know that there's full spectrum in that bottle because it's the highest risk for getting anything in here and junk in there that you're not aware is in there alright alright the second type is gonna be broad spectrum so broad spectrum is going to be very similar to full spectrum the biggest difference is it's not gonna have any THC so they filter out the THC our broad spectrum product is our HC CBD spray so this has all the phyto cannabinoids it has plant terpenes phytonutrients it just doesn't have the THC so for example if your concern about drug testing for THC and you want something with zero THC but you want the benefits of full spectrum then the CBD spray would be a really great option broad spectrum would be a option there now what it does is it calls causes something called the entourage effect so full spectrum and broad spectrum you're gonna have that on taraj effect which I explained I I called it the synergistic it's synergistic nutrients working together that's basically the entourage effect when you have all the nutrients working together with all the cofactors the body's gonna be able to absorb and utilize it more effectively okay and then the third option is going to be CBD isolate now CVD isolate is going to be a white powder it's very very pure you don't have any other cannabinoids no THC no cbn CDG none of those no phytonutrients no vitamins no minerals nothing else the only thing that's in the isolate is strictly CBD and if you look on this wheel it would be only this little section right here now obviously there are a lot of potential benefits of the CBD right but if you don't have these synergistic cofactors and that entourage effect this CBD may not work very well for you now there are some things that you can do to help bring back that entourage effect and I'm going to give you a couple examples of the isolates that we have we have our cat drops are a CBD isolate and the reason for that is because cats have sensitive stomachs so we have an isolate in here now as you can see between these two bottles you would never know this is full spectrum and this is isolate that's why you really need to know how to read labels cuz I slit is less expensive so if you're paying for full spectrum and you're getting an isolate you're getting ripped off okay you want to make sure you're getting what you're paid for we have the isolated in here and then what we do is we add in back in a carrier oil that's going to help create that entourage effect all right then the other thing you can do is for example a vape we have our vapeshot our vape liquids we use an isolate but they are they can be very effective for people because we add back in the plant terpenes and plant terpenes definitely helped create that entourage effect and increase the or absorption and utilization of the nutrient and the CBD oil okay so those just a couple examples of the CVD isolate so ISIL it's not bad it just needs to be it needs to be in a formula that's going to create that entourage effect for you and then also isolate another thing that you'll want to know about isolate is that you can get super high milligrams in an isolate like our isolate powders a tiny little container with 50 or 100 milligrams in it and one thing that you can do is that isolate is you can I have a customer who adds it to to hate HC here so adding the powder to this and shaking it up you increase the milligrams of the CBD concentration and you still get that entourage effect because this is a full well it's a broad spectrum so you've got all those other synergistic and code factors to help with that powder so taking the powder straight it's usually not going to be very effective and that's a lot of times what they're using in gummy bears and Edda bear edibles they're just throwing islip powder in there and so it's usually not going to be very effective for most people but again the benefit is you can boost products CBD has no taste and some people may be allergic to for example to plant terpenes well there aren't going to be any plant terpenes in the isolate alright the fourth type is very new its distillate and distillate in a nutshell it's gonna be very similar to CBD isolate what they're doing is are isolating different cannabinoids and it's considered to be very pure just like the CBD ice looks very pure not having any of the other plant parts or terpenes CBD distillate is going to be basically like picking and choosing only these cannabinoids out of a hundred people are you know they might decide well I want CBD I want CBN and CBD but I don't want THC and I don't want CB air or whatever so it's it's kind of picking and choosing and isolating specific nutrients and putting it into the formula so there's pros and cons to that one of the pros to that again is you don't have the plant terpenes for people who might be allergic to plant terpenes the the cons would be that you don't have the plant terpenes which are super beneficial you don't have the plant terpene to are really important and you don't have all of the phytonutrients all of the flavonoids all of the nutrients that come along with the hemp extract alright so those are the four primary different types of CBD hemp oil that you can find make sure you watch my video on how to read the label so that you know what you're buying like I said if you're looking for full spectrum you want to make sure you're you know you're paying for what you get for and then broad spectrum remember that has no THC so it's a great second alternative option if you can't have THC CBD isolate would be lower on the list unless you know how to create a formula like we do in our vape pen or in our cat drops to create that entourage effect and then distillates fairly new i don't even know if there are any dislike products on the market at this point it's really experimental but that should cover everything and thanks for watching this if you have questions we'd love to have you join us on our Facebook group I'll have a link to that and you can also email us at support at foods that Helia calm we'd love to hear from you and help you out and help you better understand CBD hemp oil right thanks for watching you guys I'll see you the next video", "qr3zpQxrPD0": "hey good morning everybody its Matt hopefully you all can see me pretty well I wanted to introduce this to you basically what we've done a lot of people have been opening the capsules so we actually are working with a company out of Colorado as well so it is domestically grown hemp I have all the COAS which I'll post shortly this stuff is unreal honestly what I have here my hand is a hundred milligram syringe and we wanted to always you know as we started our mission has been to get the best product for the best price for everybody it's only $19.99 for a hundred milligrams so you can look at the amount that you're getting and the price you're paying you can see that this kind of blows almost everything else away and it's domestically grown hemp just like the flowers I've been posting on there so I want to let you guys know I'm really excited about this I took my first dose a little while ago and it's hard to explain but I kind of had like this overwhelming feeling of calmness it's hard for me to describe but you can definitely tell that it's it's doing something so I just wanted to show everybody how to administer it it comes in a little syringe it is hemp paste it's it's more of an oil but it is a little bit thicker because of the high concentration that it does have when you get it you're gonna have this blacktop all you have to do is turn it it'll come right off now because this is 100 milligrams I do not recommend putting it in your mouth and squirting it all in there that's a lot to take at one time especially if something highly concentrated like this the best thing to do is just squirt a little bit of it out like I did here on my finger you can see it's kind of like a pace so it's not falling off and then rub it in your gum lines just like that all I taste is cannabis right now a hemp that's all I taste in there it's a really really good taste it's not anything like that grassy or dirty taste that people have said sometimes about our old you know the Bluebird oils which we still do carry but this is kind of the future this is what we're going towards and you can see the major differences a lot of the retailers online some of them don't even have what they claim they say they have but there are a couple hundred dollars I mean depending on who you go with we're talking about $19.99 for something that is gonna affect many of you in a positive way so you guys are always asking this family is always asking for new products and you know Kip and I we work as hard as we can to try and get these delivered to you I hope you guys enjoy this and on a final note all of the oils are in and they will be shipping today both the cherry and the orange so I want to let everybody that has existing order that's waiting for them they're going out so you can find this at Anna mother nature calm feel free to PM me or tag me if you have any questions thanks everyone", "kwNe1LBbEjY": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to make kind of brownie using distillate so let's get into it [Music] all right so the ingredients that i need to make this recipe would be a quarter cup of water a half a cup of vegetable oil and two eggs what i'm going to do is i'm going to replace the vegetable oil with a half a cup of peanut butter so the first thing we need to do is make our can of butter all right to make my peanut butter i'm going to be using 1 gram of banana kush distilling so what we need to do first is loosen the oil so i'm going to get some hot water and put my discipline into that bowl and let it sit for about one to two minutes but let's get into it [Music] all right guys so while your discipline is sitting measure out your butter [Music] now add a teaspoon of lecithin [Music] and now at your discipline [Music] now i mix everything together all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put this on a pot and let it simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes so well let's get into it all right my can of butter is now done so let's start working on the brownie so the first thing we want to do is add our brownie mints i'm going to be using dark chocolate brownie mix [Music] now add your eggs [Music] add a quarter cup of water [Music] add a teaspoon of vanilla extract [Music] add your peanut butter [Music] now mix everything together [Music] once your mix is fully incorporated add it to a baking tree [Music] hmm [Music] hmm [Music] all right so i recommend purchasing a baking tray that have these dividers it's going to make sure that all of your brownies are the same size so just keep that in mind but now i'm going to put this in the oven so let's get into it [Music] so [Music] all right my canon brownies is now done so at this point i can eat my brownies like this if i want to however i want my brownies to be a little bit stronger so what i'm going to do is infuse some chocolate and add it to my brownies so let's get into it turn your stove on high [Music] add a pot to your stove [Music] once your water begins to boil reduce your temperature to low heat [Music] now add a bowl to your pot [Music] now this is what we call the double boiler so now what i'm going to do is add my chocolate to this bowl i'm going to be using chocolate chips but you can use regular chocolate if you want to [Music] now we're just going to wait until our chocolate begins to melt all right guys my chocolate is starting to melt so what i'm going to do to expedite the process is i'm going to get this spatula and just stir my chocolate [Music] all right guys my chocolate is completely melted so now i'm going to add some can oil to my chocolate i'm going to be using keep oil but you can use peanut butter or regular kennel oil doesn't matter but um let's get into it [Music] now i miss everything together all right my infused chocolate is now done so now we're going to add it to our [Music] brownies [Music] [Music] [Music] alright my kenneth brownings is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace you", "Re1VZwJavR8": "today really just I was about to do a distillation for meditation over the next couple weeks and thought I would try and do a better video than some that I have posted trying to go through the process a little bit at least with what I do you know this mayor cannot be right or wrong he's given the equipment that I have so one thing I wanted to talk about here was the difference in Chinese glass box or glass I guess that's one thing that was passed in one of my other videos and they mentioned that there was an article mentioning toxins in the glass now personally I've been smoking for probably 20 years or more this is something I've never heard of I've used bikes from the cheapest finished glass you know two bucks at the convenience store to the more expensive types of pipes like 80 90 bucks a head for just a basic plate you know I could see a difference a lot of it I've never heard of the toxins I've never read about we seen anybody to mention it in the article that I didn't read about it it was like somebody who you know I'd say they probably had an idea but it also didn't apply to laboratory glassware they were speaking specifically at players now I don't know about toxins but one thing what I do know about the Chinese glass for the office was causing problems but stuff like this work comes down to his tolerances and inconsistencies in the glass like you're gonna have you know the glass is not going to be you don't want thickness it may not be the best quality of borosilicate either it's they probably use something cheaper but if you use the types of soft glass mention in the article in this type of application the heat would absolutely destroy it so the other problem we've got with the Chinese type of glass are these ground joints here where they may not may not make a perfect steel you know you'll never really see it unless it's really really bad but if it can't make a perfect ceiling here you're gonna end up with say maybe this is just a little bit longer than it should be so the tolerances will be will be different they'll be way out a lot more than what you would see and say american-made glassware they're tall matches are gonna be really really close so that's one that's one of the issues were running to there and what happens when like this is too long or especially too short as this heats up you know it expands and then this joint will actually it'll fall in just slightly and as it cools down it'll grab that and it basically you know prevents that swipe from ever coming out again that's where you went into less of those problems with american-made glass also there's there's the the sealing ability here now you always need to use vacuum grease on these but with a really good quality Canadian or American made glass from a reputable company you would find that you could get a vacuum seal without using any grease or additional stuff in there but that would not be good because again you'd go back to welding your joints together and things like that so you always want to use a greasing so that being said this is just the quote-unquote cheap distillation unit you know it's not it's made by some offshore company so it does the trick but it could be better like I'm pretty sure I run into packing leaks and things like that there's no insulation around globe flasks and other such things like that where you see improvements like that on the American stuff also your electronics in here these are very cheap electronics so it doesn't have the accuracy in temperature it does about the same plate control that something better would happen where this just controls the temperature by a thermal probe and basically turning the heating on and on and off repeatedly you know to maintain a temperature a more professional unit will use wattage control where it'll actually just adjust [Music] the amount of current going into the heating element instead of turning on and off it's actually regulating regulating the current that's feeding it so that you have a more accurate more steady temperature so not all being said now I would like to get this [Music] I just like to every night at the back you pump right [Music] and I've reached over my shoulder down to zero so I [Music] another thing I wanted to talk about here is the back in Greece I started off using this Dow Corning's but the person I think it's garbage it's thick it's it's sold us back in Greece but it seems to leak through the joints no matter how little I use or doesn't create a perfect seal if I don't use just the perfect amount you don't need a lot anyway what I've started using here is krytox GPL 207 which it's a little thinner it's not marketed as back in Greece but it's a parent induct and a fighter temperature resistance so when you're using this stuff you really don't need a lot a little little dab on there just a little dab will be it's hard to do with one hand and then so on your joint you would just apply a little bit of that is down the edge there just like that even that looks like quite a bit there I don't like to come all the way down to the bottom on this piece just because this doesn't see a lot of the heat and I you know I don't like the trip to seep into the joiner end up running past now but how do you pull the vacuum this will thin out it'll really in the filament will pull into the rest of the joint you do have to make sure to actually put enough on there though otherwise you'll still end up with joints that are hard during just put a little bit on there like that and you stick that in the joint you just spin it back and forth until you get a nice clear joint seal showing that like it's easier to spend titles so here's how to properly grease the join now I've got a nice thin little coating on that side that side put it in there carefully just minutes with the devil corny grease it tends to make the joint nice and clear I've noticed with the cry box it doesn't clarify it as much they just spin it there and you shouldn't feel any any glass grinding together get you just feel smooth all the way around that's nice and snug and stay longer I'm actually gonna clean house and as is your joint don't forget to put a cat clip on it there should be plenty enough grease one thing to take note up here do not forget your [ __ ] stir bar because I do this just about every time and I have to take this out plop it in there and we grease that joint make sure you put your spare bar in there every time I'm about ready to get this started now I get my cold trap cold and for anybody wondering what the purpose of this bowl here is the goal trap will collect any of the vapors and they'll drip down into this blast now the extra cold will help also condensed extra [Music] boiling installing cycling so with everything hooked up greased up everything's cold vacuums been running for a while and gotta like glasses together so the first thing I'm gonna do is run it back to you and don't worry about that little dog this is the flash don't fly called a joke this I mean it will cause some certain problems as it will also try to boil and want to vaporize compounds that are still in it but that's already distillate so this should be pretty negligible and yes I should have taken the time to clean that better but the other two that will collect everything are clean much better and as this is just for personal use I'm okay with this yeah I'm not too concerned about that right there so the first thing we're gonna end up doing here is turn on a vacuum gauge also this PVC pipe isn't hooked up that was an experiment before I was going to run in public that PVC is just not the way to go it off gases and a week too and it just there's there's too many points of leakage so it's just not word that maybe some Dale gold stainless steel but right now that's just not you know it's it's not in the foreseeable future so I'm just using the government roses and then [ __ ] everything up or whatever I need at the time the vacuum regulator just hooked up because for other purposes if you did that great out of the way out of the back and pump through the table into the vacuum regulator - bull trout so whenever I need to use anything else I just I just unscrew that fitting there screwing whatever appropriate fitting I need so right now for for the distillation I'm just going to do turn it on and set it to pull back in because we don't need any regulation here it's probably isn't the greatest pump but I'll worry about these problems a little bit later down the road for us to change the oil I just changed out while the singular form works next another the dryers as well [Music] smells pretty clear to you this is just a reservoir [ __ ] chambers in here so question they tell you almost impossible through here [Music] missiles you gotta be careful in your film because we have company [Music] so just be wary about it got one of these pumps right now I'm just pulling you back c'mon I'm gonna let that pull down as low as it'll go before I even start heating it up as you can see is kind of slow with this welcome other part of this problem is my lines could be dirty so you know there's terpenes and stuff collected absorbed into the lines and they're gonna be vaporizing and off-gassing as well so that's another thing that'll affect your vacuum level another thing that I'm aware of and we'll try to address in the future see what I can do about that so I'm aware of some of the problems that I have here another one should be this should be robbers I guess in some tip while I'm not really sure what I should wrap it with I'm going out there how quickly you're done oh yeah but how does of great now like when this is running this is just acting as a condenser as well I'm going I did try packing the head with stainless steel steel wool I wasn't really sure how much of there's also the condensation that bill here which is an issue running degrees so that's another thing they're going to take care of possibly wrap that up so there's there's key things that I'm aware of that I need to fix that could improve the distillation overall we'll see how long this takes it's just about one o'clock in the afternoon I'm hoping to get started here by one o'clock and see how long it takes to get through this whole process thing so right now we're sitting at 1,200 with this particular batch I have done more filtering on this than dispatches okay I kept filtering it through stage one and full of a stop boat that I really freeze up to 24 hours again we filtered it through stage one and I kept doing that if there was nothing coming through in stage one there are nothing getting left behind the filters to stage one which I wasn't doing previously and I probably should have been actually I definitely should have been alive and I repeated that through stage two and stage three as well so what's in here is has been more filter than anything that I put in previously so I'm curious to see what kind of an effect last thing you have going with this with this current class of distillation and what's in there right now is just to put exactly 1,000 grams fully winterized and filtered plenty of oil they you know make thanks to a closed loop system actually made to a terminator style system so here we are at 9:20 so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna let that just sit for a while without backing pull-down we'll come back when that's that's not a star I've been holding steady at 860 for a while got a pretty good boil there I mean realistically I'd like to see it not boiling but someone's car cleaning it up now [Applause] I'm gonna heat up to 50 degrees you're running before I start turning on the starboard point of advice if you want your driving school last a little longer one thing that makes a good seal not let any moisture in there because it hit moisture freezes and then encouraged to do a block of dry ice to do is just stuff it all blankets or towels or whatever in this remove all the air space that you tend from the dry place and this will last the cooler I'll have this pool of dry ice in a couple of days and I constantly use it topping this thing off making sure it stays cold that's the process for now it's just going to be one once it hits 50 degrees start going up by 30 degrees so then I'll heat it up as soon as it is 50 I'll ramp it up to 80 and then from 80 I'll go to 110 and so on and so forth like that usually once I get to about 180 I've seen a bit of reaction from water and other call the files and stuff up here and ahead so I will hold it there at that temperature for a while we'll let that stuff collect into the ship blast so I haven't had a bit of an opportunity here and I see we have boiled up a little bit [Music] but it's not 60 degrees right now all should be 56 overshot that's already pointing system so at this point now since it's not Ronnie Emma on the skewer because we see over there 1,050 [Music] the pressures come up because the vapors in here well this is the first time ever you do this to me only goes so fast that we're gonna stop [Music] except this 286 the other thing too is this is a PID so it's gonna learn it know if I want to get to 50 I'm gonna end up going up to 80 anyway so I guess it's kind of learning that it came to order shoot the temperature a little bit stupid [ __ ] but this is where your this is the difference between your basic PID and something that actually controls the wattage right now I'm pretty sure that's just collecting water and ethanol but only mostly ethanol what was left after the evaporation process the reclamation so this unfortunately won't be reclaimed it will just be thrown out I just about at 180 now pretty vigorous reaction going on I'm honestly not sure if it's supposed to happen what this right now this isn't anything good this is just the about earlier least I think it is anyway so in this pointing I've been told these puffs of smoke are not good [Music] I can't remember the reason why and I'm not running entirely correctly with myself can leave your song [Music] so I will just hold this here for a little until this reaction stops basically distilled all out just got pure stuff here over the right now we're in 860 so it's been just about an hour come up to this temperature get here of course that our like it's gone up to a Nazi 1200 [Music] gen-i smoking stuck there too Nessa's tough innings of is out there the bus now if I had a secondary cold trap on there I'm sure so I know this server stuff didn't like - all this hold America last one during about ten minutes later you're taking the reaction up here stock for the most part I stopped collecting stuff as a pastor [Music] [Applause] start turning because this would take a while [Music] hormone when this to exchange so slope is still down at 790 microns now [Music] about 220 now and [Music] after twenty twelve hundred microns was lower I was starting to see a little bit reaction here so I've set the temperature up to 230 and I want to stop it when I start having a reaction here 46 degrees at the head I'm going to junk this is starting to get a little bit more yellow kind of a bit a little bit thicker oh I also set this up once this hit [Music] so probably by the time this event of 225 or 220 6w3 in addition to 25 right now with 154 point two degrees and temperature dropping at the head well 50 micron 2-minute 86\u00b0 I'm actually going to hold that right there that is now 240 in the afternoon when I started this about one o'clock from here I am our 40 minutes in see this is running by the Chinese stuff that's gonna overshoot the temperature not measuring correctly as to why to swing hysteresis I only seen a really big clean reflux rate in this setup once or twice I mean no one wants your twice but I mean just to replicate it every time I probably turn around run for a bit michalak [Music] so it's 3:45 started except one I had the temperature such as a little too either to 35 and it's kind of boiling over but it has gotten to the fraction looking for I think it looks pretty good the most part yeah some kind of something's showing up I'm not sure what it was but so far this looks pretty good here another got this stuff coming down before coming down it was little green colors like this because he [Music] I'm so willing to do now is I'll rotate this over and begin collecting this fraction and collected in this separate jar here yeah rotated cow turn the temperature down 230 actually keep this one 2:33 instead so collecting distraction I think I have noticed that I've got I mean you see it down there very well little bubbles right there in my class I'm sure how they came about or where they came from [Music] I believe this is the hearts hearts fraction I wanna say but I don't know also not really sure with those little bubbles I run I think it's just an air bubbles I want to save all this I hope it is it looks like it is [Music] I'm sure this looks like animals [Music] and there's old that's collected someone that will be I guess wildest one and then I put this stuff into it our container later right after all the same process I gotta collect all the garbage and let it sit this fraction that off [Music] [Applause] and so far so far just looking like the nicest distillate I've produced out of this which I attribute to the extra filtration that I'm wrong see how it looks on collects an alert so while 280 degrees when we got eleven fifty microns not ideal I was able to pull a lower vacuum on this and the temperature would be much lower than the same results right now it's five o'clock now so that's been going for about four hours a couple hours since I actually started to cover it it's another nine hundred and sixty microns now we're degrees up in the head to put it 32-bit 50:33 it seemed to be working pretty well so bit of oil over but in the most part I guess it's working okay this what's already here there was at some point there's a little white cloudy [ __ ] showing up I'm not really sure what it was but it's not there now it's not showing I'm done here this in a second distillation with help I'm not sure what that [ __ ] is it keeps showing up in here I have never shown like one of my other videos I'm not really sure how it started why it started it's not something that I've always seen and quite frankly and really saw in flesh and doing all the filtration so that's what confuses me the more but I don't see anything down here and now right from there we are a couple hundred grands who goes [Music] this is actually pretty clear the stuff that you see in there there's a lot of air bubbles it's hard to see on camera but you know what right there right there a little I feel swirl thing that's that murky [ __ ] that I was we play those bongos across there down from the top goes over there [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] and that seems like a lot but I eat about five or six grams probably about 10 grand you're just eating this [Music] 20 up there 6 evening now and I'm pretty much just gonna wrap this up on you there's a bit left in there I'm sure there's a lot I could collect still I don't feel like letting it run all night it's director slow down and get a lot of character so [Music] Kangra doesn't really show it too well there's there's a lot of stuff on the outside of the glass that's showing up in here there's some air bubbles and what's dirtier than it really is but it's not it's not that very this however this does look a little bit cleaner still less air bubbles it's a higher heat yeah I did turn this up specifically so I would get a higher boiling right but even now I can see it's starting to slow down there somewhat so it's about at this point I'm just going to shut it off here and we got we're at 10:50 so I find pretty disappointing a lot of times that dullness I've been able to achieve a lot lower results in fact a couple of times by this point I've been down to probably 200 or less microns so I've definitely got some issues here and I'm welcome some of these got some suggestions or nonsensical help me out I call that some people suggestions and done what I hadn't but at this point I'm not sure just too much too much more I can this is certainly clogged up you got a goblin come down there you want some [ __ ] that's one thing that having problems with usually that starts happening at the beginning it causes trouble the whole way through but when that plugs up the boiling air stops I'm going to give it a little bit water - for sure color week too low 6:30 6:40 [Music] now you can see where it blocks where it becomes plugged and stops the boiling across it's still going there's not a click still a bit in there I'm just a little pressed for time this evening unfortunately so [Music] well I do when I shut this down I just turn the temperature way and just back down to zero and I'll let this cool down under packaging all still running because if I unplug this right now if I disconnect a vacuum right now this will fill up with smoke I don't really like doing that I don't like it and smoke in there it's all about you're in a while to cool down and then disconnect all files and applause playing out with the next and four blasts into the jars did you make a medicine so I just released a vacuum on that bye I loosened up this time I just kind of pulled it that'll do with support so I want to collect that stuff my trusty heatgun here [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] when you're cool enough heat gun to mine has a cool setting [Music] any rate when you pull off your heat gun you're always going to want to put it up like that will maintain the light to your heat gun and be less dangerous because unless the heat escape up inside that's just a this is a little FYI I'm gonna turn the pump in here there we go we'll call now today I said I'll just pull these once it's out here like so and before I have to you know wipe up the grease inside there and we have I'm not gonna lie I'm not gonna try and you know I'm not gonna be anything I'm sure I could have better results I just don't know how I would love to have better results perhaps I would be able to consume less of it on a daily basis but for the time being it is what it is this is pretty much what I did it looks pretty golden and nice when you look at it you know in a syringe or in a little on a little jar something like that piece of glass until the drunk did it take in there like I said I'll recycle that that plainly stuff in the bottom yeah I love your backs and that's kind of stuck but you know it can be recycled it's gonna be cracked and so I just don't like waste and if I can waste as little as possible I will should we got that up I'll set that to uh turn off for about you meter the condenser so I'll take that part this is some little and that's it for today that's just from that distillation thanks for watching everybody", "7E6pxDesewg": "[Music] hi it's Brandi with green wellness life it has been a bit since we've done a video and I've been getting some customer requests so learn a little bit more about a few of the products that we offer so I thought we would take a few minutes to do just that today so we are going to talk about the plus CBD oil raw whales that we have now and you might have seen our other video on a raw tuile and how that works and that is from USM wholesale and that is an a standard oral syringe real easy to use you just push down that plunger the only problem with it is that the serving size cannot always be exactly precise we recommend that you and would put those serving sizes in terms of grains of rice and I've actually a customer say well what type of rice brown rice white rice long grain yeah super good question it's pretty it's pretty standard so everybody is a grain of rice size serving might be a little bit different so plus DVD has taken some of that guesswork out of it for us now they don't have a raw version they have what they call the total plant complex which is their full spectrum still has plant matter all the cannabinoids included there and then they've got their filtered option so that is their gold option and it does have a little bit more precise serving these come in a one a three and a six gram applicator so that's pretty similar to our other offering but the us have does have a 10 gram and that is a bit of a better value same percentages so the gold is going to be about 25% or 250 milligrams of CBD part of one gram serving and then the total plant complex with the green label that guy is going to be about 150 milligrams of CBD for the one gram applicator because they have that precise serving size each one gram gives you 20 servings so if we're go back to our grain of rice analogy that's about a grain and a half of rice per serving so these are super easy to use all that you do is twist until you hear the click this has been my sample guy for a while so it was little bit dried at the top I was just cleaning that off because well yeah so this is the gold you simply turn it until you hear the click I'm not sure if that was audible to you but we turned it until here to click that will go right onto your spoon to your finger to whatever you want to use and it's going to dispense about that much because the Gold's more of a gel rather than a piece that's going to hold its shape it does turn a little bit liquid I'm gonna give you one more serving size example so it still kind of looks like a grain of rice to me I'm not much of a cook just ask my husband but it probably is a little bit thicker in that application still gonna have that almost popery flavor of the filtered CBD oil with no added ingredients no carrier oil no flavorings no anything just those different cannabinoids in a filtered form now the total plant complex green label again 15% versus 25% this is still going to be more of a paste then that goolge a little different consistency little thicker we're still just going to turn it to here one click and then we will have we will have the one serving of the total plant complex so one serving of that guy just turning til we hit the click easy-peasy this is gonna look about like that so again our grain and a half of rice I'm a total plant complex this one's still going to taste really grassy and earthy heavy is our adjective but grassy and earthy and the difference between the two is that this guy just has not been as filtered so it's gonna still have some of that plant matter all those terpenes in there that some of us really like thicker green paste we're gonna pop it under the tongue let it dissolve a little bit 30 60 seconds whatever works for you and then move on with your day it tasted either of these is a struggle for you I get asked a lot about mixing them with a liquid I wouldn't do that as these are they're just not gonna mix that well with a liquid so try mixing it with honey coconut oil something of that nature to help you out with that flavor should be pretty helpful so just another option another great way to get CBD into your life on a daily basis without any additives you are always welcome to email us at support at

"gEGqGVR7jKc": "yo what up yeah trying something new again today we have this distillate I rest this link yeah it's got CBD and it's one one ninety two percent total it was on sale today so we're gonna fill up the needle where's the plastic this is good I just did a DAB this is [ __ ] good nice and smooth relaxing today we're going to use the sour OG from little yellow bus they said this stuff will not turn black if you mix it with real distillate you're gonna have the best product out so if this don't work little yellow bus I'm gonna be mad so he said do one to one with this stuff [Music] let me shake yourself first always shake it off shake it like a Polaroid picture it smells amazing [Music] we're distant on straight distance Shh we play in there we're going to take her to the stove and let her do her thing [Music] get back when she's a little bit out clear for the cooling period now said like I said 2025 minutes and it looks nice yellow clear just what you want see how hard they alright we're back it's been 25 minutes and hardened up some but it's still a little liquidy I'm not around tryout was the 25-minute mark it's clear so let's take one of these t9 I guess they're called cartridge there was like a piece of glass stuck down in the D like I said these carts are driving me not saying more about to be done even smoking nothing but knowing okay so let's take our car squeeze it's clear it is super clear get the rest relative I don't have my good needle I had to suck a saddle that was his junkie junkie damn sucker my sucker there all right smells like the sour OG I mean it looks per deep-down phenomenal throw my excess off like I said I still got more in there but I'm just gonna try this right now to see if this battery works this one is on the charger still looks clear yeah [ __ ] man that's how you make a real card and you got to use real just one shoe I'm rocked that was 92 percent that's the thing I did a half of a quarter or whatever whatever probably like a 67 percent quarters maybe but still you can definitely feel it whenever you hit it long as this thing stays the same color yellow now tomorrow I will be 100% satisfied and totally behind my homies yesterday that's regular concentrate and we're good turned a little brown but still kept the flavor this ROG got that dispensary taste start at that fruity ass it's got that rural band I think Rick's let's see if she's leaking we're still dry no Ronnie but what did the flavor sour OG still yellow beautiful color I'm definitely rips use this thorn you have to use the stone if you want real good quartz I'm going to do a review tomorrow probably even later than regular produce and I'm placing this thing down because I'm loving to them how good it hits and the flavor and the flavor is amazing it's so smooth don't cough that's the same thing when I did the dabs with this brand of stuff you don't call if it's smooth you can put that on your dabs and flavor it if you want and it just like totally cuts off the harshness of everything can't see me hi guys thank you for subscribing this [ __ ] is good I'm very very satisfied with this turning brag at all I'm satisfied the tea this is how you make cards for real keep subscribing we're gonna be making all kind of crazy they got a blueberry sour grape this blue a lever makes Unger somebody makes us seen we're gonna start doing a lot more of these holy [ __ ] I had this thing three times so yeah get this one some little buff little yellow bus honey liquefier thanks guys keep subscribing keep watching keep you and thanks", "eDn3wTnbsE8": "how's everybody doing this is John with C&C connoisseurs and we've got a much requested one for you today so do you have a cartridge and you're having a hard time refilling it well this also applies if you happen to purchase one of these questionable cartridges and it fails how do you remove the mouthpiece to extract the oil I'm going to show you how to remove the mouthpiece from these cartridges in a way that they can then be reused or the oil can be recovered from them now the tools that I'm going to be utilizing are simply a common pair of vise grips and these are going to be csail 1 mil or 1 gram disposable one-time use ceramic coil cartridges that being said let's take this to the deck ok well here we are once again these are one-time use non removable sea cells as you can see right here this is a sea sail brand that is a batch code on the bottom alright this is another one this one here does not state sea sell across the bottom but on the base it does say sea sell m07 9 this is also a Jupiter distributed cartridge so the first things first we're going to take a pair of vice grips common write scripts and we're going to adjust them so when we apply them we apply them just at the base of that metal see how it's just barely barely at the base of that metal right there and we want to close it so it closed it just a little bit it pinches down just ever so slightly nothing cracks it barely bows and then you rock it back and forth rather firmly now there you have it you will get some flyer marks on the mouthpiece but if you look this collar right here which is what you want to preserve is undamaged completely undamaged okay now well there's the silicone ring right there that will seal around this shaft so you don't worry about that now in this outer sheath you can see that it is also undamaged that one was a little bit difficult I'll apply it to this just to stand it up and they'll have a go at one of these other ones all right I will show you again on this one here I said this is a C cell you take the pliers right at the base of the metal hinge it lock it back and forth pulling the cartridge off of the mouthpiece just like that [Applause] very simple easy there you have it alright now I'm gonna apply this cartridge to this battery just for a stable base and I'm going to open up this gelato right here and warm it up to dispense it into this cartridge okay now here is the cartridge we are going to refill all right here is the mouthpiece for the cartridge perfectly fine a couple of scratches on but that shouldn't affect it in the least here's the distillate we will be applying to it I have warmed this up substantially just to ensure that it does flow rather well into the system you simply place the applicator tip on the syringe twisting it to ensure that it has a good seal you put the syringe tip down into the cartridge and then just begin to apply the fluid all right there you have it as you can see the original line of the older oil right there at the bottom of the new oil coming down to meet it okay take that off the bottom there and see it's sinking down there very nice we didn't get a protective silicon cap for these threads right here apply it to the threads take the mouthpiece that came off of the cartridge put it over the top and it will it will not go on all the way that's a good thing that means that the seal still works it will not go on at this point you want to take a precision device and apply pressure now as you do that you will see this seal disappears and there you have it let's take this back up top and see how she does all right and here we are back on top with the csail refill that we have here now as you can see the oil has got down to the coil has mixed with that heather oil bubbles are rising to the top let's take this protective cover off the bottom of this hook it up to a battery let's see what we got shall we well there you have it that's working like a champ looking that of oil through there I can get that a little bit of gelato flavor from that distillate that I put in there it's very nice well there you have it that is how you can remove and refill one of these cartridges to extract the oil from it what you're going to want is a slightly longer blunt syringe tip and I have a few of those a slightly longer blunt syringe tip such as this one right here as you can see how long that is that would definitely get all the way down to the base of that and you would be able to extract any additional oil that happens to be in a cartridge where this this cell has failed this one no it's not failing all it's working great well thank you so much for tuning in this has been John with TMZ connoisseurs you be sure to remember to subscribe and give this a thumbs up if you liked it and tune in to some of our other videos to see if you like those as well thank you so much this has been great you have a nice day peace", "6-H9X4PEpnY": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hey what's up everybody - boom axe beats here get up max reviews wouldn't do another medical marijuana review and now this time I'm gonna be doing one back on Africa I had one back yesterday evening actually because I was finishing up my 9 pound hammer and you can check that review out - if you haven't seen it but I went to Africa because I really wanted to try their their concentrate syringes and I went on their website and they had a strain called Durban not sure if it's Durban poison or Durban it just said Durban excuse me so uh seemed that it had ninety three point something percent THC and I was like yeah that's for me that's really so it comes in this bag right here like my whiz from Africa nice little blue bag they got and inside the blue day they have a ziplock a little bag in itself and the way that you open that is there's like a little thumbprint here on the side you just you just press it in and then you go ahead and unzip okay and I have some product facts here tells you you know like what's inside the the products obviously tetrahydrocannabinol and a pure concentrate syringe especially formulated from cannabis plants extracting for medical use and yeah it tells you like how much the active ingredients is the Delta nine and then the 900 milligrams and then you know it says has other ingredients cannabis plant extract and natural terpenes um the only thing that I could possibly say it tells you like what temperature to store as well 68 to 77 degrees is what the window you want to keep it at and as far as temperature wise so yeah the only thing complaints I have of after you is they they don't have like much info as far as other dispensaries or I've been to one other dispensary and that dispensary had um like facts ahead the strain name you know and I just I don't know this is Durbin and it just doesn't have the strain name on it once you buy it so you got to remember what you got it only has a hybrid like the dominance of it so the dominance is a hybrid and it says here 93.7% THC and 0.2% CBD it has the harvest number and it has the lot number and where it was manufactured and it says one syringe I like how they have it in a pill bottle that's cool because it's like it actually looks like medication now it's not just like some you know like some other places have they just keep your liking a pop you know anywhere you know like so you might get pulled over or something and they might think like oh what is this like you know but this is actually like it looks like medication so I like that and yeah just open it and get right into the review this is what the syringe looks like very dark very dark color and trying to get it behind the white so you can see actual actually just get it close up for you guys okay so there it is up close and uh I should give you guys a nice little visual of it and get you guys back in oh yes all right so yeah we're just gonna get right into it I don't want to say that and talk for 20 minutes but today's different gonna be a new day new day for change here's our the yolk ham and this is what I'm going to be using today and basically uh in the past I've sort of recommended this but now I kind of like full fledge go ahead and recommend this because I actually found out what the problem was what with it I wasn't tightening on the screw so here's what it looks like you open it up you got the Yochanan there and then underneath here you have like your charger you have another atomizer or a Tama I don't know I sit at atomizer I guess you have another one of those and it's basically a cart cartridge that you can fill up with a juice or whatever concentrate and babe whatever you can get in there so today I'm going to be using the coil atomizer and it's basically it's just a coil where you would drop a little dab of this on there and inhale and it heats it up for you so we're gonna go ahead and do that and just so you guys excuse me just so I guys know I took like a very very very very very very tiny taste of this just to see what it tastes like wasn't really trying to get medicated off of it just a little drip I was hanging off the end and I I just like wanted to get a taste so just so I can give you guys like a taste test or a review and I just did that actually before I turned it on so I could still taste it and it just tastes like um I don't know if you guys ever had like edibles or something like that and excuse me it has a UH like a little edible taste it tastes like cannabis really um yeah it tastes like cannabis um but just the THC though not too extra added so uh Warren achar I'm gonna try to do a close-up for you guys where you can see me loading this up so just in case if you guys wanted to get the same product or something similar you can just go ahead and do it the first step that I'm gonna show you guys is uh you don't really need to warm it up too much but if you are going to warm it up this would be the first step really a lot of people warming up with their hand they just hold it in the hand like this or there's like a pen where you can insert this in and it'll warm it up for you just hold the button but me personally I just hold it in my hand like this and I'm from you know where a place where like it snows all the time so this is what we do you just ability your breath in there that you warm the warm breath for about five seconds ten seconds tops and that's it now this comes with a a pull-off cap it's like a unscrewed cap like that and I like to take both of these off so I'm just gonna do it I'm gonna go ahead and do that I'm gonna take both of them off and I see right there it's just these two little one is a cap that holds it screws in and then the the other is the part that it screws into and that secures or fastens the cap screw in so that you can screw it on so I'm just gonna go ahead and remove that completely because and I'll show you why in a second let me just go ahead and move my gimbal okay so here it is and here's the yoke an and here is the atomizer okay the atomizer actually has three one two three yeah three parts to it I'm gonna say so here's the coil I'm trying to get it so you guys can see in there but there is a coil in there and basically what you want to do is you want to let out about this size just a little tiny bit you see that guys that's actually too much but it's a race size and that's what you're said \u00ecdo you just get the right size and you're just gonna want to put it right on the coil there smear it around a little bit on the sidewall that's what you said to do okay try to get you guys okay so yeah so that's what I said you want to do it looks like it's gonna keep coming out so I'm gonna draw back a little bit on it what you want to do is just screws back in and then from there just gonna drop this right in there and it's good to go that's all you gotta do ladies and gentlemen so let's get back into it let's get the taste tester saalu let's see what this is about let's see what the Durban is about some kind of medication feeling it can give us but here this is what in there not really sure how like how long you're supposed up how long you're supposed to hit this for um I just put like a a right sized drop in there that seemed kind of like a lot hmm it tastes good it tastes kind of like the UH I'm trying to think of what it tastes like tastes a little bit like the cartridge that I got from Africa Wow Wow excuse me guys and girls okay well wow what a difference from the cartridge to that holy cow whoa all right sorry guys I am like really medicated right now from that wasn't expecting that at all I've been using something else which I don't recommend that yoga that y'all do and it's do not use the yo can with this it is a cartridge burn as a concentrate unevenly or something it just doesn't give you the hit that I just got yeah I'm I'm good sheesh all right so um I don't know if there's anything like else left in here um or if it burned but I suppose a rice sized drop in there Oh got some smoke so I guess you can hit this more than once out to you after you dab with it did I hit that one kind of taste it a little bit like the granddaddy purp or the now I'm done hammer that hat well I apologize but I'm gonna leave all the coffin in there just so you guys know how how powerful it is hey alright so um wow I'm gonna have to take a minute I'm sorry for like the clicking and coughing and I'm doing like I probably sound like a like one of those tribes you know we're like on a YouTube video wow I just think I might have to take a minute guys like I might only took a minute like cut seriously they're like sheesh I'm gonna have to take a minute and just take a walk for a second Wow Africa the guy even said um David said like be careful when he gave this to me is that you know just be careful because this stuff is really strong so I really gotta be gotta do gotta be careful don't drive honey don't don't think about driving or no and yeah well you're about to take this because it's like I feel completely different like and I feel like I have to take a minute to relax I can just get my thoughts like straight I take a walk or something they oh no this is I wasn't expecting this I suppression or private they took a rice sighs a rice sighs Wow so yeah guys I'll definitely definitely recommend this I don't even know if I'm gonna get anything else like as far as anything to concentrate I did do that I did do the uh the granddaddy purp and nine pound hammer from a difference especially but I didn't do it from this I didn't dab it like this because I thought it was broken because I didn't have it tightened enough I didn't actually have it tighten enough so it wasn't making a connection to the heater coil or whatever it's called and uh it just was acting like it wasn't working it was basically every time I would try to go and hit it it was just doing this obviously was just doing this alright you guys could see that it's just blinking like it doesn't have anything in it you know I mean so when you put something in it though it stays on and I guess it wasn't making a connection so I actually I think her name is Vicki Nikki I forgot she loved to comment just so I could shout you out I don't want to butcher her last name Gillan or Gillian Gillan I think Illinois but Vicki she actually said they hate why don't you try this way and I went ahead and replied back to her like I did try that way but I think it's broken so thank you Vicki for helping me out with that uh for making me like a little bit motivated to go ahead and try it again because if it wasn't for you doing that I probably would not have so yeah definitely try it this way if you're gonna use if you're gonna inhale the concentrate definitely dab it or use it on a coil of some sort because I tried it with the granddaddy purp in a nine pound hammer with the cartridge and it did work confirmed it did work but it wasn't like this at all not at all like I had to take at least like five or six of them pulls like long pulls to feel like I do right now so yeah definitely do it this way um eating it I felt like it went so quickly when I ate it and it took so long to kick in so I just it's just I have a high a high tolerance for a THC so I this way is you know I mean it's like right away you feel the effects and it you know doesn't ease into it and then you know and then damn you hit you like and then you're feeling good it's just I like this so I might uh I might do I might do like some gummy bears or something I don't know we'll see but it was seventy-five bucks guys and it's 900 milligrams so it's not anyone's busy oh man there goes the dog again that's his like morning ritual Oh time to walk me so yeah anyway I'm gonna go walk him but before I do that I'm gonna close with the 900 milligrams it was seventy-five bucks but it is powerful as strong so like I can't do a comparison on the granddaddy apartment 9 pound hammer to tell you that which one was better or which one was more potent but uh because I was doing it out of the cartridge that yocan came with which wasn't the best way so from now on I'm gonna do this I might go back and get something else of the true clear or something but for now this is the Afra and I'm totally impressed with this thank you so much \u00e1free\u00e1 this is the port st. Lucie location and yeah that's it guys thank you for joining if you haven't already like comment or subscribe tell me what you guys would recommend I'm gonna try to do some other dispensaries but

injury in 1997 and he was put on a ton of pharmaceuticals and it didn't really help with his with his injury and the symptoms he he would get dizzy he wasn't able to walk well he had short term memory loss he's very high blood pressure from all the pills so he had asked his doctor if he could get his cannabis farm because cannabis has been legal in Canada for god knows how long and his doctor would not prescribe it to him so he just went and did it anyway I did a little bit of research on him and he said that on with me decided to use cannabis was a show called the nature of things and it was an episode on cannabis and it was just healing people left and right it intrigued him to try it so again he went to his doctor and he got shot down for his medical card again but he continued to smoke and his symptoms for his head injury just kept getting worse and the medication isn't making it any better so he had to went to his doctor asking like hey you know what if I take the essential oils of cannabis and ingest that instead of smoking cannabis and the doctor had agreed that the medicinal benefits were much better but still would not give him a card so he decided to go ahead and make the extract enemies but he kind of got scared because he was thinking like you know they wouldn't they would not give him his card so there had to have like some bad side effects to the extract or smoking that something bad had to be part of it that they were not allowing him to do it so he just kind of sat on it for a couple of years in 2001 there was nothing more the docs could do they pretty much said you're [ __ ] out of luck shit's creek without a paddle we don't know how to help you so he then proceeded to ask for a card again they still denied him so he decided to go get these essential oils from cannabis that were the extract that was sitting on a shelf in his medicine cabinet and try it and they actually choked him [Music] sorry guys I took a lot of notes when he went home and took extract he had awesome results his thinking cleared up his arthritis got a lot better he had better blood pressure he had better memory he didn't have any more how do I say that Josh late he didn't have memory losses his memory got better yeah his memory got better sorry guys I'm super stoned his memory got better so yeah and I'll get before-and-after pictures for you guys on all of our social media accounts so you can see like the before and after pictures are ridiculous the resemblance between this guy and my dad so he just kept treating himself with cannabis extract in 2003 he weet TV doctor because he had skin lesions on his chest he had three of them on his arms he had one bite i'ii buy his nose and he was concerned they were cancerous and um they operate he wanted to operate on only a couple spots at the time so they operated on the spot by his note irv by his eye by his eyes sorry i can't read my own writing and they got inspected so he had heard this report on a radio in 1975 about cannabis curing cancer and this was in 1975 lake 30 plus your prior to 2003 and he thought it was BS that I mean it was 1975 there's no research or anything so I I mean I get it so he decided to put some of it anyways he decided to put some of the extract on the lesions on his arm and the one on his chest and he put a bandage over it and after four days he took it off they were pretty much gone because he wasn't thinking anything would have happened because when he put the extract on it made like the discomfort go away but really nothing else so like he was amazed and he told everybody and nobody believed him which I get it because 2003 still is pretty sheltered and I'm time marijuana so um about seven weeks later the spot that was operated on on his I came back and he decided the spots that were treated with the extract before and he decided to just go big and help anybody and everybody he could with his extract so that's a little bit about Rick Simpson who he is how he came about with the extract and I'm sorry my cat sneezing in the background here so now I'm gonna get a little bit into how our so is made um I I'll put links that I used Tilly take that let me try that again I'll put the links that I used in to take notes in the comment section of this conceit all of my references um pretty much you get an ounce of flour you have to do carve it um all flour is THC a before you d carbon or you put a plane to it in a bowl or blunt the flame is what turns activate THC aid so you have the psychoactive effects um to do car but all you have to do is put the bud up on a sheet pan grind it I know you've earned it after you decrepit sorry guys um put it on a sheet been in the oven for 220 at 225 for like 45 minutes and you're gonna want to check on it to make sure it doesn't burn if it does start burning it I turn it down a little bit because once you do that like I said before the THC a turned into plain THC and it's activated so once it's the carb do you grunt in the flour and put it into a mason jar I was gonna try and do it for you but here's the thing we're kind of gonna walk down again and ever here ever clear is a little bit hard to find so once all of this quarantine thing stops I'll make another video and show you guys how to make the Rick Simpson oil um so once you get the flour out of the oven you grind it you put it in a mason jar and you fill the mason jar with Everclear just enough to cover the flour and then you shake it and stir it really good and like if you have a mortar and pestle kinda just grind the bud up with the Everclear for about 10-15 minutes until it turns to like this almost mud green kind of color and then you put it in cheesecloth in a strainer and just strain it and then you have to reduce it in a double boiler you just boil water and put the jar in the water and boil it for hours and hours and hours and hours and hours until it reduces to pretty much nothing and when it's done it you put it in the syringes I do have an RSO syringe though guys it's from grassroots and from my local dispensary justice ground in Pennsylvania uh you see what I mean it's really dark from the bud just sit when you put the Everclear and you shake it this particular syringe is a garlic cookies are so it's one gram it's from grassroots and it is an eighty-two percent THC 2.4 percent CVG 1.7 percent THC point nine one percent of CBC wait four seven five of th TV and point one four four of cbn and if you don't know what those are I'm gonna start on Tuesdays a video series about different terpenes and cannabinoids all right there is another type of syringe called THC distillate it's fully activated like the lake er so syringes but the distillate process takes all of the impurities out so it's the purest form of cannabis you can consume and it's not necessarily just a syringe it could be any kind of concentrate a wax a shatter a crumble Beach then so on and so forth so um pretty much would a THC distil is translucent little devoid of all the undesirable compounds from the original plant it's one like I said it's one of the most popular forms of cannabis it's really not any flavorful so a lot of the people who manufacture the displacer and just add terpenes like limonene Karpin allene nice or myrrh seem so you can get that cannabis flavor that you get from the flower so distillate process is like huge long process and I don't have the attention span to even watch a video to figure out how it is but it starts with butane hash oil and then they put it through distillation process where they take out all of the impurities from the BHO and then they turn it into like I said any kind of concentrate one of the distillate syringes right now I have a distillate syringe from allure healthcare essentials it is the blueberry blunt I'll show you guys the difference between a be THC distillate and the RSO it's definitely a noticeable difference shake this is the THC distillate if you remember the are so syringes like is much much darker than the hologram it out because you see the difference in color so that's about all I have for you guys today [Music] feel free to subscribe to our channel and check out our merchandise store on bonfire comm we also have a GoFundMe started for recovery 420 I'll put links for those in the description as well cheers everybody have a good Saturday bye guys", "0y2EiO7UNxM": "[Music] how to use the precise dosing applicator from sir taro wellness first remove the protective cap and set it aside the color of the cap indicates which product formula you're using so be sure to hold on to it the first time you use a new precise dosing applicator you'll need to prime it by twisting the device two or three times to remove any air bubbles you'll feel it click as you twist to dispense the product you want to twist the device very slowly remember the pure reserve oil is highly concentrated the top of the device will rise to reveal these black lines these lines are small but they're extremely important to monitor closely now that you have your desired dose gently push the top of the precise dosing applicator down you'll see the pure reserve oils start to dispense from the metal tip of the applicator and there you go the precise dosing applicator makes it easy to see and dispense the exact amount of oil you need with less mass and less potential for wasted product", "UmT0yiIcFZs": "how's that bike that's easy connoisseurs and they got a good one for you today so today we are going to take this C cell 1/2 gram refillable cartridge we picked up at vape part smart comm and we're going to be putting some oil in it and showing you just how easy it is to make your own cartridges well here we go what we're going to be putting in it today is some dab ex gelato this is 92.9% total THC for a grand total of ninety four point three total cannabinoids as you can see the color on this is absolutely beautiful let's open this up and get to work okay there you go opens it up every time very nice very nice look at that color it's about as clear as it can get right there loving it now all of this is extracted using ethanol alcohol so it is definitely the way to go this is a good company they make really nice distillate it is quite thick so I do recommend a cartridge with large holes like this see cell first things first you need to try to acquire an applicator tip this is very simply a very large syringe tip to administer the distillate into the cartridge now there will be a link to where you can get some of these in the description a lot of people ask about them and I did the work find it one now first things first we take our distillate we assemble it not too hard now as you can see when I pull off this cap [Applause] the tip is slightly frosted that is to ensure that this when you apply it has a good mating surface and does not slide off now would they recommend first and foremost is that you heat this syringe up just a little bit using whatever method you prefer to get it nice and viscous you take your oil that you want to load into the cartridge have it ready you take the cartridge simply unscrew the lid from the cartridge very easily take your syringe full of the fluid that you would like to dispense into your cartridge insert it into the cartridge as far as it can go and begin to diminish pinch the fluid you can see it pushes down simply go around the cartridge filling it up as you go okay I knew at that point just top it off a little bit remove the syringe take your lid replace your lid on the top [Applause] and there you have your cartridge simply allow the oil to run down to this spot and test it for function as you can see the oil as has gone all the way down to the bottom is filled to this level at that point in time so if we remove the mouthpiece and a small silicone seal on the bottom get a standard 510 thread battery this is a VAT mod very nice battery 510 thread screw it on to the bottom [Applause] and let's try this thing out shall we [Music] all right well there you have it that's how you refill a C cell cartridge you guys have an absolutely

but it's great for hiking and things like that has a installed self-induced battery and everything in there I'm also gonna be filling up one of these half gram units there's one one gram and two half grams so those are C cell cartridges who you are as you can see on the bottom right there it says C cell ll9 2 L 1 9 9 0 jupiter-c cell all right now I will be taking this in song it onto a battery setting this up here on the heater next to the distillate so the cartridge itself warms up a little bit allowing the oil to soak into it promptly and efficiently I will also be doing that with this point 3 I don't know if you can read that but it's just right on there it's a Jupiter liquid X you see the big X right there that is the Jupiter glass liquid X this has a C cell authentic C cell

of them all right the screaming coils you are on here buddy shout out my brother thank you so much as one of my patreon supporters right there big shout out the screaming coils my brother brother alright so here we go um yeah that's a sale day the sale over at nature's gifts that was a 35% off sale day kind of a doorbuster deal normally I can get that for about $14 but down to 11 is really nice okay on a normal day no discounts at all it's about 1718 dollars for a gram of distillate so that's that's average price for a gram of disciplic no you have use concentrate in terms in the cartridge yes I have used concentrate in turrets in a cartridge as a matter of fact all my terpenes are inside right now but I do have a very large assortment of different terpenes and liquidizer that I use in cartridges if I want to try that the only liquidizer that I really recommend using at this point due to my caste is true terpenes actual Turkey and liquidizer and all that's used for is turning a very thick distillate oil into something a little more liquid so that it will run adequately through a lower quality cartridge it doesn't actually break down any waxes or anything like that like you would get in one of the wax liquidiser or something like that it just goes into a pre winterized distillate and thins it up a little bit so it runs adequately through a cartridge necessarily I recommend right now other than that you can add terpenes to your distillate to thin it out but as far as liquid izing wax and putting it into a cartridge I've heard good things from the company wax liquidiser I've never used it myself I used one product from Nexus a wax liquidiser product from Nexus which is a company that does products for liquid izing wax for a cartridge and I was very unhappy with the results I didn't like the the heaviness on the chest I didn't like the flavor I did I was unhappy with it so I did not recommend it in my video there is a video of me doing that online and I don't recommend doing that that that was just my experiences one I've heard that farm to vape is another quality company the company I use is kind of a no-name company so I'm not surprised that it was [ __ ] to be honest with you anyway let's read some more here here my upgrade trans bud 0.3 huh we'd finish that super quick yeah exactly but what this is is uh if you go to a dispensary and you're like I've got some really bitchin oil just handle this card and say here go man take this [ __ ] home it's a got point three in it they can get plenty of good pulls off of it plenty of effect they know what it's like they know the flavor the battery is disposable when it's dead it's gone you know it is what it is so I mean it has its place is meant for industrial events or industry events and things like that tasters samplers if you have if you're an extractor yourself and you want to try your product you do a DAB you taste it out you put it in a cartridge they've got these that are point one point one gram it's just you put in there in your sample you just sample it through a nice high-quality very small ceramic core cartridge and you just get a taste of the flavor and then the effect that you're getting point one is plenty and a cartridge to get a couple good rips off of it so you need to smoke it all day to know what the flavor is to know what the effect is anyway getting off on it but point three is plenty for what we're gonna be doing we're gonna be using it for different events walking very discreet that is about as discreet as you can get right there very nice unit we're gonna fill this up we're gonna show it to you I think you guys are gonna be pleasantly surprised this little unit is is quite cool alright and uh just just for comparison purposes just because you guys would probably appreciate it we're gonna hold up the point three the point five and the one gram cartridges so you've got your point three right here you had your point five right here and you got your one gram right here all right I I deal with cartridges sometimes pretty regularly I specifically want to know as much as possible about the cartridges that are coming out see the shop that I

way let's get this done all right not too much on you're gonna have to open up another jar here pretty soon but not yet this still got a little bit of the terpenes in it yes sir yes sir yes sir I got me some OG he cush busted me a bottle of ji cush terpenes out did a drippity drop drop he drop onto my crystals here came up with some OG Kush crystal dubba dubba dabs very very delicious I used the last of my wedding cake here recently I cried a little bit in my goddamn Cheerios when I did it but I did it because it was so damn good all right folks let's get a dab on what's up Dave from Detroit man hope things are turning up turning up for you my friend if not it's Sunday it's Sunday Monday I'll probably worse so live it up live it up right cheers for years folks okey-dokey okay what the [ __ ] was I talking oh my damn great hey Loretta how's it going um did you catch that Cassie uh he wants you to do some goddamn he wants you to pay do some commentary on your mail videos well I see that anyway no I don't need terms lover things I'll have to check that stuff out for sure I literally don't have anything out here and I should have everything out here and I literally I don't have any other but [ __ ] it doesn't matter ah cells there all the time never ear said no dates price gave me down man I know sorry man I'm sorry I really apologize man I don't know what to tell you I would never ever ever condone traveling across state lines with concentrates or marital products of any form but hypothetically speaking if you live near a recreational state times like 7/10 for 20 different dates like that you can get concentrates I was able to get up a very nice quality concentrate one time for $7.00 a gram if you're used to paying 25 dollars a gram think if you were just to save up a little bit and you were just to do a road trip for personal use of course it would definitely hypothetically be extremely worth it you need to think how much do you pay for 10 grams normally $70 I've seen one gram go for $70 okay so mathematically speaking hypothetically of course if I lived in Idaho I would not be buying my cannabis in Idaho hypothetically okay but that's just me and I would have no way condone that don't do it drugs are my drugs man okay man now I have heard I have heard of people getting on an airplane right flying over to the the areas you know I'm saying if you're paying $80 a gram all right seriously you get a plane ticket for 160 bucks that's 2 grams right you get $300 saved up right what's that 4 grams so now you're out six grams of dope right you get on your plane ticket to fly over to a recreational area you get a wonderful experience a wonderful experience an absolutely wonderful experience what it should be all right and with that $300 you buy 30 [ __ ] grams 33 [ __ ] zero okay and then hypothetically don't do it hypothetically but don't do it you box all that [ __ ] up into a box and you mail that [ __ ] to home then you get on your airplane you fly home today why would a wonderful vacation I just had and you know a really a really bad person might get home and sell six grams of that distillate for 80 bucks and then they would have a free vacation in 24 grams of distillate don't do that it's not proper but if you do the math all that [ __ ] checks out every single piece but anyway um now that I've talked long enough I'm gonna blow my nose a little bit and then we're gonna do this damn distillate thingy that I've been talking about we really narrowed it down to six people huh there used to be a lot on there now it seems like that might be a bit of a stretch for a lot of people you know what I'm saying traveling all that distance for something now you need to think there are at least two people in this chat right now they use cannabis medicinally as [ __ ] all right couple people are dying right how you doing reasoning how are you I'm so Washington State for example does not have mandatory pesticide testing for their product a lot of people in an uproar about that I don't know exactly what parts per million my medicine has in it now you go to any one of these illegal states you're buying dope from some dude on the corner pesticides are in that maybe none make me they're not using a single bed sure why not now Oregon California Denver a lot of legal states they test for every [ __ ] thing all right just think about that if you think that clean medicine will make you live as much as one [ __ ] day longer is it not worth going there is it not worth going there just to do that just to have that peace of mind that that whatever the [ __ ] you know what I'm talking about but anyway we're off on tangents now like I said we're gonna bring you guys in we're gonna take you guys and bring you in to here here excited about that you guys seem excited I can tell the shade screams shaking and [ __ ] you guys are just twitching the mission I can see it I can see it I can feel it already how you do it didn't get right up close personal image engine it's weird got a big nose all right here we go I'll give you guys a reference point there's the desk you can't see me and the desk at the same time I'm sorry okay but it's also much darker here because the light glares much better cannabis marijuana THC okay we have here in the half gram cartridge this is the C cell cartridge by Jupiter research we have here a point three gram disposable pin this is also by C cell we want to take the mouthpiece and want to take the other mouthpiece we want to keep these handy we want to keep these handy for one [ __ ] reason and one reason filing as it states in the directions if you are reading the goddamn directions it says right here immediately after filling install the mouthpiece and twist clockwise to tighten all right bayar to install the mouthpieces and two minutes are filling their result in leakage you see that [ __ ] do you see that [ __ ] so if you're filling up like [ __ ] 50 of these cartridges you need to [ __ ] think about that they stay right [ __ ] there they are to install the mouthpiece within two minutes of filling may result in leakage okay maybe you should do 10 [ __ ] cart runs or some [ __ ] right depending on your system how many do you want to do in a row before you [ __ ] timeout you know what I'm saying I mean you want a failure rate as low as possibly production quality as high as possible [ __ ] do I know I'm just some dude [ __ ] smoking weed right okay here we go now what again what I am utilizing at this particular point is some mango secret recipe distillate that chance they send the cheapest [ __ ] blend of trash he swept up off the floor but it's pretty clean so I'm pretty happy with it other than that here you guys go I just lost another viewer you guys upset about that I'm doing exactly what I'm title said I'd be doing guys ready here we go okay this right here the oil is plenty malleable as you can see thank goodness it's sitting in front of that [ __ ] heater alright we're gonna go right over to the tip there oh there we go and here we go now here is the C cell let me introduce Ian go around a little bit a little bit okay all right I do have some god dang dang do air right there but I'm gonna set this back up a furnace heater you guys know I'm talking about right screw that mouthpiece on very nice okay there we have our nominal C cell cartridge so this is the 0.5 grandma grammar all right so there's back over in front of the heater here let that warm up and here down in there now this is the point 3 this should be nicer I've never done one of these before it's the same basic deal to spray the oil in all right they say point three but if you're a [ __ ] jackass slapped me you can point forward a [ __ ] you think I [ __ ] can I just [ __ ] did I [ __ ] did okay all right wow I sure put a lot in there you screw the mouthpiece on just like that and right there you've got a very very sexy little [ __ ] unit right there what the [ __ ] do you thing about that all right that is sexy as [ __ ] this was in much oil Jupiter where the [ __ ] reflection on there Jupiter liquid X Jupiter research calm there's a phone number call them tell them John [ __ ] sent you they don't but it does I talked to somebody at the place they like yeah oh not bad not bad not bad I'm gonna set that over there right next to the other one and I know when they were built let that [ __ ] cycle slow and warm and go for a minute or two well I do another one don't you know and then we'll get that blowing some smoke what do you I say what do you say what do you say what do you say what'd he say all right message retracted holy [ __ ] oh he took all of this messages back that's weird Costra well there you go that's weird just imagine doing that I'm just kidding hey me [ __ ] painting style sorry you're painting and that sucks very badly very badly sucks sucks learn my favorite never go away we race no I care about the pain slowly oh there you go see there you go hello glitch on my and I basically missed that process hope it's only for me we're only doing this journey this was for almost 30 years no glitches for ii feel the Grinch is here too god damn it is that why everybody left yeah that's fine couldn't pissed off about that actually got kind of glitchy huh I lost a bunch of [ __ ] viewers too I bet right on well those of you that are still with me thank you so much I certainly do appreciate it I did the last of my dad's that I have in this jar and the last one my dad's that I have in this jar so I'm gonna have to open the dad's that I have in this jar so those of you that are going in to be in Seattle for the Seattle Hempfest make sure you hit us up we will definitely be excited to see any and all people that would like to come through well yeah we definitely see anybody that wants to come on through I've got like I said I've got my email ready to go we're gonna be smoking and dabbing all the way through the old Hempfest there it's gonna be awesome should be a whole lot of fun really really looking forward to it um last year was a good time this year here I've talked to some more people got a little bit more of a organized method to my madness going on so that will be extremely exciting [ __ ] it's quiet in here without that goddamn heater going I'll tell you that much right now I'm competing with the silence right now and the silence is deafening holy [ __ ] I could play some music you guys like that get some music going on here and get a couple of copyrights get a couple of copyright strikes going haven't gotten a single [ __ ] copyrights factory that you play some [ __ ] music Dudley do-right [ __ ] going on do Dukes to next thing you know [ __ ] I'm gonna banish it alright all right I said there's some that's some that [ __ ] right there you guys like that [ __ ] you know you do eighty-nine point - nobody would like my music right oh man why don't yes this is very very very very very very very good I like this a lot THC am eighty five point nine very very nice very nice super crystalline structure extremely high quality when the light comes through it or you can see there's no oh you guys can't see [ __ ] you like that hell yeah can't see [ __ ] I can see [ __ ] though it looks [ __ ] amazing it looks like it looks fine you guys have figured out all that really does is [ __ ] with the camera beyond goddamn words I gotta get a better camera I've got to get a better camera [ __ ] so dark it looks I don't know if I turn this down just a little bit I squat down if that [ __ ] helps it doesn't [ __ ] see I need to get a better camera I need better lighting if you'd like to support the channel patreon blah blah description underneath the blah blah blah [ __ ] blah okay here we go over and do another dab if your dad dog the Big Chill the other night Oh cause my parents sounds like they were just saying yeah yeah yeah there's music that exists that's that's for sure you guys name some that's a fact alright I appreciate classic ballads does that make sense to anybody cheers [Laughter] Wow that stuff is just so so very high-quality you know what I'm saying this goes back to what I was saying earlier about road trips this is just like I said this is $13 maybe $13 a gram for this the only real color in that is a little bit of almost no torches allowed no it's like laughs right that's why I'm gonna have an email I'm gonna have a silicone rig hopefully all right what music now well I just I gotta tell you I listen to horrible music my wife can inform you of my horrible music if she wants to Madonna she needs you Oh probably the reason our music some of the non carborundum another [ __ ] right yes at him fest but you can they have a bad check they have a bad check okay they have a bag check they checked your bag for torches they check your bag for rigs okay now what I normally take the Hempfest is to take bubbles my little bubbler my little bubbles I'll grab her for you hold on this is bubbles she's very very neat she's very cool she's a very awesome she's quite awesome and if you dump the water out of her and you invert her a hundred and eighty degrees upside down you can put right here the crotch of your pants right there this will add to your manliness by pushing your scrote all the way out and proud onto a platform like most will be able to see greatly this will shoot down one leg this will go down the other wait a little bit and it will be stable enough if your balls are holding it good did you sit there high and proud and nobody'll feel it unless they feel this far down from your crotch which they don't do that so all right I normally get this one in no problem I walk this one right through the old gates there and uh my torch I have a Newport blazer torch and I'm a bit of a mechanic a little bit so I adapted it a little bit to where it's about smaller than my fist and then I just take I take this okay then and I take my torch and away we go I'm very popular because very few other people have a torch and a rig in Hempfest so that's pretty neat but this right here this is my go case all right and all I need to do is replace this glass rig right here with a silicone rig and there's nothing in here that is not allowed in him fest by the way I'm press I've got a [ __ ] VIP press pass backstage everything pass so I'm not sure I even need to convert to silicone but just to abide by the rules I'm gonna make sure I get my goddamn rig in there one way or another you guarantee that [ __ ] um and now that's my go get I take that whenever I go anywhere hashtag mini nails the [ __ ] whatever and uh mini nail will be there they will be at Hempfest by the mainstage they should have two big banners coming up they're an amazing company they make an amazing product make sure you swing and see them Blake should be there biron should be there should be a lot of fun for everybody all right hello Colin dope how you doing me deep dip dip sorry if I'm blowing your name to [ __ ] there Colin where's clay Colin how's that wait what's responsive bosses text don't torture as an infant that's right new person like you videos without music I I don't I don't really appreciate music very much very loudly in the background sometimes I like something playing but that's just for whatever I'm being silent I tried that once I had [ __ ] I had Cheech and Chong playing in the background on the television while I was doing a video just so that I was whenever I was like they were saying since Shannon you can hear strategic Charlie and even if you couldn't hear the words you knew it was there in the car doing the thing in the road with the [ __ ] with the mayonnaise jar and the piss anyway um and then everybody gets a good laugh out of that boom they [ __ ] hit me so fast you'd think they were [ __ ] paid to do that [ __ ] yeah that [ __ ] boom boom bam bam BAM that can't happen brah how's my first year on [ __ ] YouTube and I was like sorry man I had no idea um Hempfest is in Seattle it is in it is in Seattle proper Merle Edwards Park Inn on the seafront bay front seaport whatever the [ __ ] it is on the coast of Seattle er out in Elliott Bay yeah that's it Elliott Bay back where highway 99 used to go just hop off the ferry turn left walk until you run into the [ __ ] hit fast man dollars to it that's what I'm gonna do that being said I really look forward to you all you guys being there and um and there should be a whole lot of fun oh you live in Californians do they got him fest in California cannabis cups in California matter of fact opinion where you live they got northern [ __ ] Hempfest southern folk and infest central [ __ ] infest cannabis cups from all over San Francisco has old [ __ ] cannabis cup Oh goddamn nine yards man I'm oh yeah [ __ ] I guarantee it just felt good a Google cannabis cup near Anaheim and that should come up like a [ __ ] you have it [ __ ] Northern California's some of the best because Humboldt all that [ __ ] but anyway back to why we're all on here this thing has a title the title said some [ __ ] and that's what some [ __ ] and the title said it was talking about cartridges it was talking about putting cannabis oil in vapor cartridges well friends this right here it's cannabis oil this right here is the tube cannabis oil came in this is the vapor cartridges right here you got one vapor cartridge that's permanently installed on a battery it's called a disposable go I just made that [ __ ] up this is a liquid ex by Jupiter research C cell to be exact the other one is a liquid sakes glass cartridge this is a C cell cartridge from smore the brand C cell they are the main distributor of C cells more devices so that being said we are going to give a bit of a pull on it it's pretty cool how that lights up I don't want to draw on this son-of-a-bitch too fast I think I filled the other one up first this one has a preheat this is that mango I was talking about so these cartridges I have found personally and all the devices that I put them in like this magic 7/10 right here from bat mod it's not too bad I think it runs about 3-4 this Drago right here from a mod it's pretty cool it's got one of them resin [ __ ] faces on it you said resin on Hertz light absorbing [ __ ] doesn't matter but uh this goes from like 2.4 up right this right here this has variable voltage this goes from 3.4 up right this one here and this is variable voltage from 2.6 and up yeah this one here and it doesn't say I'm pretty sure this one is like 3.2 and up and then this one here this says it has variable voltage but it doesn't say what it is this is the the air space so I have found while testing all these different batteries to this what's [ __ ] new these C cell liquid 6 510 thread glass cartridges right here they work best up to about 3 point 4 volts over that you start getting a burnt flavor that continues through the life of the cartridge if you hold the battery down for a long draw that's that's just what it is that's what it is that's not saying that the cartridge is no good that's saying that the cartridge is so efficient it vaporizes oil perfectly well at two point four to three point four degrees or volts it doesn't need four point five volts to activate this cartridge if it does then you will burn your cartridge that's just something to say and don't whenever you run this this cartridge through like I had one I ran through a uh I ran through a CB d5 battery it was a two battery kinda like this one right here alright and it wasn't clear on the voltages so I wasn't sure what the voltage was well I ran my cartridge to it it burned my cartridge like you could taste if it tasted bird to [ __ ] and it didn't taste like that just before so I took the mouthpiece off I drew the oil out I'll put the oil into another cartridge a brand new cartridge and the oil tasted good again it was definitely the burn cartridge and it was telling that battery we have not used that battery since because that didn't have clear clear instructions for the voltages I didn't even review that battery pissed me off so much I didn't want you guys to buy it and then not [ __ ] realize that but anyway that is what that is these these these are very high quality cartridges they can be bought at the link in the description Bay part smart comm if you click down there click that link go in there it'll take you to the home page looking cartridges look for parts alright this right here I don't know if it's drawn to very good I'm half we worried about it I don't want to burn up the cartridge because this is the first woman I've ever had but it shouldn't take any longer than the [ __ ] another one they're the same [ __ ] technology right not fully tasting the oil just yet tasting a little bit of something but it doesn't taste like it's possibly a good thing I don't know there are a couple bubbles but none of them are actually over the holes see that one is above the hole so I'll let it saturate for as long as it says they let it saturate so I'm pretty excited about it hopefully it works good we're trying more time then I'm going to kick the [ __ ] out of here and I'll let you know how this goes on Monday morning on the wake and bake have you seen any thank you so much me okay there was some there was some mango there you go alright I'm being a little bit of a [ __ ] with the goddamn thing because I don't want to burn it up this one here is completely contained I'm not even sure I think the only hair draw is that little tiny [ __ ] that little [ __ ] right there you can barely see that little rectangle right there there we go oh yeah see now she's born that's what I need to do it needed to get warm you get one view that well there we go all right well that's pretty good there that actually cloud it out really nice there at the end there's a big-ass [ __ ] bubble right there though someone let that summits rise up out of there so there you have it uh what am i goddamn glitter of all kinds of [ __ ] focus over there um got some videos coming up with some of this [ __ ] over here just let you guys know and as always say Kinkos I certainly will do that yes I did sir Locke I got this liquid x class cartridge had an event so I'm trying that out I think it's gonna be super cool all right that being said you guys have an absolutely wonderful day thank you so much for tuning in I really do appreciate it we will see you bright and early Monday morning on my sister channel wake and bake with C&C once again thank you so much y'all have an absolutely wonderful day peace", "7TOsKn79KJk": "what's going on everybody this is Joe and extract lab and today we'll be comparing distillate and icy distillate is the high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract from either hemp or marijuana this is the resulting product of this lemon as a welcome party of dislike and range from 75 to 85% cannabinoids and can sometimes be even higher now the remaining percentages on this slit or other plant material such as lipids and potentially some turkeys if you take a look at the distillate here you'll see a viscous beautifully golden oil now this looking range in color from gold to amber to the red but usually the darker distillate is caused by rushing the distillation process by setting aggressive parameters we tested two gas chromatography little-to-no turbines are present resulting in a somewhat bland scent now this depends on the removal of volatile impurities present in extraction solvents prior to cannabinoid distillation high potency CBD distillate will always crystallize over time crystallization can be accelerated by cold temperatures this distillate hasn't crystallized it because it is fresh off the stove even though this lip crystallizes it would not be considered Iceland Iceland is an individual cannabinoid separated from the planet matrix in the case of cannabidiol or some meat it is a white crystal ground down into a free-flowing powder the cannabinoid contents on Iceland are usually 99% or higher Iceland has no scent and properly manufacture no taste as well now these isolated cannabinoids have much more research to be done especially some of the new ones that have been discovered like CBD P and T ACP now whether your goals are to produce a high cannabinoid full-spectrum extract like discipline or to individually isolate cannabinoids extract what I was here to help you do like this

everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making mango flavor thc lean so let's get into it [Music] the ingredients to make your recipe would be sugar honey coconut mct oil mangoes and your distilling so the first step would be to make your mango simple syrup peel your mangoes [Music] [Music] [Music] now cut your mangoes [Music] once you cut your mangoes add them to a bowl [Music] all right now work on your simple syrup add your water once your water start boiling add your sugar [Music] reduce the temperature to medium heat and let your water boil into your sugar is completely dissolved [Music] once your sugar is completely dissolved add your mangoes [Music] [Music] now let your mango simmer for a minimum of 30 minutes [Music] all right after 30 minutes turn your stove off [Music] so now i'm going to let our ingredients cool in the pot for about 15 minutes after letting your simple syrup cool drain your mangoes [Music] all right my mango simple syrup is done so let's get into the next step add your discipline to a bowl of hot water [Music] measure out your honey [Music] now add your coconut mct oil [Music] now add your distilling [Music] now mix your ingredients together [Music] add one teaspoon of hot water now mix your ingredients [Music] all right now we're going to let our honey simmer in hot water for about 10 minutes [Music] all right my cannabis simple syrup is ready so now let's add this to our mango simple syrup [Music] all right my cannabis mango syrup is done so now let's make our drink [Music] all right get yourself a large cup add your dried

wreckless rainbow 0.5 grams here and this recipe is simple as hell you're going to need 2 1/2 cup water 1/2 cup sugar and your distillate doesn't have to be the jetty it could be anything you prefer and vegetable glycerin is an optional step here I know that jetty comes already activated ready to go I could literally take this push it on my tongue and it get me high that's why I'm super excited about the jetty extracts I actually made a quick little video about this product in particular I'll throw up in the info card but today is simple as hell let's go ahead bring that 1/2 cup of water to a boil add the 1/2 cup sugar push in the 1/2 gram a distillate mix it around put it in our simple bottle and get ready to make some cocktails yeah this is just a mary-jane I ain't do this for my stoners and from my cannabis enthusiast talking edibles and bring it comedy get it time to pass it to the left and we can have a smoke session Hey yeah true love for my troopers light it up and I'm on it this might take me way back sweet man I got five on it in the cutter sativa anything that you me break it down like the weed this is trooper Stevie troopers I'm a STONER I'm smoking it's not happy so I hope you find this recipe helpful and to be honest I think you could even simplify it more as you see I had the water pitcher of boiling water I think you could just straight-up add the distillate into that with the sugar already in there and it'd be good to go [Music]", "Fc9bmPrwg18": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to make peanut butter using distilling so let's get into it the ingredients to make my can of butter would be disciplined i'm gonna be using one foot gram of discipline next we also need clarify butter and you need some type of container or plastic mold to pour your butter into for me i'm gonna be using a marijuana mold to pour my butter into so what i'm going to do now is add this to hot water just to loosen up the oil [Music] while your discipline is sitting in the water measure out your butter [Music] and now i had a teaspoon of lecithin and now add your discipline [Music] [Music] now mix everything together [Music] all right guys so now what i'm going to do is put this on a pipe and let it simmer on low heat for about 10 minutes so let's get into it [Music] [Music] all right guys so every few minutes you want to stir your butter after 10 minutes remove your glass cup from the pot now mix all the ingredients one more time [Music] all right your ingredients should be fully incorporated so now what we're

our CDU 3000 distillation apparatus and I have mark here from you labo that's going to talk about the paired youlab low temperature controllers with the unit so some of the great features that you're gonna see on this CDU 3000 are the 10 litre crude feed vessel and the great thing about this as well as it has stop [ __ ] at the top so if you've got a big barrel of crew that you want to feed in on some sort of automated system or with a dosing pump you can do so following your your feed vessel down this is of course jacketed now the entire path of this system is heated in order to avoid the gumming and the residual sort of clogs that you would get in any other distillation system with this you're going to feed your distillate in through your through your feed pump down here and you can see your adjustment for your feed pump right here now you can feed slower or faster depending on how you want your product to come out you want it more pure do you want it less pure do you want it at you know up to 4 litres an hour throughput or do you want to run it a little bit slower so you're trying to do single pass these are a lot of parameters that you can play with with this system in order to optimize your distillation how the original crude oil was made was a hydrocarbon extracted how clean is it how well was it extracted at what temperature how good did the biomass look like right so we have varying ability to handle any sort of crude in this machine and get it up to a very very high level of purity above 90% and sometimes even above 95% purity with this distillation apparatus so with feeding your distillate through this reservoir you're then coming up it's coming through this heated feed tube and this is actually coming into your evaporator here now your evaporator is going to evaporate that distillate and it's going to reconvince on an inner coil which is where you're gonna get your separation between your your cannabinoids and your non-kinetic right so all the gunk so to speak or the chlorophylls and residual phosphides and all the other compounds in the plant that are undesirable are going to come out on your left side here right which is your we call this the residue side that'll be your black sort of reject right and you'll have your amber gold on this side which is your distant now on this particular unit you have output metering vessels and basically what that is is you don't want to starve your distillate or your residue pumps you don't want to starve your feed pump right this is meant to be run as continuous operation a continuous feed system right so it's very important that those pumps don't get starved that you keep everything heated right because if you've ever played with distillate or with crude oil you know it can be very very sticky right the viscosity of finished distillate can be like a warm Jolly Rancher if it's kept at room temperature right and with this being said we want to make sure that everything is heated we have our discharge and you have ultimately your residue coming out of this side and you have your finished distillate coming out of this side so continuing to follow this path here we have a cold trap the cold trap is basically what is going to be your channel of vacuum through your roughing pump and then back here we also have a diffusion pump and those work in tandem in order to bring this apparatus into a very deep vacuum so that you can achieve a very precise distillation that vacuum is controlled via a vacuum metering valve so I know that there's people that like to run different parameters on this machine and again talking about the different variations and crude the different variations and output right we can adjust the temperature of each individual zone right we can run a little bit hotter with your colder we can we can adjust the vacuum levels in order to accommodate now when we install this product we install it for you we train your staff and we give you an SOP but there's a lot of people in the production community and scientific community that like to play with those parameters so to speak of myself being one of them so there's a lot of different variables that you can do in order to make these different products and optimize the process of what you're doing here with this machine a couple cool features with the cold traps is you actually have a terpene removal call this flask that can remove the terpenes simply by opening this valve and you're never breaking vacuum cool a little feature of this and you do have a dual cold trap and you can see the secondary beaker down there I'm sorry in secondary flasks in order to remove your terpenes with your secondary cold trap as well now as Marc's gonna discuss all of these individual zones right so your your your feed zone your pathway for your your distillate your evaporator your cold trap all have individual temperature zones further compounding the ability to run custom parameters on this system and make a desirable output product so we have two core EOC DBC for heating temperature circulators and 230 volt these provide two kilowatts of heating power of the temperature capability up 250 degrees C and on the CDU 3000 they are plumbed to various zones to provide temperature control to make sure that the highly viscous cannabis extract and distillates can flow through the system properly on this side of the system we have the SE six high temperature heating circulator this has three kilowatts of heating 30 volt with the temperature range up to three and a degrees C and in this case the SE six is plumbed to the outer jacket of the still itself providing the the heat to do the actual distillation next to it we have the choreo CD 600 F and 230 volt this has a two kilowatt heater with 600 watts of cooling power at 20 degrees C and 220 watts of cooling power at minus 20 with an operating temperature range of minus 35 250 degrees C in this CD you 3,000 it is plumbed to the vacuum trap here which protects the vacuum system and also enables you to get a turbo down below we have the F p-51 SL refrigerated heating circulator this has a temperature range of minus 50 to 200 degrees C with a three kilowatt heater two kilowatts of cooling power at 20 degrees C one kilowatt of cooling power at minus 20 degrees C in the CDU 3000 it's plumbed to the condenser inside the still where the distillate collects and then goes into the lights collection flask on the C 2 u 3 the CDU 3000 provides quality engineering from Detroit ped with German engineering from UIC and olavo providing a perfect setup for a turnkey solution catered to the hemp and cannabis industries one thing that I stress is really fantastic about this unit is its you already right so if you guys understand the compliance issues between CEC SI and ul and understanding the electrical inspections and parameters this is a unit that becomes pre-certified with your paperwork that's compliant in any regulated jurisdiction so if you would like to have one manufacturer to see e compliance for introduction into the European Union or South America that's something that were completely capable of as well as CSA compliance for Canada the main units that come to the United States here are of course ul compliant we wanted to take a look around the back here about the UL compliant power distribution boxes the great thing about the UL power distribution boxes is that you have all of your hubs connected into one central location and you have a singular whip to connect into your power source right this is gonna make it very easy for an electrical inspector to come in look at your paperwork look at the compliance look at the integration and understand hey this is what I'm looking at this looks good it's compliant here's the you all stand for the CSA stamp for the Cee stamp or whatever it may be which gives us a very much more ability to vastly integrate your product into your laboratory a couple other key features if you have ever worked with a variety of different distillation devices you'll know that there's all sorts of courts to them right in terms of breaking them apart breaking vacuum taking the blast off putting the blast back on reaching up in order to put your your distance re your crude oil into your device in order to be distilled you can see with this system everything is very very economic right anywhere that I want to reach to do anything it's all right here right makes it very easy to operate and very user-friendly so to speak the other thing that I love about this system is that your body is all stainless steel right your entire pathway here this is all jacketed stainless steel making an extremely extremely reliable the glass units while they're excellent for laboratory scale and introduction their glass right you have somebody come in and you know hit one of your machines with a pole or something like that all of a sudden you've got a you know $35,000 piece of glass that can potentially be broken not saying that's gonna happen I'm sure all of you are very careful but the reliability of stainless is certainly a benefit and the throughput ability of stainless is certainly a benefit as well I hope that this video was helpful for everyone to help understand this piece of equipment what its capabilities are what it does thank you guys for watching the videos please leave comments if there's anything else that you wants to talk about or specific features that you'd like to know more about on the unit you can always give us a call or shoot us an

on the last episode I'm using the Prussian lines so we can make hemp biomass into coal oil in this episode I'm going to show you the biomass first and then showed you the step by step how to turn the crude oil into good and clear CBD oil so the biomass my current use from this is pretty good as we can see here they have done a good job on separating the biomass out of hemp fiber and hemp seeds all the material remaining in this pack are in high quality they contains a lot of a hemp flour and and leaf which has pretty high CBD contents especially don't want any hemp seeds in your bio mast the hemp seeds contain seed oil which has no CBD in it if you process a bag of biomass that has too much hemp seed in it then you and I was getting a CBD distillates that looks like clear and golden but has very low Sabri concentration in that case that punch that bottle of CBD oil will not be selling an very good price let's take a look at our distillation units so before talking about this relation line we have to talk about how to polish and how to get your CBD crew ready for this relations so right here we are using a rotary evaporator to decarbonize our C bleaker oil so in here we have about 10 litres in this round a flask that we got a foreign extraction line and in here as you can see the liquids beneath the crude oil are yellow so because we were using heat transfer fluids in it instead of a using water by using the heat transfer fluid we can heat up this units 235 degree Celsius which will remove a little bit of ethanol out of it and so decarbonize it nicely so here is our [Music] white film distillation units and our left is crystallizer so we can after we have disciplines we can transform the disciplines into CDP the isolates in in this units so this is not a usual reactor that you see we have a future on the bottom which is the white one yes you can see on the bottom so that one will be filtered out CPD isolates out of the matter liquids the matter its click liquids will be drink from the bottom and CBD isolates will be remain on the future as you can see here here's the drain so once your once you got your CBD isolates by lowing the chlorine temperature you can open a vow and drain the mother liquids out of it okay let's talk about how this were filmed this laser machine work so this machine will help us to transfer our crude oil into good and clear disciplines so we just finished the first runs of of coroico usually we run the crude oil through this machine to time so this is the feeding tank right here so this machine separates different components by using the boiling temperature differences for example your view your terpene and your CBD oil all have different type of boning temperatures also there is some sugar and there's some small particle in or crude oil as well and those things doesn't boil at all so those can be separated by using this machine as well so we just finished our first runs on the floor we have two buckets the buckets on the left is the polished crude oil the buckets on the right is the the terpenes and and also some crow fields so this machine's and everything they have a lot lower boiling temperature will we both will come out and falling into the right buckets all the things that have a higher temperature or four downs to the left pockets so in the first round we set the main body temperature the main distillation body temperature into a temperature that the terpenes and curfew will keep boiling well the CBD will not boil so we have we will also catch all some of the eighth notes in the system so in here we have two Co traps the left cold trap is negative thirty Seco trap the Reiko trap is negative 83 contract and as you can see that the negative eighty contra is we can filling the dry ice or liquid nitrogen in it to treat as well so here we have a vacuum gauge and we have a vacuum pump do stage where come from one floor the first one is turbo pump second one is the normal oil thing reckon pump so the color in the right pocket is look pretty greenish and the viscosity is very high which tells us that there is the terpene for sure and we're going to dump the left pocket back to the fitting tank and do a second runs so in the second runs the we're setting the temperature so that CBD will keep boiling well the others are not well others I mean the particles and the waste will not be boiling so we can collect CBD of the machines so right now we are running this machine further where we're running the crude oil for the second times so because you can see we are feeding the crude oil in its so the mercy is is keep running and we have the the waste coming out of from the left tube and which dripping into the buckets then this halfs and on the right we have dissidents so as we can see in temperature it's not I mean the color for the distillate is not so good because it we just start running the machine we haven't we haven't fine-tuned the machine yet so I'm going to do some fine-tuning to make sure that the color looks much much better after a few changes in temperature setting for this y film distillation units the CBD colors looks looks much much better than previously I just changed temperature setting on the the center coil for this units and also a little bit of vacuum as well make it look much better this units can output about 5 liters of distillate Spri hour and I can improve it a little bit more just changed heating heaters and Childress for this unit to upgrade it into a higher capacity so that this unit can run under be faster even he can even run about a liters per hour if you have the right heaters so that would be all the information now like a share today so we talked about distillation we talked about crystallization and my client is pretty happy about what he got today and here we have the CBD distillates that we have around today this civilities looks looks in a high viscosity but because it is hot after is cooled down to room temperature it should be close to solids so if you liked this video please give us a thumbs up and think about our subscription thank you very much have a good day bye bye", "jQdf7gkmdKM": "it's too early for the 6:00 in the morning 6:00 in the morning how you guys doing today hey guys what is up this is Cody or Xcode hey how's it going today I've got something today something today that I've wanted to share with you guys for so long for so long dude this is the kind of video that I've wanted to make ever since I started making weed videos like you know weed smoking videos that kind of thing because everybody always asked me yo try this try that and I'm like bro I don't have my med card you know it's a bad day my state sucks for med cards apparently it's a lot easier now so I'm gonna be really looking into it in the near future but today we got something super special and I can't wait I can't wait to share it with you guys like I said very very excited for this video before I get into it how you doing today hopefully you have a snazzy day drop a like on the video today we're gonna be reviewing alright today we're gonna be reviewing and I'm kind of disappointed to myself because I had two different ones and there's only one left let's just leave it at that all right way she goes [ __ ] way she goes way of the road only one left we got some strawberry banana 95 percent THC disel it would you just look at that and I'm sure you want to umbrella why's it on that booking box mod and it's like bro well I just bought the cartridges I actually didn't buy like the whole setup my buddy actually just drove it down from a different state and it was lit its lit 95 percent I've never had anything that strong in my life alright never had anything when I went into it I was expecting for it to feel like a dab kinda and it feels like about three or four dabs at once it's nice it is really nice let me know if you guys have ever hit any concentrate oil cartridges the disel it it's very tasty man that this this flavor in specific I got two flavors from my buddy gave it to me strawberry banana and Peach the peach one kind of tasted like orange creamsicles I don't know where they're getting their flavor names because they're not accurate at all this one's strawberry banana and it tastes like sunset sherbert CBD from seep from empire wellness or empire extracts which tastes which tastes like how in the summertime okay help me hit this real quick Cheers it's almost like you get the sensation of like you're smoking like a whole but at once like you're like you're here you're smoking like a lot of concentrated wheat altogether which I know in a sense like that's what it is but and I know it's a really corny explanation but that's the sensation I get whenever I hit one of these amazing so the sunset sherbert tasted like how in the summertime when the rain hits the pavement you know that signature summer smell that's what it tastes like if you can get can get what I'm saying there taste how that smells like doesn't taste like strawberry banana I'm honestly at this point I'm considering that they just put the wrong carts in the wrong labels but got a really funky color to it I actually didn't notice this until now it's almost like it's almost a little bit more red at the top then clear at the bottom the other one was just mainly clear maybe a little tint of orange but yeah honestly I haven't smoked any way any way of I haven't smoked cannabis any other way and I'm sure a lot of you guys that live in legal theatres gonna be sitting here laughing at me of this whole video because it's like bro I did that back in 2012 dawg and I'm sitting here feeling [ __ ] blessed so ever happen to of these things Cheers [Music] and then it catches up to you the tab sweats running down the arms oh my god go I have some leather lungs I'll tell you that for one thing I think it's the heat oh he usually doesn't kill me like that I think it's because it's 6:00 in the morning and I've smoked backwards recently but anyways anyways yeah dude the thing creeps up on you like an actual dive out of a dad break sometimes especially if you hit it back-to-back you take one hit ghost inhale going for another you're like halfway through the hit feeling super-confident then you start exhaling and it just piles and piles and piles in a matter of 2 seconds and it's all oger from there it's all over so yeah what can I say about this 95% I don't even know if I can call this a review because I feel like to do reviews you have to have the accessibility to go out and try multiple kinds different types sativa indica different brands and I feel like you have to have that general consensus of what the oil card game is like and this is the second one I've ever ever tried so I thought I'd make a video a little wake-and-bake 6:00 in the morning got my sleep schedule kind of back where it should be woke up at 5:00 in the morning like a [ __ ] old man what am I even saying I hope you enjoyed this leave a like if you did follow me on Twitter and Instagram I'm really trying to hit a hundred thousand followers on Instagram sitting at about 92 yeah so if you don't follow me on Instagram go for can also follow my cat both links are in the description hope you have a great day I'm feeling really nice right now wake-and-bake is definitely achieved yeah have a nice day stay high stay lifted and stay snazzy please [Music]", "cy0r4zIdDMs": "[Music] hi friends trent the wizard here with factory six we're diving deep into some factory six factoids going into the forge about the difference between full spectrum broad spectrum and isolate products now the first thing we need to under really understand is where does that come from what is hemp extract well that comes from this delicious little flower here which is produced by the hemp plant now this little guy is where we're really going to pull most of our product from some of the leaves but mostly this is where the concentrated product exists now it's about a three to four month growing period for this to come to full fruition then a couple months for you know harvesting and drying and then at that point we're going to put it through an extraction process most commonly that extraction process is going to be a co2 or an ethanol depending upon you know purity and speed and whatever you're looking for but there's also new processes that are coming out we're working with a company right now that is actually working on a high pressure water extraction right now that is really exciting because it's solventless it's all natural we'll see how that comes out and more as it comes down the line however right now we're going to talk about the full spectrum crude oil that is the first thing that comes off the plant through that extraction process so this dark tar-like substance is exactly what has what we call a full spectrum of the cannabinoids or when we say that we mean all of the cannabinoids that that specific strain or that variety of hemp produced so it doesn't contain all 113 known cannabinoids but it will produce a variety of specific ones depending on the strain that you're growing and from there when you put it through the extraction process those are what's going to be present here along with some plant fats some chlorophyll some other things like that this is a pretty raw material so taste wise it's not super delicious it's kind of rough to the palate however there's things that we can do with this even as it is right now one of those things being we can use it in for example topicals like a cbd balm or a cream that way we're also utilizing as much of the plant as possible because it's as close as to it as we can get it's the first extraction that's something that you can really just use and just rub onto the skin and it's really nice you're gonna get most of the benefit that you can get from the plant in and of itself from this product alone all right friends so the next step in that process that we're going to be talking about today is going to be distillation with distillation we're going to get a distillate from crude oil that distillate is going to look very much like a honey as you can see here it is a very beautiful product in the sense that it's got the fats the chlorophyll everything else is taken out of it it can come in two different forms it can either come in a full spectrum or a broad spectrum the full spectrum is going to have again like i said all of those cannabinoids that plant produced and 0.3 or less thc as per federal regulation whereas a broad spectrum you're taking all of that thc out down to four decimal points so it's a non-detectable amount in that extract for you so the main thing that we're going to use something like this for is we're going to put this into something that's more of like an adjustable product like a tincture but this is really one of the main or most popular products that we use with a distillate among the many various products that we can put distillate into all right friends and as we move along this process we're going to be taking our distillate down to an isolate so in isolate as we go down that refinement process is going to be a powder that is literally a crystallized oil which is actually quite fascinating but one of the benefits of that that gives us is the fact that we can do really targeted things now an isolate is a 99.9 or 99.5 pure concentrate extract so we're talking about really really pure no plant anything but just that singular compound in and of itself so you know this is kind of like a sniper rifle in the sense you can get really targeted you can get really specific on what you're trying to do with it and that's really really nice it's workability it's it blends well it does a lot of things that these other products is a little bit more difficult takes a little bit more time to do so for example like a great product that an isolate would be used for is like a quick tab it's a nice little sublingual tablet that dissolves directly into the mouth but again it's very easy to work with and that's why we like to use an isolate with it all right guys so the last thing we're going to be talking about today in our process is going to be a powdered water soluble extract now this is unique in the sense that we're taking a oil product we're encapsulating it down on a nano size to actually make it dissolvable in water which is really really unique considering the oil and water don't generally mix so from this we can make really really cool products there's a lot of applications you can do especially since this can be a broad spectrum product still retaining all that cannabinoid profile all that entourage beautiful effect that we've talked about earlier but while at the same time getting a very very targeted application it's really unique and really really cool to work with guys thanks for watching this is all we have for you today for more information check out factory6cbd.com watch more of our videos this is trent the wizard with factory six factoids again we'll see you next time you", "hcHTsgxmDBA": "[Music] I'm been kolchin I'm with hope scientific we I'm a process and sales engineer and we're here at MJ biz con in Las Vegas Nevada it's our biggest show every year we're excited to be here we're working with different processing equipment for example our nutri filter dryers these are used for making CBD isolate and so you'll end up with a powder solution that comes out of here it's a great piece of equipment used not only in cannabis processing but throughout pharma and food industries worldwide MJ biz con has been a huge success for us it's keep kept us really busy and we always like to bring our new equipment out to the show and show off to our customers what we've been selling to industry traditionally and what we got in store for the next year I'd say we're at the forefront of distillation and process design we really are trying to come up with systems that are going to fit customer's needs a lot of the systems we build our custom design and we really want to work with customers to make sure that we're putting together a process it's going to make them successful hopefully they can make a good profit off of it and we can as well help them grow I think a couple things we're looking to solve is probably just working on especially with in CBD processing there's a lot of people who have are trying to figure out how do they properly remediates THC one of the other things that we have a background in is pharmaceutical processing and as it becomes tighter and tighter regulations especially throughout the world countries like Canada and in the European Union a lot of the GMP requirements are pretty high and so with our background and that we want to make sure that we're bringing that to the forefront and helping understand what customers need to make products that are safe and effective all right so this is one of our white film stills this is one of our larger units we have you know like this could process about 60 kilograms an hour of crude oil that's extracted we're going to be doing with these machines is separating the extract into three parts you're first pulling off the lighter components such as your terpenes then you just fill your cannabinoids away from your heavier materials such as floor fills waxes fats sugars 60 kilograms an hour is what this machine is rated for we make a couple bigger products than this we got one bigger lineman it's about two and a half times the capacity haven't seen much demand for it in this industry but I can't say that I don't expect it to come through if you visit our website you can go to poping comm that's gonna be our main website there's also Polk cannabis distillation comm that's going to be a little more focused on what we're doing within the cannabis [Music]", "e6-SFbyVbFQ": "what's up what's going on guys I'm Rick Shaw and for those of you who don't know I make medicinal marijuana extraction videos and I post them on the internet for other people who watch learn from and smoke along with now today I have something cool of the clear from Thompson caribou concentrates I got ten separate syringes all containing one gram I get them first like they sell them for $60 a gram which is really really really reasonable because a lot of people sell their short path distillation for about 100 bucks a gram even more sometimes and this stuff's really really nice it's flavorless it's basically Congress it has a beautiful golden tinge to it it's not too liquidy it's fairly stable compared to some of the syringe soil I've seen yeah it's like 97 percent 60 bucks a gram so this was a six hundred dollar river right here but that's fine because this is gonna be worth a few months like this is a few months worth of medicine mixing it into shatters and stuff this will last for a couple months without further any without any further ado we're going to heat up the Omni nail by Santa Cruz shredder we're gonna heat it up red hot leg cool down for a couple seconds we're gonna go in and take a nice quick down but I'm not gonna be able to tell you guys about the flavor or anything because there is none but before we do that I will bring these back in over here quickly show you them off like I was saying there's ten of them they were sold out of this stuff for a really long time and then they put 350 grams on their site sold out in three days so yeah we're just gonna pop open a random one there's a little tag in these you when you're putting it back on you don't want to bend that or else you'll never keep it on I'm gonna bring this in and show you guys the first push and then I'll heat up the nail off-camera and we'll be right back see that so as you can see it comes out fairly slow haven't had distal in a long time you just grab it break it off drop this camera down actually yeah I do focus come on it's a fair-sized ab okay fix this camera and then I will quickly as you can see right there the distillate is actually coming out oh there grab focus there so the distillate is coming out it is moving some people dab off the syringe and honestly you're gonna melt the [ __ ] plastic tip and then you're gonna ruin your oil you're gonna put impurities in it you're gonna cross contaminate it with [ __ ] polypropylene I'm sure it's a food-grade plastic but you okay so we're back Neil's hot cooling a bit we're going in Cheers yeah that's sweet make stuff nice on set that's really really nice stuff again this was from Thomson caribou concentrates guys this shirt was brought to me by waxer not calm don't even smoke flour I'm a cush connoisseur I'm a

"b44rkf89LII": "[Music] short fat distillation is almost the end of line in cannabis product manufacturing we have basic manufacturing of extracts and then we have distillation than you have chromatography and a high in analytics which tends also can go back in a distillation afterwards short path distillation has been shown to be an excellent solution in providing the maximum yield of the highest quality product and so we worked very closely with manufacturers in this industry and listen to what they had to say with a rotary evaporator without being able to control the cooling the rotary operator won't work it'll overheat and shoot the vapors right in the room so when you're running a rotary evaporator you're gonna have a hot bath a cold column and high vacuum without keeping that column cold the vacuum just going to pull vapor right through the system it's gonna rush out into the room the Pau science chillers that we supply with our customers are so heavy-duty that they never shift from a degree and they're able to keep the temperature on point every single time and they don't start going up in the middle of their run where vapour starts to escape the system they're able to control it and keep it all the way in the road about there are many areas in short craft distillation that require precise temperature control from heating the product to areas where you need a slight level of cooling of the product and then extremely low temperatures for the cold traps to maximize the longevity of your vacuum pumps and get the purest product possible so when the factors are making product a couple years ago even longer they were not aware of how clean you can make a product so in the process of distillation and even when the chromatography andrey distilling the product for purification we can remove a lot of the inactive compounds that serve you no therapeutic purpose when you're consuming cannabis there's parts of it there are therapeutic of the cannabinoids that are they're helpful in turbines and there's parts of the plant matter that's dissolved like fats waxes proteins lots of numerous things including bad flavor you can remove that and create a flavorless product that's very high in purity and actually clean and safe to consume if you're chiller is down you're not making money so people have really come to rely on poly science as a reliable solution that will maximize your yield and also keep your system up and running poly science allows us to control a lot of the equipment that's used in this process we have a lot of heat and a lot of cooling if those parameters are off you can be selecting different molecules or you could be having clogs in the system or you can be damaging your pumps so none of our equipment we manufacturer would be able to operate without cost nice choice [Music]", "o3fYypXjEeM": "hi buds it's candy here today I'm going to be making THC infused strawberry lemonade that I made with distillate so I'm going to be a hundred percent honest with you I'm leaving a timestamp here so you guys can go straight to the recipe because I've made this way more complicated than I needed to be and basically this video you're gonna watch me turn a mistake into something magical I can start feeling the heaviness right now Dex first things first you're going to need a gram of distillate roughly it does all the grams and I'll be talking more about it later on two cups of sugar 1 cup of Everclear this recipe calls for a two-to-one ratio and we're using Everclear to dissolve the distillate that Everclear is something you could potentially skip next we need roughly two cups of half strawberries as well as one and a half cup of fresh squeezed lemons next you want to preheat the oven at 200 degrees and leave it at 200 degrees so that where we don't activate the THC and I honestly just so it you don't need to activate the TFC because it's already there so we just want to make sure we conserve as much as possible next get the 2 cups of sugar and put it into a pan then get the 1 cup of Everclear important to a bowl now we're going to be putting that one gram of distillate into the so that we can start mixing this distillate roughly houses around a thousand milligrams of THC in it the reason I wanted to put it and Everclear was so that it would dissolve evenly and that way I could put it evenly throughout the sugar my original plan was to make granulated sugar about what I did was I messed up and I closed the oven door and then it turned into a syrup so then I decided to work with what I had but yes I will be making an actual tutorial on how to do the guy kneeling sugar now we just mix the Everclear and the distillate together next you pour the mixture onto the sugar you could use a little bit of a wider pan than we did then we mixed it all together and make sure that everything is saturated evenly next just place to the 200 degree preheated oven and set your timer for 13 minutes and check for daily and this is where I messed up my original plan I did close the other door so it did cook down and it created an actual cistern so if you do want to make granular sugar you simply just leave the oven door open so that way it can all evaporated but then you get this golden to cool this is where the real recipe begins you simply boil two cups water and keep it on a very low simmer because you do not want to activate the THC and then I poured the syrup that I created into the water just to dilute it a little bit now here I'm going to be placing the actual instructions on how you can make it a lot easier and save the headaches basically ideally you would just put the two cups of water melt two cups of sugar into it and then add a distillate right on it I actually enjoyed several clearer taste to it it had a little bit of a move to the lemonade so I didn't mind it now it's time for the lemonade start cutting an equivalent of two cups of hats strawberries put them into a little bowl and then start mashing away you could certainly use a blender but according to my friend he doesn't believe in them use this now it's time to roll some lemons and get the juices flowing and start to squeeze the lemon juice in there I did get a roughly an equivalent of a cup and a half of lemon juice it could certainly be anything ever they want and then I add the mashed and pureed strawberry onto it I actually enjoyed the masher because it left Jack pretty pulpy give it a good stir and then we're ready to add the syrup we created put it in along with two cups of water and that's pretty much it after giving it a good little stir simply serve in chilled glasses and enjoy I really enjoyed making this granted it was a headache and a half just because of a failed experiment but you can always turn something negative into a positive and definitely this was a positive hope you guys enjoy it as we did and I'll see you guys later we're gonna feel it

what I'm going to talk to you about is the ethanol extraction process and I want to go over as much detail as possible as I can cover so I'm gonna start very first with kind of an overview of the process and I'm gonna compartmentalizes so you can look at the entire process basically in three large steps so the first being extraction this is achieved by our cup 15 or cup 30 systems the second being evaporation of the solvent and this is achieved by alcohol until systems or rotary evaporator as well and finally you have a distillation step and that is performed at our roll-film system which is behind me or a similar distillation setup now those are the three big primary steps to compartmentalize that a little bit further before I go into detail on these steps I want you to understand that there's to tertiary steps in between these three lines so between extractions our cup system and the falling film or evaporation what we need to do is we need to filter that solution so we're going to be removing out of particulates and in some cases even lipids in fact the second tertiary process happens between the falling film we evaporation and prior to distillation on the real film system here and that's decarboxylation which is the process of converting the acidic cannabinoids that the plant produces THC a CBD a into the ones that are useful for us as consumers and manufacturers is THC and CBD so that is the decarboxylation step and then usually the final step is a distillation as I said that produces a distillate so to go into detail here a little bit the first thing that happens is your biomass or your cannabis or Hamptons in put it into your lab what's very important is that you make sure this is milled and homogenized you don't want or batches to be inconsistent because this is harder to track data while process so most large-scale facilities the first thing they do is mill or grind and homogenize their batches so the first thing then once we've milled and homogenized is on our cup system we're gonna pack that biomass into a mesh bag then these bags are about 80 micron forest size and what happens in that biomass is packed into the bag and then frozen at this point I do want to make a distinction that ethanol processing overall can be done with one room temperature or warm solvent or ethanol but for most people in most labs it's most advantageous to do this cold so you need to chill your solvent most often to something around negative 40 degrees Celsius prior to extraction and this cold processing is also the reason we pre freeze our biomass prior to extraction so once we've had our bag packed we've got that biomass pre frozen and we're gonna perform my extraction so we've got our ethanol cold at that point in the cup system we put our bags in and we fill it with ethanol and we do an agitation this is the formal abstraction where the ethanol is gonna grab the THC the sea Dee Dee and the terpene compounds and this is very largely depend on the solvent temperature once that extraction or agitation is done the centrifugal process of the cup is then initiated and this spins that bag very quickly and uses that centrifugal force to remove the residual amounts of solvent from the biomass now once we've done that we have a solution here of ethanol and our cannabinoids are compounds we want our CBD and THC a actually in that example and at that point that solution needs to be filtered and another point that should be made here is that solution isn't fully saturated meaning it can hold more THC and CBD and because the evaporation process down the line is very energy intensive we want to make sure ethanol is it as saturated as possible so in most labs after that initial extraction what they'll do is they will really saturate that ethanol or they will use that same volume of ethanol to wash or extract multiple bags on a cup system for example so once that ethanol is fully saturated as I alluded to at the beginning here it needs to be filtered prior to evaporation and this is to remove particulate more than anything little bits of plant matter that were left behind from the extraction process so once we've filtered it through a nuclear funnel or lenticular filter of some sort at that point then we're good to move that on to the evaporation process which is going to occur in usually a rotary evaporator or Delta's equipment we have a fall in the film evaporator so this evaporation procedure essentially involves applying heat and vacuum to the system to get the ethanol to boil off the key concept here is that the ethanol is going to boil off but our cannabinoids are target compounds the things we want our CBD a THC a are not going to boil off at this point and we can collect them and REE collect our ethanol now as I alluded to at the beginning there that crude extract prior once we've collected it from evaporation prior to distillation we need to decarboxylate and what this is is it really boils down to just applying heat to that crude extract and this is most often done on a hot plate or in a large glass or steel reactor at scale what happens there is again the plant produces the acidic compounds thca and CBD a and what we want especially for consumers but prior to distillation as well as we want the non acidic form so this is THC and CBD the more recognizable cannabinoids so the decarboxylation process just applies just involves applying heat for a certain amount of time to get these acidic compounds to convert to their non acidic forms and then at this point we have a decarboxylated crude extract and this crude extract generally speaking is the Queen 60 and 70% potent or 60 or 70 percent by weight cannabinoids are CVD or THC and the final step in him is distillation and that's performed again on a machine like this one behind me this is the rolls mill distillation unit of deltas and what we're going to be doing here is very similar to the following film we apply even more heat and even more vacuum to boil off and separate certain compounds and at the end of this process we're left with what is very recognizable now in the industry and what we call distillate this distillate depending on if we started with CBD or THC biomass is approximately 90 percent or 90 percent in CBD or THC respectively in that distillate and then that cements the process some manufacturers will take that distillate and will isolate the cannabinoid compounds as well but primarily we have from biomass extraction filtration of the solution evaporation of the solvent decarboxylation of that crude extract and then a final distillation of the crude extract to end or result in a very potent cannabinoid distant", "cusrXgscKvY": "hello senior stoner fan just a real senior stoner back at you and this afternoon I want to get back to business today we're gonna talk about concentrates we're gonna talk about things that are stronger than regular flour things that you could add to a bowl things that you can put into a joint things that you can dab with we're gonna talk about all those things how they affect us and the different things we can do with them let's take it away let's go with something that we know this is THC distill it runs about 99% pure when it's clear like this you need to get it to be clear like this translucent not opaque you don't want it to be brown you don't want it to be you know where you can have like a color to it you want it to be yellow or clear THC distill it can be used a number of different ways we can put it in our dab machines we can put it right on top of a bowl in a pipe we can roll it in a joint I like to line the inside of a paper with it this is THC distill it runs about anywhere from 40 to 90 dollars a gram that would be a thousand milligrams that is THC distill it the next thing and this is not an order of my favorites or anything I'm just picky enough to talk about this is THC diamond THC a diamonds which I have contracted for me in large quantities and these are very special these are gorilla glue number four and you've seen these before from me and keep them in large quantities because I use them a number of different ways obviously use them in add a break either the puffs go peek the Carta or now the new hora I also use them in an electronic pen I also use them not on a bowl but sprinkled on top of the joint the Jimmy joint includes THCA diamonds the next thing I want to talk about is something that I got from mrs. stoner sativa shatter this is more of a sauce than it is a shatter not a hard shatter smells pretty good let's take a look at it I think the strain is called penny wise but yesterday I made mrs. stoner about a dozen Jimmy joints sativa and I took this on a DAB spoon and then spread it onto the paper kind of like you spread fudge inside of a baking pan or something like that so this is shatter okay next on our list we're gonna talk about something I already mentioned to you all and this is dosey doe THC diamonds very nice smell and a darker color some of the extraction methods that the growers and the producers use yield a darker color there's more impurities in the darker color then there isn't a lighter color we'll see that shortly you saw that minor yellow golden these are kind of brown let's go to a set of Cinderella gram of Cinderella 99 by slam pig extracts these are pretty you might even be able to see the crystals glistening on these lighter color not an orange color very pure I really like the way they came out slammed pig extracts and the strain is Cinderella 99 next this is make America glob again make America glob again Girl Scout cake live rosin one to two PO full-spectrum hash Rossum County cultivators is who it's made by let's take a look at it oh it smells tasty really smells like sauce like my THC diamonds and sauce it's not gonna be as harsh rosin tends to be less harsh when you smoke it then the diamond is do well I've had this before but let's take a look at it again this is sugar wax called Wonka burry buy organic goods a very very top-flight supplier in Maine Wow look at this now it's a darker okay the darker keep that in mind a lot of this sugar wax is darker you're gonna get sugar wax that's Blonde Redhead brunette but you're not gonna get the white you're not gonna get this from sugar wax not gonna get that color and you're not gonna get this glistening this you can watch the shine you can almost reflect off of you on these diamonds look at the light how it hits it in that incredible - shame I'm light on diamonds these days but it's really only the ring I'm light on because I'm rolling Jimi joints with all of this in it I'm really taking a full spectrum approach to my Jimi joints so hope you liked this discussion about white diamonds about make America glob again about THCA diamonds about dosey doe live resin diamonds about sugar wax about Wonka burry sugar wax and about distill it message me if you have any questions a lot of this can be put into edibles I talked to people about this you know what the suppliers I deal with them their opinion is it's a very expensive way to make edibles they're saying this to me and I'm sure they're saying it from a commercial perspective but this certainly can go into anything and I am going to start experimenting with the diamonds let's say small amounts in edibles I'm going to decarbonise them but right now I want to convey all this nice information to everybody I hope it helped this is the real senior stoner everybody have a great day out there and keep on smoking", "GQDmqLqLkvg": "welcome to 420 RX cannabis cooking and confectionaries here's Jamie hi oh we're going to do an infusion of THC concentrate into a half cup of coconut oil so I'm going to get my coconut oil into my metal bowl that is on medium-low heat and let that melt give a little stir I'm going to use 600 milligrams of a hybrid concentrate once I have that I like to pull a little of the warm oil into the syringe and empty it back out to make sure I have all the concentrate out I'm gonna give that a stir and then leave it on low heat for a few minutes [Music] once I feel comfortable that it is infused and things are bound together I'm going to give it another quick stir and then I will transfer it into a container with an airtight lid put my little leaf label on it there are 24 teaspoons and a half cup I have 25 milligrams per teaspoon and infused coconut oil be sure to subscribe to this channel for updates and notifications whenever we post a new video thanks for watching", "eqSJoOmCi8s": "alright let's get started first things first you're going to need some THC distill it I'm gonna need some coconut oil you're gonna need a shot glass you're gonna need a dropper finally you're gonna need a pot with some water in it so the first step in this process of making cannabis capsules is going to be to weigh out your THC distill it so we're gonna weigh up one gram here just put your shot glass on top of your scale tear it out so it's at zero get all that distill it in there we're now gonna follow it up with three milliliters or three grams of coconut oil this is gonna give you a nice dye Lucien you're gonna have about 23 milligrams per dropper on this dropper here which is 0.25 ml dropper so you might have 10 ml per notch on your syringe so next we're gonna tear the scale again we're gonna get our coconut oil I'm gonna add 3 grams or 3 mm now the next step is to take your coconut oil and THC distill a mixture place it in top of the pot of water on top of the stove allow it to blend evenly when it's completely mixed it will be ready to fill into your cannabis capsules so it's been about five minutes with both the oils over medium heat on the stove and as you can see they're completely blended into a beautiful clear liquid the stirring definitely helps now this is what's going to fill your cannabis capsules alright now we're off to the final step which is filling up your capsules you're gonna need some capsules here we've already took in the time to split them up we got the big end small end these are very easy to find you can find them at your local health store they're just empty gelatin capsules size zero zero super easy to find great for making cannabis capsules of any kind so what you're gonna do here is take your cannabinoid rich oil suck it up into your syringe or your dropper we're using an eye dropper here it's easier for filling up the as I find and you're gonna take out your dough sighs so what you're gonna do is you're gonna figure out how much concentrates you used how much oil you use and do the math ml mark and since we're making 40 ml capsules we're gonna suck it just up to here the 50 mark on our eye dropper take the top of one of the capsules pop it on and you've got yourself a cannabis capsule if you're making these for personal it doesn't matter if you don't use gloves if you're making these for somebody else please use gloves cuz it does get messy and your fingers gonna be all over these things unless you have a capsule machine there you go there's your first cannabis capsule this is a 40 milligram pure THC distill it cup so again hook it up to the 15 portion get it in the capsule get a top one there pop it on it's another cannabis cap so we got two there", "JpgapkpDzRI": "[Music] when you're buying a CBD product really the first thing to look at is to see whether it says its isolate or a whole hemp distillate but really what you're dealing with there is if it is isolate it may be perfectly good the reason that they did it that way is because you don't know what it was originally in it it has been purified in that regard but everything else is gone as well what you're really looking for is a hold him product because there's so much about this plant that we don't know one of the theories is that what it's called the entourage effect that they're all of these different cannabinoids there are the other ingredients terpenes flavonoids so on that we don't know why they're there and what effect they have what is clear none of them are toxic and certainly they're not there in sufficient quantities to be harmful as a part of how this plant has evolved over the millennia that it has been used by human beings and it survived as a plant in all kinds of different environments this plant will grow almost any place in various various forms and it has been used for thousands of years and we know the of course from our immediate experience it has all kinds of possible medicinal properties the idea of simply taking one cannabinoid whether it's THC or CBD or whatever you really don't know what you're losing by not having it in a whole him solution to look at that and see what's there if the only thing that it's listed is the ingredient is CBD you know that they are basically isolated that that's fine but you really true I think you get the whole hemp plant and this is not immediately obvious because you would think oh this is pure CBD whereas the other has all this other stuff but the other stuff as far as we know could be the good stone certainly is going to hurt you you", "pW66iiVNJtY": "hey guys it's Nick with precision here and today I wanted to talk to you guys about the fundamentals between co2 and solvent based extraction what we want to talk about is the fundamentals of the solvent we're gonna start with co2 so co2 typically in the atmosphere as you guys probably well know is a gas right it's all surrounding us everywhere but in order to make it a solvent it needs to go into what's called subcritical or supercritical phase right and what happens with a supercritical phase is you're compressing and you're heating that gas in order to make it into a fluid form right so typically called supercritical fluid extraction or and if it's at the lower end of that range sub critical fluid extraction now this technology has been around for years right it's been used in coffee it's been used in vanilla types of artisanal extracts it's really really good for decaffeination they use it in dry cleaning right so the technology has been around and about 10 years ago when cannabis really started getting large and people started looking towards cannabis extracts they said hey why don't we try this supercritical co2 so the history of the solvent is that it's been used very widely and people look to repurposing it into the cannabis industry right which they started to do maybe you know eight nine years ago and it started to really get big about six or seven years ago right so all these supercritical co2 applications popped up for cannabis specifically and when you look at the fundamentals of the solvent right the the difference between co2 and a different solvent like hydro carbon or ethanol is co2 doesn't do a great job at actually extracting the cannabinoids right so you've got your your cannabinoid structure that's contained within your trichome right and your trichome is a a mushroom like shape on the outside of the leaf of the plant right and that's what contains all your goodies that you you know your turf beans your your CBD your THC your cbn your CBG all those things are contained within that mushroom trichome structure right so what we want to do with the solvent of any kind is dissolve that structure right and isolate those molecules now supercritical co2 can do this right but it's a very weak solid so if you think of a solvent and you think of a molecule like like a Lac on one side and a key on the other you want to find the perfect key that goes into the lock and you're kind of sliding it in there you're turning that turning that lock and that that that door is opening right away right now with supercritical co2 it's kind of similar to trying to jam a screwdriver into the lock right it's going to work right but it takes a lot of a lot of power a lot of pressure right which is why you see these systems that operate between 1,500 to 5000 psi and because of the nature of the solvent right the solvent has to be repeatedly passed over that trichome structure right so we're continuously passing this this solvent that doesn't have great solubility with cannabinoids and with that trichome structure of the plant over this plant in order to get our goodies out so to speak right so that's why co2 units have a long cycle time typically what you're gonna see is anywhere between on the very low end to hours which will diminish your yield and diminish your your returns on your actual processing and you're also going to see longer cycle times the more material that you put in there generally right so these can be manipulated in a number of different factors a lot of the co2 companies have drastically improved upon the old days you know the old days it was eight hours per run right they've improved that by running things like subcritical running things like a higher pressure sometimes up to 5,000 psi but it doesn't change the fundamentals of the solvent right the solvent is is is not the best key for our lock in order to get those cannabinoids and those those chemicals out of the plant that were that we're desiring right so that is a fundamental overview of why co2 technologies aren't as applicable now when you look at the equipment side of co2 right obviously it stands to common sense that if you got to have something that's going up to you know 1,500 2,000 5,000 psi right you can imagine at scale it's simply not economical or feasible in order to have those technologies at scale right because if you think about a gigantic vessel that needs to go to 5,000 psi right think about the amount of engineering that to go in there the shell thickness the the valve the safety precautions right obviously when you're working at those types of pressures there's a fundamental safety concern now if it's properly engineered equipment of course the machines operate safely there's not a thorough history of accidents or things like that but that it takes more dollars right which is why dollars two dollars when you're looking at co2 equipment the equipment is actually quite a bit more expensive than solvent based right so what really happens with with with all this total scenario right as you start weighing out all these variables between co2 and solvent based against the equipment against how how you're going to scale what's right for your business how you're going to apply these technologies to your end products right and that's a lot of what we do here at precision is we we look at our client's needs we understand what it takes for an end-to-end process to integrate and that's part of what differentiates our company is that you know we our end-to-end process integrators not just somebody that's gonna sell you a piece of equipment and walk away right so so what I'd like to do is really is compare that with you know the the fundamentals of solvent based extraction now right and when we talk about solvents we'll talk about the three most popular which would be butane propane and ethanol there's a lot of other solvents out there that work there's a lot of other solvents that that may come into play in the future but we're gonna focus around the primary three that are that are used today in the cannabis and hemp industry and we'll talk about how those apply more readily to large scale especially in CBD production and hemp production so on the other side of this coin I want to talk about solvent based extraction right I want to talk about how it compares with co2 specifically so let's go back to our lock and key analogy right our lock and key analogy is we want to find the the perfect key to go into the lock right and on this side is our molecule that we're trying to extract and on this side is our key our key is our solvent right and we've not found generally a better key in the history of extraction over the last decade or so then butane and propane right so butane and propane are nonpolar solvents with light boiling point right and what that's going to yield is it's going to it's going to go in there it's gonna bind to all of your cannabinoids or terpenes and the desirable aspects of the plant right so if you ever look at our teas '''l type of products most of them are made with butane and propane right you get that really beautiful light color that terpene rich smell right which is very very applicable to artisanal cannabis markets and it's also very very applicable to moderate scale right different types of manufacturing and making different products right now we start to make a little bit of a paradigm shift right because butane and propane as most of you probably well know are flammable solvents right so and they also contain a little bit of pressure which means it costs a little bit more money to engineer the equipment right the shell thicknesses on the equipment have to be a little bit thicker but not like co2 right at co2 we're talking about 5000 psi butane and propane we're talking about anywhere from 50 to 150 psi so much much lower pressure is much safer working environment over all right but we want to keep these vapors contained so they're not ignitable right and you want to stay in a class one division one room and take all these proper safety precautions now our company has done thousands of installations of hydrocarbon equipment across the entire world at this point and we can we can honestly say that I think we're experts in hydrocarbon extraction and we understand that hydrocarbon actually does pull the best terpene profile the best cannabinoid profile out of the cannabis plant however at large scale you can start to see where the actual hurdles come in so to speak right so now how do i process you know 2,000 pounds a day with hydrocarbon on a large scale it starts to get very costly and very engineering heavy let's call it right because you have to have all of these different vessels everything has to be under pressure everything has to be class 1 division 1 rated right so it's not really feasible for for large-scale CBD extraction or large-scale hemp extraction and what we like to usually say is is you know if you're an artisanal brand that means you're processing about a thousand pounds of input biomass per day or less right once you start crossing over that threshold the cost of engineering the equipment the cost of the redundancy and the batch equipment and and the cost of the hydrocarbon equipment becomes prohibitive right and it's why you see a large trend towards ethanol so let's talk about ethanol from a from a chemical standpoint for a minute right so going back to our lock and key method ethanol is also a very good key for our lock right but the problem with ethanol is because the polarity of the solvent it's an extremely polar solvent right so the extremely polar solvent yes it will bind to our cannabinoids and our terpenes the problem is is that it's also going to bind to chlorophylls and to other water-soluble or undesirable compounds within the plant now traditionally what everyone has done to combat both those water soluble molecules are those chlorophylls is they've chilled their ethanol down so those of you that are watching this video that are experienced you may very well know if you run your ethanol at negative 40 or below generally you're you're able to bypass a lot of the chlorophylls you're able to bypass a lot of the a lot of lipids and the phosphide profiles right things that are going to gum up your process downstream right but the problem is is that how do you chill now all this ethanol on a massive scale so we're in a different a different era now so to speak right how do we use ethanol a scale for CBD that we're doing 10,000 pounds a day well it comes down to properly engineered equipment right it comes down to proper mass balance it comes down to proper post processing procedures where you need an end to end in engineered solution which is what we've done with our KP D Series right so it's not just pouring ethanol over plant matter right there's refinement of the product there's variabilities in the biomass there's there's all sorts of things that are coming down the pipeline right that affect your yield they affect your your distillate quality they affect your crystallization right all these different variables that you need to have a thorough understanding of right so processing at scale it can be done you just need to have an understanding and a strong team that understands all these variables and how to combat but from a from a fundamental standpoint of scaled extraction ethanol is fantastic because you don't have the pressures there's absolutely zero vapor pressure which means none of your vessels are under pressure you're not operating under pressure it has significantly less flammability than then hydrocarbon and it's significantly safer than co2 and the fact that it's not pressurized right and people like ethanol because they know most of us go out to the bar every Friday and Saturday night and drink it right we ingest it it is a relatively safe solvent generally recognized as safe from the FDA so let's let's talk about an overview of the common misconceptions that come with solvent based extraction right people tell you all you extract with a solvent you extract with butane or propane you're gonna have residual butane and propane in your product that's absolutely not true so what happens is once the product is extracted there may be trace amounts of butane and propane but it goes through a heating and purging process right typically that's done either in vacuum drying ovens or in decarboxylation or in distillation right that's going to remove that solvent and there'll be zero parts per million of any sort of residual solvent right same thing with ethanol ethanol is a little bit harder to take off because it has a higher boiling point right it's not as volatile doesn't make Verizon's easy but the same thing right it's going to be pulled off and decarboxylation or in in distillation and it's ironic because a lot of the people that that preach anti solvent extraction right there in the CBD market and they realized once they get to crystallization that they're forced to use pentane H pentane is a group D hydrocarbon and you know needs to be purged needs to be dealt with in the class one division one room needs to have all these parameters so again understanding your process and and working with really I could say educated people not believing a lot of the marketing hype that's out there because everybody wants to sell you equipment but in the end of the day do they know how to integrate your process and and do they really understand the science of what's happening behind the process and have they done it before did they have a long operational history so these are things that I would definitely you know ask the people that here that you're potentially doing business with a lot of what we do here with our R&D team is that we test these processes we test new parameters we're working on ways to optimize the extraction process you know our company while we're an equipment manufacturer where a process integrator but we always focus as an innovative technology company right so we're always looking at disruptive disruptive technologies what's going to change in the future market trends what's going to happen to these markets how do we get the scale for lower cost and we look at all these variables and that all starts on the bench right which you guys can see the lab behind me we work with our team very closely and we're always working to find a more efficient more effective process right while still being able to integrate the existing processes and making them work really well right so I

And this is why we're -- we're\nactually fighting our government for the right\nfor medical access, because it shouldn't be\npeople like me, sitting in a dank,\nlittle house, risking my life\nand my -- my freedom. to produce\nhigh-potency cannabis oil, I wanted to know who was using\nthis back-alley medicine. So I'm joining John\nas he consults with a new patient,\nPaul Webster Hughes -- a single father of two\nand stroke survivor. Hello.\nGood evening, John. I'm Paul.\nIt's a pleasure to meet you. Hello, Paul.\nVery nice to meet you. Can you step aboard?\nI'm -- I'm good. Thank you. \u266a\u266a I've just given cannabis\nin the privacy of my own home. Thank you very much. And, uh,\nthat's a 1:1 strain, which is 15% CBD\nand 15% THC. There's no\nrecommended dosage, because there isn't\nany medical data on how we're to do this.\nOkay. But, really,\nwhat I'd say of anyone is try a very, very, very\nsmall amount. Just take -- even just, like,\na pinhead to start with until you just\nget used to it. No need to worry about money,\n'cause that's what we do. We give out\nfree cannabis oil.\nWell, thank you very much. Because Paul lacks\nregular, safe access to medical marijuana, he uses a combination of medical oil and street weed to treat the symptoms\nof his stroke at his home in North Yorkshire. [ Birds chirping ] Andavolu: So, Paul, if you could\nsort of take me through -- What happened to you? 2005 --\nI'm living in Thailand, and I went out\nto my wife's village. Went swimming\nin the morning, and later that morning,\nI just fell, and I've got videos --\nbizarre, coincidental. Paul: Now, while you're\nplaying around on there... [ Woman gasps ] -It's okay.\n-There's no blood. [ Child crying ]\nOkay... And I was paralyzed\non the left side of my body. [ Slurring ]\nDo you need any... [ Woman speaking indistinctly,\nchild crying ] Woman: Hey. [ Crying continues ] Paul:\nAnd for the next six months,\nI was carried to the toilet. I had about 10% of my left body,\nat that point. I've had a headache\nfor 11 years.\nWow. Can you imagine having\na headache for 4,100 days? -Straight?\n-Straight -- absolutely. I never get a break. Imagine big, rolling\nboulders or marbles crashing\noff each other. It's like a tightening\nof a skull cap on my head. Did doctors sort of\nprescribe you anything to sort of help?\nOh, sure. Yeah, I-I've been on\npretty much all the medications that they're allowed\nto give me. I was on 14 pills a day\nat one point. So, on these pills, physically,\nit closed me down, and a couple of them depress you\nenough to kill you. This last Christmas,\nI decided no -- no more. And, uh, that's when\nI started, uh, smoking, because it dulled\nthe pain. \u266a\u266a It allows me to do the things\nthat I must do. It gives me potential. The pain's still there,\nbut it's in a bubble. But it's like\nthere's an extra layer between me and my pain. My kids\ndon't see me smoke. I only smoke\nin my room. I don't smoke anywhere else\nin the house. I'm a single dad.\nMy kids come first. Hello, you. -What'd you doin'?\n-Hi. There's word\nfor your brother you'll learn\nwhen you're older -- seven girlfriends,\nI mean... He's a player! Okay, that's one way\nof putting it. Yeah, sure. All right,\nhere's the view -- pizza. Can you bang it on?\nYou can do that, can't you, huh?\nMm-hmm. All right, homework --\nWhat about French?\nI got my history. What was your history like? 64%. 64%. -Yeah.\n-Well done, you. -Pizza's ready!\n-Okay. Thank you, sir. Please.\nYou're very welcome. Oh, thank you very much. Meat Feast or pepperoni? I think it's Meat Feast,\none of your favorites. -Meat Feast.\n-Looks like it's Meat Feast. Do you guys sort of,\nlike, realize that, like, the marijuana\nthat your dad's smoking is still, like,\ntechnically illegal? Yeah, we do. How does that make you feel?\nLike, what... Uh... Kind of scared that\nhe's gonna get caught. Paul: If I thought there\nwould be a situation where our life\nwould be threatened, I wouldn't smoke.\nMm-hmm. That's just\nblack and white. They're more important to me\nthan, uh -- than anything. [ Speaks indistinctly ] Ooh.\nHey, you okay? Yes, yes. Is it sort of scary\nto think that he has to do something that's illegal to,\nlike, feel better? If it's helping him,\nI allow it. But if he's doing it\nfor no reason, really, I would feel\nkind of upset. Right. But it doesn't seem like\nhe's doing it for no reason. It seems like\nit helps him a lot, right?\nMm-hmm. Well, she hates smoking --\nI think that's the main thing. And she's got a pretty good\nsense of values. And to her, whatever\nshe sees in the world, says pot's bad. And she thinks\nin black and white. And now we give her\nthis conundrum that daddy needs it. It kind of throws a bit\nof a wobbly at her, you know? Mm-hmm. So she's trying very hard\nto reconcile that. We had a bit of a cry together\nand a cuddle upstairs, and, uh, she'll be okay. I mean, it's hard, right?\nAnd it's -- It's lousy. I have to live a lie,\nand no parent, especially when you've got\nabsolute love for your kids, wants to do that. \u266a\u266a I've come\nto Limehouse Marina in London to see John on the final leg\nof his journey. Today he's gonna take\nhis tiny, little canal boat into the mighty River Thames\nto let his cannabis banner fly and to drum up support\nfor marijuana reform right in front of Parliament. What we've got here are\nsome CBD-rich cannabis seeds. They're very low in THCs. I'm gonna pop them\nin the balloon. Okay. [ Helium hissing ] We are gonna tie some notes\nto them from patients -- medicinal-cannabis patients\nacross the UK, and we're gonna send those\nup into the sky and hope they reach\ncommunities across Albion. Amazing. [ Hissing continues ] So, what do you reckon the day's\ngonna be like for you? Uh, I am...\nI mean,\nyou're taking a small boat into big old body of water. It's gonna be a big old\nbody of water out there, be nice and choppy. How is it different from the small canals\nthat you go in? Uh, it's tidal,\nso it's pretty dangerous. Do you think the boat's\ngonna handle it? The boat is gonna handle it,\nmy friend. We do not like pessimism...\nOkay. Right on. ...anywhere near my boat.\n[ Laughs ] \u266a\u266a [ Boat motor humming ] All right, John!\nSee you, man! Goodbye, Krishna.\nGood luck. Namaste. Whoo-whoo!\nWhoo-whoo! [ Laughs ] That's the little barge\nthat could. \u266a\u266a [ Crowd cheering ] It's to legalize\ncannabis in London. [ Cheering continues ] -Hey, how's it going?\n-Nice to meet you, man. Good to meet you.\nHey, man. I'm Krishna. You guys excited? \u266a\u266a [ Siren wailing ] Hey, Paul. -Krishna, how are you?\n-How's it going, man? Aw, it's good to see you. -What a great event.\n-I know. How are you feeling --\nYou excited? I'm very enthused\nand excited about it. It's not just talk. These are real people\ncoming out and demonstrating\nthe reality they believe in. And that's got to make a\ndifference, Krishna, in the end. And what's it like being sort of\nbeing amongst this group of, like,\nother like-minded people? -Brothers. Family.\n-You think so? -Yeah.\n-Amazing. They're just be so open\nand honest about it. I asked them, did they feel\nat all self-conscious? Hell no.\n[ Laughs ] You know, this is what\nthey believe and what they do. Yeah, people are just, like,\nsmoking weed next to the Thames, next to Parliament. The English are\nvery law-abiding. But I think now that we're starting to see\na movement that's gonna\ngive us a change. And this is the mother\nof Parliaments. If it can't start here... -This is where it starts.\n-This is where it starts. \u266a\u266a Andavolu:\nAll right, it looks like he's just about to go\nunder Westminster Bridge, and he's just gonna pop out right in front of the Houses\nof Parliament and Big Ben. I saw him for just this little\nbit right on the other side, and he looked really tiny. Like, the boat was small. And -- Oh, look! You can\njust see him right there. He's coming in. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] He's releasing the balloons. [ Laughs ] Amazing. Man: Go on, John!\nKeep going! Get those seeds!\nYou tell Cameron! [ Cheering continues ] Hey, John!\nHey, John! He gave the wave!\n[ Laughs ] He waved at us. And he looks so small\ncompared to that building. \u266a\u266a [ Cheers and applause ] \u266a\u266a As an American,\ncoming to the UK and seeing how medical-marijuana\npatients are faring -- In one way, it's a little\ndispiriting to see that they have to improvise and sort of do\nthis underground stuff to get what they think is\nmedicine that's gonna help them. But another way -- I'm seeing\nsomething sort of special. The people I met here\nare kind of filling in the gaps. Guys like John,\nlike Paul, like Hidrow, who are making real sacrifices\nin order to help people -- Robin Hoods of sorts -- they're forming these kind of\nad hoc underground communities, taking weed\nfrom the black market, making it into oil\nand medicine, and then giving it\nto the needy. That's kind of\na beautiful thing. That sort of, like,\nmodel of compassion is something I think\nthat the world can learn from. What I've seen in the U.S. is that legal weed\ncan equal money. But here in the UK, it seems like illegal weed\nequals compassion. And what's cool\nis that compassion is free. \u266a\u266a", "BhAAhz6ozOE": "[Music] wiped thin-film distillation sometimes called molecular distillation is the separation process where fluids with different boiling point temperatures can be separated with great efficiency and high purity in the cannabis world thin film distillation is commonly used to purify cannabinoids after the oils have been extracted from the plant material extracted cannabis oil is very dark brown in color sticky and very thick at room temperature it is sometimes referred to as crude oil or full-spectrum oil and is a feed material for our distillation process because crude oil is very viscous at room temperature it is first warm to a liquid state in the feed tank this oil is then pumped up through the feed tube into the main evaporation chamber the three main elements of the chamber are the evaporator surface the wiper and the condenser the process takes place in a vacuum which is monitored by the vacuum gauge the vacuum is created by using two pumps a mechanical roughing pump and a diffusion pump reducing the pressure reduces the boiling temperatures of the liquid which in conjunction with the wiped film creates greater efficiencies in purity following distillation the oil is divided into two fractions known as the residue and the distillate phases the distillate phase contains valuable cannabinoids rich in THC or CBD while the residue phase contains impurities and other undesirable high-molecular-weight byproducts the wiper rotates at several hundred rpms by the motor on the top of the unit and creates a thin film on the surface of the evaporator similar to the wiper blades on an automobile the evaporation of the crude oil makes the distillation process more effective and facilitates the transformation of liquid oil into a gas phase in this view we see the crude oil mixture entering the sidewall of the evaporator in this illustration the mixtures are composed of distillate and residue shown hypothetically as the letter D and are under very controlled temperature conditions the desirable distillate portion is heated to its boiling point which in turn vaporizes to four mccaf\u00e9 per the vapor phase molecules then returns to a liquid phase on the condenser which is at a lower temperature finally the distillate drips down the coils of the condenser and is pumped into the receiving vessel the residue flows down the side wall at the evaporator and is collected into another container the distance between the evaporator surface and the condenser is sometimes referred to as a short path which helps ensure product quality since the distillate is only in a vapour phase for a short period of time which reduces the chance of breakdown or oxidation in summary high purity cannabinoids are distilled from raw cannabis oil extract by selectively evaporating and recovering distillate phase using wiped thin film distillation the distillate fraction is often a brightly colored yellow solution that will also become solid at room temperature cannabis distillates are odor free high in purity and ideal for edibles and other medicinal products [Music]",

again yeah today I'd like to talk a little bit about cannabis in fact I came out here I have three different lists of notes that I wanted to talk about on videos and I went right to something completely different which is weed and let me just say first off that you know I've been disappointed with the legal cannabis industry I don't talk about cannabis very often at all but cannabis is a huge part of my life and has been for a long time I felt guilty talking about it years ago when I first started my channel because it was illegal and I thought I could get myself in trouble you know I had a bunch of plants growing even though I had a legal card to grow it I had a channel that was dedicated to growing just weed and I turned that into my philosophy Channel eventually but you know when I was smoking cannabis heavily when I was younger you know I learned a lot about it I was obsessed with it I mean I wrote about it in high school for my like junior report just out of my head didn't even really do any research I still got a beat but something's happened to the industry and this is what I figured would happen when it got legal am I surprised absolutely not but there is so much [ __ ] in the industry so I'm not here to talk about weed itself but to talk about all the [ __ ] and all the crap that's being sold to you as you know a lot of you are new to cannabis and cannabis is something that I've myself been smoking for about say 20 27 28 years now so I've been around and I've seen a lot of different cannabis a lot of different products and eased back over recent years on how much I smoke you know I've learned to really you know pace myself and I've learned a lot over the years about what works and what doesn't but the one thing that's and what inspired me to make this video well for example I actually had these capsules that I made a couple weeks ago now I took some old some cannabis that I'd grown in the past I processed it with a quiso method which is quick wash I suppose alcohol I'm not gonna go into detail but I did a quick wash i evaporated it off then I baked it in order to basically cook off it 240 degrees to cook off the you're what you're doing is decarboxylate in it you're converting the THC a into THC so it's orally available then I combined that with like half of coconut oil and made these little capsules and they're pretty strong I took two of them earlier to test it out and I was like wow and one of the beautiful things about capsules is that you have the whole plant extract when you do an extract like that now there are many different methods to doing extracts but then we have what here's what I buy in the store this little pen tip which is THC distillate okay it has a beautiful taste it's called Maui wowie I'm thoroughly disappointed with the fact that it's just a synthetic flavor and that's what you get usually when you're smoking this you know when you're buying these pens you're smoking synthetic terpenes or even if they're plant derived terpenes let me just kind of backtrack a little bit if you're not aware of what terpenes are whenever you smell cannabis the smell is the terpenes the smell are the different fruity smells the different berry smells citrus which is limonene or then you have mercy nor like the kind of nutty or nutmeg type smells so many different odors that you can get from cannabis and naturally there's an association with those odors as to the buzz in other words some lemon haze which is a nice sativa might give you a really cerebral enlightening buzz whereas some mercy and soaked you know heavy like spicy indica really dense nugs of some pure hashed plant might give you a really relaxed what they call a couch lock or a couch high but it's not that simple that's just like the general quick stoner you know yeah this is this is good for enlightening this is good for being low it doesn't work that way you go into the shop you can buy sativa you combine indica and sure you might be likely to have those effects but when you get into extracts you're talking about something totally different and that's the main point I wanted to make when plants in its whole form you're still getting a variety of different cannabinoids not just THC and CBD or even CBN and these capsules for example have a lot of CBN and CBM is only produced when cannabis gets old when cannabis starts to age certain molecules start to degrade into other molecules now before I go any further I'd like to talk briefly about why eating cannabis is different than smoking it when you smoke it you smoke it the THC is absorbed by the lungs it goes into the bloodstream and it has a short-lived effect an hour a couple hours few hours depending on how much you smoke and what you expect but when you eat it it takes about the same amount of time to come on as most people end up wearing off when you smoke it in other words it might take an hour or two in order to take effect when you eat it and when I eat these capsules it might take an hour to an hour and a half depending on how much I've eaten now each one of these capsules has about a hundred milligrams of THC and 100 milligrams of CBD combined but it also contains CBN because that was processed as a whole plant extract all the cannabinoids came out when it comes to this this is what they call it THC distillate that means that they basically reduce all of the plant material down to a perfect extract then they remove just the THC from that and then they what they call back blend terpenes which means they add flavors back to it and this is really the main premise of this video I'm very bothered by the fact that the cannabis industry has slightly just started pumping terpenes into th the distillate without anybody asking questions such as is this a synthetically derived extract like some of the raspberry ones are because it costs a fortune to extract you know a certain raspberry flavor so they do it synthetically are these synthetic compounds healthy to inhale but more than that I'm not as concerned about the health aspect as I am the fact that people are saying this is an indica hash pen and this is a sativa hash pen when the only difference is the flavor that they have added to it so here's what I'm saying we have two identical products you have one that's their most likely extracted from the exact same batch of cannabis because it doesn't matter what strain it is the sativa or indica aspect of it is by what they named it Maui wowie Northern Lights and they do this by adding certain flavors that they think would be conducive to that strain and the people say wow this is delicious it tastes really good Wow mmm-hmm it's like mango and and it's delicious it's very tropical I really like it it's delicious but the buzz flat and it all comes down to this it's placebo I believe that when you're blending terpenes into THC distillate any effect that's a sativa or indica like or high or low is placebo if it were as simple as just terpenes then that would change a lot of the foods we eat but it was also mean that you know do you really have to buy this for example could I just take any old THC and then smell some peppermint to get the same effect and believe me as an herbalist somebody who's fascinated with herbs and I love essential oils I've experimented with this tried to smoke cannabis and try smelling different essential oils because the same molecules you're absorbing into your bloodstream whether you're inhaling them or smoking them or consuming them and I would think that if you're smelling a very strong oil you'd probably inhale even more molecules than you would smoking it because some of them get destroyed in the process of vaporizing or smoking but well it's not getting to the technicalities of it we don't know and this is coming from a veteran stoner is that coffee over you know 27 years I mean that's not bragging rights that's something that I figure I'm obligated to talk about this this is important that I tell people that they're getting totally bullshitted by the industry and all I've talked about is just one little thing terpenes I haven't even gotten to the south the lotions that they want to you know that you can just rub it right on you'll be healed from all your internal illnesses I know they're not saying it that blatantly but basically people believe that they will be saved by rubbing CBD on their skin now look CBD and THC phenomenal phenomenal compounds rubbing them on your skin topically is only good if you have something that helps it absorb and that's why a lot of people use like arnica I believe you can honestly use essential oils but it's only good topically and what they call regionally or locally which means that if you have a sore muscle in one area sure you can rub itself and lotion on there you can include some CBD and THC whatever you want and that might help but really these things are being oversold and overplayed huge marketing companies are buying into this and giant companies are consolidating all of what we've always known is our comfortable little cannabis community I'm not surprised as I said it's just like what happened with looking alcohol for example look at what they've used to sell alcohol chicks and bikinis and speedboats and people happy and dancing and you know just this total [ __ ] idea that you're gonna be the socialite of the world go back and look at cigarettes you know I mean there's [ __ ] a there's a cigarette called cool in other people really believe that smoking cigarettes made you look cool and they were able to advertise to that and so my point being that anything that we do any substance we consume will be oh you know shown to be in some sort of a kind of you know I guess an association people will want to be like I'm I want to be like that I want to be that guy or that girl I want to be that cool person I want to smoke cigarettes I want to drink alcohol and with cannabis its they've turned it into the same thing and I've always been a respectable person when it comes to cannabis say look some people are predisposed to have psychotic episodes schizophrenia delusions depression severe anxiety these are people should not be using cannabis my opinion and people may say well you could use cannabis for anxiety it's great for anxiety look when you grow up and you smoked it for a really long time and you're really way where your anxiety comes from you might find that cannabis can make it worse it's all about the dosage and the right strain but today's cannabis is very strong and it does tend to lean towards just being very high potency THC cannabis which to me is kind of a disappointment because [ __ ] I love these things you know a couple of these capsules half CV half CBD half THC and then they've got the CBN and who knows what other cannabinoids I'm not I don't recall but I believe there's something like thirty to thirty five to forty five cannabinoids and in cannabis that lesser-known cannabinoids that we don't even understand how they work and many of these molecules can help us with it for example CBN it turns out is is the one that's really good for helping people with anxiety with eating problems or you know people who need to eat more build up an appetite and for sleeping and for pain the four main ones that a lot of people take cannabis for and the only way to get it is by aging your cannabis they haven't found a way to like convert anything to CBN in a hurry because it's an oxidation process that does take time so basically you leave your cannabis mi exposed to the air for like a year I would say a lot of the weed on the shelves in the stores is probably already there one of the things is that THC a converts them to THC over time naturally but they hurry it along by doing what I mentioned earlier the decarboxylation process but some of the cannabis I have is so old that you can probably just eat it as is it's already converted most of it over I make these caramels or did for a while that we're phenomenal it takes about 15 minutes to make them and the temperature all the conditions of making them means I can just take my cannabis put it in a crock pot make butter can take that butter strain it turn it right into these caramels and they cook just long enough to decarboxylate the cannabis the caramels and these things were really strong if you go in the store any buy candies usually they're regulated or any type of cannabis food it's usually regulated by milligrams and 10 milligrams is the average dose and if you buy a package they are usually 10 candies or 10 cookies whatever it might be and 10 milligrams each so in other words one of these capsules is the same strength as a package of ten candies that you buy in a store but it's great for people who don't consume a lot who don't know how to dose you know their proper dose in other words if a person who would never smoke cannabis before except two of these capsules like I did earlier they wouldn't even be able to top probably they you know it's it's we all adapt to the substances we consume and to me cannabis is nothing it's child's play if you will when it comes to drugs but I take it very seriously because I know that a lot of people take it too far and they smoke way too much and I take it as a very serious medicine something that's strong something that can overpower people so be cautious I'm gonna leave with that note don't abuse cannabis don't don't go out use it on the account that I'm mentioning it here I'm definitely not suggesting it's for anyone in particular I'm giving you my personal experience you know and I have to say that it's a harm reduction thing I want to see people use these substances safely and I've been saying that for a really long time and I'm really glad it despite all the things I mentioned the negatives about the industry even though they're selling weed with naked chicks it doesn't matter the fact is the fact is that people are generally using it responsibly there have been no major Rises and crime in fact crime is probably going down in many of the southern states when once they start legalizing and watch how this happens the cartels are going to lose ground what's happening now is the cartels are desperate down there they're trying to buy up houses and grow on the legal market as a cartel or as a group criminal group organizations they're trying to keep up because once it's legal there's no market for the crime anymore and that just shows you that the drug laws failed in this country and I've been saying that my whole life but I just felt like it was falling on deaf ears you know like Americans were just never gonna go for this but I always knew in my heart would legalize cannabis and I can't believe how [ __ ] far we've come and then last month they decriminalized mushrooms in Colorado or in Denver anyway I just Wow you know like things are really changing and to people who don't consume either of those they might think it may seem like the rantings of a druggie you know but I really don't care that's not how it is there are a lot of people who benefit from these substances in immense ways and cannabis is just one of many substances that should just be left alone and legalized I understand that we want a government to protect us from these dangerous drugs out there but you have to realize it's a it's a decision of adults to consume and if we are gonna ban substances which I don't believe we should I believe that at least we should leave the ones that are in their natural form completely alone that includes cannabis psychedelic mushrooms create them truffles things like this so um as far as the market goes it's gonna do what its gonna do we can't stop people from telling you that you know CBD is gonna cure your cancer overnight we can't stop the market from from you know people for example I had a company send me a product the other day and a lot of you might know my channel but I figured I mentioned it for those who didn't they guys sent me an email he said hey I have it because I have a separate CBD video that has like a hundred thousand views or something and I always get these emails about oh can you get good CBD products and I tell people the truth because it's called the CBD ripoff report and people are like you know yeah I've experienced this people are charging you know 50 bucks for 50 milligrams and all you know there's a lot of ripoff out there and then you have to wonder if even what they say is in the bottles in the bottle and a lot of them have been reported to not have the right content of CBD and then you find out CBG isolate doesn't work for [ __ ] on certain conditions and I know that's Greek to people who don't know the mechanics but put it this way CBD in its natural form in its plant in the plane within plant material or bud form with THC along with THC and other cannabinoids can have a much higher threshold of effect in other words a lot more can accumulate I guess in the bloodstream and and and have more of an effect on tumors this type of thing but when you take CBD by itself it's just nicely it hits a peak and it just drops off and that's it this was discovered recently about last year or the year before by a team of scientists in I believe Israel but you can look it up I don't want to get into the details but it's fascinating to me these are things that we need to realize that you need to know what forms you're taking so anyhow this company sent me this email saying we review this CBD product on your YouTube channel and I told them straight out I will but I'm gonna review it honestly and he told me it was a pure CBD product and when it got it is said hemp oil or hemp extract and I emailed him and he's like oh well it's the same thing it's just different because of its it is from this hemp and I just was ok I'll try it out tried it for a week didn't really notice anything I checked it out online and stuff was a hundred and twenty nine dollars a bottle look are you [ __ ] kidding me I'm sorry I don't care what company you are I don't care how good your [ __ ] product is if you're charging one hundred and thirty dollars for a product like that I'm just I'm dumbfounded I can't believe it it was less than a grams worth and yeah it is what it is people are gonna charge what they can charge I want to see people get this medicine people that need it I have had a ton of CBD cannabis at my disposal in the past and I gave it away to anybody who wanted it always because if you can benefit from this you know I want to see people benefit a friend of mine gave it to his dog in pain I gave it to my dog people have given it to their their dogs who had seizures and kids with seizures and helped them to illumine them and they're afraid to speak out because a lot of parents are using it illegally in states where they still won't accept these substances so really I'm a major cannabis advocate and I just wanted to get that out there if that ain't obvious already and and to know that you know for all the people who think that it just completely destroys your functionality you know [ __ ] I've been sitting here taping on this thing and before that I took to those capsules I mean put it this way you hear about the functional alcoholic and everybody has a friend who can drink and still like like you think if I drank that much wow I'd never be able to function it's nothing to be proud of it's the fact that a person knows their limits and when it comes to cannabis it's the same way once you've adapted to it we're smoking cigarettes if you've never smoked cigarettes and you have one you get a buzz you feel like [ __ ] my fall asleep or pass out well if you smoke cigarettes all the time it's just a normal part of your life and with cannabis it's the same and it's a matter of personal decision do you want that in your life and does it benefit you and what I'm saying is I don't want to encourage anyone to smoke cannabis who hasn't already somebody who doesn't know their body doesn't know their mind because it can actually hinder you and if you're not intelligent enough to know when to stop and no one to stop you stop yourself then you know use caution cannabis isn't very self limiting some people just smoke joint after joint and never stop I mean I can't give you an amount of what's normal I might smoke I guess if people were gonna ask I might smoke about a gram and a half to two grams a day myself maybe and that may seem like a lot to some people and others just like to say nothing of course you always hear these rappers talking about how they smoked a pound a day everyone was completely full of [ __ ] [ __ ] I just wanted to put that out there nobody smokes a pound a day and if you do your douchebag so nobody even smokes an ounce a day I mean you might be able to take an ounce of cannabis out and smoke it with all your friends but a pound of 16 ounces so I mean come on it's all talk anyhow I just wanted to get that out talk a little bit about cannabis I'm hoping I will get into my next video which is about muses amusement music but I'll still have that's about it I could talk about cannabis all night I have several books and about cannabis about growing the can of Bibles with all the different strains and I grew for many years I grew a strain called white shark which is my favorite ever and I'd love to talk about different smells of cannabis and textures and flavors forever but I really started out with that main point when I started making this the idea that those flavors that come natural in the plant I thank God I remembered this before because this is the main point I want to make really those flavors that come natural in the plant those terpenes it's my belief that those aren't what give you the effect so this is why back blending terpenes back into extract isn't the answer in my belief it's not that those terpenes combined with the THC or affect you because of them themselves but rather they are indicators that other cannabinoids are present within that plant so in other words a plant that tends to be more lemony might be a sativa one more spicy smelling might be an indica not always but that generally there's a lot of smells where you can generally tell smells and textures and it makes you wonder if it's something else in the plant that the terpenes are just indicators I hope you followed what I'm what I'm what I'm getting out here that even if you removed those terpenes from that plant those other molecules are the active ones because cannabis is so interesting nobody has been able to pin it down yet the whole industry has been trying to figure out they want to pretend they know but they don't know why certain buzzes occur with this strain and not this one because when you look in a lab report they have the same amount of THC same amount of CBD and then they try to extract both of these and/or all the cannabinoids and then isolate them and then they find out it doesn't work by itself it's not the same buzz it's not the same feeling ask any cannabis smoker you know what is the most well-rounded just kind of kick-ass high is it extract if you were gonna take one hit of extract or one one one bong ahead of really high-quality top-shelf cannabis the answer is obvious the high the helical if it was all about extract people would just smoke extract the high quality cannabis has something within it that is very undefinable difficult to replicate and I don't think my mother nature is gonna reveal her secrets all that easy so maybe it's just the all-around experience I don't know be well my friends peace and love thanks for listening to me ramble about cannabis be safe don't take any of my ramblings here is advice to start yourself that's all I gotta say be smart peace",

you're new here welcome uh i hope everybody's doing well and staying safe uh this review is not going to be as long as my normal reviews this is actually a product that i use on a regular basis uh regularly uh so i'm very familiar with this company they did not send this to me this is a product that i usually purchase uh my cbd haven uh they're d8 distillate carts uh i've already opened up the box because i got one of these out um to use it i bought three cartridges um it does they come with coas uh there's a coa just for the distillate and then there's a card here for law enforcement so that comes in the box uh it comes bubble wrapped and vac sealed you don't need to back seal these but they're vac sealed and wrapped the one thing i have to say about every time i order from my cbd haven fast super super fast ellie it comes in like two three days max and when you check your um your tracking it tells you a certain day i always usually get mine the day before so if it's this actually wasn't supposed to get here until today it got here yesterday um this product right here is a d8 distillate syringe uh on the coas it says uh 66 delta eight and it has a 0.6 uh cbn so it is delta 8 and cbn so this is a sedative sedative version of the delta 8 distillate like compared to say the rta that's got the cbc i get really uh big sativa effects from that one this one is more relaxed more chill uh definitely body effects i will show you guys how i personally use this to get what i need for physical uh anxiety relief the thing about these guys is three of these cost 54. three one gram syringes fifty four dollars i use this uh pretty regular this is my delta eight distillate go to company one because the quality is really good like i'll show you the syringes they're very uh the clarity is really clear on them they got a little bit of a rose tint to it but it's probably because of the cbn but they're fairly clear like they're not murky i've had some 60 dollar syringes that were very very murky and i've heard murky is bad i don't know i'm not a scientist but if somebody says murky is bad and then i'm getting something this clear or water clear but it was also a 60 it was a 50 syringe uh i won't go go back to that one but these are my regulars 54 for three like one single syringe is uh with no uh added terp flavors is twenty dollars nineteen ninety nine you can add terps to it and i think it's like another four dollars added to it but if you get the three syringes with the terps it's sixty dollars so that's twenty dollars for a one uh gram one milliliter syringe like that's a really really good price and i use this often it's a very clean product and at that price point you can't beat it uh you can put this okay we gotta explain this so i've explained it in my last one you have to run this in water uh to loosen it up because at room temperature it is very thick if you try to squeeze it just out of this it's got a screw on top you can put a they do include a tip like a little metal tip which i can't pop that out they include a metal tip which that can get clogged you can i'll explain that but you have to loosen this up with hot water now i'm going to explain to you guys how to do my uh my patented d8 smoothie this is how i usually take d8 distillate first off you're going to start with peanut butter you're going to take a small spoonful of peanut butter and you're going to eat it it's going to get all up in your mouth it's going to get all on your throat so you're going to be sitting what you're going to be eating this while you're going to be doing the other process then you're going to take a shot glass i make my own delts or my own cbd oils when i make batches i put it right back into the container the mct oil this is all my homemade cbd oil this bottle was 32 ounces i paid 20 dollars for this mct oil that's 32 or yeah 32 fluid ounces for that for 20 bucks and then i have this organic stuff that's 16 fluid ounces i also paid 20 for this so i got double the amount with that one but anyways i'll take two droppers of my cbd oil and i'll put it in the shot glass then i'll take the shot glass with the oil and i'll put it in the microwave for 40 to 45 seconds now while that's going you're going to take this syringe and you're gonna run it under hot water um until that the the microwave beeps when the microwave beeps you're gonna take this out and then unscrew this and you're gonna put the tiniest drop like a a grain of rice size do you want to start small if you've never used this stuff before because it is very potent like the slightest over kill drop will be noticeable it's a very noticeable difference so you put in there and you take like the back side of a spoon or a mental uh like a i use like to use metal to uh start around wait for it to cool you can use your finger to test it and then you're gonna take it like a pink you're going to put it under your tongue for 60 to 90 seconds sometimes i soak it longer uh you know when that's going on uh you take a i take usually take like a piece of tortilla and wipe out the inside all the residue because some of the delta 8 sticks to the inside of the shot glass because it's kind of so viscous get all that out now when i'm getting ready to swallow that i'll swallow the piece of tortilla with it so um that's my d8 smoothie um it usually because of the peanut butter and the added cbd oil it usually takes about an hour hour and a half to kick in but start light on your delta eight drop like work your way up because sometimes i got a little heavy uh thumbed one night and yeah i fell asleep and i slept like a cinder block under a stolen car you had to work to get me up out of there it's very potent so you want to start small that's my d8 smoothie and it's quite effective i feel usually when i do that i feel effects for about eight to ten hours so it to me that's effective but this is a solid solid product especially for that price fifty four dollars for three syringes always fast shipping uh like they're they're really great company their customer service is top notch they sent me a sticker this time finally i've like ordered from them like a bunch of times first time i got a sticker if yeah if you get my if you do send me something for reviews send me a sticker i really really like stickers i'm trying to deck out my laptop and cbd stickers but the packaging's plain nothing too crazy it's that's like typical syringe packaging you know the back it's got the delta eight i got i get the natural i've had the uh terps before um and they're really good but for me i like this one because i get the body effects the vapes is like a different story it doesn't even even if the vape itself says it has indica terps in it and it says indica on it usually it still gives me more or less a sativa effect if i'm vaping it or like say i put this on flour it's not my preferred method but i'll do it every once in a while um but this is such a good product for that price the shipping is super fast like i messed with this company hard uh they just started um dropping custom mix syringes their cbd cbg mix there's a delta 8 cbd cbg mix they're three milliliter syringes so um yeah there's three different mixes there's one that has a third of delta eight cbd cbg there's one that's cbd cbn or no cbd cbg and then there's a delta 50 50 delta 8 and cbd i need to try these mixes but they have a lot of distillates isolates they've got cbd isolate powders and all that jazz bath bombs they've got full spectrum distillates gummies uh cbd mints they've got a couple flower strains they've got a cbg flower strain they've got like sour space candy lifter bubba kush um but they're more or less distillate and isolates but they're solid company their prices are really good and the quality of this syringe is like top-notch uh i recommend this if you're like budget-friendly and you like your delta eight and they have different things like you can get uh there's a five milliliter five milliliter distillate syringe you can choose your uh weapon on that one as well your options are really good and if you ever have any problems with customer service they are quick to uh turn that around my order got messed up and i was literally sent another package like it arrived in two days from the time that i actually talked to him and said hey i have a problem and he was like don't worry we got another one coming out to you refunded my order and sent me out a whole nother order didn't have to do that i would have just been happy just to hey could you send me out which you forgot to send me and that was like that was the only time i've ever had anything with uh me ordering only problem i ever had and literally they resent the whole order that i ordered to me in two days all right that's some customer service if you're the person watching this video thank you dude that was solid i was over the moon i was like man he did not have to do that i was only expecting them to uh they shorted me uh a cartridge or yeah they shorted me two cartridges i ordered three they only sent me one and i was like uh i ordered three you only gave me one they were like oh okay they refunded it sent me three more like you didn't have to do that man you could have just sent me out the two i would have been i've been totally happy with it but this is a good product i know a lot of other people on the market that love these things and at twenty dollars uh for a natural they i wanna say it's like twenty five dollars with flavor for just one but you can't beat the three deal that knocks them down like eighteen dollars a syringe and this is a really good product like i like it i stand by it i put my seal of approval on it check them out go go look at them syringes if you like your delta 8 and you also like your money dude they're quality uh company i need to i need to try some of these mix uh syringes they look really really cool oh no and they've like they're gradually dropping more and more distillate uh things so there's always like a place where i i'd like to keep my eye at because they're dropping new syringes and new uh formulas and stuff but yes i definitely did i give this product a 10 like solid 10 especially at the price point you cannot beat it if you know a place cheaper with this good of product get order this product try this out and if you can find something cheaper blast me down in the comments oh dude and then i will buy that product and i will try it out and i'll compare the two but i stam i stand firm on that like i don't work for my cbd haven but i like that product that is something that i i want to let you guys know things that i use on the regular basis and that is something i use on a regular basis when i use delta 8 this is my usual delta 8 go to but i do like other ones like rta because the cbc and stuff like that everybody's got their own mix but a preference for me budget friendly and i'm trying to get rid of the body anxiety the shakes and stuff like that every time never fails it's good product can't beat that price but 10 solid 10. i mess with my cbd haven i am going to look into getting some of these mixed syringes and trying those out the cbdg distillate and the custom syringes try out the mixtures and see how those work i'm like really getting into like the other cannabinoids but the mix with the delta eight kind of really intrigues me like the cbc with the delta eight is really mind-blowing like it makes me feel like i open up a whole another side of my brain it's good stuff i want to look into more like edibles and stuff like that as well i'm actually looking into a company that does like fresh edibles and i'm looking into getting my hands on some of that stuff but look these guys up follow them on instagram uh show them some love uh but dude this is a definite if you want to try it out and you don't want to like blow like 60 on a syringe and then you end up not liking it you just spent 20 bucks somebody will like it and i honestly i don't think you won't like it if if if you like your cbd and your relaxation there dude straight up i i [ __ ] you not i i i throw you no shits well yeah i wanted to do a quick little review this is going to be a lot quicker than my normal reviews but i want to start doing this i want to show you guys more of the stuff that i use on the regular as well as the stuff that i do for reviews because now some of the stuff that i do use in the reviews i'm starting to use on the regular like the jupiter nights like never really mess that but now it's more of a frequent oh what am i going to puff on and it's boom right there and it's always it's been a go-to for me for like the past couple weeks so i want to show you guys what i've been using regularly and this is one of them and top-notch for that cost there are people on reddit that bad mouthful yeah it's too cheap it's too cheap like uh maybe uh homeboy over here at my cbd haven's not trying to rob people you know i'm not saying that everybody robs people but i don't some people are cheaper than others and then usually when something's like super cheap everybody throws us back to it they're like oh it's gotta be too good to be true too good to be true uh some people are aren't out there just to make make a quick book you know some people are overpriced some people are not it also depends on your formula too like rnt there's they have cbc a fair a fair amount of cbc in their formula and cbc is not cheap like i can justify that distillate because of the cbc involved in it cbc is not cheap at all if you look up just cbc tinctures and oils it's it's very pricey so when you go into like distillates and stuff like that you can price hunt and but people also you got to look at the formulas if you're like that's a lot look at the formula and see what's in it it's cbc is really expensive stuff but as far as just like a a delta 8 cbn formula this is there's a lot of basic just delta cbn formulas out there but this one i i've tried quite a few of them and i still always go back to this one because one the price and then the customer service awesome but yeah dude all right we'll make this quick um i got some uh i got some more delta eight stuff like delta honey sticks and stuff on the way so i'm gonna do those i still got the flower and everything i want to thank you guys for coming back and watching my video i hope you like this if there's anything that you want me to check out or like your go-to's or something like that and do a review of that product throw it down in the comments i'm always down to like check out other stuff so yeah um if you're trying to contact me you want

stuff we're just like shoot the [ __ ] you know um follow me on twitch we do those regularly so yeah i guess i'll see you guys in the next video so uh stay safe and uh stay up", "n89hueeyme4": "I want to get some special infused honey for the Pakistani desert that Fatima's gonna be making so I'm meeting up with David Bond villain who makes these really fantastic little infused honey Spears and he's gonna show us how to make them David we're gonna be having an infused Pakistani dinner and for the dessert we wanted to get a really special kind of infused honey because Pakistani desserts use honey and a lot of really tasty waves heck yeah so great let's do this we basically just takes some distillate so we got a bunch of CBD distillate here so basically four thousand milligrams of CBD is what we're working with yep and we mix agar into it and on the magnetic stirrer so agar is like a thickening agent right yeah it's like you know it keeps it more vegetarian so you're not using just regular gelatin I love those magnetic stirrer yeah they're cool we got AB organic kinky butter we will mix in the ghee and we'll give it a little more heat so now we have a good blend of our butter and Annapolis yep now we have some acacia honey and a little bit of sunflower lecithin what is the Leveson do it's an emulsifier so it helps everything bind together so into our ghee and our distillate we're gonna put a bunch of honey honey and then a little bit of that sunflower lecithin we like using sunflower because you can get non-gmo so now we just wait for this to warm up a bit and then that's our honey butter mix basically we mix that with a little bit of distilled water and agar once that's blended bring it to a quick boil let it cool and when it's at 120 degrees pull it up in a syringe and we drop it in the cold oil but as they go through to the bottom they'll cool they'll solidify we'll leave them in there for a minute pull them out of the oil so now we let them sit in there for a minute can I try one of these yeah grab one big guy you know honey smear mmm right yeah it's really Pleasant", "ZkiJLLvT4vQ": "welcome to true buds tv we're going to be making some can of sugar today and this recipe is very simple but the tincture itself that we're using takes some time but first and foremost we're going to do our two cups of our pure cane sugar and one cup of our tincture this is a two to one ratio a lot of people call this tincture green dragon as you can see it's got that nice color to it this tincture in particular is 35 milligrams per tablespoon so in the full eight ounces we're looking at about 560 milligrams for the whole batch the t check 2 helped me know this now if we use a stronger batch i did that was 131 milligrams per tablespoon we'd be looking at about 2 100 milligrams for the whole eight ounces so you can see the difference and you can see the importance of the t-check too to know the potency i'll put a link below if you want to check it out learn a little more i'll also put some videos showing how i use it as well but let's go ahead and put the oven on to 200 degrees once it's heated up we'll go ahead and add that in there the sugar and the tincture this is important you want to leave the door ajar 15 minutes or so will come back besides leaving a door jar you want to make sure you have good ventilation a fan blowing because it gives off some fumes and then we'll go stir it also important we want to make sure that we're being very careful especially if you're using a gas stove like myself a gas oven electrics recommended but i like to live dangerously so keep stirring it every 15 minutes so and then after the first 45 minutes i'll stir it about every 10 minutes so you'll see it keeps getting you know a little more grainy every 10 minutes or so come back and do it and the total amount of time that elapsed during this whole video here was about 2 hours and 45 minutes is how long i had it in the oven as you can see it's going to keep getting more grainy and grainy as it goes in longer and longer the total amount of time that elapsed in this video right here that i sped up is about two hours and 45 minutes then i went ahead and just strained it through just break it apart so it's nice and grainy and looks like sugar when it just started just a different darker color i hope you like this video and i'll put links below to all the videos you need to make this and some other videos that you might be interested in like how to make simple syrup which we'll be doing with this can of sugar thanks again for tuning in to true buds tv it's always good to have you here let me know how you like this recipe let me know what you want to see next you", "gDbrlCkDQSI": "yo yo yo what's good everybody bass drum kings your feeling neighborhood negro and welcome to my brand new magical butter kitchen in today's video guys i'm going to be showing you the easiest way to make a simple syrup and you know that is goodies 420 style so without any further ado let's go ahead and get into it let's do way all right guys so welcome to another great goodies 420 video the first thing i got to do is i got to let you know this video is being sponsored by magicalbutter.com use base drop keys to get 20 off your order with magicalbutter.com i want to thank them for sponsoring me in general but also sponsoring today's video if you're interested in getting one use base drop keys to get 20 off your order with magicalbutter.com all right guys so today we're going to be doing an update video i'm going to be showing you guys how to make a great easy simple syrup now the difference between this video and the last video that we did also by the way if you don't know whenever i say simple syrup that's the same thing as saying cannabis syrup thc lane it's the same exact thing if you didn't know all that is is an infused simple syrup the way that we're doing it this time we're actually going to be using a concentrate instead of the actual flowers in order to do it this right here is going to make it 100 times easier than before you guys know i try to give you all the information about a certain topic i already gave you all the information about making it with flowers now we're going to make it with a concentrate speaking about the concentrate what i'm using is distillate what's so great about distillate is it's already de-carved and ready to go so if you have some distillate you can eat it you can smoke it you can dab it it's great we're going to be using a lot of distillate going forward in the future because it is odorless and it's flavorless meaning that you can actually put it inside your drinks put it inside of your food and it doesn't have any flavor or any odor so it's not going to disturb or mess up anything or any recipe that you're trying to make so this right here is exactly what we want to use we want to use some distillate in order to make our simple syrup it's going to be way way way easier and like i said you don't have to worry about any of the hard stuff that we had to do last video as far as like straining and just dealing with the flowers in general this right here is a cleaner process right here and it's super easy now a couple of things that i want you to keep in consideration whenever we're using a distillate or concentrate if you don't have any distillate it's just fine i have already made a video showing you guys how to de-carb your concentrate as far as like dabs or shatter or anything like that i've already made a video showing you guys exactly how to de-carb your concentrate if you don't know how to do it i will put that link in the description and also i will put it ahead in the card up top but this particular distillate that i have right here this is actually 91 thc does that mean that it's 910 milligrams of thc right here like i was saying this is a great way to pack a punch as far as adding thc to whatever you're doing without affecting the smell of it or affecting the taste of it which is great and exactly what we want so we're going to go ahead and use this distillate right here in order to make our simple syrup but once again you can use any concentrates that you have all you have to do is decarb to concentrate and then you'll be ready to go check out the video of me showing you how to do that if you don't know how to do it let's go ahead and get to making this simple syrup here we go all right guys so when we're talking about making a simple syrup we're talking about doing a 101 ratio meaning that we're gonna use one cup of sugar and one cup of water one to one ratio that's how we're gonna do it if you're using brown sugar you don't wanna do it as far as volume like one cup to one cup you wanna do it as far as weight you want to get a scale and actually do gram for grams so if you do 50 grams of brown sugar you want to do 50 grams of water whenever you're doing brown sugar you want to do it by volume if you're doing it with this white sugar that you know is readily available in any grocery store then you can go ahead and do like one cup two cups or however it is that you want to do it equal parts no problem also what we're going to be using is we're going to be using some vegetable glycerin the reason why we're using this we need something for that thc to bind to and just with the sugar and the water it doesn't have anything to bind to so we're going to be using this as well so let's go ahead and do it it's pretty simple we're going to take our sugar one cup of sugar one cup of water [Music] and i have my trusty magical butter spatula right here we just want to stir this up right here and so now what we're going to do is i'm going to go ahead and cut on my hot plate right here [Music] and so we just stir that up a little bit great and so as far as how long that we want to do this we're going to bring this until it's almost going to start boiling you don't even need it to start boiling you just want to go ahead and warm this up so that everything in here will dissolve evenly and we're going to be good you don't even have to let it boil or anything it's super easy we just want to warm this up and you can tell when it's done because it's going to be clean here now what we're going to do is we're going to add in our glycerin this is just one tablespoon just so we can have something for this our thc to bind to so once our glycerin is in there we obviously have to put our distillate in there so let's go ahead and do that all right so once we have our distillate in there you just want to stir this up and make sure that it's combined well that is fully dissolved in here there we go it's pretty simple all right guys so this is what it's going to look like right before you bottle it as you can see everything is clear and everything's dissolved so let's go ahead and bottle it now all right guys so now it's finished the only thing that we have to do now is we have to go ahead and bottle it up so let's do it i got a nice bottle right here if you don't have a bottle or something like this you can always use one of these one dollar squeeze bottles they work great you see me use these on the channel in the past but i went and got this bottle right here so we're going to use this bottle right here just put the funnel on and pour it in [Music] all right so we have our simple syrup inside of our bottle let's go ahead and just put the lid on there so there it is that's how you make a great simple syrup using a concentrate it's pretty easy as you can tell right here the next thing that you want to do is you want to go ahead and just put this in your refrigerator and it will last for about four or five weeks no problem at all the reason why i wanted to make this is because we're going into the area now where i'm going to be making some infused drinks here on the channel and the main way that we're going to be medicating it is with our infused simple syrup right here and our tincture as well which you guys have seen us make right here on the channel before so that's it that's how easy it is to make a simple syrup so you can see how easy it is from the way that we did it before with the flowers and everything you can see how easy it is to do it with a concentrate especially if you're using distillate like we talked about before once again if you don't have any distillate you don't have any access to it all you have to do is decarb your concentrate i've already showed you how to do that click the link in the description it'll show you how to do that as well no problem decarb your concentrate and use it that way if you guys want the full blog of everything that you've seen today make sure you click the links in the description it's going to take you over to goodies420.com where i give you everything in detail also if you need vegetable glycerin i will put that in the description box as well you do need this in order for the thc to be able to bind to something if you just use uh just a sugar in the water there's nothing in there for it to bind to so you need something for it to bind to and that's what you're going to use your vegetable glycerin for we only use one tablespoon of vegetable glycerin so as you can see this recipe is pretty simple one cup of sugar one cup of water one tablespoon vegetable glycerin and we use one gram of distillate this right here is 910 milligrams of thc super easy no problem so that's it guys that's the easiest way to make an infused simple syrup i hope that this video helped you if it did please give me the thumbs up it really does help with the youtube algorithm and everything share it with your friends and also if my channel helps you please come and join the membership program here on the channel if you want to support me off of youtube please come and join the patreon we would love to have you over there also if i showed you how to do anything come over to goodies420.com and submit a post show everybody and myself exactly what i show you how to do so guys that's it thank you for everything until i see you guys the next time peace and goodies i'm out guys see ya", "fYMCA_Tg_vk": "Welcome to Endoca's beautiful organic\ncannabis fields. Come I'll show you Well, in order to make a good cannabis extract\nyou need good starting plant material. In my hand I have a cannabis plant it\nsmells fantastic. In order to make a nice extract you need to obviously dry the\nplant material first. Come let's go to the lab I'll show you how to make an\nextract. Welcome to Endoca. My name is Henry Vincente and today I will show you\nhow to cannabis extraction using ethanol We will use cannabis material which is\nthe leaves and the flowers all in one Very important to use organic so that you\nknow there is nothing inside that can harm you. There are over 4,000 different\nvarieties of cannabis now the one I chose has a lot of CBD inside. You could\napply the same method or what kind of cannabinoid eschews so called ethanol\ntake a ball put the plant material inside so the process has to be very\nfast. You don't want the ethanol to touch the plant material to a long time. If it\ndoes you get a lot of other stuff inside which you don't want. You just use enough\nethanol to cover so that we can separate the plant material from the cannabinoids. You need to be fast in this process because we can only stir for three\nminutes so I use a plastic spoon. You don't use mechanical devices because you\ndon't want to create a spark. If I create a spark now everything will burn. You mix\nwell then we have to separate the ethanol from the plant material. I do\nsimply by taking a sieve and put it in another Bowl. It can drip a little bit\nyou know there's still some alcohol left This was the first filtration now we're\ngoing to do the second filtration in order to remove the plant material you\nhave left, and we do that by using a simple coffee machine\nIt can heat your material and it can filtrate and we start with the\nfiltration part coffee filter, take your spoon you take now the material on the liquid\nand you pour it into the filter paper and you see the process starts. In order\nto accelerate the process we change the paper, every time a single filtration has\noccurred if you have more material you just continue until you don't have any\nmore, and like this and it's dripping beautifully. Now it's time to cook so\nwhen you cook at home you can use many different things I have here an example\nof a rice cooker which works fine a pot and a heating device works also fine and\na water distiller. Now my favorite is the water distiller because if you cook with\nany of these methods we need a cleanroom box like this for those of you who\ndoesn't have a box like this you can cook outside but to make it all easier\nlet's use the water distiller. Now this is the process where we separate the\nethanol from the cannabinoids. The time it will take for the full separation\ndepends of course of how much material you put inside I use a bowl to collect\nthe pure ethanol that's going to come out here because you can you reuse it\nagain and again we give it some juice and we wait so now the question is when\nto stop I can see I have 80% of my original ethanol volume so that's\nindication that it's time to see what's going on inside you open the lid slowly\nand look inside and you can see that is very little material in my case this is\nthe time to stop just to be sure not to breathe it here we go and be careful\nwhen you pour because there's very little material you don't want to lose\nit and now I'm going to show you the final step using the coffee machine what\nwe have to do is remove the remaining ethanol from our extract put it on the\nheating device turn it on and we wait best is to wait for 24 hours so that\nyou're sure that no ethanol is left I already did this and as you can see from\nall the work with it we have very little material the final test is a quality\ntest we do it by using a paperclip dipping it into the material and you use\na lighter you light it fast and see what happens if there is a spark you know there is \nstill ethanol left so you can see comparison see it's burning then you\nneed to put it back on the heater but in our case it was well done. To make a\ncannabis extract at home you need a lighter\nfilter coffee machine some small bowls, two bowls\nsieve plastic spoon coffee filters alcohol cannabis. Put the cannabis into\nthe bowl cover with cold alcohol steer three minutes with plastic spoon filter\nthe alcohol through the sieve filter again through the coffee filter it still\nuntil 80 percent of the initial alcohol volume is gone pour into a small ball\nhit the small ball with the coffee machine for 24 hours to remove the\nremaining alcohol. To check if there is any remaining alcohol use a small spoon\nand the lighter if there is any remaining alcohol the product will\nproduce sparks when burning with a lighter keep heating until you don't get\nany sparks anymore Enjoy your cannabis extract Stay tuned\nnext time I'm going to show you how to purify the extract and turn it into pure\ncannabinoids in my hand is 99% CBD beautiful crystals See you next time", "HjVnvEy-IkA": "what is going on welcome back to the I smoke Channel and another cannabis inspired video with me your host Tyler Greene today we're going to be covering diamonds and sauce versus shatter two forms of cannabis extract but what is the difference and how in fact are they similar those are the questions that we are going to be answering in today's video remember to hit that like and subscribe button if you are feeling these videos that helps us grow rich even more people and get our message out there so without further adieu let's talk diamonds and shatter I've got my Chuck B glass piece originating in the USA for today's video it's getting out of the Pelle case so I can show you what it looks like oh yes and we are gonna fill it with water you ready and here we go we are ready to kick off the video let's put this pillowcase away the old one 120 Pelle case what you need if you're traveling with your glass let's talk about the difference between shatter and diamonds and sauce we're gonna start with the most familiar form of extract that you've probably come across for ready it is shatter and this has been on the market since at least a few years ago but all the way people have been extracting cannabis going back to the last century recently shatter has become a much bigger thing lead partially due to the advent of medical legalization and recreational legalization in the States that is where this was first super popular and now extracts come in this form so what does she look like shatter can have different coloration but is generally gonna look a bit more stable than other forms of cannabis extract when you get shatter you will know it is shatter because it will literally shatter when you break it you can see from the way that it breaks although some of it may potentially be a little bit more sticky but basically shatter looks like this this is some lovely mimosa shatter we got beer 710 this is what shatter should look like if it is clean it might come in a different color look at the consistency look at the sort of golden hue and just just look at it guys you can see that that is some nice-looking chatter if it's tiny or if it has got too much chlorophyll or aged plant material eg trimming it it might be darker and you might see shatter that's like really dark almost black looking I wouldn't really want to dab that anymore but have done in the past how does it differ to diamonds and sauce well let's take you through what diamonds and silks of Diamonds themselves are almost pure THC a crystals basically 99 point something percent tetrahydrocannabinol where is the source is a mixture of Turks some cannabinoids and the flavonoids giving it this lovely rich flavor profile not being an extractor I don't know too much about the process of creating diamonds in source but the source is a really Turkey volatile cannabis extract that is on the other side of the spectrum to something like shatter shatter has a really nice stability to it although it may degrade into a more waxy like substance over time particularly when not refrigerated as those turps cannabinoids flavonoids begin to break down into a delicious extract soup that's when you'll see shatter waxing up diamonds and sauce basically is like honey sort of looking liquid the diamonds are the crystallization of that so that could happen when the extract has been left in a pressurized compartment over time it begins to crystallize and over the last few years the process has been honed and developed until we start seeing big thca crystals that look like rocks basically and that is diamonds and source I really like the flavor profile you get on this I think it's very hard to replicate the diamonds and sauce flavor profile in shatter or even in fact in other forms of cannabis extracts the more stable something is the less in my experience is the flavor some exploded in my mouth you know a lot whether it's with the Diamonds and sauces so volatile goes turps something which is unparalleled so this is some lemon skittles diamonds and sauce you might be familiar with the skittles strain skittles with that is a really popular Cali import strain lemon skills in their skills cross and this is the diamonds and source of that straight away I can tell you that out the to extract this one smells really nice this one smells about ten times nicer you get a little bit of the aroma with the shatter but with the diamonds and sauce it is really really stinky in a really lovely way for the lemon citrus the skills sweetness you know that fruity pebbles types or a sweetness I've got both of them in front of me I can smell this one and I can't smell this one diamonds and sauce is going to smell a bit stronger because of the volatile nature of the extract you know it's lighter pea sauce shatters a little bit more stable than that stability means that you can pick it up with your hand as you see with this shutter I can just pick it up and hold it and that is because it is nice and stable allowing me to do that without it breaking down I couldn't pick this up and hold it I'd get it sauce all over my hands and that would be a waste we need Abdul for that so that's a comparison between shatter and diamonds and source hopefully I haven't missed much out do feel free to add your input your insights in the comments section I think that people will be wondering what the difference is between the different forms of cannabis extract and Shatter versus diamonds and sauce is an interesting comparison should we dab some first of all we're gonna start with these shatter this is mimosa another really popular cannabis strain that I'm sure some of you would have heard of so you can say this is Shattuck is as I'm digging my dad's hole into it it's literally splintering off into little portions you need to be careful with shatter particularly when cold that you don't accidentally flick it off of your your parchment paper and onto the floor sometimes it can be harder to pick up with a dab tool than than with your fingers as this is proving because it's just not sticky we are ready to go live with this dab of mimosa shatter and I'll see you guys on the other side wow that mimosa flavor is delicious but I do find with shatter he's sort of got a very slight chattery taste to it so you sort of can taste the form of cannabis extract it is now a wonder whether that is actually the lack of volatile Terps meaning that it's not as flavorsome as other forms now there is also something to say about open-loop blasting versus closed-loop distilled butane both of these forms of extract are extracted using a solvent it looks like this it is called butane and it is the same gas as goes into your blow torches your clipper lighters etc obviously handling this stuff in an enclosed environment is dangerous it is extremely flammable that is why it is recommended that if you don't know what you're doing do not try this at home I've spoke to more than one extractor that has told me that they've had an accident in the past and it's not really a little accident when it involves things like explosions and fire so stay safe people there are safer ways to make your own extracts at home just look at rosin all right should we do a dab of the diamonds and sauce and see how it compares to that in the motor shaft that we just tried I think we should it isn't the best shape to dad till family in diamonds and source actually but I think we're gonna be able to to get your nights tab allows a these looks great guys we're about to do this tab right now and I'll see you on the other side tears folks [Music] wowsa oh man all the flavor got me that dad makes your eyes forward sometimes that was intense that was expansive that actually gave me the sweats guys been a long time since I got the sweats doing a DAB the flavor of the lemon skills diamonds and sauce is absolutely incredible through the coffin I was able to get that delicious sweetness you know just as it smells it tastes and I've been dabbing that all yesterday I'm really loving that flavor so which is my favorite out of diamonds and sauce and shatter it has gotta be the diamonds and source guys and girls it is a delicious form of cannabis extracts able to give me the sweat after all this dabbing that's pretty impressive and it is certainly particularly that version of it a winning flavor and dabbing experience shutter is nice but it's got that shattering flavor but I think with the Diamonds and sauce you get this like magical level of flavor that you don't really experience anywhere else saying that though with diamonds and sauce you definitely don't need a big dab those crystals of THC a are expansive and very very strong and I just experienced that from a normal-sized dad got me quite a bit high up and giving me the sweats which I don't mind it's been a while since a DAB has done that to me but what do you think of this video folks what is your favorite form of extract have you tried dabbing it they leave your comments below this has run on to 24 minutes of filming supposed to be in a three minute video that has been the video comparing the diamonds and sauce and the shutter that's it for the moment as always thanks for watching and keep token stepping on here rollercoaster going down but I never felt this high biggest right how the century [Music]", "sJBZ4ruZ0wY": "the market for CBD really isn't as much the plant material as it is the purified oils and the extracts that can come from the plant [Music] CBD is an acronym for one of the cannabinoids in the cannabis plant honestly as far as medicinal value all of the cannabinoids are medicinal but the association of THC is generally the fact that people use it to get high CBD does not get you high yet is known to relax you nine times out of ten the people that are using CBD really lead CBD medically elite focuses on CBD we do everything from breeding the seeds all the way to the extraction and purification process our products go through the gambit really from things that you could combust to skincare products I personally have been a cultivator since 1996 and so I've had a lifelong passion for the plant guy came from an IT security background ended up running one of the world's largest team of computer hackers and during that time I was still cultivating cannabis but the real birth of the company to where everybody quit their jobs and said this is what we're gonna do professionally was when Colorado legalized in 2014 our laboratory space is approximately 2,000 square feet it's in a former cleanroom environment all right so we start with stripped plant material and then we load that material into a column that crude extraction comes out as an oleoresin it goes from that into a alcohol bath and that basically precipitates all of the waxes fats lipids out of the solution and then we have to remove the alcohol from the oil in a rotary evaporator you're using controlled heat lots of vacuum and a condenser once it is through that process we fractionally distill the oil which removes impurities through a boiling point process and essentially the purified substance crashes out of solution it took us about 50 pounds of raw material to get to this one kilo of purified isolated it's basically organic chemistry 101 you're dealing with rotary evaporators you're dealing with Buechner funnels and vacuum assisted filtrations you're dealing with fractional distillation stills so yeah the labs pretty advanced especially for a cannabis industry the benefits of CBD are still being discovered on a daily basis you know generally speaking it's an anti-inflammatory and antispasmodic it's a neuro protectant people are using it for everything from breast cancer to epilepsy to aching joints and stress relief so we've seen CBD change people's perception of what cannabis is on a significant level I mean barring any unforeseen federal intervention I see the future of CBD as largely limitless right I don't even think CBD necessarily belongs in a dispensary environment I think the future of CBD is in everybody's home food and or medicine cabinets it'll become more and more commonplace as people realize what it is and what it can do for you [Music]", "7F-rOC4RUAA": "[Music] all right so we'll start with the ingredients main ingredient Betty Crocker milk chocolate brownie mix now this recipe calls for two eggs all right and then two ounces we're also gonna have someplace to put it all in makes it we're also gonna add fluent full spectrum cannabis oil concentrate now this dispensary it's one of my favorites see here this is THC 88.2 1:9 Wow and I see the name is battledore fluent they speak cannabis whenever I'm cooking this this normally is really hard to get out it's really concentrated so it always helps to put it in warm they could I normally just might crave a cup of hot water get it really nice and hot and just drop this bad boy in there for a good five minutes and come on up just like oil all right first things first you want to go ahead and preheat your oven to 350 degrees go ahead and spray your pan whoa whoa it's like that okay we have to read the hot water that's right hot in about five minutes and this time I decided to just put it in a little bowl put in the microwave for like about 10 seconds make sure you get time be careful getting that out of there it's very hot one way to tell that your product is ready is by looking at the little air bubbles you'll see that the air bowl will go up or down real fast all right so we have our concentrate and our vegetable oil we'll go ahead and dump this in there's 500 milligrams make some pretty potent brownies oh it smells it smells very good and you definitely want to let the oil cool down a little bit before you put it into the mix there's my eyes because you're putting eggs in there and you don't want to cook the eggs not yet one of the best things about coming with concentrate is it's essentially a oil and you can put it in anything anything can rise anything that use oil with you can mix it alright so now that we have our brownie mix inside the bowl we'll go ahead and get some eggs one that's two and asked for the recipe add three tablespoons of water now we have all this we'll go ahead and stir this or we'll give it one more mix ago we put it in there make sure it's all nicely evenly mixed because you don't want product that has a little bit here and a little bit there all right so he just makes us wrap around all right once you have everything makes well together should look like that nice and consistent you don't want to over beat it one of the advantages of using concentrate is that it already comes the carbonized so whenever you cook it it won't impact the THC in it whatsoever all right and we're about to go ahead and put this brownie mix into this pan and let the magic start all right now that we have everything here and in here all right we're all good to go all right so we'll just go ahead and get everything your ovens preheated to 350 we'll put it in here BAM all right now you should put it for 42 minutes if you're using a square pan like I am but just to be safe put it to 39 that's not a good time oh I think she's doing so it looks like it's sad 42 minutes right now see ain't it nice and cool now that we've allowed the brownies to cool now it's time to cut them up keep in mind that until we 500 milligrams of concentrate so what this means is that we'll divide it by how many pieces that we play [Music]", "b003uKiQXKo": "Hey all right it's been like a half-hour and no I wasn't pushing on like this part of it hard enough but I'm starting to make progress I'm starting to eat significant amounts of this of this distillate we're going to fly high tonight well I definitely am hopefully you are too you for watching this [Music] really push down hard no idea teeth at the end oh yeah look at a huge piece of right too yeah this syringes nearing the end very subtle but definitely like it's subtle but you know it's gonna be strong because I subtle with a strong aftertaste he know is gonna be good holy [ __ ] this reminds me of like that Seattle Waterstone syringe oil that you could just make edibles with put into your butter just like same kind of deal but I bet this that was only eighty-one percent THC yeah well I definitely believe I've done a statistically significant amount on camera where did I put the cap would want to put the cap on before putting this back in my pocket [ __ ] it leave it in the bag for now yeah and I could feel myself getting a little higher from the efforts from before so this is going to be a hell of a ride I'm hoping I'm hoping I got like 500 milligrams out of that like THC at least", "h_nEypnwdLs": "what's up you guys I'm about to show you the easiest way to make a cannabis tincture yourself at home if you have cannabis distillate at your disposal it's as easy as three three three all you need is three ingredients takes three steps and it should be about three minutes so the three ingredients are going to be is a high proof grain or ethyl alcohol this is a 151 proof so it's seventy five point five percent alcohol by volume I have a gram of some candyland distillate it's a nice sativa sounds delicious from vaping extracts Phoenix Arizona and I have a tincture bottle these are the only three things that you need okay I have an extra one which is a shot glass this is going to help me mix it I'm gonna make sure that it's mixed clearly you don't need it okay now now I've got my grain alcohol I'm going to add it in here I'm just gonna eyeball it for right now hopefully that's not too much because I have a thirty milliliters dropper I'm gonna actually use the tip of this dropper as a stirring stick alright so this is completely dissolved in here you can see the alcohol has turned a little bit yellowish when you do a picture with flower it's gonna be a lot more green so I'm going to transfer this by the dropper so that I don't waste anything alright this was so easy that I overthought the hell out of it and I kind of messed didn't go as smoothly as I hoped but we have a cannabis distillate tincture right here is fully infused it's ready to go was wonderful about the alcohol tincture is that you can add it to just about anything to put it on your skin you can have this thing right here you can put it in a spray bottle I actually got this idea from another youtuber something Canada labs or something like that you can put this in a spray bottle spray it into your mouth okay this takes getting medicated to the very next level and tinctures used to be the main form of ingesting cannabis before prohibition so it's a lot safer it's a lot cleaner this is freaking awesome here's about 15 milligrams it's all approximate I could have been a lot better myself that stuff is strong all right so it's best to actually probably put this in like a little bit of water to dilute it and you look at the effects but I think that the alcohol also helps your body absorb it faster this is overall really just a great thing to do here so next step with this for me is I'm gonna make the most delicious homemade from scratch you're gonna see a medicated soda you can make 450 milligrams worth of soda for like 20 bucks if you have the certain things it's gonna be great stay tuned like this", "EeCyvVgqSjc": "you welcome back YouTube so today I want to give you a little demonstration on how to basically make your own personal use capsules my biggest issue when I make a big batch of oil is like sometimes I really don't want edibles I don't want cookies I don't want any of it sometimes I just want to you know consume I will hey is it that hard it's really not so what I usually do is I get this little capsule machine you go to GNC or Vitamin World or any any health food store they sell these capsules and they also sell this press right here so the capsules cost like a dollar you got like 200 oh and this cost about $10 money well spent let me tell you so all you're gonna do is you take your capsules okay your tops you put your bottoms in this really can't get any easier and the best part about this is these friggin things work you you can make your oil as strong as you want and then you can really really hone in on how strong is my caps and you you can really master this so you get it all filled out and it'll come back in a set but say if you don't have one of these fancy presses which isn't that fancy or expensive but you just you know you're not gonna spend the money it's just you don't you don't see the point so you could what you could do is get a bowl of sugar and say you take your tops put your tops to the side and then you just stick the bottoms into the sugar or the salt and it works pretty perfectly you'll lose say if you do about a hundred you're probably gonna lose a good 15 in falling and just not just whatever but that's not that bad and on the other half you're gonna put your tops so what's gonna happen is we're gonna put or oil and then we're gonna spread it around it's gonna fill up the caps perfectly and then we're gonna put this top on and then squeeze and then when you squeeze they all perfectly become capsules it's amazing and the best part is you give it to one of your friends or or a different medical patient they're gonna look at you like you're just how did you do that so before you go any further you really want to make sure that each one has a capsule in it because if you miss I'm just gonna have oil everywhere and you get a waste of money and you're gonna be pissed so next you take your card so I'm gonna take it I'm gonna pour it in a center round a little square and it'll disperse around and the best part about this thing is if you do too much oil you just pour it right back into your glass so you just spread it around so a little excess oil that I got all right so now I'm gonna take my tops and I'm gonna sit it on top and this is where you really got to be focused when I say really got you focused I mean not really but just squeezed evenly is really what I'm trying to tell you so you're gonna take it and give it a nice squeeze make sure it's all in then boom got canvas castles oh now you can go to work boom boom boom you know no big deal and now ain't no big deal but they work they look great and this is exactly what we're going we're not going for half-assed you know edibles that kind of work like we want stuff that's gonna work so give me a little close-up well thanks guys for watching like how easy was that get yourself out there instead of making cookies or being boring with your oil do something different make some capsules and and you're gonna find that you love these things because I know I did but if you liked what you saw today don't forget to check me out on Instagram at the NJ chef and as always smoke [Music]", "n7cP6YWO_nc": "Hey guys, Nick with Precision here and\ntoday I'm gonna teach you a brief overview on how to make every extract\nunder the sun. So what I want to start off talking about is live resin and why\nlive resin is so relevant in the market and why you guys hear this this term\nbeing thrown around rather commonly. So live resin, the entire process really,\ntakes into account harvesting the plant while it's still technically \"alive\". So\nyou're harvesting the plant, you're not drying the plant, and what you're\nactually doing is taking those flowers and putting them into a vacuum type food\nsaver device and freezing them right away. So you can imagine like harvesting\nfresh blueberries or strawberries obviously you want to pick at the peak\nof ripeness, so that you have the maximum amount of terpenes, the maximum amount of smell, flavor and all the positive attributes of that plant. And you're\nactually freezing that in time by putting it into a freezer once you put\nit into the vacuum bag. Now it's very common for some people to deep freeze\nthat could be all the way down to -40C or -80C. I would say most commonly\nit's somewhere between -10C and -40C, so once we have this\nmaterial harvested and we have it frozen in vacuum bags - ultimately what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to extract it and we're going to extract it with\nhydrocarbons. The reason that we use hydrocarbons is because it's a very\ngentle process. The process of using hydrocarbons will actually take those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes out without disturbing a lot of the other\nplant-based matrices that are in there, and our result ultimately is a extract\nthat is very, very close to the native plant. So when you smell the extract of\nthe plant that we've extracted via a live resin process what will happen is\nyou'll actually smell the original orientation of that plant, it you'll have\nthose original flavors and they'll be extremely robust, extremely profound in\nthe way that you're actually smelling and almost tasting it when you consume\nthe product. Now the best analogy is if we keep that\nfreshness preserved we eliminate the oxidation, the degradation, and all the\nthings that can kind of take that \"fresh fruit\" so to speak or that \"fresh cannabis\"\nand turn it into rotten cannabis so to speak or rotten fruit. And that's\noxidation, that's degradation from the environment that could be disruption or\ndegradation from high temperature solvents. So with live resin were always\nfocused on preserving that natural state of the plant. We're focused on freezing\nthat biomass right away, and we're focused on ultimately extracting it at\nvery cold temperatures to retain our terpenes, to extract the cannabinoids in\na very gentle fashion, and ultimately to have a highly, highly desired end product\nthat's artisanal and a vast majority of consumers enjoy in terms of theirs their\nsatisfaction of consumption as well as their ability to just actually taste and\nsmell the product once it's been on the shelf for a while. So that's just an\noverview on live resin and the next thing I'd really like to talk about and\ngive you guys an overview on is shatter. So you may have seen shatter in the\nretail dispensaries and things like that and ultimately with shatter we're trying\nto get that end product from a sort of a plant-based entrapment of those\ncannabinoids and those terpenes to a glass-like finish. So it's very common at\nroom temperature for shatter you hit it and it'll shatter almost like a piece of\nglass. To get that consistency there's certain aspects of extraction, certain\nthings that you want to deal with. Shatter first and foremost is always\nmade with hydrocarbon, and the preparation of the biomass is almost\nalways under every circumstance dried very, very, very, very well almost to a\nfive percent or lower humidity. We want to avoid a lot of that water that would\nbe pulled out with the solvent, and we ultimately want to extract that product\nat a cold temperature in order to avoid a lot of the lipids and fat profiles\nthat you might create by extracting with a warmer temperature solvent. Hydrocarbon is obviously ideal for this because not only can we extract with hydrocarbon\ncold but it's hydrophobic so that the water is going to be separated very\neasily from the hydrocarbon, but in addition to that it's going to extract\nthat cannabinoid profile and it'll extract those terpenes with leaving\nbehind,  because of the cold temperature, a lot of those fats, waxes, and other\nadulterants that we don't want in our end product. So when making shatter are\nultimately extracting the dry biomass with the cold solvent we're going to\ntake that to a finishing process which is called vacuum oven purging. So once we\nhave our shatter and we want to vacuum oven purge it, what we do is we we spread\nthis out on vacuum oven trays and we go into a very low vacuum, very deep vacuum\nwith a mild temperature increase from atmospheric. So a temperature increase\ndepending on methodologies it ranges vary widely depending an operator but it\ncould be anywhere from 75 Fahrenheit to will say 105 degrees Fahrenheit would be\na common operational range, and we're always trying to get to a very deep\nvacuum we're talking about 28-29 inches of mercury - very, very deep in terms of\nbeing able to purge out those residual solvents. So not only do we have a\nsolvent free product but purging out the residual solvents and the terpenes is\nalso going to take away some of that some of that added viscosity and\nreally get that product to the point where it's like a glass-like consistency.\nAnd we commonly call those as they're coming out of the oven \"slabs\", sometimes\nthey look like Swiss cheese, sometimes they'll they'll be you know a perfect\nslab of glass, sometimes they'll flip over. And it can vary between a\ncomplete glass-like type consistency and it can also vary to you know sort of\nlike Jolly Rancher or warm Jolly Rancher type consistency - but the good part about\nthis process is to make shatter using hydrocarbon you can generally\nstill make a very good end product on biomass that's been properly dried\nproperly preserved even though it does have maybe a little bit of degradation\nit does have a little bit of oxidation of the cannabinoids and loss of the\nterpenes it's okay because you can still make a very very credible saleable\nproduct that's widely consumed in the form of shatter. And optimizing that\nprocess as a way that you can create a lot of revenue for your\nextraction company. So the next thing that I'd like to talk about is diamonds.\nTerp sauce. There's all sorts of crazy names, \"the sauce\" -  that they coined for\nthis type of extract and really what we're after on this type of extract is\nterpene preservation. So it starts off very much like a live resin\nprocess in the fact that we're harvesting these these buds or these\nflowers in a live state, we're freezing them, and we're ultimately preserving\nthose terpenes. Because terpenes are very volatile compounds in general. Too much\nheat they evaporate and they get degraded by heat, they get degraded by processes, they\nget degraded by solvent - so we want to use a very light solvent, like a light\nhydrocarbon, and in this case mostly moving towards a propane dominant blend. Propane has a much lower boiling point which means it's much more volatile in\nterms of removing it from the end product - easier to remove from the end\nproduct is another way to word that. So ultimately extracting this\nlive resin like prepared biomass with a propane dominant or a lighter\nhydrocarbon dominant blend at low temperatures and ultimately what we end\nup with is we end up with this extract that really becomes a sort of miscella of the cannabinoids but also a very amount high amount of terpene\ncontent. And as I stated before the terpenes are quite volatile and any sort\nof heat, any sort of degradation, even just being an atmosphere for too long\ncan degrade those terpenes. So imagine this kind of cannabinoid and terpenes\nsludge coming out of the machine because we've preserved them up to that point.\nImmediately usually what's done with sauce and live resin is you're taking\nthe terpenes and generally spinning them off in a classified centrifuge. The\nreason we use the classified centrifuge is because there's still a little bit of\nsolvent in there, so we just want to be cautious, but what that ultimately does\nis it spins off the terpenes and it separates a terpene layer from the\ncannabinoid layer. You separate those two now there's a variety of different\nproduction processes that go back into this. In some cases if you're if you're\ndoing crystallization you can leave a little bit of solvent in there and you\ncan ultimately recrystallize the THC-a through a supersaturation method.\nYou can ultimately take the cannabinoids off from that terpene fraction and\ndecarboxylate the cannabinoids and then add the terpenes back in - and that's how\nyou make live resin pens. So for example you know once that decarboxylated\ncannabinoid profile is there you take your original terpenes blend them back\nin and it's going to give you the viscosity in order for the pen or the\nvape cartridge to be able to uptake and atomized that extract. And make, again\nthis is an extract that is absolutely in line with the original orientation of\nthe plant, the original smells, flavors terpenes, and the uniqueness. It's very\ncool because you have such variety within these plants and to capture the\nnative essence of that plant and to reconstitute it and to several\nconsumable forms is a massive value add for an extraction business. And if you\nlook at some of the best extraction companies in the world that do this, this\nis exactly what they do and this is exactly how they do it. So on the flip\nside of what we've spoken about here which has mainly been artisanal\ntype extracts and hydrocarbon extracts. Let's talk about crude oil, let's talk\nabout distillate, let's talk about the high-value type extracts. So crude oil is\nexactly what it sounds if you think about crude oil coming out of the ground\nin like petrochemicals or something like that.\nIt's an oil that has a lot of adulterants in it. It needs a lot of\nrefinement. It needs to go through further processes in order to be\nconsumable or in a consumable form. So what we're looking for with crude oil\non an extraction is really any type of biomass but preferred dried biomass\nlow-grade biomass that can be purchased cheap and ultimately refined into\nsomething of high value. So if we've got for example you know a thousand pounds\nof biomass sitting it's been sitting for six months, we're not going to be able to\nmake really a credible shatter product out of that, we're not going to be able\nto make a credible live resin, definitely not going to be able to make any sort of\nhigh terpene extract or anything out of that. But what we can do is we can\nmaximize the extraction of the cannabinoids out of that biomass with a generally\nwarmer solvent - of course there's ways that you can do it with a cold solvent.\nAnd this can be done with hydrocarbon or ethanol. This is where ethanol becomes\nreally applicable it becomes really easy it becomes really user friendly and\ncost-conscious. And this is where you can still use hydrocarbon but not as\nefficient of a method as ethanol for bulk crude oil. So what we actually do is\nwe take our biomass we load it in and we'll saturate it with ethanol for\na given amount of time. Ultimately we take that miscella stream is what we\ncall it which is the cannabinoids and all the other stuff that comes out of\nthe plant along with the solvent and we evaporate that solvent off. Once that\nsolvents evaporated off ultimately we have our crude oil. Now this crude oil\nhas got all sorts of chlorophyll and whatever came along with the plant and\nany sort of adulterants in there. Generally it'll have a lot of fats, waxes,\nand lipids in there that generally come out of the plant in extraction. So\nthere's a variety of refinement processes. One of the most common\nprocesses to refine is to get to distillate and that's what I'd like to\nchat about next. So let's talk about guys how that distillate actually gets made.\nNow distillate is a process that's made through distillation so quite commonly\nor to break it down in really simple terms if you're putting a pot of water\non the stove and ultimately that water is boiling and turning into vapor - \nthat's a process of distillation. That water is being distilled into the\natmosphere in the form of vapors. So that's exactly what we're trying to do\nwith the cannabinoids in the crude oil. We're actually trying to take those\ncannabinoids, we're trying to vaporize them, and ultimately we're going to\nrecollect them in a more concentrated form. But before we can distill there's\nseveral other things we need to do. We need to make sure that there's no\nadulterants in that distillate or in that crude oil that are going to inhibit\nmaking the distillate. So those things can be waxes, they can be chlorophylls,\nthey can be fats, lipids, all sorts of weird stuff that can come over in a very\nrough crude extraction. The way that we refine that is we commonly\nuse winterization processes, we also commonly use fine filtration, there's\nguys that use what are called adsorbent - which could be diatomaceous earth or\nactivated carbons in order to clean up some of these undesirables from this\ncrude oil in order to make it into distillate. But ultimately once it's\npassed through a distillation process it's normally used a what's called a\nfractional distillation, or a wiped film distillation process when you're at\nscale. We're taking those cannabinoids and we're evaporating them and we're re-concentrating them. So what happens is we take this very, very poor quality\nbiomass, turn it into a really rough crude oil, but ultimately extract the\nwe'll call it \"the goodies\" - but the cannabinoids out of that crude oil and\nconcentrate them in a very refined format. That can be remixed in and\nreconstituted into several different products. This process is awesome because it can literally take any grade of biomass and turn it into a shelf-stable,\nreplicatable, scalable, repeatable product that has a consistency across the board\nfor end-users expectations. For example, you get Pepsi every time it tastes like\nPepsi every time you don't want it to taste like Coke one time or taste like\nyou know RC Cola the next time. You want consistency and a repeatable fashion for\nwhich to make your product. So last product that I want to talk about is\nisolates and isolates are made from actually in almost all cases distillate.\nSo we're taking this crude oil remember as we spoke about with distillate,\nrefining it into a distilled product. So we have this distilled product and the\npotency of that can be anywhere from say a little very low-end 75 percent on the very high-end 95 percent - but it's not 100% pure. And what\nwe're gonna do with that distillate is we're actually going to go through a\nsecondary refinement process called crystallization, isolation of\nthese individual cannabinoids. So each one of these cannabinoids has a\nmolecular structure and based upon what that molecular structure looks like we\ncan come up with ideal ways to actually crystallize and crash out of solution\nthese individual molecules. This is a very common process in chemistry. It's\nused very widely and it's ultimately how CBD isolate is made, it's ultimately how\nTHCA diamonds are made, it's a process of crystallization. So how we do that is\nwe use a selective solvent the selective solvent most often used is hydrocarbon.\nVery often it's either butane or pentane in order to make these isolates.\nAnd what happens is you actually take your distillate and you mix it into\neither the pentane or the butane if it's THCA depending on what you're trying to\ndo and you have your distillate or your fine cannabinoids back in matrices at\nthat point it's back in that now that miscella of hydrocarbon and\ncannabinoids. And what happens is over time and over a temperature ramp spike\ncurve and over a slow period of time these cannabinoids will start\nto actually crystallize. And they'll form one little crystal and it will grow upon\nitself. As we reduce the saturation of the solvent they actually fall out of\nsolution. So what will happen is you'll almost see like rock candy or crystal-like formation growing. Once those crystals are fully formed they can be\nharvested and once you optimize this process you actually have nearly 100%\npurity on any given compound. Now there can be adulterants you know that gets\nstuck on the crystals that need to be washed off but in ideal state this is\nsomething that you can refine up to say a good benchmark is 99 to 99.5 percent\nif you're a really good chemist you can get it up close to 99.7 to 99.9. This is where that last little bits very, very\nhard to get, but there is ways to do that. So if we look at you know the the world\nof cannabinoids in conclusion. There's several different ways to make extracts.\nThere's a lot of different ways to make very, very viable market products. There's\na lot of ways to drive revenue in your extraction business with these products.\nUnderstanding this knowledge base and understanding how you're going to occupy\neach one of these market niches, what access to biomass you have, what\ndiversity and methodology do you have in order to create these products and\nultimately drive diversity and revenue in your in your business. And then really\ntaking that to the next step and taking the next level of understanding of how\nto create these products. That's something that we do here all day long\nat Precision. We absolutely understand all these processes very intimately. We\nhave a very robust team of install / integrators that\noptimize these processes, so again not just selling you the pieces of equipment\nbut actually coming out training you on these processes, sitting there with the\npieces of equipment with you in order to get these processes integrated until\nyour business is up and running and on legs.\nSo in conclusion, a tremendous opportunity ,I hope you enjoyed the video, and thanks for joining us .We really look forward to seeing you again.", "L1eSRXl3Des": "[Music] hello this is Jimmy from Green Wave channel and this channel is mainly focusing on the cannabis industry and we're going to update this channel at least once a week and bringing you the latest and the best method that were using right now in this industry so today we're going to talk about the short pass this relation because strip a distillation is really popular right now it's taking a hit um when is that first of all it is because the cannabis oil is very popular right now people use canvas canvas or your in different way that they can infuse them into the water making a CPD water th the water and they can also infuse them into bakeries for example like our brownies chocolates and they're easy and easy to digest and they're taking a hit and it is kind of a lifestyle right now and to take those CBD water so it creates a large demands for the markets a lot of supplier a lot of bakery they're asking to try to purchase the CBD oil and it creates a huge developer shop has as well because shop has make for special oil as we know so in this video we are going to explain the theory behind the shrub has distillation so we are not going to do her participation demonstration in this studio because in here we require state license to run the cannabis processing and I don't have a license in this studio but I will have another video coming out next week to demonstrate the full process of the I'll pass distillation in licensed facility close to me please stay tuned and click on the subscribe button and we will have their video ready for you in about a week so let's talk about ultra pass so short pass distillation first of all so let's explain the theory of distillation what is this Latian I summarized the distillation as it is a chemical processing that can increase the purity of your targets contents by heating and cooling so we require we have heating and cooling in in the distillation process and how it worked I designed a small experiment in my in this studio and without this vide and you see using the regular stuff that we see in our life and demonstrate what is the distillation for you ok so we have we have a M people here across crossbow and we have a half note and water and vegetable oil and this is wd-40 I think and this is what we call just like kitchen kitchen waste just like waste so pear see here its contents right here symbolize one thing in the cannabis industry so as we know in order to have a full spectrum oil we need to get a crude oil first so crude oil you can get Croyle from extraction you have a lot of methods of extraction that would be another whole new topic that we're going to cover on in the next video so luckily I pick up this one in the cannabis trade show and this is a full chemical contents that might appear in the cannabis industry we have CBD THC family here we have the chirping Padma here so we have the solvents the residue and also everything else just everything else everything use use you will my met in the cannabis industry you will see in these charts so each contents they have different boiling temperature for example the solvent one they have lower lower profit m per around from sixty degrees C 200 degree of C and the disability they have a higher from 150 to 200 Anthropy lower proteins between the solvent and the simply they take the usually they boil at about 130 degree C okay so remember as I mentioned we are using degrees Celsius in this channel because it's more predictable more easier to remember and that's right now I think it's the industry standard to use degree Celsius okay so each one each one in here represent the cannabis contest so let me explain for you so we have one from your left to right we have ethanol water vegetable oil wd-40 which is synthetic oil and this is the waste so from your left right we have we are renting then with the boiling temperature so this is the lowest boiling temperature and this is the highest Pony temperature so distillation is method that you separate each content by using playing with the temperature for example that know the usually they come on there boy at sixty six sixty seventy eighty depends on the concentration of the of your ethanol but usually is much lower than water and so we have water which you know the Boy Wonder we have vegetable oil this one is peanut oil it will boil about 210 this one is the synthetic oil this is the brief 40 wd-40 which will be higher than vegetal oil but still I have about 250 to 300 this is the kitchen kitchen waste this is not liquid it's like small particles and it cannot boil but because it's not liquid so it will just get burned okay so this is has a really really high for the temperature okay so we mix them together so we mix them into this giant glass bowl so where some water ethanol and we have for you here this is switch the boil Wow okay this is wd-40 [Music] okay and we have the kitchen waste so we everything right now in here so this will be your crude oil for your cannabis so now you have your mixture which will represent the kind of a soil what we call crude oil and we are going to put it in the hot surface to heat it up okay for not in my studio I'm not going to hit up I know exactly what what is gonna happens I'm just going to explain walk you through and what we happen okay so once this mixture reached 60 degrees Celsius the ethanol will just be coming there will be there will be boiling and they will become repressed so the vapor will come out once you place a surface on the top the whipper will hit the whole surface and became and dripping down through this slope you measure their your surface as a slope okay and then you place a container at the end of the slope so that the ethanol will just drip down to this bottle and you will collect the a bottle of ethanol just weak recycled ethanol from this mixture okay next one is the water right so as soon as this container reached 100 degree Celsius it will become the water would become repriced same as ethanol it will condense in this closed surface and drip down to this cup okay that's what will be the a vegetable oil right so as remember that which the boy are bowling at 220 degree around there and CBD and THC also bowling at that temperature okay but somebody wants media somebody wants you see but they are so similar the body temperature so similar and it's very hard to separate them using these rapid rapid deceleration I'm not recommending using a shop has to separate them if we only separate that we can do that but in a much better because they will call a wife room equipment why few distillation which we I will talk about later because them are she have a better efficiency have a pattern welcome as well and I will introduce you to that one in two weeks okay now we are reaching 200 degree C the CBD and THC all those oil will be coming coming out and then condense also drip down to this bottle and you will have your CBD and GC combined and this one so after that what's remaining would be the waste in cannabis to industry the waste will means that the way the wax that you didn't carried off in the previous processing also the sugar and the some small particle of the cannabis leaf which is smaller than your filtration system okay so you have all of them in here so there was another very important thing in store pass one important factor that is vector you need to have a good vacuum during the process there are two reason that you want to keep a good worker okay first is you want to cut the loss of the processing okay if you're running this heating and cooling in an open atmosphere the vapor your CBD and THC vaporized they will go around your room you know that we are selling the full-spectrum audio by Graham in the market right now it's about eight to nine dollar program difference they have different price so you might lost a few thousand dollar for this one went wrong if you're running without a vacuum and the second is that the vacuum can lower the boiling temperature of your target contents okay for example vegetable oil they usually the boil at 200 300 degrees Celsius but if you're running if you are hitting them in the rectum for example like 20 Pascal it will reduce to 130 to 170 degree Celsius in that range it depends on the what exactly or you you have because it's running sporting a lower temperature it actually is beneficial for you first of all you don't need to hit that high temperature to get all the harvesting or the likes abilities you want a second it will protect your material okay for example the sugar and the wax a high temperature for example at 2,000 degrees Celsius this to contest sugar wax do will burn and damage your glassware severely okay I have experience with that trust me that those stuff is really hard to carry it off it will also damage your yachts at that high temperature so if you're running low pass a high temperature which means your webcam is bad so data back engage check your back and running below 200 degree Celsius okay so I think that would be all the content that I would like to share with the capacity if you have any question please mess with me I would try my best to answer discretion if I have talked something that is using is not correct also please correct me we are in the process of learning and sharing so as I mentioned next video will be we were heading to facility that's a license so we are going to show you what a short pass in the production would be looks like and what's the second are using and what's the yeah they're there they're getting okay so please subscribes and click on the

edibles yes yes yes we are I have got three grams of distillate to put in to our edibles this came from underground reserve there are no terpenes in it so you won't be able to taste it and it's going to make some delicious edibles and by delicious I mean they're going to taste just like fruity pebbles but they're gonna be about 200 milligrams apiece so these are going to be potent that's exactly what I wanted though so alright guys so the instructions are three tablespoons of butter so let me measure out three here one two three and this is gonna go into my double boiler pot all right we're gonna let that melt down and once it melts down I'm going to put the distillate in the butter I'm gonna let the distillate set on the warm stove maybe it'll help soften it up a little bit all right guys when this is melted I'll be right back so the butter is melted and I'm going to put the distillate in it now oh man that's a lot of distillate Jimmy that is melted it first yeah okay so I'm doing this I'm realizing I should have melted this first yeah what would have been a lot easier but lesson learned we doing this right guys so I have all of that mixed together and mounted very well so I'm going to get the marshmallows and I'm going to get the spatula marshmallow back and Bachelet and we're going to attempt to melt all together all right guys I'll be back in just a second to show you how it's looking all right you guys so we have melted all the marshmallows so in goes and 11 ounce box of fruity hetal's and you want to start quick cause it's a mess [Music] I'm gonna do mine in some trays light coating a light coating of cooking spray guys so I'm gonna be back after I get these all portioned out and whatnot so give me just a minute okay so they are done don't they look delicious I've got 12 more in the freezer and they're gonna be delicious I hope you guys enjoyed the video if you did please give it a thumbs up if you like these kind of videos in general please consider subscribing it doesn't cost you anything and it always puts a smile on my face so thank you guys for watching I hope you have a great day by the way these are going to be about 150 milligrams apiece

ganja guys and this is an eight delta eight product that we about to show you guys but this one is really not to smoke this is a syringe guys okay take a look at that right now y'all see that so i know in my past videos i mentioned syringes people didn't know what the heck i was talking about uh yeah they're syringes but this is not a syringe that you shoot in your arm people okay it's just that they put it in the syringe to make it easier for you to get this lit up all right so with that being said there's different ways you can use this you can put it on top of flour you can put it under your tongue you could put it in a juice water wine however you want to do it uh but for me today i'm gonna use it as a dab so i got my candy pin all right and guys i'm gonna tell you now i never tried this so this is supposed to be it in its periods form this one has no added terms so let's open it up and get a good look at it and yes this is straight off the doctor ganja site guys and all you got to do type in smoke.dad check out all right save yourself some bucks [Music] i don't really want to damage the label just in case there's something that we need to read on there so what i did i took the label completely off all right so here we go we're going to open it up oh i like that it's held by a magnet too got a magnet okay guys so here we go this is the syringe as you guys can see and this bad boy is almost as clear as water now there's a thing going around i'm hearing that if it's murky it's bad this thing here is looking pretty clear all right so let me show you what else came inside here now this is the tip if i could get it up all right here we go all right guys so this is the tip this is your tip piece and i'm guessing just like the doctor do you screw that on there which i'm going to demonstrate give me one second i don't want to mess nothing up here all right here we go so all you do screw that off like that [Music] oh okay so now that we have the top piece removed we're going to insert the tip wait a minute that ain't sound right guys that ain't sound right insert the tip all right guys here we go okay so we got the tip inserted yeah see and it sure does look just like i was gonna go but i'm not and they said this needed to be kind of preheated so i'm going to preheat this for a moment just to make sure i can get it out of there this is my first time using one of these i've seen them on the market this is not just for delta eight it's for regular cvd uh whatever i'm not too sure what else they put inside here but i tell you i'm definitely going to try this dough to eat in there but for me like i said i got this candy pin off of my other super store the calm leaf and guys let's get ready let me take this off here [Music] i think i need another piece here i'm gonna make sure i got everything okay here we go guys sorry about that we have to change a few things [Music] so now what i wanted to do is get my coils out i was gonna use this ceramic chamber but i actually like using the coils they burn better they burn quicker and you have less product that you have to clean up so now that we have that piece on now okay first thing i'm gonna do i'm just gonna drop a few inside before i even turn it on see this is really really thick guys really thick that's why i say use it as a dab i'm gonna heat it up some more just to get it flowing let's see this stuff is really thick there it is it's out though and if you have a dab rig i'm telling you you really could go to town with that you really could go to town with that so i'm gonna close this up now that i got what i need inside let me just tighten it up all right let's turn this on one two three [Music] wow this is the truth listen no games being played here look at my forehead right hold on [Music] wow amazing wow taking it like that it was like instant boom i like it like that guys [Music] okay i think that's it because i only put a little drop so i'm not really getting nothing else out of here [Music] whoa i was wrong wow jesus okay now this thing stuck in my throat now this is also good for people that don't smoke now as you can see i don't know let me get a close-up if you can see the tip you see i got like a little tiny bit up there i would like to try to drip some of this on my flower maybe we should do that for another video but shout out to dr ganja i'm telling you guys the product's been off the hook lately i mean off the hook especially with the dell to eight man i gotta let you guys know that it's been a great experience it helped me out a whole lot with my depression any issues i've been having with my pain whatever it is the delta really helps out a lot so if you enjoy cbd i gotta tell you some people i know with paranoia they can't go over what they feel with cbd and i understand that's why i showed you the mouth i think it was that the tree top the disposable from dr kanji was effective but it was mild and this seems to also be mild because it doesn't have you doing it it's just not too much on you that's why i like the delta eight it is a scaled down version of delta nine but guys it's perfect for me do i still what love my cbd but when you add the cbd and some delta 8 you guys are in there so i just wanted a quick demonstration uh that was my first time using one of the syringes uh i enjoyed it i really did i used it as a dab uh next time i'm gonna put some on some flour and see how that worked out uh and i also want to try to put some into some of my wine too guys all right so that was just a few ideas for you guys but y'all can go check it out like i said smoke doctor simple at check out save yourself a couple of dollars even though this is not really expensive right now guys so i say get all you can while you can alright so smoke dr signing out right now guys i'll be back with another review [Music] peace", "CsyyH2RzlIc": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]", "B5B9bnBQVrQ": "hi everyone my name is Tyler welcome back to my laboratory today we're going to be talking about short path distillation the functions the components and the process of it and then we're going to finish up distinguishing between full-spectrum oil broad-spectrum oil and tea free so let's jump right in alright so we're gonna talk a little bit about short path distillation today and what what the purpose of it is so we use short path distillation to extract cannabinoids from the crude oil so basically we're really doing refining operations using the short path distillation system it's very similar to the chemistry that was used in the white film molecular distillation that I talked about in a previous video just on a much smaller scale but you can also be a lot more precise with this equipment so several different components of the equipment of this whole entire system and so we'll start off from the beginning first piece that we have here is a low temperature coolant circulation pump and this is used to keep the condenser which is right here cool and what this does is it takes the vapors that are created by heating up crude oil in this boiling flask and it turns him back into liquids so as mentioned we have a boiling flask here inside of a digital heating and stirring mantle and what's going on in here is do I put crude oil in here we stir it at specific settings as you can see here below we have it at 330 rpm and 237 degrees Celsius what that does is that heats up the cannabinoids to the point of vaporization they turn into vapors they go up the distillation head they hit the cooler temperatures at the condenser right here cooled off by the chiller and once they turn back into a wick they come down into this thing called a cowbell and I can only hear the comments and jokes from here so so get them all out of your system now yes we all need more cowbell so what the cowbell has is you have your head and then you have your three main collection flasks and in each collection flask and you'll be collecting something differently in the first collection flask that you see in the background kind of a like a dark nastier color you're collecting heads and what's in those heads is any ethanol that wasn't recovered during the rotary evaporation process there's a little bit of terpenes some fats and waxes and lipids a little bit of CBD comes through here but really this is junk the second collection flask that we have is our mains this is the good stuff this is where we're collecting a majority of our CBD and as you can see it's pouring in there nice and smooth right now and a nice golden color that's that's what you want to see and the third flask which we haven't started using yet we'll use that at the end we're gonna collect our tails these also contain some cannabinoids but you're starting to get a really dark color which you really don't want in there and you're starting to collect a little bit more of some of the undesirables that are left behind in the crude oil after your cowbell yes we all need more of it you'll see a cold trap and this cold trap is designed to protect our rotary vane vacuum pump that we have down below here in this cold trap is on top has a mixture of ethanol and dry ice as you see is sort of bubbling right now right like it's not boiling that's just really really cold and that's what ethanol does when it gets it's probably below 30 minus 30 Celsius right now and so that cold trap is making sure that any vapors that didn't turn into liquid the cowbell are turning into vapors before they make it to the rotary vane vacuum top if they didn't then it would end up potentially damaging the rotary vane back and thumb so this vacuum what it's doing is it's lowering the atmospheric pressure of the entire system so that the cannabinoids don't have to reach as high of a temperature in order to convert from liquid to vapor and the reason why I want them to convert to a vapor at a lower temperature is because we get to have degradation of those can monoids at a higher temperature and we want to avoid that so that we can have higher quality and we're wrapping up this session by talking about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and tea free or isolate oils so full spectrum has terpenes CB d minor camera cannabinoids and a small amount of THC what I'm making right now is full-spectrum stuff broad spectrum includes terpenes CBD and minor cannabinoids but no THC an isolate or tea free includes no terpenes no minor cannabinoids no THC and only CBD that wraps up this session thanks for joining me in come back again later on have a great day", "0cIZq1j-hbc": "what's up everybody and welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis non-alcoholic beverage so let's get into it all right guys so the first thing i want to do is break down my ingredients so typically when people make cannabis beverage they're going to use cannabis tincture and the thing about tincture is majority of the time people use alcohol to make their attention so therefore i won't be using cannabis tincture to make my cannabis beverage instead we're going to be using this ingredients right here and this is simple syrup once you make your simple syrup you can use that to infuse any type of beverage so lemonade coffee whatever you want to use it for but let's get into it [Music] all right so now we're going to put our cannabis in our mason jar and get ready to decarbon all right guys so now we're going to decarb our cannabis i'm going to put this in the oven for about 35 to 45 minutes and the oven temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] my cannabis is now the card so now we're going to set the mason jar to the side and start working on the other ingredients [Music] so now we're going to start working on the simple syrup i'm going to be using 2 cup of water for one cup of sugar [Music] so i have my one cup of sugar and i'm going to be using two and a half cup of water so the reason why i'm using two and a half cup of water instead of two cups evenly is because once i start boiling my water i'm going to lose some of the water during the boiling process so just keep that in mind now we're going to add the water to the [Music] pot once your water start boiling add your sugar [Music] all right guys once your sugar is completely dissolved add your vegetable glycerin i'm going to be using two tablespoons of vegetable glycerin [Music] now i'm going to add the cannabis [Music] now reduce the temperature to low and let the canterbury simmer for a minimum of two hours so it's been over two hours so now we're going to filter out the cannabis [Music] so now we're just going to squeeze the cheesecloth to try to get the maximum amount of simple syrup as possible all right guys my cannabis simple syrup is now done so at this point we can now use our beverage so let's get into it [Music] so [Music] i just want y'all to see how how my sweet tea look once i added this simple syrup to it all right guys so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to infuse my powerade so let's get into it [Music] [Music] now we're gonna add one tablespoon of simple syrup to our pirate [Music] so all right guys my parade is now infused with the cannabis and you can't even tell that i add anything to it it looks just like parade it doesn't even look like cannabis infused power right which is great if you have any questions just leave a comment below thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe [Music] peace oh", "F1WHHlyXfcs": "what's up you guys so I just stopped by a bita can over in Tampa and you get 15% off your first purchase just to let you know and they have quite a few locations around Florida Daytona Deerfield Beach Breit is in Tampa st. Pete I don't know they had one st. Pete Bonita Springs Miami Jacksonville there's a couple other places but they got quite a few places so I stopped by and I got some of the distillate I actually went there to see if they were selling flour yet and as of right now April 8th or 9th what the day is but as of right now they are not selling whole flour in the bud they are still selling it in the cups but I must say I've tried that and it was really good the wedding cake or cush cake that was a really good strain awesome awesome stuff there I actually would say that that's probably besides truly the second my second favorite place to get flour even that was some good that was some good stuff I mean I've like I like moves flour as well but that was a I was really really impressed with the cush cake so let's take a look at this distillate that I got here this comes in a little box like so he told me to keep upright because it's in a little jar inside you usually see it come in a little syringe like this at least this is how I've seen it at the other dispensaries here in Florida this is some Kim dog from true leave a little glass syringe so he told me to keep it upright like this because it's in a little jar okay so don't keep don't keep it up right like that because it's packaged on the side in a little jar so when you get it I don't know which way they're going to turn it on you but that was the real top for me you can see kind of how it's packaged in here I'll show you it's in here on its side you can actually see the distillate is on the side of the jar over there I asked him why they put it in the jars like this and he said that it was just too thick for a syringe [Music] the taste is just amazing Wow has some really good taste to it I'm not even sure what that flavor is but it is amazing it's real classic weed taste I'm gonna take a couple more dabs off this let's get a couple melt shots and see how this leaves us feeling [Music] [Music] you guys can actually eat this stuff too you don't have to dab it this is an edible because it's distillate it's activated you guys ever need to clean your banger this is the way to do it right here so here is torture - all the black stuff does away this goes right in here thank ya nice clean bangers [Applause] so as far as the strain goes I mean it's a really good pure indica strain that is really good it says on the bottom I noticed the total milligrams 847 milligrams so probably around 85% for that I think this Kim dog came in at like 88 or so it's right around the same but I would just [Music] not sure if you guys heard that but they need to smoke some weed bad they are still oh my god alright so I mean I would just like to see it in the syringe but other than that that's really good really good indica I would definitely buy it again there's something about the flavor of this so I just got on Leafly and I read this that's pretty cool I got to read this to you guys it says citral is a town and packet I don't know if I'm saying that right citral is a town in Pakistan known for making some of the best hash in the region Pakistani central Kush also known as pck is a pure indica that is considered a selected Rand race meaning it is an indigenous strain that has been selected selectively in bred to enhance its characteristics PCK produces a very colourful phenotype often earning nicknames like purple Pakistani or purple citral this strain is appreciated for its advanced resin production and enables the strain to produce top quality concentrates and this I know the taste is amazing PCK M is a diverse boutique of aromas ranging from earthy caramel to sweet notes of fruits and berries I don't know I was getting more of like the earthy maybe even like some tiny but I'm not finding in there oh no it was a really like classic weed taste the influence of pure indica Jeannette creates powerful relaxing body effects that help avoid anxieties pain as well as induced sleep when needed yeah I could agree with with all that one guy says the flavor on the strain is incredibly unique I would have to agree with that for sure I mean the the flavor that I'm getting from this is is just crazy so it makes me wonder about the terpenes you know what how they're doing everything over there so I'm definitely gonna have to get some of their Strawberry Cough and try that try that out and see what's going on with that so yeah that's about it for this video I hope you guys liked the review please drop a like if you did and subscribe we're gonna have all kinds of cool stuff coming to you especially here really soon we're gonna be taking a little road trip so make sure to follow along with us and we'll see you guys soon", "3G-7XwYV6ls": "of this material we used is about 90% of CBD and 0.3 of THC or less because we know how to sometimes during the shock of this relation that each C can rise up and we know how to deal with it that TG will never go up and we know how to clean this up which steps you are removing that hitting those technologies so and also with this bucket you see we can do it like remove the THC from here and this is this is now a 78% of CBD we can make it it will be having 90 percent of CBD and the THC will stay as it as long as it is so 0.19 and it is so simple things so easy that I just cannot tell you now because everybody will know it it's so easy point 0 points 9 0 1 1919 so less than 0.2 my customers eagerly to have that yeah I know it", "T9tIe981YFA": "chance the jury will take a field trip to the Middle school to see where the alleged crime occurred. Knew it. Six tonight There is a new product on the market that's being touted as legal marijuana without a prescription. It's hitting store shelves all across the Bay Area. It's something you should be aware of. FOX 13's Josh Cascio reports. Experts have a warning tonight. Sign inside Chillin Glass Gallery in Ybor City reads loud and clear trying this stuff. Delta eight, THC will get you high, Unlike your standard marijuana. This stuff is being sold legally to buyers without a prescription. The difference. What we're talking about here is Dr 90 CBN cannabis of the 80 s being available in hemp. Right. It's available in hemp. It's legal, right still gets you stone, and it's made it legal under the same laws. It made CBD illegal. It's said to be 70 to 75% as potent as the real thing. The best way to think about that is for every two hits off of Delta nine. It takes three hits off adult to hate. So essentially all you all you need is to consume a little bit more in order to feel the same effect right now. The medical marijuana system We have to see a doctor every seven months. On you're fading like extreme prices for cannabis. Some of these patients can't do that. So it allows us to offer an alternative to that whole system, the DEA or Drug Enforcement Agency says it's currently in the process of reviewing the rules surrounding products like Delta eight THC, I'm not surprised because I warned everybody that. It really wasn't medicine for the very sick. It was the camel's nose under the tip, and we've not seen all that We're going to see, says Pull County Sheriff Grady Judd. It should be noted Delta eight will likely show up on a drug test. You could also get it, Do you? Why? If you're driving high on it, what we're seeing here today is not the end result. But the next step. And to find another way to Stone America. I'm worried about the health. Of your loved ones that's going to drive on the same highway with a person that takes enough of this low Delta eight to get stone.

o'clock this morning been blowing it up it's gonna be good we got uh hey can you guys pant all this wonderful stuff we got here look at that look at this we got it all set up it is so cool we got isolate we got distillate we got flavors we got existing tinctures here i'm terrified i'm going to break something i don't know it's going to happen i'm going to break it up right it's all right i'm totally going to break something okay all right so i'm going to let you go oh but wait wait wait wait icbc virtual event adam young in colorado springs congratulations you are this week's winner uh jarrod will reach out to you do we know what he won what did he win oh he wanted a grab bag i think you put it in this large glove hey put some gloves in there will ya we'll put some ppe and some gloves in there adam young colorado springs congratulations at the icbc virtual event we're good okay don't forget lots of resources live tour cbd jam sessions you guys are lighting it up you're asking us a lot of really cool questions on those jam sessions and things uh advanced extraction guide distillate guide calculator library is live you guys it's live oh my god they've been burning it up burning it hundreds of people on there so it's been it's been great and we're we're adding the and uh mini courses to come so good all right all right so uh yeah so let's uh let's get into this this is probably uh one of those uh one of those sessions where we're we're it's kind of more loosey we see uh so i only like no i only have the others work i only have like three slides and a couple tables oh awesome yeah okay they didn't see you i know okay i was i was showing you my eyes glazed overlook how do i get how do i get my wonderful presentation up here because people are going to be excited about these calculators if they're at all making tinctures and then we're going to get into some tasting and then we're going to make our own you're going to make me taste the bad stuff i'm going to make you taste it no i'm going to make you taste the good stuff okay i got cuts i got cow leaf i got holist stuff here remember last week you said ooh this is horrible taste this okay okay that's that's what i'm expecting okay uh number one number one guys uh if you're gonna make your own tinctures you gotta make sure your biomass or your cbd oil has been decarboxylated first okay otherwise it's it's not going to be able to be absorbed into your body um just to let you know that so what that means i didn't know that yeah what that means is that you you need to bring it through a process of decarboxylation so um you know whether if if you have a distillate it's it's very likely already decarboxylated almost all of distillate is decarboxylated for sure okay um if you have just like for example some uh some some biomass you're going to want to kind of warm it up you're going to want to cook it at 150 degrees for about an hour that'll decarboxylate it um or if you have some crude that you've taken from like an ethanol tincture or something like that you're gonna have to remove the ethanol and cook the living daylights out of the oil okay so that that and that that will basically decarboxylate it okay so first step in making a tincture obviously is decarboxylating either your biomass or your cbd oil just so you guys know that it's very important otherwise they're not going to be there's going to be what they call mal absorption oh yeah not going to be very good okay if you're using cbd oil you can follow a recipe that you create using our kick calculators kit calculators kick calculators yeah they're really great uh if you are using cbd biomass you need to extract it so we're gonna go over some of those calculators and then once you have this wonderful uh oil of some kind and we'll go over different ways to make that of course you guys there's different ways to do that um then then you can calculate your dosage using our dosing calculator okay so this is going to be a lot of fun and then step four obviously is enjoy it awesome so that that's pretty great that's that's my favorite part there's a small list okay so a lot of people ask us in the past you know what uh what cbd should we use in tinctures should we use isolate should we use distillate should we use winter eyes should we use broad spectrum ethanol all of them are perfectly fine to use in a tincture it's just you might get some uh different uh different things uh happening with that so like for example with isolate isolate is the most straightforward one to use within a tincture okay and um um what's nice about it is that potency is pretty high but it doesn't have any terpenes so you'll have to add some of your terpenes that you gather up in in a different process uh and you need to add those in i'll give you an example what that looks like here here you can see these are pure uh pure terpenes uh they come they come from a decarboxylation process which is essentially uh vacuum distillation and so they don't they don't have any thc or cbd in them but they are they are straight from the hand plant they have all of the a full spectrum of uh of terpenes there so you can add those into your isolate to make uh like dabs you can add them into your isolate to make no smell great they smell crazy good crazy good um yeah so terpenes um there are some you know sometimes with isolate depending on what isolate you are uh you know extracting from typically you will always have some miners in there like if it's 99 pure uh cbd you'll probably maybe have one percent miners or you know and when i say minor cannabinoids i mean cbn cb cbc cvg you know some of the miners will also be in there but they're very very trace they're very low low level they're just because the way isolate is processed you do have a residual risk so i'll be very careful about that i am a total anti-anti-residual type of person um so the way that it's processed with nonpolar solvents and stuff like that i i don't i don't like it so i don't prefer an isolated tincture i prefer something more natural but a lot of people use it because um you know like if you use a crude or winterized or bots broad spectrum you're really talking about the natural flavors of the plant in there so you know um you know a lot of people want to mask that and overpower it with like a strawberry flavor or a chocolate flavor or something like that people also use distillate and when you use distillate and you're in manufacturing you just have to correct for you have to know how much cbd is in your distillate right otherwise you wouldn't know how to dose it and i'll show you in a calculator that we put together for manufacturing and what that really means it's just suffice it to say it does have some of those minor cannabinoids it does have some of the longer chain longer longer isoprene the larger um the larger terpenes in there so yes it does have some terpenes in it but it doesn't have the more volatile ones which are the diatribes uh things like that um and then a residual risk if if you there's always a residual risk with distillate we've we've done a pretty large study on uh you know um distillates and and you do see some of those residuals making it all the way through the distillate even if they are volatile organic solvents so um but it's uh it really varies about 25 of the manufacturers that we survey their distillate had some sort of contaminant in there so when you buy distillate you just want to make sure that you are basically contaminant and solvent free um and then winterized decarboxylated oil um 50 to 70 percent of course terpenes yes you got lots of terpenes in there it may also have some miners in there um you're not going to have a residual risk if you if you are using co2 oils and you're using food grade oils that don't have residuals in them you might have a ethanol digital though so you want to make sure that that's all taken out of there um broad spectrum is basically a thc free distillate typically you would take the distillate and you take the thc out of it you do that with either chromatography or solvent techniques one of the two you have to decide which one you want to use you know we use chromatography here because it's more clean than using a solvent so we try to stay away from acetone heptane hexane or anything else that's going to get into your body with unknown consequences to the to the endocrine system or to anything else you know you're trying to get to the point where um where where we're not taking and eating chemicals we're trying to do that that's a good thing better living through chemicals only applies if you live in the laboratory um and then uh ethanol extract yes you can do we're gonna show you how to make a t-shirt like uh with an ethanol extract the definition of a tincture is uh essentially an ethanol extract okay it's it's or it's a uh if it's it's an active with uh in in ethanol okay and most people don't like to have tinctures like real tinctures because they burn you know oh yeah yeah yeah they really burn they don't taste very good because they're overwhelmed by the burn so sure a lot of people don't um you know for example you know make tinctures but they are medically used all over all over the world sure so and uh in the pharmaceutical world so all right so that's the type of cbd used in the tincture which one is best um i think that they all you can see that they're all um they all have different different things to bring to the table like the ice lit would be used if you want to have overpowering like berry flavors and things like that and you don't want to have any plant flavor in there if you want to have some plant flavor in there you know you're going to have to either hit the distillate the winterized oil of the broad spectrum if you're not going to want to have any thc in there you're going to want to use broad spectrum winterize is probably the best or crude oil could also be used and that's the the closest to the plant obviously so you can take winterized oil directly out of or i'm sorry um co2 oils directly out of crude directly out of a co2 extractor that has been pre-decabox lid and you can use that right in your tincture in my view that's the cleanest possible but you're also getting a lot of uh plant uh plant flavors there's a good flavor but it's a lower potency yeah it's a lower potency also but you can make it you can make the potency however you want because you're diluting obviously with uh with oil so got it that's what that is and so basically what's awesome about this is that if you have you know 50 flavors you have uh different types of isolate you have uh you know different types of terpenes really there's a lot of different combinations this is where cbd formulation gets a lot of fun because you're able to test and try you're able to come up with something unique there's uh you know any they're 100 factorial different you know different combinations so your combination can actually be unique and you know if you like it people like it they'll taste it like wow this is really great so yeah we've we went out we we bought a whole bunch of tinctures we tasted them some of them were like you know own natural yeah and they were a little bit tough uh from the standpoint just didn't taste very good right so we i always kind of like okay i like to i like the stuff that tastes really good and i do like the natural hemp flavor too so that's just my bias um so what's a does an extraction method for cbd uh why does it make a difference well uh just to just uh just to summarize it for you have purity is important unknown and known residual solvent should be avoided so this this is where um if you're on the market you're buying for example crude oil you're buying distillate um and they give you a report that says hey this is this is really great i i would i would test that um because i i don't trust residuals your laboratory will not test for unknown residuals that's a big deal and if it's not on their list they'll say it's pure it's clean it passes and that's a problem i i think it's a huge problem it is a problem it most definitely is a problem okay because you know there's just an infinite number of things what if i used something that wasn't a list you know like methylene blood or dimethyl bat [ __ ] oh oh dimethylpatch it do you have that okay or and organic is better organic is better it is just this because um you know it it's it's made with agricultural practices that that don't use pesticides or insecticides and so you're really reducing or eliminating that risk so hey anything you can do to make your cbd tincture the most healthy tincture possible is the best way absolutely period absolutely and the residual thing i mean i i agree with you the residual thing is is bad and we've talked about this in ad nauseam in previous episodes but if you're taking multiple doses a day of cbd or a tincture or taking that over time oh my gosh you're you're ingesting way over the limit that they want right over time right and that's just bad stuff right right exactly well yeah and they don't have any basis for the limits in the first place yeah so there's there's you know there's no studies and so their their modus operandi is interestingly enough oh we don't have any data on it so 5000 ppm is okay you know that that's you guys have heard me rant about that a lot and you know whatever you know does it actually happen in practice though the answer is yeah it does all the time yeah it does we we've got a whole bunch of extracts we got a whole bunch of you know distillates and stuff yeah we see the stuff in there you can see it yeah look we we analytical chemists we can see everything yeah okay there's no hiding yeah and we've got by the way we've got chemists from europe we've got chemists from ohio congratulations nicholas and edgaris hopefully i said that correctly and we've got barney here i mean we've got questions coming all over the place so thank you for being here it's awesome right thank you so anyway so that's that i think um let me see here so people always want to know how much to take okay so it's based on body weight it's based on delivery method and it's based on that condition that's being addressed okay so um you know like for example with some forms of epilepsy i know that uh you know the dosage is quite high like really high wow so um what's cool about the cannabinoids is that you're not going to die from it okay nobody has ever died for example from uh from a cannabinoid overdosage that i know of i don't think that there is if someone knows please put it in the notes that would be interesting but you know people have died from alcohol people have died from other things but they haven't done that you could you could be you could be you know you could be uh taking so much of it that it you know you you would have an adverse reaction that's not what i'm saying i'm just saying dying from it that would be a male reaction yes yes so that would be a male reaction okay so let's get to some calculators and then we'll get into the fun stuff which is basically uh sampling and mixing crazy awesome so let me see here it's on the website technical we're we're we're moving it and and this is awesome by the way um uh also as as we're going you know one there's a couple of questions that we're coming in as we're moving to the calculators and that is can you process just with pressure or do you need to process with a solvent um i wonder what that means uh it's it's tough to understand what that means if i mean okay we talked about methods last week okay and methods are basically you have your technique plus your temperature and your pressure conditions right and that's put putting those together with a piece of equipment that has been calibrated and has operating procedures and trained personnel that's a method okay so um if you are going to talk about different ways to um change you know like for example i could i could increase the pressure or i could decrease the pressure i could change my solvent i could use a different solvent sure um yeah there's there's lots of different options for me so yeah you look there's the sky's the limit when it comes to uh when it comes to making your different methods sure all right and we can talk about that um and and for barney if you want to watch the last episode we did on processes and things that would be awesome it's in our blog and you can connect there or on our youtube channel that would be good and then we're talking about i think we addressed some of these where you get all of the cannabinoids and flavonoids in the processes and where they are and what they would need yeah yeah um yeah so okay so yeah we can we can talk about that i'll talk about that as we're tasting and perfect stuff like that all right all right good good thanks for the questions by the way all right so um look here uh here's our calculators page you can go to our website uh calculators are at the top and then uh scroll down um scroll scroll down how do i scroll down here buddies that's just a pointer i know i'm looking to scroll here you got the whirling circle of i do have the army [Laughter] let me see here do you want to try it that's fun okay uh also again um it's really good to see you guys from europe from all over the country this is this is good stuff and um we are going to announce our topic later in the show but if you have any topics you want us to cover let us know for future episodes um and you know maybe there is a prize in it if you that's what we're gonna do next week because yeah i'm i'm held i'm been bound i can't speak right till later on the show right so we're good i still am terrified i'm gonna break something oh that's all right hey you know what we can do the calculators later look i can just look it's it's there's some technical difficulties that we're having which uh it does happen actually this is the first time that that's happened over all of our bodies oh my gosh i have technical difficulties in my brain all the time okay all right well let's let's i will narrate them and then we'll then we'll take it from there how about that guys so hey uh so what i'd like you guys to do it's gonna be it's gonna be a lot of fun i'd like you to go to the calculators page and if you scroll down to the bottom there's two calculators one is a dosing calculator and the other is how to manufacture a tin shirt calculator okay and i'll go through the dosing calculator first let's just kind of you guys open that up yeah i mean i'm gonna wait i'm gonna do it from memory extract lab.com e-x-t-r-a-k-t-l-a-b dot com forward slash calculators right right right right okay let's do it uh okay so uh let me see the dosing calculator let's talk about that one first your the dose that you would have is really dependent upon the weight of your of the weight of your body okay so um if you put in that your pounds how many pounds you are uh you have to convert it if you're in europe to kilograms um i think it's just divided by our time 2.2 i think so um and that'll give you your kilograms weight uh you need to put in your weight in pounds so that's uh let me see it's a so if you're 200 pounds or 100 pounds you put that in there and then you all then you decide uh what what uh dosage your um tincture is so if if there's a usually the tinctures are about 30 milliliters okay and um and they have usually they're about 33 milligrams per milliliter or 33 milligrams per serving and a one serving is typically right around one milliliter okay um yeah so uh you have to put that in there and then um you push the calculate button you got to put in some stuff and it'll tell you how you know basically what the maximum amount you have um it'll tell you what your dosage is for high medium and low dosage it'll tell you uh for example um what is your um you know how many milligrams you would take per day it's got a whole bunch of figures in there for a high medium and low dosage so how we doing james and and we're we're close one of the things that are is our technical difficulty is we are in the r d lab yeah i think that's uh that is we switched it at the last minute oh man yeah and so we've got usually in the other studio we've got you know plug-ins and everything and now we're going kind of wi-fi yeah okay so all right i know that that's part of the issue all right so and quick quick question yeah okay so when we're talking about body weight um my weight is about 165 right when you add my ego it's about 300 rounds okay it's like all right three clicks hey the calculator that's up is the wrong calculator did you know that oh you didn't know that okay he doesn't know true what are we doing when i when i mention those kinds of things you know i'll know whether he's paying attention to me he didn't hear a word i said no i didn't i didn't uh that's when i get away with so much [ __ ] i can't even tell you man why didn't i ask a really good question i don't know hey i've got a really good client who needs a discount okay sure he hears that i hear that okay all right let's just skip this because it's not working so all right we're gonna skip it sorry guys i all that all the calculator mango that i did this morning it's uh it's all there for your enjoyment so go ahead take and explore it and uh and we'll we're just gonna start trying out some things okay so what this means is this is rather than the calculator it's just trial and error and i'm the guinea pig am i the test you're the test oh you're the test thanks so okay just so all of you guys know in the room here thanks okay all right so let's let's do some tasting first okay um so this right here here there's some different pictures here that's that's a holistic tree right there this is a holistic tincture yeah what does it say it says key lime key lime we got strawberry okay i'm gonna try a strawberry 16.5 milligram serving of key lime this is look there's a brand spanking new okay this is kind of interesting if you can take a look at this so uh you can see this is almost clear it's got a slight color to it um let's see here if you can see that and then um yeah it's it's see it's strawberry so let's see if i can taste it all right this is typically what you do is you hold it under your tongue for like 30 to 40 seconds i hold it for two minutes it's it's better two minutes yeah two minutes i can hold my breath for two minutes i won't do that now actually it's kind of funny watching people take pictures i thought i'd just go oh key lime you know what that needs what little mango you know what if we we are going to be so relaxed in like an hour if we if we sample all these i don't think no way no way challenge challenge accepted okay then try the mint then try them in try them try them oh this is okay that other one was 16. this is 33. okay so this this is which one is 16 oh this is 16. yeah yeah 16. oh that's that's sweet so this is this is nothing so this one is a og kush so this one right here is cuts um this one is made up with uh terpenes like natural terpenes so um yeah let's try it all right oh yeah you can see the difference i mean it's definitely got definitely got a lot also it's got a nice little graduated cylinder oh same here look at this see that that's pretty sweet look at that okay i'm not going to take much i'm going to take a quarter a quarter quarter yeah yeah just a quarter is it quarter two bits you know what that's definitely got some oh it tastes great what do you got mint try that one okay try that one oh that's got flavor that's terpini does it really oh yeah it's got mint and terpenes mint terpini full spectrum hemp flour oil okay here let's check that out and it's uh heavy duty oh this is it's got 2 000 milligrams in this bottle yep i told you didn't i tell you yeah it's good it's good oh it's got that mint with a little bit of oh yeah but there's a good aftertaste yeah it kind of blends on the tongue and just kind of grows right under the tongue and just kind of comes and gives your tongue a hug right with terpenes so okay so so there's a couple different things you can swallow these tinctures and it'll go into your gut basically um and you know it'll it'll kind of it won't be metabolized as fast right it'll go it gets metabolized through the liver if you take them sublingually basically it gets absorbed um you know under the tongue and so you have to have a carrier for that and that's why typically alcohol is used because it's a good carrier directly into your bloodstream and there's some arterial a blood that goes right under the tongue and and it has a more direct way of getting into your bloodstream so um yeah oh that's good yeah oh that's good yeah oh and look certified pesticide free no reason here's a great vape too this is a great babe this is a pretty good one great babe yeah great babe that that's a do you know that ages me because i remember grape grape that was a great thing great bush you see this has got this has got more like a real cannabis flavor with no um you know with no um let me see no no like berry flavor or bean flavor it's just straight up you know og kush yeah it's great well the other thing would be the 2000 the other thing with this one is it it's got a thicker viscosity almost on it a little more oil base i like that oh mango sorbet oh my totally gonna try that one [Music] you're on a mango kick i i like i like berry flavors what can i say harry berry all right here we go i'm gonna try it grape ape i wonder if i'm gonna get any work done this afternoon boy we got we do have work don't we randy wow i i taste it definitely has the mango it's very smooth but it definitely ha it definitely still has that cannabis background in it what oh this one again it just kind of there's this little grapey flavor just slight it's not like drinking it's not like you know drinking a shot of welch's right but but then it's just slight and then all of a sudden the terpenes just kind of kick you yeah bam pretty good bam okay i think we've had enough we're gonna fall asleep i think we've had enough oh we're good all right well thanks we got that we got some conditioning are you kidding me yeah yeah okay so all right i'm i'm looking at uh questions here good uh maxum thanks good guys good uh barney cool thanks and look for that uh the blog will have a lot of that on there barney so just make sure you look right um matthew uh good to see you richard good to see you uh let's see questions um [Music] i think there's a great opportunity yeah there's one of the things that we have been noticing on our sites just because of this dude here um we have a lot of phds and chemists on staff and we speak chemists oh yeah oh my gosh yeah we kind of do yeah for us you know business and sales geeks yeah it gets old it never gets old i'm sorry did i say that out loud did i have too much cbd um i'm relaxed i don't care anymore oh good see now this is awesome but i think we need to do some uh very like this one was very good for chemists and i think the only thing that we didn't get to were the calculators but go your chemist you explore right do r d go to extract lab.com calculators and find those calculators because they're awesome yeah and in the blog we have several posts how many white papers have you written on distillate and that would be very chemist specific boy um how many white papers well we do blog posts we did guide our blog posts and then there must be at least we wrote uh we have at least 40 pages of faqs yes which are you know are very digestible because they're just adding okay and just so you know the faqs are not like a one or two sentence answer okay i mean they're exhausted it's a white paper okay yeah we make we make a white super faq i think i've seen citations on some of those yeah our guys go can we just make this into a blog article instead of an faq oh yeah sure whatever yeah whatever but leave it as an faq because people want to know this answer yeah all right exactly all right now one a couple of things that i wanted to show here just because it's cool um you know we got bigger beaker beaker all over the place okay okay that's fine no yeah bigger bigger bigger okay so there's some really cool stuff so why would you use this yeah or these little those are cool those are volumetric flasks yes these are volumetric flasks okay i apologize to all the chemists out there but those who are not chemists don't know this stuff so yeah let's let's make some stuff here so let's let's do some stuff let's let's make it all right so what do we need to do well okay i was going to start off with just uh just kind of an ethanol extraction of some of some uh bombings okay okay because a lot of people who want to do diy stuff at home yeah they might have some biomass and they take some water no no no that's fine oh okay so uh first thing you do is you start off with some everclear just take a shot and then start yeah so you buy it and you take your pork up this is the reason you start off with everclear is that uh it's a food grade uh alcohol it doesn't have a lot of water in it and uh you know you're not you're not dealing with residuals except for like a lot of alcohol okay and it is going to extract the um you know the biomass okay um a lot of times what people do is they'll they'll take some biomass they'll put it into a jar like like this okay and then they'll pour the everclear in there and they'll let it sit for you know a week and they'll they'll stir it and they won't really get it's not very efficient technique so you're not going to get out a lot of the cbd or so you might just continue to put some more everclear in it usually you want to start off with something a lot smaller you can also by the way this is from our own farms that worked out pretty good this right here shout out to nevada crest farms uh these guys are in nevada obviously um they had some pretty good blend that they sent our way oh nevada crest hey try to try that out shout out to nevada yeah yeah it smells great cool that smells really good yeah yeah and nevada crest they're looking at expanding their yeah facility yeah eli just talking to them oh really yeah cool sweet yeah all right so we're gonna take some of their stuff and we're gonna we're gonna take and do a little bit of an extraction so we're going to put a little bit in here first of all you see this is called a buckner funnel or a buchner funnel um and it has a paper in there you can see that that is a filter filter paper you put that in there and then you have like a little apparatus which is a this is called the sidearm vacuum flask you can buy these on ebay you can buy them on amazon or uh you can just not buy them at all and use like a coffee filter or something like that yeah that would be fine as well um and so you put a little bit of usually you want to wet the paper a little bit so i'm gonna take this is not normally how we would do stuff but we're gonna we're gonna do this diy here today so we're just gonna pour a little bit of that on there kind of wet that paper smell that yeah okay you all remember ever clear in the wapatooli college put a little bit of that in there [Music] all right we're gonna put a little bit of that in there all right this is great for like pre-rolls and things like that um and or you can just extract it straight out so usually what you would do is you would know for example the potency of that and then you would measure out the amount of alcohol you'd be extracting it with it's you still wouldn't really know what the end extraction would be but you can make some assumptions say if you have like 50 recovery or 40 recovery then you can kind of calculate okay i have i have uh calculate how much is in there so here we're just going to add it in and you can see now this is this is a really great illustration as well the issue with uh with with ethanol extraction and that's because now all that biomass is sucking up all of our alcohol okay so you need a lot of it in there and now we're just gonna kind of roll it around there and you can see down here there's uh we're getting a tincture out yeah now a lot of people want to just soak it that's fine too this we're just kind of doing this in the short term and then we're going to try i'll let you try it you're awesome yeah thank you it'll be great we're gonna get all those terpenes out of there and stuff like that so while that is cooking okay i'm gonna put this over here that's that's what you would do and you can put it into a jar and then you can decant it and filter it off and this would be considered to be a tincture a kind of an all-natural tincture okay oh yeah so you can see it's coming down so now when you do this approximately you know if we do this if this is you know what potency typically would that flower be so that would be either you know anywhere from five to fifteen percent and most likely right around ten percent okay yeah so if you're doing it this way yeah how much cbd will come down yeah not a lot not very much i mean it you so you maybe get most of it is stuck in that in the matrix there you know so that's why a lot of people soak it for a long time okay um you know so again diy uh do it yourself at home get a bottle of everclear but you can see there's it's definitely pulling some out yeah it's very green it's yeah cool yeah i can't wait to taste it yeah we're gonna we're gonna taste it and we're gonna taste it like real soon as soon as we get this all right so and then um let's kind of go over some of the flavors i was going to kind of show you guys some flavors here that yeah um you guys can pick up um any kind of flavor you want now these these okay let me just talk a little bit about terpenes and what makes a difference with turkeys okay not all terpenes are equal some terpenes are are synthetic some of them are say fruit derived um and some of them are steam distilled some of them are solvent distilled um and some of them are like i said purely synthetic and some of them are also derived specifically from say hemp these ones come straight from the ham plant they're they're they're not uh they're not cut they're not uh they're they're just natural okay so this is kind of what you want to have if you want to have uh you want to maintain that hemp flavor and that m taste and stuff in fact these terpenes right here are some of the terpenes that you that you um that you tasted in this oji kush okay okay so those are the og turkeys right there okay so that's one way to so when you say that it's right that's the flavor you're you use that stuff to flavor your tincture is this is this like when you say it's right from the plant that's pre it's pre-processing pre-processing processing all together yeah so you would use a a terpene trap yeah and uh and with that that terpene trap would allow you just to just to basically take the terpenes directly from here and and get them into there got it okay that's the chirping trap we have a product that that does that for because a lot of people do that and capture these post extraction yeah but they're not good they're not as good horrible yeah yeah yeah so these we call angels tears right yeah they definitely are angels tears and it's good stuff so you want it right from the plant yeah if you do it afterward uh in other words gather those uh these terpenes up afterward they just taste they're horrible they don't they don't smell good they don't taste good mostly because you have to really cook it in order to get it out right so and it's been processed like three times already by the time it gets out and so they're degrading and all that stuff so you want to make sure that you have some good uh you know nice terpenes um we also uh so that's one one particular flavor i would consider if you're going to make a tincture for um you know that's based on hemp you'd want to have a little bit of like terpenes in there so we taste you know something like the hemp plan um some of your clientele however is just going to like something like the holeless products like um there i mean i couldn't taste any like the key lime or the strawberry or the mint i mean was there any hemp in those at all terpenes that was a flavor was there a little bit yeah maybe i didn't taste it wasn't as strong as it was in the and some of them they were they were stronger in some than others yeah so the strawberry one i couldn't taste that at all so maybe that's just like almost free um so yeah um and then uh let me see then you can use different flavors you can go to amaretti um or you can go to you know different sources like here for example is uh we have usd organic these are organic tinctures that we have by the way so you want to make sure that you have the organic label um which means that this peppermint oil was grown organically extracted according to the organic principles and then to us in this beautiful package here that then we could put into an organic product to show hey look we're 100 organic i love that yeah it's good it's great and so this is very very concentrated peppermint oils you can also get non-organic and those would be like in fruity flavors and things like that um like for example uh here's here's lemon oil terpene less lemon oil here's some cassio oil for example that's more like cinnamon cinnamony chocolate cream look at here's sassafras oh yes that's the fresh fruit and then we've been doing a lot with like um you know like hot flavors like i think i really think that um you know like fusion you know like you know you know the fusion cooking yeah i think that that is really a great way you know to have that in like tinctures and things so i mean if you can you can mix and match like hot and yes the four essences you know uh sweet sour um earth air fire water i mean you know i mean something along those lines so you can have that in there and where it would you know develop over time so yeah uh the taste and all the flavor okay and by the way samantha loves our geek okay your geek not my geek your geek okay all right let me see here we got uh isolate here okay this is some of our raw products so here's some isolate so that's what that looks like it looks beautiful white and it's uh and then we have it's kind of fun when they dry it and they just there's some here's some distillate okay so that's some distillate so we would we would make that up and uh here's some winterized oil so again all of these are decarboxylated here you can see how they're kind of flowing there um then this is yeah and then that's crude crude you know smell smell this cream oh i just love the smell of co2 crude is so smells so wonderful it just does it it just really smells good yeah look how thick that is oh my gosh i i just like okay it looks weird for me just sitting there smelling it but if i can oh yeah you know what if you move it around you can really see yeah crude smells so good oh and then you know the winter eyes again it just kind of you lose a little bit of that beautiful um so if i was to make a tincture um you know making like making it with like food is actually a really great great idea so hey we got we got ourselves are we making it yeah we got ourselves a little bit of alcohol here you can see that little tiny bit of alcohol tincture here that we're making okay you don't have to use uh only alcohol in fact let me talk to you a little bit about what the difference is between an alcohol tincture in what is known in the marketplace as a as a tincture usually um people don't use alcohol because it's their shipping issues and all that stuff and so what they use is other excipients like coconut oils like mct oils or sweet almond oil or they'll use glycerin or something along those lines okay usually you want to stick with an oil we can use hemp oil too we have a whole bunch of hand boiled danny kemp oil here um that's a really great way to do it too usually the hemp oil is green and you know it comes out green that's the organic stuff but most people i mean if you look at the labels and you read the labels most people are using an mct which is a medium chain triglyceride and you know it has its own actually mct oil has its own health benefits you can go up on on the web and look those up so a lot of people are using those um it doesn't always have to be alcohol it it solves a lot of problems if you don't have to you know store a lot of everclear or food grade up ethanol so um okay so uh so how are we making this well i i don't know i think what we're going to do first of all we're going to just taste it okay and then and i'm going to use one of these a little bit yeah we're going to take yeah so here it is here's the so let me take a look at this if you can real quick so this is the extracted material and you would it's not fully extracted for sure but you can see that all of that ethanol there is still stuck in there yeah in in the matrix there it's really hard to get out so you'd have to centrifuge it or something to get it out of there i can't wait to go to the matrix matrix here we go oh well um i didn't smell that like a chemist you want to know how the chemist is supposed to smell stuff here i'll show you yeah there you go you got it you got it that's how it goes yeah so okay here you get a little beaker and i get a little beaker i want half of it and you can have it and then we're gonna use that as our base to try out some stuff here okay i'm having fun i don't know about everybody here i i know i see there's a lot of people on on the show sorry but i'm having a lot of fun i hope i hope you guys are okay okay well bottoms up man yasu okay a little tiny bit under the tongue maybe i i think i'm gonna do this instead what yeah i'm gonna try this i'm not gonna try that what no way i'm gonna try a little bit on my tongue if you want a dropper there's a drop over there really okay here we go oh my gosh that warm oh it's very hot can you reserve the cot for me wow that's a that's what they call extreme burn excuse me sorry wow look at something else okay so are we wimpy or i mean we don't drink everclear we drink whiskey but not every clear wow i mean okay i that has great flavor though i mean other than the everclear burn but i you can really taste the flour you know what i think that is i think what that is is that the oils that were on our tongue i think that they're now desorbing and redissolving into our mouth or that's just my tongue i think you're dissolving your tongue all together that's from all right okay so okay okay this is not oh man this is killing it oh no he's gonna do it okay you got it done okay you could do that okay now what we're gonna do here i did it it's you did it what do you wanna you wanna pin or something high five okay okay you know what we don't have is something to clear our palette in between or like i did actually i had some water earlier oh really yeah i'm going to try this before i tried this i cleansed my palate it's totally unsuitable it must just be the dissolving of my tongue in the everclear but you know after this no one no one's going to join our show again all right are you kidding me everybody's going to be on all right here we go now we're going to do some mct stuff um i think i think i could do here if we lift something i could go you just pull that up pull this out yeah pull it pull it out no no pull this up right here yeah there you go pull this up yeah just pull it up i'm trying yeah okay pull it all the way up okay go there and i'll push it down how much just give me a little bit i don't need a lot there you go yeah okay there it is i need some of that okay then i'm gonna make a i'm gonna it's just kind of like a uh it's kind of like a buffet so you can just go ahead and make i'm gonna i'll tell you what i'm gonna i'm gonna put a little crude in there and uh oh my gosh now this crude is probably right around 60 percent so you know whatever i probably i probably have about a quarter mil in there so it's not a lot let's don't put that in there okay and then i put a little bit of i'll put a little bit of terpenes in there [Music] i love it when he opens this jar wow how would you like to have gallons of stuff just give us a call pick up the receiver we'll make it i tell you what our terp trap kills i mean and you can do that and that is money money money okay you don't need a lot no you don't want to overpower it right no i mean you should smell this i mean cross contaminated how many kinds are there so you can see it's not dissolving i don't know okay so it's a little bit we can we can do one or two things well obviously uh you can heat it or you can do it you can chew it you can also do a little bit of this yeah oh look at that okay i know exactly what to do we'll put this in a little centrifuge too oh okay we're going to mix it all together and we're going to make it into one homogenous solution i feel like a homogeneous solution oh yeah look at that do a little mixing it is not dissolving that's it i might i might have to add some ethanol to it to dissolve it possible oh you can see it is dissolving it is dissolving a little just need some more time and some heat probably it'd probably be some heat maybe you just pour some of this in that's plenty of pour some of this in go ahead make your own go ahead and make your own i'm going to blow something up here this is some sweet almond oil i like the sweet almond oil jared's there yeah blow something up blow something up you can make a isolated one i'm gonna make a crude one go ahead okay all right here here's this oh yeah put some sweet almond oil in there okay i'm gonna totally put a little bit of peppermint in there and then uh what do you say and then maybe put a little bit of peppermint in there what do you say whatever you want whatever well i don't mind but i mean am i am i like that's kind of fun okay that's that's enough of that i i we don't have heat but that's how you would how would you dissolve that uh first of all if you were using like vegetable glycerin you have a very hard time getting it in you'd have to heat it up and it's not it's not really it's not really soluble very because it's not very soluble in vegetable glycerin okay so um you would need to do something with it within mct oil though you can see it's it's dissolving but it's slow it's going to take a little bit of time to do that um i'm going to i'm going to actually take it out and then and then fortify it with some isolate okay all of these really cool tools i have no idea yeah i'm gonna smell it first well that smells great okay now i'm going to um there's my slight i'm going to fortify this with some isolate i think it's boiling and there's no heat oh man what occasional listen what are you doing don't blow up the r d lab yeah they they will not let us in here anymore they kicked me out a long time ago i remember when we were doing our vape formulations we're sitting here all weekend long this whole place if you just you couldn't see anything you're like boy i'm really relaxed we go outside we take a nap come back in okay i do think at one point down the road we need to take you out really good and maybe next week we'll make popcorn in the gemco oh yeah we can do that alvin we have to pre pre-pre-look at that all right so in this i have the peppermint i put a little bit of our uh flour tea from nature's crest by the way and then i put a little bit of distillate in here and i know distillate is so see what happens yeah now normally you would be taking notes you'd be measuring everything out like like a good chemist would do so that you would know what i am not a good camera we'll see this has got a lemon terpene uh mct with it should be very terpene i'm going to try it it's all for fortified did i did i tell you that you don't need a lot of peppermint that's a lot of peppermint okay i won't have to brush my teeth for like a week i think you'll be you'll be burping uh peppermint peppermint yeah here we go i'm gonna try this one now what'd you get i made it in the right proportions dude did you yeah well this is good is it yeah um will it cut the peppermint a little bit no it's got well it's got let me see here what it's got it's got uh lemon oil terpeneless lemon oil it's got a little bit of these terpenes you know uh one thing about terpenes is is that they do have a burning characteristic yeah so you always have to limit them this is especially when you're doing your vapors uh you want to make sure you limit your terpenes otherwise you're going to have a lot of burn that's that's that's very lemony it's very limiting can i try yeah sure maybe that's quite the dropper did i make it that's kind of flails that's good lemon this definitely has it's got a little bit of that lemon rind it takes to it because i can taste in the back like you know like a lemonade okay okay that's not lemon rind it's zest for those of you who cook it's called zest okay all right yes that's what you make oh that's good yeah it definitely that was good it definitely is way better than mine way way better this is this is basically a isolate fortified um crude oil um mct with a lemon no yeah lemon zest it definitely has um it has limonene in it for sure and it's got a little little in it little which is kind of a little which is a terpene it definitely has it say that five times okay all right and i put some of this in there too i know but see that is sweet thank you for being here and thank you for enjoying our tincture creation mad scientist r d lab here so this is awesome let's do a recap okay okay first uh first we had a uh a wonderful uh presentation that i put together yes yes it was really four slides you said three what was it it's kind of a bait and switch and then get the calculators go go on the calculators give us some feedback on them uh things like that please do that um and then we tried you know we did a an extraction basically an ethanol extraction using everclear and some stuff uh and some of this uh some of this blend here you can see it's still it's still in there you might want to extract it again and again but yeah you can do that with really good tea your friend does um golden water turtle tea and you can you can fuse that like seven times so that's probably the same thing you can do here you can just keep pouring and running and go yeah and you can use um in terms of uh so that's one way to do it if you're doing an ethanol extraction you can use distillate you can use crude you can use isolate um and then you know the and you can totally get this stuff online just yeah like amaretto has all the flavors i would okay there's some couple different things when you buy amaretti flavors be careful you want to buy the oil soluble flavors you don't want to buy the water-soluble flavors because they they are not very miscible in other words they won't really go into the cooking and you so you might like oh i like that flavor i like that flavor and then you have a whole bunch of them and they're like water-soluble so don't buy those i'm just say i just saved everybody a hundred dollars oh there you go don't buy the watershed oh hey barney has another quick question um he didn't know terpenes burn oh he did oh yeah yeah why would they burn well they're well because they're organic just like any anything else organic will burn like mct oil will burn um you know if you light you can light distillate on fire obviously so so he's not talking about like every clear burn that burns when you taste oh yeah yeah okay he's talking about you can light it on fire oh yeah you can do that too you can do that too so it's a good thing we don't have anything hey hey you know okay so i don't think i was involved in the formulation of these um well let me see here some is that about to change but the strawberry one is actually quite good and i still have a lot of lemons so if i if i took this would i have lemon strawberry yes of course i'll have peppermint strawberry i'm gonna have peppermint spaghetti for dinner tonight probably strawberry fields forever straw oh i still want to sing oh that should be next week's episode no sing along karaoke okay all right okay so then um an optimum thinner for people looking oh okay thinner to vape oils be very careful with thinners okay that you do you guys remember the um the vape crisis yes okay yeah um like for example um a lot some of the compounds used in the thinners that were used uh which which are terpene thin thinners essentially uh we're but the vitamin e acetate which was a problem so be careful about what you're using look at the ingredients and a lot of times people will say oh they'll say okay here's a terpene thinner for you they won't tell you what it is you can't use that because you don't know what it is and someone might actually uh for vape you know sure might get in trouble so don't use anything that you don't have like you know what everything what it is sure so yeah just just and there's a just because it's healthy to ingest doesn't mean it's healthy to vape that's correct that's correct and the other thing there is that if yeah i mean people died because they took that vitamin e acetate which is an oil yeah you know and they were vaping it so yeah so be very careful with the thinners because they're proprietary and people don't want to tell you what's in the thinner you should never use that so don't do that okay thank you for the 100 samantha awesome and uh chris has a quick question about nano emulsification still use oil based not water based um okay so using water-based you can use uh like a water base with a nano emulsion that's great i would do that um we have some water-based you know like one shots or something like that we can do that this time but we we could have and basically sounds like a future episode yeah yeah you can get all kinds of fruity flavors in there um so um those are typically uh used in like uh like water formulations like uh you know like sodas and uh seltzer waters and and like shots like energy shots and things like that i know people also sell them as quote-unquote tinctures uh you know why not you can put it in the tees and things like that so that also works um and there's a lot of different ways to nano emulsify okay a lot of it involves like equipment basically you need a high pressure homogenizer or medium pressure or a low pressure homogenizer and you can get with a low pressure homogenizer you can get down to the micron level your um your water is going to be a little cloudy and you're always going to taste it a little bit on the back of your tongue um but yeah it works sure yeah and then as you go down into the nano size and the nano emulsions that are occurring sometimes people use a combination of of emulsifiers which are chemicals which i'm not a big fan of but you know they're used in foods and things like that um and uh what else there and also high shear homogenization sure so that's like equipment plus chemicals is what you need there and it'll work it works just fine um we have done formulations that way we have some great formulations along those lines we could probably try try some of those okay yeah so i love it okay um so one of the other questions and by the way chris said they are using water sweet good good chris okay so next week we need to announce what our topic is for next week yeah i'm getting late and here's what are you thinking i don't know okay one of the things that i've thought of i mean these are things that we need to do we can we've been in the r d lab here now um what about going outside we could what about shucking and bucking we could do that yeah i mean that's an option yeah i mean you know most of the crops are in now right yeah but that where that would probably be uh like a harvest thing right so that would probably be what they need to be thinking about yeah we could do that yeah what what they need what the tools are that are coming up whether you're indoor or outdoor because now they have to start budgeting and thinking and what they're doing and you know you want i'm a planner yeah okay that's fine i mean that that's something we could do we could do that um the other things that we can do is talk about you know um protocols between the rooms yep i mean there's a lot of things we can talk about venting we can talk we could even go into you know some of the condensing potentially i don't think anybody you know are our super technical topics yep those are those are those tend to you know there's uh we could do some of those but i think we just want to do like demonstrations and things like that so what do you think yeah yeah okay so what what do you what do you what what is your music any thoughts out there we'd love to hear from you yeah okay so otherwise it'll be a surprise we will be announcing it in a couple of days what we're doing right and it's one of these three topics right so let's go all right well done great show thank you for being here look at all our resources calculators mini

first step is to make sure you have everything that you need out so our items are a three ounce package of unflavored jello or flavored gelatin not sugar-free I'm using two packets of unflavored as per the recipe that I posted and 2/3 cup cold water I've also got my lecithin to the side to put a little bit in because that is a nice fat protein that the THC bonds to there's a little machine that keeps it to a perfect time without having to go back and forth to the stove also has a link posted since we're doing super Lemon Haze on blue so let's again box tile I like to make sure it's very loosely powdery because it'll stick together I said it is a plant fat protein mini whisk mix all of these powders together enter water so we want to make sure that all of the gelatin is wet and separated and there are no clumps of gelatin that are still powdered the gelatin is mixed and 15 minutes has elapsed the gelatin has soaked up the water so enter the trusty little heater you turn that on I'm going to go ahead and break up the gelatin a little bit here and I'm going to wait probably about 10 minutes to come back and stir it again back quick search it's starting to look clearer for the record I'm doing blue for super-lon haze because true clear has a blue label just like I did read for indica and I did yellow for hybrid alright we're gonna let it sit another five minutes so it's been a little bit I'm gonna go with that is as clear as it needs to work because there's lecithin and it doesn't get that crystal clear like if you're doing candy but it is quite smooth quite runny I'm going to inject the super Lemon Haze truth here into it that has been so deep and warming in a cup of warm worth yeah it's tough [Music] and what i'm doing here is optional ma'am I usually pull that off but I'm going to pull some of the jello up in give it a shake and squirt that back in we all want to make the most of all of our product so I'm going to stir that in and once again I'm going to let it sit for five minutes to infuse before we put it into the molds all right we're gonna give it one more stir then because this is gelatin and not egg I'm not gonna whisk it super fast assuming it's going to stay in there [Music] smells like THC so the gummy bear molds that I put the link to hold about a milliliter you don't need to measure but they came with little droppers I'm going to hand this off to my partner because he has a much better non-payment you if you drip anything cuz it's silicone it's gonna that's basically gonna be one dose all of the little dots that end up on top of the silicone yeah kind of scrap all those at the end put them together it's almost like having an extra Bayer we use the opposite color or a different color than the jello you he's gonna go ahead and fill the rest of those up and we'll be back in a moment on to another bold [Music] we're gonna go ahead and stipple some cornstarch onto the back I put these in the freezer they've set and I've let them come back to temperature to make sure there's not a lot of moisture so this is my makeup brush there's a link to this this is the stipple the flat top that's what we're gonna stipple with so I've got cornstarch I just used the cornstarch lid they've got a little folded up foil and a paper towel in case I feel like it's getting too thick so I just went to stipple along the back of these and if you feel there's a bit much you can always go back and kind of wipe something away the nice thing about the brushes you can twist it and if you feel there's too much corn starch somewhere then you can use the edges of it so I like to know that my backs are good prior to pop them out I'm gonna pop this one out like so now gonna turn it over and show you the quick way I just stick my nail into it and pop them out and then lay them out afterwards welcome back to the final step we're going to say it's been 24 hours these will stay out overnight these have been out for 24 hours they're slightly smaller because they've now reduced down a little bit in size once they have dehydrated a bit as such I stipple them on the top with the cornstarch and I'm able to have them not to be sticky any further questions please feel free to send me a private message or post on the video however you'd like thanks", "5B74JVtSACo": "today's an exciting day because it's the first-ever cannabis drinks Expo thank you sir we are sold out it's thousand people attending here this place is packed with people it is did you expect this yes this is for the weekend warriors for the professional athletes anybody who really is just thirsty you know beverages don't have that cannabis taste that a lot of people think that they're going to get the drinks tastes delicious they work great and it's just a nice feeling how is it very good [Music] the size of the crowd says it all cannabis could be the next big frontier in the beverage world but it wasn't a natural fit every single one of these drinks is made with an ingredient that doesn't dissolve in water our first beverage you can turn it upside down and you'd see that cannabis go up and down THC drinks were a little bit like salad dressing so they had to be shaken and bottom didn't taste or smell that good it all comes back to a simple truth oil and water don't mix it's backbase it does not mix well once you add it to beverages though it starts out as the green plant we all recognize the cannabis we're talking about gets distilled into a thick oil that's nearly solid at room temperature it mixes well with the makings of chocolate which are also fat based so companies like Stillwater ingredients hired experts from the candy industry we've solved it before our eyes they pour these crystals into a glass of water and they appear to dissolve lipids cannot dissolve in water but you can do is coat them in a surfactant and then enable them to be water compatible Industrial sauna mechanics makes this contraption that sends sound waves through the cannabis oil to break it up into tiny particles then coat them with a slippery substance that stays suspended in water it's nanotechnology and it's the solution that's unlocked a whole new kind of adult beverage Keith makes cannabis Cola root beer and sparkling water for those who want a wave of refreshment with a splash of THC Cheers and bottoms up with the cannabis drinks from Tinley all modeled after your neighborhood bar our whole approaches and alcohol inspired type strategy so we've got ready to drink tonics stoned AZ which would be compared to a margarita they offered tastings here at the show of samples without cannabis oh yeah it is ice-cold there are cocktails and shots it smells very cinnamon it may be no surprise the industry's going after a specific customer those who are less experienced with cannabis but love trying new drinks craft beer consumers are perfect for cannabis drinks because they're into experimenting new beverages and though there is hemp beer and weed wine there's one thing you won't find drinks can have cannabis or they can have alcohol but they can't have both it's the ultimate irony stopping nausea was a major reason marijuana was first legalized for medical use because remember cannabis isn't only about getting high all right bring CBD into the sports world now legal in all 50 states hemp derived CBD is making his way into seemingly everything including this sports drink it really is calming it helps with pain inflammation Guardian taps into a whole other market for these drinks those looking to use cannabis for wellness so we wanted to go with the all organic no refined sugar they're going after the same crowd as eat green people come to cannabis to help them with their health I don't want to give someone diabetes while trying to help them come back eat Green makes cold-pressed juices in three different versions it's this the packaging right here the hemp drinks can be sold anywhere the first thing I smell is watermelon is there real watermelon but at dispensaries they sell THC versions one with a little and one with a lot cannabis products can't cross state lines so all these drinks are made and sold in California at least for now and tomorrow the world", "4k0qumqCKYQ": "hey guys it's Jason from best friend this is a demonstration video of the best one guys cartridge fill the gun that I have here today is our fifty CC gun it'll hold 50 ml and it's capable of doing one milliliter shots it comes attached with a heater controller this one currently I got set to about 110 set it a little bit higher because you know you have the heater on the outside that's wrapping your inside barrel and sometimes a little bit of a heat differential I have some prepared oil here I also have that on a heat pad and then I have some cards right here too so just to start with it you can clean your components and all that kind of stuff but it comes with is a 14 gauge tip it's already pre bent and we also have an extra plunger that goes on in the setting gun in the event that may be soaked in an alcohol and you damaged it you replace it shouldn't need to though it's very easy to disassemble and clean you just unscrew from this end it's very simply product so you install your tip it's a little lock tip Luther locks you know we can buy them all different variations and sizes so you don't have to worry about whatever I give you if it doesn't work for your products you can pick them up and get a bag of 100 of them for 6 bucks the cards I have right here are 1 ml they're also sitting on a heat pad I like to kind of keep my tarts a little bit warm when I'm doing this stuff too so to fill it it's very simple you just make sure you plunge it down into your liquid and you pull back slowly as you're filling it the nice thing is this will stay warm why are you using it ok grab my cards here you want to make sure you depress on the handle entirely sometimes the first shot is a partial shot just because the gun may have not been filled up or backed up all the way but there's my full shot there you just kind of keep moving along pressing the handle all the way there's notches on the inside of the plunger and those notches will ensure that you don't over pull it but if you do under pull it you will get a half shot but it allow them make sure you can fill each cart exactly the same every time we will also have these available in point 5 ml increments those will be coming very soon just gonna finish up this last one all right thanks for watching", "USaTmfTOxpo": "we got in there so this is a full-spectrum distillate this is internal tracking milli years you can see how many grams the CBD percentage CBG percentage you can see it's pretty high potency starting to crystallize here up on the top going along the glass and a lot of crystals down in here so that's your full-spectrum market prices right now we're probably around 2,500 and then this is for another client this is a broad spectrum that we just pulled out it'll start to crystallize pretty soon that's similar what you used in my broad spectrum yeah they're stunning yeah very similar 0 2 HC on this one and this is worth about double with this one is right now does it so look so consistent mm-hmm yep yep and you tend to get a like a bit of a darker amber color with your broad spectrum as opposed to a full spectrum which has all the other cannabinoids a little bit more of a heavy flavor even if you were to put it in a teacher we actually got some more of that stuff [Music] and this is where you do my creams isn't it this hashing that used that measures out the creams and fills our little airless jars this is where everything goes down this is the Boojum lab removing fats lipids that's right here that we're pulling off all my dad's yeah my goodness and we haven't done color Remedios [Music] it's fantastic cold oh yeah requires cold for the chemical process the require is cold in order to get the the fats and the CBD to separate they form a pretty strong bond and put it through a short cop unit and extract before winterization a lot of those fats are all going to collude with the CBD so in order to take co2 oil and remove those fats it's a three step process so you do it once the room temperature take it down cold filter it again take it to a smaller micron taking it and folder down to around negative 65 degrees in a while music these are all waiting for sociation Wow thanks to the tour of the lab and this is where you do the THC remediation yep talk to me about this screen yeah so this is a flash from at ography you know from bio todd if we were to go take a look at it you want to look at 3d take a second what are we seeing here so these are all different cannabinoids at these different various Peaks so we have to go in and we have to actually separate those so this is a first pass separating out the CBD and the CBD which collude together and then the THC and CBN which go together and then we'll do another pass which creates even more separation between the tea to make sure we're at zero and non-detect levels so this gets your CBD safe this is what keeps it below the legal limit and non-detectable if that's where the customer wants right correct yes", "PAk3eXM8VhU": "guess for starters let's put some water in the bond hey guys so today we are going to be sitting down and doing our second edition of flower versus concentrate the strain that we are going to be looking at it's going to be Girl Scout cookies or gse depending on where are you buying it from and what the hubbub about Girl Scout cookies versus GSC is I suppose the only reason I say that is because today somebody was just telling me that there has been like all of this hubbub and legal matters was surrounding the name Girl Scout cookies because I don't know trademark reasons Girl Scout cookie reasons I'm going to be sitting down and talking to you guys about the strain as a whole and talking about its effects in flower form and concentrate for him and then we're gonna choose which one I like better as a hybrid Girl Scout cookies is a really great middle-of-the-road strain great for the afternoons if you want to just hang out on the couch or if you're kind of indecisive but you just want to smoke a bong and you might get up and do something later I personally enjoy Girl Scout cookies most when I'm about to sit down and watch a movie and just kind of do mindless stuff for the rest of the day though again I do definitely like it as one of those strains were like I'm gonna sit down and I'm gonna smoke it as if I'm going to be lazy and not do anything for the rest of the day but if for some reason I end up having to get up and go run errands or you know do something I'm not totally groggy and like in the couch from the strain I feel like Girl Scout cookies is one of those strains that has a very familiar look and smell to it like like when you see Girl Scout cookies and you smell it and you taste it you know it's Girl Scout cookies umm GSC just has this really vibrant green and orange look to it it's pastilles are very very like fluffy and orange and Girl Scout cookies is such a like sweet almost like fruity scent which is kind of funny because when I think of Girl Scout cookies I think of like thin mints or dozy doats but it totally does have a very like sweet fruity candy almost like aroma it's taste does kind of represent that sort of fruity candy taste but it definitely does have more of a cookie taste I guess you could call it so the parents trains of Girl Scout cookies are Durbin poison and OG Kush which are two strains that I've never had a chance to try before so I always find it interesting to come across what the parent strains of some of my personal favorites are and just to see whether they are strains that I'm a fan of or that I've even tried or heard of GSC has kind of made a name for itself in the medical marijuana community as being a pretty popular strain for just everyday stress and depression as well as it's been known to be a really great just body relaxing strain as well as like total mind relaxing as well so like I said Girl Scout cookies can kind of be in any time strain I personally like it in the afternoon however I can see it being a really good strain to start your day with a fewer person with super high anxiety or maybe really manic depression on days that I don't have a big to-do list Girl Scout cookies is definitely on my breakfast menu so in Flour forum I would have to say that Girl Scout cookies is one of my favorites overall I mean it just has a really great look a really great smell and a really great feel to it it's definitely one of the more popular flower strains on the market I have noticed as well now that we've covered the flour part of this video let's get right on into the concentrate part of the Girl Scout cookies I have transferred my concentrates just into this little oil slick because it's just easier to contain them than the packaging that never had provided so Girl Scout cookies as a wax definitely for me is different than Girl Scout cookies for me as a flower I noticed that I'm definitely a little bit more able to relax with the Girl Scout cookies flower like I could probably fall asleep whereas the concentrate form of it is definitely a little more upbeat I notice I always find it interesting how depending on whether you get a strain in flour or concentrate it will definitely affect you differently or it definitely affects me differently I notice I've definitely heard some people say that they think Girl Scout cookies has a sort of diesel e or fuel scent or taste to it I don't really get that in the flour however I definitely do get it in the wax form I feel like in the wax form it also has more of like a desert flavor versus like a candy or fruity flavor GSC is one of those strains it's almost like a triple threat between the way that it looks the way that it smells and like it's After Effects of smoking and using it um like I don't know I just feel like it's such it's such a common strain and it's just like hit home for so many people and gotten on there like top three favorites I definitely prefer the wax form of GSC for more upbeat things versus the plot the versus the flower form where I definitely would use that for more of like an evening on the couch or you know like I don't know crafts or something I can definitely see myself using the wax form for an afternoon yoga hanging out with friends or you know just kind of getting some light work done around the house nothing too major nothing that I need like a super sativa for but all right I'm gonna have myself one more dab and then we're gonna have to choose which I like better the flower or the concentrate form of GSC and today we are devin on our xlb glass rig that we got in seattle this thing is like I was just shopping cases before I was sitting down to record this video I'm so excited at the beginning of this video I really did think that I had my mind made up already whether I was going to like the flower or the concentrate form of the GSC better I mean I really really thought that it was going to be the flower I'm like I think you know actually I think it still is going to be the flower form of the GSC that I like better but like that dad really threw me for a loop like I'm blown away right now I think that the flower is going to be the winner winner chicken dinner of this flower versus concentrate episode with you guys I guess I'll call it an episode it's our second episode I feel like Girl Scout cookies for me in flower form is just like a really great end of the day kind of like melt away the stress of the day kind of just sit back on the couch and watch an episode of something and just relax the wax form was just like phenomenal I'm still just blown away by how how incredible that dab made me feel so that's always like something that I'm going to be keeping right up here thank you guys so much for joining me I hope you get a chance to try the both flower and concentrate form of GSC or Girl Scout cookies however you may like to call it and I will see you guys again for another episode of this hopefully it'll be a lot sooner than it took me to get in this one after the first episode which was the arcade a train wreck but alright I'll catch up with you guys later feel free to subscribe if you have not ready give me a thumbs up if you have not already put some words in that little comment box if you have not already and I will see you guys later", "mPwBQcdKTcw": "okay I want to talk you through a step-by-step process of using ethanol and a Vincent screw press to extract CBD oil so you're going to start with fresh biomass so this is fresh hemp that's been dried it's probably 10% CBD you're gonna run add ethanol probably 33 gallons every hundred pounds and you're gonna run that through our screw press after the screw press you've got two things you've got the cake the spent biomass this is depleted of all the oils and everything else you can be left with the press liquor which has waxes in the bottom so there's that once you go through winterization you're gonna have your your pressed liquor here that's a bit cleaner then you need to reclaim to go through an ethanol reclamation process maybe rotovap or something and this is what you're gonna be left with raw crude this is raw CBD crude oil it's really thick you know this just doesn't move around this right here is probably 50% of that's going to be CBD distillate so you're looking at probably about two and a half kilos of distillate there so today's prices looking at about $23,000 sitting there so in a very fairly effective simplistic conventional and cost-effective process you can take your hemp to crude with the Vincent screw press you okay this is a darker one yeah you know we have them lighter you can see the color of that yeah yeah some viscous this is a 65% interesting here this one some of it so 65 percent by volume are CBDs yeah yeah so that's the oil so you can see so you can tell that it's it's fully d waxed because it's viscous yeah that's right it's beef with so this is the the quality you know the consistency which is really good and really high in terpenes this oil here okay you", "CzMHusSAZs8": "we've uh removed most of the sticks that you've got in here um a couple more sticks to come out you don't need to grind this you don't want to grind this you want to basically break the flowers up that gives more access to the cannabinoids that are on the trichomes in those flowers it's going to basically break that up get rid of the stick okay so here we have our raw material that is prepared this will not be decarb uh when you're extracting with alcohol you do not need to decarb so this is now ready to go into the jar and into the freezer now we're going to put this jar and this everclear uh in the freezer to get it very very very cold we're looking to start this entire process with the biomass and the alcohol in this case ethanol somewhere between 20 and 30 below celsius some people want it to be much colder than that the colder it is the less green that it will pull the less chlorophyll that it will pull but the problem with making it super cold is it negatively affects the solubility of the cannabinoids as well and that means you generally have to have a little bit longer soak time but in any case that's subject to experimentation by you the objective of this of course is to pull as much cannabinoids while at the same time pulling the least amount of green from the chlorophyll here are the two bottles of 190 proof everclear and the raw material in a freezer we're going to get this really really cold i suspect that we'll be running down around -25 by the time that this is cooled off this will take overnight this particular type of freezer has a dial type gauge on it as opposed to a digital gauge this allows me to run the temperature down to far lower temperatures than i would get with a digital gauge we're now at minus 27.9 centigrade and our raw materials and our alcohol are now cold enough to begin the extraction portion of the process so now pour the cold ethanol into the biomass i'm using about 1500 milliliters of ethanol into that biomass and you can see it is essentially uh submerged in there and i'm going to shake that up just a little bit and put it back in the freezer for five minutes here we have our first wash now what we're going to do is put it back into the freezer get it really really cold again and then we're going to run it through a winterizing process in the essential in order to remove some of the fats and lipids here we have the winterization filtering going on you can see the flow and this is the uh moisturization jar it's almost empty now you've pulled most of the fluid through the little vacuum pump is good enough for doing this but if you want to accelerate it you would connect a third-party vacuum pump and make it much much faster you can see that the filter has got quite a bit of sediment or some kind of debris on it and this could be waxes lipids or bio-particles this is a 2 micron filter and it's quite dark now we can see the waxes and bio particles that are accumulated here we can see the waxes and lipids that are on there this is the clarity and the color of the first wash we can simply put the multi-purpose lid on and begin our concentration and after boiling off we now have uh this concentrate there is still a bit of ethanol in here but this will be left to evaporate and then we will have our final extract", "K2-iRt-P6f4": "what is out so today we are smoking on some skittles skittles thank you to my lovely fiancee um she's is this to what do you use it for baby she got this for when I have panic attacks okay so she uses it for anxiety I am trying it for the first time so I will let you know how it hits me initially and after the second hit I would do the same I have a bomb here the dab star that is a little dirty and I would love to do a hand out of this thing because it cools down the hit dramatically but the problem is you lose all the [ __ ] taste because it's a little dirty so we're gonna hit it out of this twice it is set to 7 watts as you can see 7 6 or 7 watts is the ideal temperature for if you have one of these things or if you have one of these things you know this is this is also set it said that once you know it's I use because I smoke nicotine as well I find these batteries very useful I used to smoke cigarettes but but anyway cannabis let's let's talk about that we have skittles here this is an indie be dominant mix of grape 8th and grapefruit which I mean I know I'm reading that right here and that's care about that but indica dominant is really for me a big a big plus because I do have anxiety attack this might go to Frank's iid do indica because they're generally my go-to for anxiety I did the chem diesel that I reviewed in my in one of my last reviews that was sativa dominant but it gave you indica of facts but still gave you the sativa energy so it was kind of weird but I loved it it was great but what we're gonna do for those of you who don't know is we're gonna hit this twice when we have flour we hit the flour twice when we have dabs we take two dabs we always do it twice that's what we're gonna do and we're gonna hit this once we're gonna let you to the flavor we're gonna cost a little bit because I can't I can't knock off you know and then we're going to review the taste and the sensations you know the high of it the any negative effects maybe if you're looking for if you're looking for it to do one thing and it does another we'll go over that all that fun stuff so here we go guys let's turn this right it's my favorite thing it's my favorite part right here just like look at that isn't that so cool it's very cool alright so here we go skills Wow okay you know how when you're eating skittles and you just dump four minutes in 20 seconds haha and you just dump a whole bunch of colors in your hand and you pop them in your mouth that's that's what that tastes like that is who that is a concoction of very fruity flavors the hi are the initial onset when you exhale you feel very one feels very relaxed I feel very relaxed um and it's a very euphoric very giddy kind of relaxation almost it makes you want to sit there and just kind of tell jokes to one another you know what I'm saying it's Thanksgiving here so it would be the perfect time to do it but I keep forgetting how late it is honestly so and that's another thing about it it it really helps with it would probably probably be good for pain I can't say it to probably put no Meah alright guys so upon yeah I know okay upon the first hit I am because I am roasty-toasty um feeling good feeling nice it's it's a functional kind of hi I have a feeling that the the hi is pretty it's a pretty potent hi so I have a feeling after two hits I will no longer be functional or I might but some people probably wouldn't be because this is this is like 99% THC in this little [ __ ] in this little [ __ ] thing not this just this this this is this is the whole thing right here just for those of you who don't know I will comment below and let me know what you want to see more of if you want to see more reviews like if you want to see more flower or more concentrate if you want to see more of my fiance or you know just dabs or flower or you know if you want me to go over the devices I'm smoking yeah so here comes the second hit it's gonna be intense I know it is because that first one was pretty intense but all right guys ten-second inhale you'll see what I exhale yeah tastes very much the same but now now I I know that taste is gonna be on my tongue for like the next hour I'm just very flavorful very potent very awesome it's uh it's very good for anxiety and when I say good for anxiety I mean like when you take a Tylenol it doesn't go to the center of your pain basically it goes to your brain tricks their pain receptor to thinking about something else and that's what this we've strayed does you start thinking about other things that are more important than the pain or the anxiety or what have you and it does alleviate some of the physical pain as well both of my elbows were [ __ ] killing me today because I'm beginning to Train 1-iron chin-ups and those those are pretty brutal on your elbow tendons and this is definitely this has definitely helped my elbows as far as anxiety goes I'm feeling very relaxed as far as depression goes I'm feeling very happy yeah I would say skittles as far as the high goes and this one I know hi I can never say that right the first time initial onset hi very very potent I would give it a night at his head so two of those two of those hits are [ __ ] you only really need one but flavor ten out of ten definitely you know it's there there's these are empty but they're just little cases with this deliver so it's completely portable as long as you have a battery you know almost odorless very very convenient so if you want to very discreetly smoke your cannabis medicate maybe not off this huge [ __ ] thing but you know out of this I have a battery but they have they have much much smaller batteries that are much more discreet that are just little boxes like little squares summer just pen some are just pens you know yeah so comment below let me know what you want to see if you want to see anything and you know if you liked what you see subscribe because I'm gonna be doing more of these", "e6dD81GhgiI": "welcome back to the demystifying medicine youtube channel today we will be discussing cannabis and parkinson's disease parkinson's disease also known as pd is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder studies have tried to find a cause for pd either genetic or environmental but none have been confirmed the disease is characterized by a loss of dopamine producing neurons in the substantia negra which is an area of the brain responsible for movement this means that the cells in the brain that create dopamine are no longer doing so the death of these neurons causes loss of motor control because dopamine is important for relaying messages to plan muscle movements this leads to the motor symptoms of pd including tremors muscle rigidity and bradykinesia which means slowness of movement there are some non-motor symptoms of the disease as well including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping the risk of developing pd increases with age especially above the age of 60. the prevalence of pd in the us was 680 000 in 2010 and was projected to be 930 000 in 2020 with the prevalence of this disease continually increasing there's a need for new treatment options and cannabis could be a potential treatment for pd cannabis is a drug illicit in some parts of the world that has both psychoactive and therapeutic effects it is an umbrella term that is given to various preparations of the plant cannabis sativa and has other common names such as marijuana weed and pot cannabis contains many compounds known as cannabinoids cannabinoids are chemical substances that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body this can be visualized as a key which is the cannabinoid fitting into a lock which is the receptor the most common cannabinoids present in cannabis are thc and cbd cannabinoids due to differences in their chemical properties can have varying effects in the body thc is accountable for the psychoactive effects of cannabis and produces the high sensation cbd works to control or reduce some of the psychoactive effects of thc such as anxiety specifically thc and cbd work in the endocannabinoid system in our body which affects different parts of the central nervous system along with cellular communication which is why changes in the system can be linked to parkinson's disease currently the most common medication prescribed for pd is levodopa also known as l-dopa when aldopa reaches the brain it is converted into dopamine and therefore compensates for the decrease in dopamine due to pd however research has shown that some patients fail to respond to treatment with l-dopa furthermore the drug has been associated with adverse side effects and motor complications over time including involuntary movements called dyskinesias in the last decade there has been an increased focus on investigating the therapeutic potential of cbd in treating neurodegenerative disorders such as pd most human clinical trials have been concentrated on the non-motor symptoms of the disease including anxiety depression and trouble sleeping with results indicating that cbd is successful in treating many of these symptoms although less research has focused on the effects of cbd on motor symptoms a 2004 study using a survey aimed to evaluate the experiences of parkinson's patients using cannabis to help treat their disease the results of this study showed that bradykinesia was the symptom most improved by cannabis followed by muscle rigidity and tremors research has focused on various pathways in which cbd could treat the motor symptoms of pd a 2014 study using a mouse model made it an important discovery regarding the gpr6 receptor gpr6 is a receptor that is predominantly expressed in the brain and is molecularly similar to the cannabinoid receptors this study showed that a deficiency of the gpr-6 receptor in a mouse model of parkinson's disease led to an increase in dopamine concentration in the brain furthermore it led to reduced dyskinesia caused by treatment with l-dopa although this has yet to be tested in humans mice are accurate and commonly used animal models for human disease using the results found in the study in 2017 a research team tested the effects of cannabinoids on the gpr6 receptor their results showed that cbd acts as an inverse agonist to the gpr6 receptor this means that cbd binds to gpr6 decreasing the activity of the receptor and therefore leading to an increase in dopamine this research has identified cbd as a potential therapy for treating the motor symptoms of pd without the negative side effects caused by aldoba although these findings are very promising more research needs to be done on the topic with more clinical trials to show the effects of cbd in humans with pd now that we've discussed the effects of cannabis in the body let's review physicians perspectives on treatment of pd with medical marijuana animal investigations support suggestions of improvement in bradykinesia and tremors but this is unsubstantiated in human studies some patients have reported that marijuana diminishes some motor non-motor cognitive and or mood symptoms of pd 18 studies investigated medical practitioners perspectives on this none of these studies presented results that outright rejected the clinical usefulness of medical cannabis in a separate study physicians were asked to indicate the degree to which the use of cannabis is evidence-based for various symptoms of pd 87 of physicians felt that the literature supported the use of cannabis for nausea 60 for anxiety and 86 for pain responses were divided with regard to motor symptoms in fact only 36 percent of physicians believed cannabis could help parkinson's patients with tremors and 35 for symptoms like dyskinesia researchers need to clarify the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy with cannabis products or medical marijuana will remain largely without scientific endorsement research has to document the full benefits risks and clinical applications of marijuana as a treatment for patients with pd medical practitioners attribute a self-perceived lack of knowledge as a significant barrier to approval a study conducted by edelstein at al revealed that 95 of participants had no formal education about medical marijuana 84.6 reported being unprepared to answer clients questions that were cannabis related medical practitioners also raised issues about the potential for recreational misuse diversion into illicit channels the risk of drug drug interactions driving under the influence of cannabis and the potential risks associated with uncontrolled supply finally rey's concern for the health of individual patients was mostly focused around psychiatric adverse effects more than 10 million people worldwide are living with pd and the incidence of parkinson's only increases with age when such a large portion of the population has an incurable disease it is essential that we explore every possible therapy to help improve their quality of life medical cannabis is a promising therapy for pd and requires further research to investigate its potential as a new and exciting treatment for the disease thank you so much for watching also remember

want to welcome all the new YouTube subscribers and the Twitter followers welcome to the family on a quick note I'm out of flour limit so I'm gonna be reviewing oils until Friday March 27th let's get right to it on this video I'm gonna show you the GSC 80 percent THC card that I picked up from ki relief by delivery order I paid forty eight dollars for this cartridge and it came in at an impressive eighty four point three percent THC or four hundred and twenty one point six milligrams this is another C cell cartridge with a ceramic coil that enhances flavor the flavor of this card on exhale is sweet fruity and piney onto the effects the first effect I felt was a cerebral Head busing sort of like tingly that quickly turned into a big old smile on my face that stayed through the effects plenty of happiness from within that also remained stronger inner joy than demand that music and dancing and my pain lower to a1 through the duration of the effects too it melts my excit and stress away like a blowtorch of calm and I also get very social and sadi when I'm on the effects can I work on the strain oh yes and GSEs one of those strains that I love to work on it makes my day a breeze by making me filled with energy or extra happy social and lowers my pain to a minimum I recommend this strain from midday all the way through to the end of the night use I hope this helps you medicate right have a great day", "zbAY763zt4M": "[Music] hi there this is ally hi times concentrate correspondence over the last few years concentrates have become the biggest thing to happen to pop culture since well pot but as the popularity of Deb's continues to grow so the questions about the many forms these concentrates can take all concentrates are made through a process called extraction where marijuana's main ingredients are concentrated into an essential oil the main three solvents used to create Deb's are butane co2 and ISO isopropyl alcohol after extraction the resulting Deb's can look very different today we're taking a closer look at the three main types of concentrates shatter butter and oil oil is a gooey sticky liquid that can be kind of hard to handle while butter has a creamier consistency from being whipped finely shatter is smooth clear and solid all three can be used in vape pens and oil rigs but finding the right concentrate for you is a matter of preference shatter is the purest and most potent form because it involves a second extraction process that removes fats lipids and waxes this can result in over 80 percent THC however it also means that some of those tasty terpenes are removed therapies are responsible for marijuana's unique smell combined with THC terpenes create the flavor of the pot or concentrate your smoking butter retains more terpenes so it tends to be more flavorful but less potent with THC percentages in the 70s oil tends to be the least refined of the three this form also known as honey oil or butane hash oil can retain a full flavor profile however THC levels are generally less consistent unfortunately availability often determines what type of concentrate you smoke but hopefully this little guide helps those lucky enough to have a choice thanks for watching and stay tuned to hi x comm for more Deb related content including how to select a nail and the rig you [Music]", "3V4wLZjxwY8": "what's going on you too so I made a video last night and I had some technical difficulties so be sure to hang out you can see it you guys really didn't miss too much but all you really missed is me talking about my ingredients and watching me putting it in and all that stuff but other than that you guys are good and check it out additive you're gonna add to your base very very strong you don't want to kind of make do all this and have it just you know you have to eat 10 candies to do whatever you're trying to do you want to make it worth it spend the money put the effort in and I assure you it'll be well worth it in the end so it's been about four and a half five minutes now and we are just crossing 240 degrees so I like I said this doesn't happen super fast it but once we hit around 270 degrees it will start moving a little bit a little bit faster so when you're flavoring with this recipe you want to use one of these kind of bottles you can get them at a Seymour Michaels any arts of crest or you can get them at Walmart when I went to Walmart they only have peppermint cinnamon and that's not my thing but right here I have cherry and I have an orange oil that I like to add so usually if you're going to say if you're going for lollipops or like life savers or anything like that flavor to get that exact flavor like they come out like it comes out of their factory you want it for this recipe when you use a half of one of these bottles and a half of orange oil bottle and it'll taste just like you bought some lifesavers what the orange oil does adds a little citrus and it just gives a little brightness to it but you don't need that I did a batch with just watermelon and you know I loved them they tasted great it wasn't super watermelon flavored and to be quite honest with you I hate the flavor of water now so these these oils then they they taste great but I know you're probably wondering why you don't add it now so you have it all incorporated it's all said and done well this is a different kind of liquid than what we got going on here obviously so if you added this to a 320 degree sugar base and this will probably burn out see they want you to wait till 250 degrees to add your additives if your flavoring but I feel like that is just way too late of a weight I like to do at almost 275 degrees you're gonna deal a little more heat when you gives you a little bit more time because once you add this stuff this is going to cool down drastically and fast so and one thing you don't want to do with this is mix it around a bunch because if you think if you live in New Jersey you walk along the boardwalk what do they make in salt water taffy so you keep stretching the sugar adding air adding air what's it gonna turn into a taffy it's not going to be as much of a hard candy it's gonna keep out again it's gonna it could turn into a candy corn which is honestly not a bad texture in itself either but it just now we're done for right now well what I like about doing these little candies and gummies and stuff like that is these molds there's so many damn cool molds that you can pick up like a robot dude here it got lollipops dinosaurs and it's like pixelated dinosaurs are pretty cool I seen Super Mario Batman ones like Legos you can actually take the Lego ones and build with them so there's like really cool stuff you could be doing with candy and if you get really good at it you know pull your kids aside and you can do a day with the kids and show them how to make the favorite candies and kids blown away that you can actually make this yourself it'll definitely be way more impressed with this than a batch of cookies that Pillsbury makes just don't have any funny business to it so we're crossing about nine minutes now it's a nine 10 minutes and we are hitting 250 degrees so in about four minutes we only went about ten degrees so once we're all mixed up and our basis set we add our additives we add our flavoring the name of the game is speed and just I don't want to say steady hand because if if you know me I am the last guy to ever have a steady hand you can people will hand me a 2 ounce ladle got a 2 ounce souffle cup and say fill up some butters just the laughs at me because I shake but for some reason I can do this pretty well but you want to almost come down and just go in a line 1 1 1 1 1 if you're just all over the place you're going to lose quite a bit of what you're doing here and nobody wants that but I would say 1 to 2 ounces for this batch usually I do a 2 cup of sugar 1 cup of corn syrup and a half a cup of water and so I'll do it it's basically a double batch of this that I would do 2 to 4 ounces but this I think 1 1 2 2 maybe 2.5 ounces will be good all right it's been about 4 4 minutes later and we are just hitting 290 degrees so I'll check back up at the end a couple of minutes all right it's about 3 minutes later and now we just hit hard crack we're at 300 degrees so most people will want to go to 310 but we're going to 320 so I'll check back when we get there well it's about 30 seconds later we're at 310 so we're almost there so get ready all right so we hit 320 degrees so now what we're gonna do is so now this is a so now this is a hard Canyon and it's going to be very hard it's not going to be questionably hard and it's not going to be and it's not gonna lose its hardness from what we had so now we wait until about 270 degrees and we're gonna add about one to two ounces of whatever additive you're gonna add and your flavor so we'll check back in about five minutes when we get there so what I like to use to make my my tinctures or if whatever I'm going to make the most is I'd like to use either a leave o or a magical butter machine the the two of them it's it's perfect the you can perfectly adjust the temperatures and you could really make it long and really strong or you can make it really fast and get you get it done fast so if you're looking for a way to do it without having to you know use mason jars and stuff like that look into buying a leave out or a magical butter machine those two things makes the process so much easier and not just easier but it makes it stronger and enough of talking we're there so now that we're at 270 degrees we got to move fast so speed and accuracy is the name of the game now do not let any sugar touch you so first get all your stuff ready because you're gonna add at one shot so I'm gonna add my flavoring to my additive half I want of the cherry I'm gonna do and I'm gonna do half of the orange oil now people like to do food coloring and all that you don't have to I don't like it because I just don't like the I like the natural color that you get so this part you don't mix too much the more air you're gonna add the worse off it's gonna look so you got to be fast go okay so we're all mixed up don't know what to do let's go and then we pour accuracy now look guys I have super shaky hands and I'm go it's all about accuracy if you tried to reheat this it would still work but it's not gonna be as clear its goal is is clarity and just like I said if you reheat it you're gonna be mixing it again so you're going to add more air the more air you add the different the texture is gonna get try some of these but a nice steady pour and you could if and when we look you're going to tell that we didn't even have that much waste so this a little bit I got here and the rest I got here I can reheat and I can make other candies so what we'll do now is we're gonna is we'll wait and I'll give it about it don't take long about three minutes five minutes and these things will be rock-hard and check them out so check back in a minute all right everybody we're all done so let's take a look at what we got just like that all you gotta do is pop them out and move and look these things they're rock-hard they don't stick together nothing and you're really that worried you can get some powdered sugar and you're good look at that perfect so I got these little robot guys so many cool things you could do and I got these little dinosaurs so what I like to do is I like to have little ones and I like to have full-size ones because a lot of ones honestly where you're gonna find yourself like in these little small ones the best at least the parquet knees but like I said guys super easy super fast and anybody can do this you've got to get yourself two simple ingredients throw it all together and you're home free you can take these out in the lake with you and your fish and boom you're good but if you guys like what you saw today leaving a like subscribe don't forget to check me on instagram at the edge a chef and a lot of big things happening this week with medical edibles calm which I will be announcing later in the week so definitely be on the lookout for that because there's some big things happening I appreciate you guys watching and as always smoke on", "lxrhXWVQT_g": "what's going on guys my name's rich can see and I am a 6-time cancer survivor and founder of 5-time foundation and today we're going to talk about a really hot topic cannabis oil and dosing aka I don't like using this term nobody should use it he was the founding father yes but it's not called Rick Simpson oil it is called eco full extract cannabis oil and before we start this is gonna be a video about dosing because there's a whole misconception about it but first I would like to give a shout out to a very special woman who was almost like a mentor and she is my mentor Robin Swan Firebird touch therapy I love you very much and thank you for changing my life for the better so we're dumped we're gonna jump right into dosing okay and there's a misconception and it's you know it's 60 grams in 90 days or a gram a day and you know what I'm sure it works yes it does work but you're gonna you're gonna you're not gonna function Dara Daley okay I don't care if you smoked for 20 years if you wait 100 brownies you're not functioning okay it's tough and this is just a more effective way to have your body saturate in it okay I look really time with the white t-shirt and the chain but let's get into it okay well we like to call it what she started was a thing called micro dosing and this is a really great way to start and this is the way to do it and it allows your body to saturate in this and and it really absorbs it and you're still able to function throughout the day and do your thing okay if you're taking a gram a day you're gonna be tripping balls somewhere in a bush or they're gonna just be sleeping a lot like you know mommy likes her valium like one it always you know you don't want to do that okay my crack jokes in this video once in a while they might not be appropriate but I hope you still share it so I had this little card here that they made I kind of memorized it but if I look down at it you know don't frown upon I still know what I'm talking about okay so like it says here you know first of all I want to say make sure you know you're getting there there are people out there who mean well and they want to make this oil and they're making they're freaking backyard okay good stuff ain't cheap and cheap stuff ain't good remember that know what you're getting you want that golden color you know that golden tint to it you want to you know if you can get the lab certificate you know that'd be great tells you the percentages you want that eighty percent mark it's it's gonna work okay um and like they said you know you want to work up to 150 to 300 milligrams a day you could do the math you know five grams syringe obviously if there's 800 gram 800 milligrams in here per you know the deal will get into a to another time that'll be another video okay so this is called micro dosing okay and instead of starting instead of starting in the morning we're gonna start at night and we're gonna work our way backwards and we'll get into that so pretty much it's gonna it's called micro dosing I know if I said that already we're gonna you're gonna unscrew this top you're gonna take a toothpick you're gonna slide that just a tip just a tip like in high school you take the tip the cannabis oil eat it whatever your bedtime is an hour before bed I'll take it 10 p.m. by 11:00 I'm feeling nice it goes off you're good to go do this for two three days if you feel like it didn't affect you then you could skip the two to three day thing you're gonna go for hours prior which would be if you took it at 10:00 p.m. it would be 6 p.m. so now after that third day take that toothpick again do it at 6 p.m. then again I 10:00 p.m. go to bed guess what do that for 3 days another 3 days you're gonna jump another 4 hours prior that would be 2 p.m. I had to look down I'm bad at math ok so you're gonna start at 2 p.m. with the toothpick 6 p.m. with the toothpick 10 p.m. with the toothpick your fourth dose for fourth dose will be at 10:00 a.m. okay after another 3 days your body should be getting accustomed to that toothpick dose and guess what you can either decide to continue this way start it backwards or the scheduled start at 10:00 a.m. and work your way down to 10 p.m. and see how you feel and increase the dose every week you know I think I go I just go just go with it you know if you feel like oh I really didn't feel that drop at 6:00 p.m. take a little bit bigger drop at 2:00 p.m. but remember you can always eat more you can never eat less okay so be cautious what you're dosing cuz this stuff is strong okay and it is you shouldn't have any crazy side effects except rip balls and you know if you get really that hot you can end up like panicking I don't know or sleeping too long forget the picky kiddo from school I don't know whatever you got going on with yourself okay but this is called micro dosing okay it's 2019 no disrespect to the founding father and all this stuff that's 60 grams and 90 days is just a whole new thing you know and and don't forget this is the this is the basic way of taking it there's other ways to use cannabis oil dabbing it smoking it guess what for lung cancer yeah people vape this stuff and it's healthy for you okay and for cancers like I've seen like in the lower back or like cervical : you know prostate suppositories okay look into this stuff do your research me and Robin are gonna go on Facebook live and do our own videos and we're gonna get deeper into this stuff but this was on my head and there's a lot of you know you know they people don't know they're not educated on it you know and this stuff is medicine and it helps people and it helped me and I'm excited about taking it this way because the other way I could not do I was getting too high I couldn't function throughout the day I got fat it's not a bad thing some people need to gain weight and eat I'm back on track now ready to go so I hope this was an interesting video and I hope this helped you and I hope you guys can share this I will also

in our team meetings and client sessions as well so i'm going to be talking about marijuana and cbd and discussing kind of the pros and cons benefit of harm for anxiety can i just i think let me see okay there we go did the slide move for you uh i think go ahead i just i'm not sure if it's the view we want but go ahead i think it should be fine okay sounds good so starting off i'll just kind of give a general landscape of anxiety as well as cannabis use in the states right now so anxiety disorder prevalence worldwide an estimated 284 million people have an anxiety disorder and by anxiety disorder and in general that means either generalized anxiety disorder gad panic disorder social anxiety disorder or a specific phobia so an estimated 31 of u.s adults experience one of these disorders in general at some time in their life and an estimated 19 percent of u.s adults have had one of these anxiety disorders in the past year not on that list is ptsd which used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder and certainly entails a lot of anxiety um but i mentioned that because there will be some tie-ins later especially in regards to cbd and some potential research around ptsd as well so we'll kind of have that in mind okay so here's the latest graph i could find in terms of where the u.s is at in terms of legalization and different programs using cannabis as you can see 36 states and four territories have now passed some kind of law legalizing cannabis this could this could include uh thc based cannabis or medical marijuana as that or cbd all of the above these 36 states 15 states and three territories have adopted laws legalizing marijuana or thc based cannabis for recreational use and this has really been increasing exponentially since about 2012. and you can kind of see looking at our country here how widespread is becoming and there's this real contrast at this point between what's still the case at the federal level which is essentially at least on the book scene viewing it as an illicit drug and what's the reality for the bulk of our country at this point in terms of using it medically in some form or even beyond that okay okay so i thought i'd start off just with kind of some uh vocabulary because even i get kind of confused with all the different terms and and what's what and that kind of thing so for viewers who maybe aren't too familiar the base of what we're talking about is the cannabis plant which has several different strains you know uh most often or the ones you'll hear about is cannabis sativa or cannabis indica and within that cannabis plant there's groups of different compounds uh chemical compounds and one of those groups of compounds is the cannabinoids and this is going to entail both the thc compound which is the well-known kind of psychoactive compound that leads to the different effects of intoxication you've heard of kind of etc a different group of compounds is the cannabidiol or cbd uh this is the most abundant uh cannabinoids uh compound group in hemp but it's also in you know the cannabis plant or cannabis uh sativa but it's non-psychoactive uh it doesn't lead towards the high or the different psychoactive properties that you might traditionally think of in marijuana so it's been extracted and it's similarized and used for different growing health purposes as we're going to talk about the term marijuana itself is probably you know maybe the most confusing here because it kind of means different things at different points marijuana can mean the same thing as just the cannabis plant you know the marijuana plant or more often it's probably used as meaning a thc based cannabis product you know marijuana something that has thc that's used and you're going to experience the psychoactive effect or kind of a high from it cbd can't make me high cbd can't make you high correct in general it shouldn't but as we'll kind of talk about it isn't a really important point actually that comes up is um how we don't really have the exact science and practice of ensuring the cbd purity and dosage so if you went to a common dispensary and bought cbd right now not knowing much about it if you don't really know how much thc might be in it uh some cbd products have a fair amount up to three four five percent of thc and then it's just labeled a cbd another one might have some minimal amount that's that's negligent has zero in it so part of the issue we're facing right now is exactly that we don't totally know exactly what contains what's in a very regulated trusting kind of way so cbd something labeled as a cbd product in general shouldn't contain at least too much thc that would have an effect but that's not something you never know so that's that's kind of an ongoing challenging question okay okay so let's take a look at uh cannabis use numbers in the states prevalence has been increasing along with that graph that showed legalization increasing prevalence of use has been increasing pretty steadily there's been a 45 increase from 2007 to 2014. more importantly is the increase in what's called heavy users these are individuals who would use cannabis daily or near daily that's kind of what we're going to talk about as a heavy user or beyond daily multiple times daily that's going from one and nine to over one in three from 1992 to 2014. so that's a big increase that means that the use among users within the use of users the bulk of cannabis consumption is increasingly becoming concentrated around a smaller number of heavy users more and more you know as time kind of progresses here maybe you're going to get to this later but um there's often been a distinction that when they talk about a reliance or addiction is that there's a difference between the daily user and the recreational user uh in terms of impact um and i don't know if you're getting to that later or okay yeah absolutely most of these kind of real serious impacts we're going to talk about are going to be connected to this general term heavy user like you're saying in that frequency of use yeah which ties right into the the next point here which is that quote-unquote self-medication or using cannabis in a way that's beyond infrequent recreational and is used in a way to regulate or modify your mood or your affect habitually and this kind of thing using cannabis or marijuana in that way in states with legalization uh among individuals with anxiety and move disorders is the highest so what that means is in states like mine in california the rates of people who are using marijuana in a way that's self-medicating habitually is higher than states that don't have this legalization status quite yet you can you know i guess about different reasons why that might be there's certainly the proliferation of the legalization happening there's dispensaries popping up all over the point all over the place there's even delivery points that can knock on your door and kind of deliver your your cannabis and that kind of way without even having to go out or drive or go anywhere there's shifting public perceptions around it it's increasingly seen as less stigmatized as having more of a therapeutic value it's an all-natural uh means towards you know health so to speak is kind of what the perceptions are shifting towards and there's reasons they're shifting in that direction but the reasons aren't necessarily based off the research we have available yet so there's something going on there that we can kind of dive into a little bit okay let's see okay here's an example so this is i just did a screen grab off of a common uh cannabis dispensary website and this is the kind of marketing that you'll be likely to find pretty easily related to thc based cannabis at this point this one kind of says conquer your social anxiety and you can see six different products of marijuana on the bottom there that they're kind of advertising as being the helpful therapeutic ones for social anxiety so there's this marketing and social shift towards really viewing this thing as you know kind of you know micromanaging your high and using this for social anxiety and this for insomnia anxiety and this you know this product's gonna be for that and this is kind of the uh social and commercial atmosphere that's happening and has been happening you know for a while now that we're going to see is kind of way over here but in contrast to the actual research which is still kind of way back here so this is just kind of give a sense of what people are actually seeing you know what they're looking at when they're buying their products and the way they're thinking about uh using cannabis before they're coming into your office or kind of on their own this is kind of the this is kind of the focus out there right now okay so as we know cannabis use is increasing and more and more people are using marijuana and cbd to help with their anxiety symptoms so let's look at some numbers around this anxiety ranks among the top five medical symptoms that north americans report using medical marijuana for a big study in 2019 found that more than half of u.s adults receive cannabis as having a medical use xthc and cbd here's here's the important one though results show that approximately 29 to 30 percent of thc marijuana consumption was used to reduce stress and anxiety so something something's big is going on there that the thc this is marijuana being used that frequently for the number one reason stress or anxiety participants reported using cbd to replace medications to reduce pain there is evidence supporting that stress and anxiety and for better sleep and thc again was used most to reduce uh stress and anxiety and isn't anxiety one of the ones on the list for medical marijuana approval kind of well i'm going to go into in a little bit more detail okay go ahead yeah i'm sure i'll get there but at this point no not you know evidence at least thc based uh marijuana not really indicated you know as having a lot of research to back it up okay so this is kind of a surprising result like as you're asking because this marijuana has gained this kind of widespread approval and a lot of people think that as a treatment for mental health conditions and it's been legalized uh for many therapeutic uses you know pain relief you know these kind of things nausea uh different diseases but the research isn't there in terms of anxiety you know and stress but it's being used in this way so what's going on so what does the research actually show like you're asking should i be using marijuana that again this is thc based cannabis products for my anxiety at this point scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of or i'm sorry does one second my screen got locked here that should say um it is up there okay yeah so scientific data does indicate the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoid drugs primarily thc for several things pain relief control of nausea and vomiting and that being correlated in different kind of diseases and these kind of things and appetite stimulation you know especially in patients who might be undergoing chemotherapy or these kind of things can be very helpful for these things however a recent comprehensive review did not identify any really good quality literature that reported cannabis as an effective treatment for anxiety symptoms again that's thc-based cannabis beyond that frequency of use is associated with increased anxiety symptoms and future incidents of some problems in particular social anxiety disorder being one of them and we'll look at some more examples of this okay so despite the state of this research the public clearly reports using cannabis to reduce anxiety and it's increasingly viewed as an adaptive way to cope so why might this be one big reason is that low doses of thc do reportedly engender anti-anxiety effects you know this does happen out there this is you do see this and like you're saying a lot of people are going to report this and it's true low doses are going to probably in some most people sometimes uh reduce anxiety and offer kind of a relaxing effect however you as i'm sure everyone kind of knows you got to be careful because higher doses will do the exact opposite and they can often very commonly lead to increased anxiety panic um paranoia kind of feeling why um many people who i might meet with who described their first panic attack you know kind of describe something like this of having too much thc or being dehydrated and using thc and these kind of things so there's kind of this paradox with it where low dosage will probably be relaxing but higher doses are going to really totally do the opposite more importantly than that is that heavy use and chronic use like those heavy users we were talking about who use daily every other daily especially to regulate mood and affect it's going to build up in their system and there's going to be a sort of a dependence that happens where when they stop using or when they're no longer in taking thc there's likely going to be some withdrawal symptoms there's going to be anxiety altered appetite or sleep there's likely going to be irritability or kind of an irritable mood and irritable depression that can kind of develop and these are going to be very uncomfortable things and if the very reason that they were using thc was to kind of modulate some of those aversive feelings here they are coming back tenfold when they stop using what's going to happen further use so they're going to get caught in this cycle of kind of using it but it could become self-perpetuating of these very issues that they were looking to find help with around it so this is kind of partially what explains kind of this discrepancy between what the research shows and why it's so often viewed as a way of helping anxiety because a person might go through a particular night you know or moment and use it in a way that truly brought their anxiety down or they will they were able to cope with the social situation and they got through it by using it that way but there was kind of the devil in disguise there and that they were actually not ultimately helping themselves through something like an anxiety disorder by using it that way it was actually exacerbating the problem a lot of my clients say i i had my social anxiety but this helps me get out the door and helps me be social um and uh and so what's wrong with that right if i can't you know get out with without it what what should i do what am i supposed to do bingo and they're probably right at the outset that it does help them to get out the door right i mean it probably does kind of shift their mood or affect their physiology or thinking and they're able to get out the door that day by using thc using marijuana but is the disorder is the social anxiety decreasing over the long run in the course of their life or is what's actually happening is they're using it temporarily in that way but perpetuating the need for further use of it in that way and missing out on the opportunity to do something different which is of course what we do you know in developing skills like in cognitive behavioral therapy and finding alternative ways of identifying and altering and facing that fear in a way to truly tolerate it you know and overcome it they're kind of staying in the same place by using it to get out the door that way have you ever thought it can be combined in some way to to meet the needs well i think when it comes to thc probably not but as i'm going to get to there's potential too early to say but maybe you know using uh some combination with cbd might be effective more effective as kind of a combination i'll talk about that more in a bit but i wouldn't recommend it in terms of thc based cannabis products okay so we're kind of this is good because we're kind of already talking about this but this is um these are just some screen shots of a twitter feed i was randomly uh scrolling through at some hour of the night this week and uh the thread was around uh anxiety and cannabis and this just kind of shows some of the at times humorous but uh kind of perspectives of how people are thinking about cannabis use for anxiety so this one person says indica makes me so tired that i don't get anything done and that gives me more anxiety or another person wrote i prefer sativas so i can blame my anxiety on the weed instead of myself or another person wrote just like you said sativa is the only thing that gets me out of bed and allows me to talk to people without fear this person says oddly enough i have an anxiety disorder but indicas make me more paranoid so i prefer sativas is that weird question mark so these kind of show a couple points to me on the one hand it kind of shows that in terms of someone who wants to say is you know sativa the good thing for my anxiety is indica the good thing for my anxiety what's the right way to you know take it what's the good one uh there's no real answer you know someone might tell you there is but depending on the person the situation other compounds involved in whatever the product they're taking there's not anything close to a scientifically based answer to the rights weed for you in any particular moment or situation and the other one it kind of shows up people are thinking about it though this kind of is like yeah this is that research we saw that people are perceiving thc perceiving cannabis in this way that they can kind of fine-tune and is going to be helpful for their anxiety but again we're kind of recognizing the problems and challenges with that kind of uh approach to it here okay so we'll go from twitter to this more academic theory based model here this is by um buckner and his colleagues and what this is is just kind of a little bit more detailed and nuanced theory around this general idea of self-medication so this is a model for people with social anxiety disorder you know what the motivation for cannabis use or substance use you know would be so for example one person might want to smoke to get out the door to be able to socialize and there might be multiple layers of that they might be having many thoughts before they walk out the door of how am i going to look am i going to be judged is something bad going to happen am i going to know what to say in this social interaction am i going to get rejected they're flooded with these negative aversive anticipatory thoughts so by smoking or using the thc before walking out the door what happens to those evaluation fears they're just kind of able to be numbed out who cares yeah yes i don't have to think about that anymore and that's what it's doing or maybe the person's starting to feel incredibly nauseous or their stomach's becoming upset because of the anxiety before walking out the door so what does smokey do oh it calms their digestive system so they're managing their physiological arousal in that moment before walking out the door perhaps is to avoid social evaluation or some kind of negative social judgment oh everybody else is you know doing it so i'm going to avoid any negative social evaluation they might facilitate their social confidence in some kind of way or might just increase positive affect so there's multiple layers and if you're working with someone or even you know someone kind of learning this for themselves you want to think about in detail what's the function of this use for me without any pressure or judgment around it starting to think and observe how and why and what function is this serving or multiple functions does the serve in a particular kind of way and do i want to set myself up to create a dependence on this substance to manage this component here or you know if i want to find i'm involved in you know treatment or therapy or find help on your own or self-help it's like how can i know these functions and look to develop alternative skills to manage these evaluation fears manage that fear of judgment manage my physiological arousal what other pathways of targeting these components can you find for yourself and that's god that's kind of how i would um you know approach someone with this challenge here okay so in summary regarding uh thc danger is about over utilization particularly in heavy users for coping motivated cannabis use that's kind of would be my main thing to focus on take away from it the dangers they can create would be leading towards like i was just talking about to psychological dependence it's going to interfere with the possible learning that could happen by not using it and learning how to cope with those feelings and get out the door anyway which ultimately over the long run is going to maintain the symptoms of anxiety i can exacerbate the symptoms over time like we're saying through just maintaining the course of the disorder and even exacerbating physiological kind of withdrawal symptoms uh could potentially lead towards greater reliance on the substance or even an overt substance use disorder and there's especially high risk around chronic use in adolescence there's no reason are you going to say more about that um i i see a lot of that in my practice and and they're they're smoking alone and often to go to sleep uh or at the end of the day rather than in the socially anxious kind of situations of going out there it's kind of isolated uh alone um use yeah yeah especially if there's an adolescent who's in this kind of high you know high use you know daily to every other or or more then there's even some more recent research about how how dangerous kind of the long-term associations are with that things like depression earlier onset of psychotic symptoms these are the things that are being linked to intense adolescent use you know this is the time where the brain is still developing during adolescence and using thc with that frequency around that time is going to alter the wiring it can even impact uh there's some studies that can even impact iq scores you know permanently using it frequently around adolescents so if there's one thing to highlight to be wary of and intervene and trying to find alternative coping methods for it would be you know that kind of use in an adolescent [Music] okay so not necessarily encouraging therapeutic news for cannabis when it comes to thc based products but certainly some understanding of the nuances of it of how it works and the dangers of it to be aware of how about cannabidiol how about cbd what does the research show can i should i can i be using cbd for my anxiety well as terms of right now you know that same comprehensive review found limited evidence that cbd is effective for anxiety symptoms however in terms of this study limited is something uh it's these are kind of stringent uh terms that they use to define it basically it means that it's just it's brand new you know the research is picking up the past couple years but it's still really in its infancy and it's not grown to the point of having firm recommended proven recommendations for it for anxiety at this time that being said let's look into a little bit more detail on what some of these very initial studies and the directions you know they might point us in here and again we're talking about cbd so this is now the non-psychoactive compounds of hemp or of cannabis not the products that are going to be giving any kind of high shouldn't be at least that's kind of what we're talking about now okay so starting off there is this one study that showed cbd was shown to reduce acute anxiety assessed by a public speaking test in patients with social anxiety disorder so what happened was there was a you know group of patients who had social anxiety and they were kind of impromptu giving this performance task of giving a public speaking activity which of course would induce anxiety you know for people who had social anxiety disorder and the group that was given cbd right before acutely uh was shown to report that had an anxiolytic effect an anti-anxiety effect they reported less stress less anxiety giving that public speaking test versus the people with social anxiety who didn't uh receive the cbd who received a placebo so this is kind of the these were kind of some of the initial studies of what they're showing that acute administration at least initially it does lead towards kind of the subjective reduction in anticipatory or performance anxiety regarding at least most of them are around social anxiety it's an example of anxiety but it's kind of showing this overall anti-anxiety acute effect that it will kind of play and there's a couple of studies showing that you know at this point so that's interesting let's let's say these are going to continue and you know the evidence is going to build around it and we're going to kind of find that maybe cbd does offer this calming acute effect and that's something that's interesting but even with that i would say there's a difference we want to be aware of between uh what's helpful with reducing acute anxiety and what's actually helpful with something like social anxiety disorder the course of the disorder so we you know we want to think about everything in context you know in cbt we're always looking at what are you know what really needs to change whether what are the maintaining variables that are contributing to this disorder being maintained over time and one of them is typically avoidance avoidance of feeling anxiety avoidance of feeling anxiety and social interaction situations and again if we're taking something to reduce that anxiety every time habitually then we're still not going to necessarily develop the skills or shift in thinking or coping confidence that's going to actually relieve something like the whole disorder over time so it's interesting but we want to be kind of careful at that just based off the off of these i'd say you know if you're have something every now and again like a speech or a presentation or something like that and uh cbd is used every every now and then to kind of reduce it or perhaps if it was for anxiety around falling asleep if you used it once a month or you know periodically like that and it did have that calming effect for you then that might make sense but on the other hand the same i would argue the same principle applies that falling into using this habitually this is what i'm relying on to feel less anxious and without that those fears of mine are still just as real you're not going to tackle what really needs to be tackled to overcome you know something like a social anxiety disorder or a panic disorder or something like that but if it lets me get to the party doesn't it kind of wear off and i still have to use my skills once it wears off probably you will still have to use your skills once it wears off yes i would imagine you'll feel your anxiety will jump right when you notice it's starting to wear off and uh that might be a challenging scenario so yes it is good that it gets you to the party and that might be an interesting way of potentially using it you know if we were working with someone individually and that's kind of how we conceptualized and planned for it and the commitment was to still be there and use your skills or have an exposure to do something at the party uh perhaps it's better to get to the party with uh in that way without other than kind of not getting there at all you know if you can test it out and it would still be productive by the end of the night uh possibly possibly uh but on the other hand if we always need cbd and there's no growth beyond that if it stays like that then probably not but if it's in the service of building that exposure and confidence and eventually you commit and don't need it to get to the party then yeah maybe that would be a potential you know you could kind of work out with i'd want it to be in a very individualized kind of plan you know doing that with someone but possibly possibly okay good so this was another study a little bit different this study looked at adolescence adolescents 18 to 19 year olds in japan who had social anxiety and this was different from those other studies because this actually was over the course of four weeks and the individuals with social anxiety were just taking uh the milligrams don't get don't have the exact dosage off the top of my head right now just once per day over the course of four weeks compared to individuals with social anxiety who didn't take the cbd and you can kind of see these are two different uh social anxiety scales the two graphs and you can see on the one on the left the blue uh bars uh you can see the individuals who are taking cbd once per day reported a significantly decreased symptomology of social anxiety over the course of those four weeks same with the different social anxiety the level with social anxiety scale on the right individuals taking cbd once per day reported less overall social anxiety over the course of those four weeks so this is a little bit more interesting because it's not necessarily just taking it in that acute moment of performance or anxiety it's taking that's kind of overall a little bit more chronically which is encouraging that it's kind of showing these results but they're still no long-term follow-up on the study beyond those four weeks so we don't really know what happens continuing after that or if the cbd use stopped you know what happened from there so it's still kind of an initial study but interesting and good in the fact that it was more a little bit more of a chronic kind of use you know versus more acute use okay so here's some other interesting studies with cbd there's some initial evidence that cbd can enhance what's called extinction learning which means it might serve like you're asking about and we're kind of hinting at here in the future it might turn out to serve as a potential adjunct to behavioral therapies exposure therapies like what happens in cvt or behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders so what this kind of means is that using adding cbd to a behavioral kind of relearning process for example say someone was afraid of heights and in order to conquer their fear of heights they wanted to try to extinguish or create extinction learning around that fear or that conditioned stimulus so what they're going to do is we're going to expose to frequent and prolonged situations that involved kind of a progressive facing of fear of heights scenarios and what this study kind of demonstrated is that doing something like that but administering cbd even after some of that extinction learning had occurred so after those exposures had kind of shifted some learning that enhanced how strong that extinction learning progressed so what that means is that enhanced uh someone's ability to feel diminished anxiety around purifieds as an analogy but a situation like that this enhanced the learning to say that doesn't have to be as much of a threat for me and that's over the course of time you know that's kind of more uh longer term so this is really where i get interested in the potential of it because it might be able to find a way we don't know exactly the timing or the dosage or how yet but there might be ways of being able to enhance already proven evidence-based strategies to habituate to fearful scenarios or whether it's kind of a phobia or whether it's something like a trauma from the past connecting it back to ptsd there might be something there that helps reorganize the memory or in the learning or enhance it in ways to start to feel less less of a threat response to these built up fearful scenarios that people experience so this another study kind of showed a similar thing cbd may help produce an enduring reduction in learned fear expression when given strategically along with behavioral treatment so it's very initial a very it's very early on but there's could be this helpful contributory effect that cbd might play along with something like traditional behavioral exposure strategies to decrease fear expression to things like fear of social scenarios or feared past traumas or fear phobias or we might be able to find these areas where we can apply this and the benefits of it you need to learn more about exactly how but the benefits of really might help in the future to develop stronger treatments you know in terms of um other proven behavioral treatments for anxiety disorders so these are these are kind of the fascinating studies for me about the potential of this and if we can get this the studies going further and further where this might uh you know more nuance it and get some actual guidelines of direction what this actually might look like um these are these are kind of the exciting parts of it from from what i'm seeing here okay so let's kind of summarize a little bit the picture with cbd most current studies again still examine more acute single cbd dosing and healthy subjects so further studies are required to establish whether chronic dosing of cbd has similar effects well we still need to get more studies around that but overall you know the summary reviews really emphasize the potential value of cbd and treating anxiety disorders but i need to add to that we're nowhere near knowing exactly you know how when and having a protocol for it so there's need for further study of cbd in the treatment of anxiety disorders and what really needs to happen is we need to develop and standardize dosing studies to inform you know what the dosing strategy is going to be exactly which means how much when for which disorder and which situation for which patients etc again we don't still really have a clear way of determining the purity of cbd you know that we know we're getting cbd and the right one and the right dosage it's like we need to have ways of straightening that out but if we can kind of move in that direction um we'll be able to determine you know what cbd's place as an alternative as an alternative or again supplemental therapy of other evidence-based approaches like seaweed like cbt so it'll be interesting and fascinating to keep a watch and see how this uh this research and the subject progresses here okay so again here's my information and if there's any of course follow-up questions uh feel free to get in contact with me and i'll be happy to share what i know and what i learn more in the future uh dr young a number of people talk about using cbd for sleep and even ask about giving their kids a cpd for sleep what do we know about it helping sleep which is commonly going on with anxiety yeah depression well i think what the studies are kind of showing is that it does offer some of that's probably uh the only the only reference would be some of that acute anti-anxiety effect so if anxiety is the thing getting in the way of the sleep or falling asleep then it very well could offer kind of a short-term benefit of decreasing that anxiety which might allow someone to fall asleep you know easier but i'd offer the same cautions with it that using it in that kind of way um it might be better than you know the other prescribed sleep medications out there in the sense that i might have less side effects or potential for you know tolerance or addiction or other kinds of things but it still might not get to the heart of what you need for enduring skills and strategies or get to the heart of the problem for you know what's kind of driving the insomnia so it might help in the short term but i wouldn't recommend using it habitually at this point still or coming to rely on it or use it as a substitute for other great treatments that are still available out there to use that you know between cbt and mindfulness-based approaches and sleep hygiene and i would go to these places first you know certainly to try and develop that um in terms of children i wouldn't recommend that now i think there was like one one anecdotal uh study i found around using cbd for insomnia and a 10 year old but uh the studies are just kind of nowhere near frequent enough to kind of recommend around that for someone you know at that age certainly so i would i would stay away from that and if i find marijuana helpful for me how can i help getting not get dependent on it well when it comes to thc you know marijuana using it in that way do your best as soon as you can to kind of start to do what i was talking about earlier start to really look at and understand the function of use that it might be serving for you and if it's going down that road of leading towards kind of the quote-unquote self-medication or using it to modulate affect or anxiety or these other kinds of things then it's going to quickly go in a direction that's going to exacerbate the problem so i would recommend as soon as you can you know becoming aware of that you know trying your best to only use it in ways that aren't fulfilling that function so you know if you're using it recreationally or to relax or enjoy or whatever it is sporadically then that's another thing but i would recommend trying to alter the function of the use or if that's a real challenge to do and you kind of find yourself lacking the skills or ability to kind of do that on your own that would be the point in time where i'd recommend kind of reaching out for help whatever that's going to look like for you you know social help or friend help or therapeutic help that's the time to really say wait i can there are other skills and proven strategies i can develop to learn how to get out the door or to regulate this feeling or to cope with this situation let me try and explore those sooner rather than later before the self-fulfilled increased problems develop over using thc in that kind of way so that would be you know that'd be what i'd recommend for it and i know everyone's different but if i'm a parent and i know that my uh adolescent or young adult is kind of using daily and and using as i said alone what what sir what does that usually serve in your ex in your clinical experience um when you know when uh when there's daily use but it's really kind of solitary and and not when facing you know anxiety provoking or difficult situations yeah it it might not be related to a function of use for anxiety in that situation it might be probably not a social anxiety or something like that maybe they're just kind of using it on their own to regulate their mood you know or their affect or they're trying to regulate you know perhaps a depression by increasing that positive affect or that numbness or whatever that's coming along with it that would be the questions i would probably see as likelier to look into so you'd want to kind of formulate and kind of dive into you know trying to individually find the answer to that question with each person with each client i stay away from blankets kind of assumptions of why it's happening right try and dive into the details of what the actual thoughts and motivation and what it's actually doing it's a great question that's what we exactly need to find out for every person we're talking to is specifically what it's doing is it's shifting is it numbness is it shifting mood is it avoiding something that's all great helpful information to start to understand and and try and work with to find more helpful avenues to meet that need and one more question of um do you know anything about taking cbd along with other medicines not much research i'm aware of on that too much other than i know other than it can potentially interfere with some things but not that i've seen as being too much yet in terms of major red flags with it but it's i don't think the research is available that i know of or that i've seen to really give a strong answer i'd still be careful you know for sure taking other prescription medications or psychotropic medications i would certainly talk to my psychiatrist around it and not just start taking it that kind of thing potentially but um i'm not too aware of specific you know research on it well thank you dr elin this has been very helpful is there anything else you wanted to add before we finish up in addition to your presentation uh no that's it just to be excited to keep an eye on the research but to remain patient as the gap between the legality and the social scene of it uh is much farther ahead of the research right now so just to be aware of that gap and to be skeptical and patient before we catch up to actual real you know kind of recommendations for this but to be excited about cbd and the potentials at the same time well thank you very much thank you my pleasure", "C4yfrb4_BiY": "[Music] what are you this is your hos Liam dads and welcome to another can of hurry reviews you guys I'm back at it again you guys with another review we got the Dukes clear as you guys saw from those up close to personals this clear you guys is some super high quality distillate the saying that is in the darts just different flavors you guys this [ __ ] is super super potent it's a 90 T 90 percent THC clear disel it with natural terpenes the dupes always coming in hot with the flavors and apparel so we are gonna go ahead and dab oh dad this super freakin ridiculously gooey this gooey gooey they're just a little sweet in there my bad ooh so bubblegum the Duke clear smells like a very very nice natural faint bubblegum it's not super overpowering it's not soup and it's just super thick you guys nice clear start off with a nice sized glob really nice faint bubblegum not super super artificial smelling we're gonna go ahead and get into our first dab here I decided to bring two rigs out so I could just switch it up one on the other and there you can do you know something different so you guys can see different [ __ ] function that's I'm gonna be doing from now on about how the pork should be giving the email soon always have to see how it goes hope your guys's holiday was super awesome hope you guys are having a great holiday in New Year and Christmas and all that [ __ ] you got the new year coming up that means canopy reviews is going in full force you just hit my halfway mark to a thousand subscribers on YouTube really really stoked on that growing steadily we got our slugworth glass top hat chugger all ended up ready to go we got a nice dad near of that of the clear bubble gum see it's not a very overpowering bubble gum that's what I like I don't like ridiculous over natural turf trouble go they do we Liddy slugworth glass you guys already know top that mini chugger with the waxy purple lollipop carb count let's get it cheers you guys hope you guys are having a blessed day stay positive stay medicated and also I started my reviews on dead sober so I'm gonna get a full effect of the medicine so I can report back to you guys hmm let's get it [Music] oh wow bubblegum really really smooth you saw a big cloud was really really smooth are the innie cough Wow that bubble gum tastes really good hmm and as you guys know the Duke is coming in hot with the darts the cartridges the clear the edibles all that stuff Oh 3,018 right around the corner you guys heating up the slug now probably should have took a longer break oh my god dude one glob this gets you [ __ ] higher and that's what and that's another thing if you guys are looking to get medicated very very quickly and I can't really dab and choke on like a lot of smoke for those patients I highly recommend a very very strong clear or distillate the problem is is you can't really get distillate this strong how do I mean you probably could but it's hard to come by a really really good strong distillate is pretty hard to come by it's good go ahead and get into our [ __ ] second dab here nice little stringer of this bubblegum clear by the do whoa now if you go in a little bit lower ten so going in on a nice low temp really really really you hit like it's almost like a sweet candy bubblegum berry like it's super super fired if you do a nice little temper even if the a little bit hotter of the tents you're still gonna get a really really really good flavor I mainly dig in how it's not like it's bubble gum but you would expect it to be like super artificial flavor but it's not that's what I like it's like super [ __ ] good go ahead and get a nice final blob here nice fat stringer nice fatty Oh nice fatty glob let's go ahead and keep this laughs bad boy up so I hope you guys are enjoying this video I hope you guys are staying liddie with all the new products and hope you guys are looking out for more reviews I've been very very busy lately going on and doing handling some transitions in my life [Music] I'm now soon ready to mingle no I'm single now separate in my own thing about to get it really lady next year 2018 gonna get ridiculous third and final glob here of the bubblegum nuclear if you guys want to get super Liddy super quick and you guys like distillate or like getting high very quick the Duke clear distillate Oh 90 percent THC committing a solid 4 out of 5 on my scale really really really good medicine you guys really really Liddy look no further if you guys want to get medicated fast I mean I'm just [ __ ] hot [ __ ] 4 out of 5 man I mean I [ __ ] up too this was yours Liam dabs I hope you guys enjoyed this review of the Duke bubblegum cleaner make sure you guys pick it up natural medicinals or other supporting in the 500 area and anywhere else I hope you guys

we're gonna be making cannabis and to use powder so let's get into it so the first thing you want to do is measure out your cannabis all right now I'm gonna put our candidates in our mason jar now we going to D carve our cannabis so we're going to be using MCT coconut look at a cheese fool no some lava lecithin see your mason jar alright guys the number put a lid on a mason jar and then put this in a pot and let it simmer for about two hours so she's getting [Music] now we're gonna filter onto the canvas [Music] [Music] so now we're gonna add 1 cup of tapioca maltodextrin now I'm gonna add the cannabis if you use coconut wall to the pound so now we're just gonna double strain the powder so what we're gonna do now is test out this powder it's supposed to be water soluble so you're gonna find out right now hopefully I didn't waste my week making this stuff but gonna find out so we're gonna put a water in here now I'm going to ask them with powder [Music] alright guys so this is the

we're trying out our all-new L-SEP, instantaneous winterization process. So\nwe're not only going to tell you a little bit about the process but we're\nalso going to walk you through it and show you around the lab a little bit and\nactually show you the experiment real time. So if you look over here, we've got\nour bead warmer. We've got some crude sitting here. It's about 60C, we do\nthat just to keep it liquid. It's about 200 grams of crude or so, and what we're\ngoing to do is we're going to winterize this in real time so you guys can\nactually see what's going on. So we've got our solvent that we've manipulated a\nlittle bit here under the fume hood and what I'm going to do is I'm just going\nto take this solvent and dump it right in I'm sorry going to take the crude and\ndump it right into the solvent in order to show you how quickly this process\nworks so ultimately this is going to have to get taken into solution a little\nbit meaning it's going to have to dissolve within that solvent and once\nthat happens we're going to slow down the stir bar and we're gonna watch the\nlipids almost instantaneously crystallize and separate from your crude oil. So this is normal crude oil out of a hydrocarbon extract similar to any\nother crude oil that you would see coming out of a hydrocarbon application. Let's go ahead and dump her in and we're gonna have a little bit of\ntransfer loss here in this round bottom but we're gonna get just get it as good\nas we can and then we'll leave it alone from there... alright good enough. Let's go ahead and\nturn this stir bar up a little bit just so we can get it moving. So what we can see here is the lipids are\nactually crystallizing similar to how you would winterize in ethanol and as\nyou cool the ethanol you see the lipids start to precipitate - that's what's\nalready happening here instantaneously. And you can see that in most\ncircumstances the lipids are actually heavier than the miscella. Miscella for those of you that don't know is the mixture of the crude oil\nwith the solvent but with the lipids being more dense and heavier they're\ngonna fall to the bottom, so you're starting to see already the separatory\nlayer. And what I'm going to do now - I'm just going to turn off this so it stops\nstirring and we're going to watch that separation. So I'm going to go ahead and lift this\nup just so you guys can maybe see a little bit better. So all of that crude\noil is now in solution and you can see these lipids just absolutely, totally\ncrystallized within this solution. You can see try to get some different angles\nhere for you guys pretty cool though, so now that's ready to be filtered. That's\nthat's an instantaneous crystallization of the lipids. This can then be poured\nthrough any sort of filtration system whether you're doing a small batch, like\nthis like we do in the lab just on lab scale and throw it through a Buechner, or\nyou have a larger filter press whatever the circumstance it very drastically\ncrystallizes the lipids within solution and it's ready to be filtered very, very\nquickly. So if you're using a room-temperature process like this you\ncan generally speed up what took normally with ethanol say 24 hours at\nthe lowest say for four to six hours this just took four to six minutes to do.\nSo massive efficiency increase and we're very proud of the process that we've\nhelped to perfect in the lab here, so we hope you enjoyed it today.", "t_Wl7fN7eCQ": "welcome to 420 RX

going to look at several ways to smoke shatter wax and rosin along with the pros and cons of dab rigs and nails dab pins vaporizers emails and nectar collectors you can find all these products and more at the wizard puff com online head shop and you can save money with the code roughhouse I'd like to thank wizard puffs for sponsoring this video perhaps the og of ways to do dabs is the trusty dab or oil rig fitted with the titanium nail or quartz banger and is truly one of the most effective ways to do a dab you'll get a huge hit instantly and usually get the most out of your wax - as it's fully vaporized in seconds dab rigs might be one of the most effective ways of doing dabs but there are drawbacks such as needing a torch and gas to heat the nails and also a recovery time to reheat it now for the next tab also when you introduce open flame and exposed high heat into the process you also sacrifice safety to some degree dad pens on the other hand are probably one of the safest ways to do dabs these types of pens usually use quartz ceramic or metal coils to heat the wax enclosed inside of a sealed glass or metal cap these types of pens can be effective and give big hits but usually will take several puffs to smoke the same amount of wax as doing a single dab off of a nail another common drawbacks to wax pans is that the unvailed wax builds up and they require constant cleaning to keep functioning properly some vaporizers that are made for dry herb can also be used to vaporize wax to these devices usually provide a cup or pod that inserts into the dry herb heating chamber to vaporize the wax these types of devices can be very convenient but the cons are that they often do a mediocre job of vaporizing wax as they lack the heat that's required and the small pods can be cumbersome and leaky so it can be hard to keep the heating chamber clean for dry herb nectar collectors or vacuum systems could be considered the Dark Horse of DAB methods these types of devices use a heated tip on the end of a handheld device that you dip directly into the wax there are both electric collectors as well as those requiring external heat sources such as a torch one big advantage of the collector type rig is that you can get huge hits when you're dipping the tip directly into the wax but they can have a bit of a learning curve and a little bit awkward to use perhaps the biggest favourite among divers is the email emails are very similar to the standard titanium nail on an oil rig with one key difference the emails have an electronic control center to set a precise temperature and a heating element that will keep the nail continuously heated and ready for a dab the pros of emails are that it's ready for a DAB any time that it's on and you can set to precise temperatures and you also you can do back-to-back dabs without having to reheat the nail they may also arguably be safer than using open flames and are clearly more convenient than needing a secondary heating torch cons are that they usually require a power source to operate so it may not be as portable as the other methods and it's also very convenient to use so you might find yourself smoking through your wax very quickly and passing out on the couch very early whichever method you choose dabbing wax or rosin so long as it's free of impurities is actually healthier than smoking cannabis flowers by not smoking or vaporizing the plant materials you are clearly putting less unnecessary chemicals into your body and by taking concentrated doses you're required to smoke less frequently not to mention that the time it takes to do it to have is far quicker than the time it takes to smoke a joint bulb or especially a blunt but if you're an everyday diver like myself a nice email setup likely be the way to go but if you only occasionally dabber prefer to vaporize then a three-in-one vape pen that does wax too might be satisfactory or any or an inexpensive wax pen might be even better or perfect for the beginner just looking to dabble in wax shatters and rosin concentrates again I'd like to thank the guys at wizard puff for sponsoring this video you can save money on

preserve integrity speed and cleanliness are the key for an efficient assembly if you missed our mixing instructional please follow the link to the video once your mixture is warmed and ready you will have to fill in cap quickly so it's important to be thoroughly frapped some items to keep on hand are scales pipettes syringes heat guns wipes or paper towels 90 proof denatured alcohol gloves masks silicon spatulas metal stirrers and hats or beard Nets there are a couple of methods to fill namely hand syringes and filling machines while using syringes by hand offers the most control filling machines avoid fatigue and shoots consistent accurate amounts there are several brands including cool jars and Thomas Duke today we will fill with the cool jars a 10 filling machine for more information please watch our product spotlight video the a 10 filler has a digital control panel and thermometer first preheat the unit adjust the heat depending on your ratios the more viscous the higher the temp stay within a conservative range of 100 to 120 degrees Fahrenheit fill the heated receptacle with your mixture adjust the piston length for the cart size you are filling perform a couple of initial fills to make sure there are no air bubbles still trapped in the piston if there is you will hear a sharp fizzing make sure to leave some space from the bottom of the cart when you press the pedal to avoid spillage take care to not overfill try to finish the entire run to avoid reheating your mixture when switching flavors purge and clean thoroughly time is crucial when it comes to capping after you fill filling while hot will prevent large air bubbles also make sure the rubber gaskets are intact this prevents spillage during capping see cells feature press caps using a press we press the cap evenly account for a few defects once capped they cannot be taken apart and uneven caffeine should not pass quality control LC and his features screw on caps if you make a mistake you can always correct it place the cap on lightly and screw on either by hand or with a customized drill polish to wipe away any sticky residue and then on to packaging it's important to remember not all carts are created equal some have wicks that soak up solution so you may need to finish off with a hand syringe some carts will need to be inverted after capping storing your finished product will

to understand these compounds what they are how they occur in nature how we're extracting and isolating them so the first thing that I'd like to bring up is terpenes are actually a variety of organic compounds and these organic compounds are naturally occurring in all sorts of areas of nature the main things that you will find terpenes are in is cannabis conifer plants like pine trees spruce things like that are one of the most abundant sources as well as a variety of insects and even some mammals now it's it's interesting these compounds because they serve a variety of different purposes so in plants they're mainly signaling it's signaling for a predator to stay away or for a sweet you know delicious smell to be eaten by a certain mammal and there's kind of this underlying communication standard with these terpenes amongst everything in nature and in the universe and if you start looking at these compounds and where they're placed and what they do it's it's quite amazing the the matrix of what's there with that all being said you have other terpenes that are produced by insects that are produced by by mammals and these are actually produced in some cases biosynthetic aliso in many cases humans produce terpenes biosynthetic Lee meaning within our own body they come endogenously produced and our signaling receptors not only are they signaling mechanisms but they're also biosynthetic building blocks so a good example of this would be squalene and the steroids that are derived from that and things like that you can look into that but it's very very interesting so understanding these molecules and what they do is very very important to understanding why they're valuable to an extraction process and why they're valuable to the cannabis plant and with understanding all of this it's really important to know that they are anti microbials they're anti virals to help keep your body into a homeostasis into that balanced state that we've spoken about before so in many many cases there actually have a lot of similar properties that they exhibit on humans the same way cannabinoids do and the key to all this is that you get this entourage type effect and it's almost like nature's produced and packaged to this perfect little plant and this perfect little combination of terpenes and cannabinoids in order to aid a variety of medical conditions and bring your body back into balance now what we do at precision is we're highly focused around the extraction and isolation of these terpenes the extraction of isolation of these terpenes is a very special process because the molecules in and of themselves whether they're monoterpenes or sesqui terpenes or triterpene there's a bunch of different types of these terpenes but in general they're all very delicate when I say they're very delicate they're very prone to degradation they're very prone to really being diminished or their molecular structure being changed with any sort of heat any sort of excessive stress will say to that molecule without getting into overly technical terms so what we're trying to do from an extraction process is extract these very very gently extract them in a very low temperature and and do that in a manner that is going to actually render that molecule unadulterated in that extract well we commonly end up with as a process for extracting cannabis and extracting these terpenes that uses a very light hydrocarbon mainly butane or propane but most cases moving more towards a propane dominant blend not only we do do we do do that but we also actually take the plant and harvest the plant when it has peak terpene content and the peak terpene content ultimately is extracted with these very light hydrocarbons and we get this soupy sort of saucy type mixture and the key to this is being able to remove that solvent because that solvent is a very light hydrocarbon for example propane can boil off at negative 41 degrees and what we'll actually do is we'll just apply a very light heat so it'll be enough heat to remove the solvent but not enough heat to disturb or degrade any of those terpenes ultimately we can centrifuge those terpenes and separate them from the cannabinoids because the the two layers obviously separate able by the centrifugal force and we have a purified terpene compound and there can obviously be further from chromatography purification steps and things like that but isolating and extracting these cannabis-based terpenes are a key value stream and it's interesting to know that you can isolate these terpenes from many different types of plants now one of the things I said when we when we started out was conifer trees were one of the most abundant sources of terpenoids or terpenes in the in the world right now that that we know of and basically you get very high levels of Alpha and Beta Pi Neen that's why a pine tree alpha and beta piney and you can obviously put that one together but they also have things in there like limonene and lena law and these other different terpenes that kind of make this perfect package and turpentine ironically is mainly alpha and beta pining and it's used as an in cleaning a cleaning agent antiviral antibacterial and insecticide and for a variety of other uses works really well as a solvent in addition so the question is why can't we just isolate these terpenes from these high concentrated areas like say conifer trees and combine them back into cannabis well the answer is is that many state laws actually restrict the use of outside terpenes or non cannabis derived terpenes to be entered back into a cannabis based product so for example in states where we have like a metric system that has a traceability throughout the entire we'll call it seed to sale of the of the cannabis value stream they want those terpenes to be extracted isolated from the original cannabis crop and them to be re-used and re-entered into ultimately that suite of products that's going to be sold so understanding terpenes what they are what they do this level of science how to extract them isolate them refine them very very important to an extraction business it's very very relevant particularly in the cannabis space because most states don't allow for the use of outside terpenes to be reconstituted into a cannabis based product for traceability purposes so with that all being said I really hope you enjoyed our short talk today on terpenes hope you have a better understanding of what they are how they're relevant how they can aid in human health and conditions and how they are specifically relevant to the cannabis industry and how we use them within canvas thanks so much for watching we'll see you on the next video", "FsqTJZjyj-g": "hello everybody and thank you so much for joining me I am so excited to share this video with you I'm gonna be teaching you how to make cannabis infused oil in five minutes or less and you do not need any special equipment to make this happen my name is Andrea McHargue I'm a cannabis wellness coach and educator and I'm really passionate about teaching you how you can incorporate cannabis into a healthy lifestyle for you I offer private consultations I'm soon to be offering group classes please check out my website at wwlp.com so that you are always in the lead all right I'm going to talk to you about why I love this recipe so much the first reason is that you do not have to use coconut oil if you don't like it or you have something else that you want to infuse go for it use olive oil use grapeseed oil use butter you can even warm up honey and infuse honey this exact same way there is no need to decarbonise I will teach you really quickly how to dose this after the video and I want to point out before we dive in that the recipe is linked in the description below in a handy PDF for you to print out so let's dive in here we have everything that you need to make cannabis infused coconut oil we have 1 cup of coconut oil a knife a spoon something to heat up the coconut oil with and this is the star of the show so this is a vial a 1 gram vial of something called Rick Simpson oil so it's also called RSO that stands for Rick Simpson oil it's also called FICO's which just sounds like a terrible name for full extract cannabis oil and basically what it is I in most cases is its cannabis that has been extracted into alcohol and then the alcohol has been boiled off and you're left with this really sticky goo sometimes it's extracted using co2 extraction which is also excellent so if you can find super concentrated cannabis oil that you know meets all the standards if you can get it with lab testing all of that then this is a fantastic way to make your edibles because it's very easy the first thing that you were gonna do is to make our coconut oil really warm because basically what we're gonna do is heat up our coconut oil or butter or whatever it is and then we're just gonna squirt this in - they are and stir it around until it's dissolved so I'm gonna go heat it up in my microwave and we'll be back in a sec the coconut oil was in the microwave for about 2 and 1/2 minutes now that depends on how cold your coconut oil is if you're in cold cold Canada then sometimes your coconut oil can be really freezing so you want it really warm this is very liquidy you you don't want it boiling or anything but you want it very warm because this stuff is so sticky and it's gonna take a while to dissolve so basically all I'm going to do you can see it looks gross actually whew I've got it all over the side you just squirt that in and you can see how green oh maybe you can't yeah you can see how green it is and you can see why it's sort in a syringe it is so so sticky so I'm just gonna try to get this off I'm not sure what I can do with the stuff that's left in the syringe I'm sure there's a way to get what's left out of there out oh yeah this is quite green I'm not sure if it's picking up on screen very well but this is a very green extraction sometimes they turn out black like almost Atari color and sometimes they turn out more like this all right that actually seemed to dissolve really really well so I'm just gonna spend some time stirring it just to make sure it's all the way through you definitely don't want to see any chunks in there you want to make sure that this is really really well incorporated into your coconut oil and then we're going to let the oil cool down and it's gonna take quite a while because we got it quite hot and then you can use this beautiful oil for anything so the cannabis infused fake 5 I posted last week absolutely any recipe that uses a cup of coconut oil sure half a cup sure cut it in half if you did butter instead make some cookies or put it on your toast you can do whatever you want alright wasn't that fantastically easy I hope you want to dive in the other reason why I love this recipe is because of dosing so let's talk really quickly about how to figure out doses for this cup of cannabis oil that we have first of all if you have lab tested cannabis then you will have the entire everything you need right on the label so check the label see how many milligrams of THC or CBD or the combination of both is in there and then you can use the same process to divide up your doses as we do down below if you don't have access to lab testing and you are going to go for an estimate then you can estimate that that one milligram that one milliliter vial of RSO has about seven to eight hundred milligrams of THC total so that's a that's 800 milligrams about for one cup of oil there's 48 teaspoons in a cup I looked it up so that leaves you with about 17 milligrams of THC per teaspoon so that makes it easy to know how to dose out your edibles or how to dose yourself if you have questions about this if you have comments please leave them below it really helps other people to find my videos when you make a comment so and I really like to read your comments and answer them so please do that and as I said before exciting things are happening at reveal especially if you live in and around the London Ontario area so make sure you stay tuned at my website thank you so much for watching and give me some time of yours today if you would like to learn how to start using cannabis right away head to my website sign up for my email list and you'll get redirected to a video right away that will teach you in about 15 minutes what to do you can also book private consultations with me and please subscribe to my channel and like this video I really appreciate I will see you next Saturday", "GDgj4zVNub0": "so we are going to be doing a uh cbd versus thc delta 9 versus thc delta 8 blind test we're gonna have my friends try out these drugs and see if they can tell the difference between them uh this is purely for entertainment uh so let's get right into it by the way if you don't know who i am i'm chris with cbd extract and if you haven't tried our hemp flour before do me a favor and hit the link down below and you can grab an eighth of our hemp flour completely for free it doesn't cost you anything all you got to do is click the link down below to claim the offer let's get right into it we're not going to tell you what's what okay oh we're going to we're going to tell you at the end but for now let me ask a couple questions okay uh how long have you been smoking like a year and a half year and a half okay about six years six years quite a while yeah that's quite a while how experienced would you say you are with weed but i am not good at knowing types quite a lot of experience so i'm a big dabber so like um i get a lot of different profiles like i tried to switch up my strains and stuff and switch up like in because of a hybrid so okay i like to get a lot of different like experiences so i'm pretty well versed and he's from the uk by the way wheat is not legal there at all so he has [ __ ] weed [ __ ] weed in [ __ ] england they don't even have cbd weed there if they do they have to label it as tea because they they don't even allow cbd weed there so this is the first cartridge uh you're going to have to guess if it's delta 8 delta 9 or cbd and also you know just feel what you think about it tastes like ginger um it's interesting like it tastes like a flounder tastes like actual planters i could do your own i feel nothing it just tastes very like not strong but you can tell the flavor no but that just tastes like the ground it tastes like the ground yeah what cannabinoid would you say this is um it tastes a little bit different from like most cards i almost want to guess that's delta nine i really don't know i don't know cbd i'll i'll say this is cbd for now but i might change my mind so okay i don't know i get like a certain like throw hit off of the actual thc and i felt like slightly different but i almost can kind of notice some effects i could just be liking a placebo so this is the next card [ __ ] tastes a lot more like what i would expect a cart to taste like oh there we go right off the bat i noticed it's super clear i'm just looking at it it looks pretty concentrated and i can i feel like i can almost kind of feel it off of that suit and by the way on these parts we're doing a curveball because not only are some some of them delta 8 or delta 9 or cbd we're also some of them are botanical terpenes and some are going to be cannabis derived terpenes so we're going to talk not super vibrant flavor like if there's any terps in this i would guess it's you know minimal what do you think about the taste this is um this is delta eight would you say it's an indica or sativa i'm never gonna tell you that all right yeah whatever i get in the currency but it's just for like the flavor differential not really the effects i never noticed anything different [ __ ] does it hit strong though like i smoked delta 8 before but this is kind of different this is like that tastes very strong in the back of my throat i can feel that [ __ ] just yeah it's definitely there um this is delta a that's delta a i think the last one might have been delta nine because starting to fill that a little bit i'm gonna guess delta h [ __ ] i don't like that one like nothing like i can't taste anything really just tastes like is there a throat hit to it nope no throwhead okay it's fruity yeah i don't know and it hits good like very smooth it just tastes like him like i'm chewing grass taste reminds me a lot of like actual distillate like um delta nine still i like this one it seems to look a little bit like it unless it's just like terps although it does look really thick i don't know it's good though i like that one so would you say cbd delta 8 or delta 9 on this one um i'm pretty stuck in between delta no no no this is delta a not cbd i don't know that was delta nine which one the one that i just did was delta nine the first one cbd because this is way weaker than the last one right i'm not tripping like this has to be delta a i don't know you tell me man i think there might be like some cd in there too you think there might be cbd yeah yeah i think like the last one is more like pure delta eight if i had to guess and then like this one there's like some other additives i don't know it could be completely wrong but i don't know how you know the difference between [Music] [Music] okay hmm is that one clogged too they're all i feel like all cars wow that one hits more it's in the bathroom oh that one is like peaceful this is like taking him right before getting to bed i don't know whether it's thc cbd abc this is like not the strongest thing it's not the strongest like the second weakest in terms of like first impressions right but this is like i could smoke this like a lot you know like i could wake up a lot of bed and take a hit you know i have to prepare myself for this i don't need a big breakfast [Music] this is very casual this is delta r that's delta all right uh yeah or delta yeah delta nine here okay i always get it mixed up then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah interesting i don't know i don't know what this is but it's not dealt to mine not about the man no okay so final verdict finally uh which one would you say was the strongest out of all strong ones one two three or four probably two two three two two no i lied three was this one yeah three okay interesting and so and out of the one two three four which one is cbd which one is delta eight which one's delta nine [Music] cbd was the one with the little white cartridge uh delta nine was the second one and the first one was whatever okay cool am i right nope you're completely wrong so out of the four which one do you think had like the best flavor to the worst flavor um i would say the first one had like the most diverse flavor like i could just like pick up like those things going on in it and i think that one would be the seemingly one the very first one i had um and then the second one there wasn't a whole lot of flavor but uh it seemed like there was a high concentration of thc in it whether it's delta eight or delta card and then uh the third one you gave me it was a lot like the first one but it just had like a little bit more flavor okay cool and then what about the and then the fourth one we just talked about that yeah yeah yeah that obviously tastes like almost any card up there interesting all right well hey that's you were actually spot on that everything was right oh okay then i'd say that's you'd say this is delta nine yeah and then this the third the middle one was dr eight and then the last one was the first one yeah okay we got that right i did she got everything right yeah oh my god yes so there you have it hope you enjoyed the video if you want to see more videos like this subscribe and hit the like and you will see more videos

medicines sublingually this is done by putting a cannabis extract usually a tension under your tongue or rubbing it on your gums and letting it absorb there for a few minutes taking your medicine this way allows the extract to go straight into your bloodstream without passing through your stomach or your digestive tract now this is useful because it offers high bioavailability it has a longer effect at inhalation and is a really clean way to take medicine this intake method has a wide range of uses and it's a wonderful way to start your relationship with cannabis it's predictable and hasn't even killed onset and this can be really useful for a more subtle effect for instance when taken for general lifestyle enhancement here are some key things to keep in mind with sublingual intake products use sublingually come in the form of tinctures infusions or concentrates this method allows for extremely accurate doses tinctures are often measured by the drop and concentrates by weight and if you're using a concentrate we recommend that you use a high-quality digital scale as well because this will really help you with your accuracy it's really important to use clean safe medicine and be aware that not all cannabis extracts are created equally the concentration levels and the extract processes can vary quite a bit and as always we recommend lab tested as best as you can easily see what you're getting now the onset time with sublingual in takers generally between ten and thirty minutes and depending on your goals we suggest starting with a minimal dose and if more is wanted or needed you can easily increase in a really short period of time now if taking a THC dominant cannabis oil there is likely to be some cycle activity you may like to go back and revisit the introduction to cannabis intake methods video in which we shared some typical effects of psycho activity tinctures are typically dissolved in either olive oil coconut oil or alcohol we like the oil versions because cannabis interacts really well with fats and they also tend to be a little bit more pleasant to take as well in terms of taste today we have some examples of tinctures infused oils and concentrates to show you and they're going to demonstrate how to measure your dose and take each of them sublingually so let's get acquainted with products that can be used for sublingual use now remember sublingual use is when you put a product under your tongue or on your gums and inner cheek so that it can be absorbed into your body now today I'm going to show you concentrates as well as liquids or tinctures that can be used for something we'll use before I get into those specifically I want to make a point really with sublingual use and with any of these products you know the form of the product whether it's a concentrate that hasn't been dead looted into any other substance or a tincture for example that has been diluted into something like alcohol olive oil or coconut oil but remember no matter the form of the product you don't necessarily know by looking at it how concentrated it is you can dose it but without knowing the concentration of cannabis within that specific product you won't know exactly how many milligrams you're taking so it's a little bit of what we're gonna get into today now concentrates obviously from their name are one of the most potent purest form of cannabis usually this is a pure form of cannabis that has been extracted from the plant either from bud from shake or any other forms of the plant itself now given that how highly concentrated the medicine is you really want to be careful with it and be able to measure it one way to do that is through the syringe where it has actual measurements but the other tool you want to use is a digital scale so that you know exactly how concentrated the medicine is inside as well as the exact weight that you're getting when you take when you actually put it in your body and those two combinations of pieces of information really tell you what dose you're taking and that way you can track what dose measure its effects and then dose effectively going forward now a great way to do this for concentrates is to use a piece of a rice paper now rice paper paper because it's edible and it dissolves in your mouth and that way you can actually get to concentrate on the scale put it onto the rice paper weigh it know what you're taking and then simply put it into your mouth under your tongue and let it dissolve there that way it's not messy rice paper is also great if you want to just measure your medicine once maybe put it in the fridge or the freezer and then take it later you can have those doses for yourself ready for at a later date so that you don't have to create as much of a mess these products can be a little bit hard to deal with they're a little bit of molasses II as you can see from the color of this all right so constantly it's very effective usually they're used for much more severe conditions when you're trying to get much higher dose of medicine into your body let's move on to liquids or sometimes called tinctures now these can be infused into a number of liquids as I mentioned that you're usually alcohol or oils which can be usually coconut oil or olive oil what happens with this process is the medicine is extracted through various methods there's co2 there's butane there's other alcohol extracts and then that concentrate is then infused back into an oil or they leave a little bit of the alcohol and put it back into alcohol that way diluting the medicine a little bit to be able to take and be taken in liquid form when taking it's pretty intuitive it's nice because you can dose the medicine very effectively with the dropper now ideally your dropper has some type of measuring mechanism on it so you know exactly the milliliters that you're taking and can dose that again you really want to know how concentrated you dis medicine is it could have for example one corner oil and a lot of medicine that's a very concentrated tincture it could have you know 95% oil and 5% medicine those are very different products very different medicines depending on the dose okay so pay attention to that know from your labels and from your medicine providers how concentrated that medicine is now when taking medicine simply put it on your tongue as mentioned let it absorb there and that's how you can take a sublingual tincture all in all sublingual medicine is a great way to take medicine get it into your body effectively with high bioavailability remember the points that we touched on it's really important to know how concentrated your medicine is and it's important to measure it effectively to be able to track", "JxmiRvJ0SS0": "people often ask the question what is the difference between cbn cbg cbd or what is cbn versus cbg versus cbd i like to put them all into the natural health products box although cbn cbg and cbd are all cannabinoids they are all different in that they have specific characteristics and therapeutic properties today we'll talk about those differences so that you can have a better understanding which will enable you to pick the one that most fits your needs the rules regulations and even beliefs for medical marijuana have changed vastly over the last few years hence the surge in studies being done on the therapeutic properties of cannabis let's start by looking at cbd what is it its full name is cannabidiol it is a cannabinoid found in marijuana science has discovered that cbd helps in the treatment of symptoms of anxiety pain insomnia epilepsy the therapeutic benefits include anti-inflammatory analgesic anti-anxiety and seizure suppressant properties cbd is also one of the few substances that has a proven neurogenic factor yes cannabidiol can help your brain grow brain cells even in the adult phase it is easily extracted from cannabis hemp oils are cbd rich concentrates with 0.3 percent thc or less have been labeled for essential use in this covid19 pandemic and are even legal on a federal level now let's look at cbn this was the first cannabinoid to be identified by scientists research into cbn is still not as developed as in thc and cbd studies but it's evolving all the time there are a number of indications that cbn is a potential treatment to a myriad of illnesses it also has many essential properties mainly antibacterial anti-inflammatory anti-convulsant and appetite stimulant and research also suggests that cbn can play a role in bone healing and growth it doesn't have as much psychoactive effect as thc has and in fact some say it has none it comes from aged marijuana strains and some say cannabis age as well like a fine wine i guess it is debatable whether the older strains like cbn have more sedative properties than the younger ones opinions are split on this one lastly there's cbg its full name is cannabigrol also known as the stem cell of cannabis it is an acid that is present in marijuana strains in the early stages of development of the flower its decomposition forms a variety of other smaller acids and these acids formed from cbg can turn into either cbd thc etc similar to stem cells that can transform into every other cell of the human body cannabigrol has similar properties it can turn into a wide variety of major and minor cannabinoids it is intriguing to both scientists and doctors and is also in high demand for many people who are prescribed with marijuana based treatments especially for neurological and psychiatric issues research tells us that cbg boosts the bliss neuroreceptor and andamide the neuroreceptor plays a role in pain depression appetite memory and fertility it is also being evaluated to treat huntington's disease cancer and bacteria like staphylococcus it's completely legal and safe to use as well as a non-intoxicating cannabinoid for more information on any products derived from cbn vcbg vcbd look on or around this page for links to information and places to make a purchase of these products remember to consult your doctor before using any products mentioned in this video now that we have a better understanding of what the three cannabinoids are else should mention that there are in fact over 100 different cannabinoids in the hemp plant the ones we are discussing are among the most popular cannabinoids the key difference between the cannabinoids depends on how psychoactive they are for instance cbd and cbg are not psychologically active whereas cbn and other cannabinoids vary in their level of psychoactivity cbd is the most notable cannabinoid and has significant anti-anxiety effects that also counteract the mental side effects of thc the receptors in our bodies become reactive when exposed to cannabinoids meaning they're able to affect key body processes including mood memory appetite and pain cbg is thought to naturally increase dopamine levels which help to regulate sleep mood and appetite and is also thought to obstruct gaba uptake in the brain and block serotonin receptors both positive implications for the treatment of anxiety and depression cbn even though it is derived from thc doesn't share the psychoactive properties of thc meaning you won't get high from cbn alone it has been studied extensively as a helpful compound to improve sleep health as some studies show it acts as a powerful sedative with effects comparable to common sleep inducing pharmaceuticals like diazepam you may find yourself a bit overwhelmed by all this information on common cannabinoids and wondering how you can find the cbd compound that's right for you and your body needs well with so many cannabinoids to choose from there's likely one to address nearly any concern you will just need to narrow down your choices so start with your symptoms for many common ailments including pain inflammation anxiety sleep issues eczema and acne cbd is an option

at home in this video we will show you a quick easy vegan gummy alternative that sets up in minutes and only requires a few ingredients plus whatever cannabis distillate or infused oil that you'd like to use because this recipe is vegan and it's so simple these gummies do have a different consistency from traditional gummies but for those with dietary restrictions it's a great option this recipe is going to use a powder called agar agar or it can be simply shortened to agar this is a powder that you can buy online or from health food stores agar is derived from a type of algae so it's vegan friendly anyway let's get into the process first get all of your ingredients together you'll need one cup of fruit juice this will be the base of your vegan gummies you can use any flavor but in this video i used a tropical mango juice blend you can get creative and use any type of juice that you want and the type of juice you use will determine the flavor and color of your gummies two tablespoons of white sugar or agave syrup this will help to add sweetness 2 tablespoons of agar agar powder and this is what gives the gummies their gummy texture liquid or powder lecithin this is an emulsifier which will help to combine your oil-based cannabis concentrate and the juice which is water-based since water and oil don't mix on their own you probably need to use an emulsifier in order to make sure that everything gets mixed well you'll also need an activated cannabis concentrate you can use a cbd oil a thc distillate infused coconut oil just anything that's an activated cannabis concentrate here are the directions in a small saucepan whisk together the fruit juice with sweetener and agar agar powder bring this to a simmer while stirring constantly simmer for 3 minutes while whisking to avoid lumps remove the mixture from the heat and allow to cool slightly add in as much or as little cannabis oil as needed i'm adding about 100 milligrams of cbd to this batch and then you'll stir it well use a dropper that comes with your gummy molds to fill the molds with the liquid and place in the fridge for 30 minutes to an hour remove the candies from the molds and enjoy be sure to store remaining gummies in the fridge in an airtight container for up to two weeks discard them if any of the gummies show any signs of mold before two weeks this recipe is so easy anyone can do it if you have a hard time finding a gar powder or lecithin for this recipe we recommend checking with your local health food store or supplement store so there you have it infused vegan alternative gummies at home using just a few ingredients but this is just one way that you can pre-dose your cannabis oil into bite-size little bits and store them in the fridge so then you'll have

lab i'm going to be talking today about what is delta eight delta eight is a form of thc that really is a little bit different from a delta nine thc delta nine thc everybody knows that's the thc that makes you guys has some psychoactive effects it's also the main psychoactive ingredient within the marijuana plant and what delta eight is is it's a form or an isomer of that delta nine thc the reason it's been talked about a lot is because a lot of people are using hemp and derivatives of him to create a delta eight thc and they're doing this with some organic synthesis jiu-jitsu really in the laboratory and they're taking cbd and converting it over to delta 8 on thc the reason they're doing that is because the delta atfc of course has some of the same psychoactive effects that delta 9 phc has albeit they can be quite attenuated from delta a lot of people would say it has like a mellow effect so they're using hemp derived materials um they're hooking it up and they're processing it to the point where it now is converting into a delta eight thc molecule that then they can formulate into vapors or gummies or whatever that is that they're looking to formulate for so that's really what delta eight thc is when you look at it just look at it just look at it it's actually an oil and it looks a lot like a cbd oil or it looks a lot like a thc oil you've seen some nice golden pictures of some of that oils as they're flowing out the oil itself is a little bit more biscuit so it's very very thick hard before you need to really heat it up in order to pour it if you want to make products associated with a delta eight a couple different things you need to be thinking about the first thing is you gotta make sure that there's no delta not in your product because the law says that you have to have less than 0.3 delta 9 thc if you have a delta h thc and you have too much delta 9 in it you're not going to be able to use that product for your vapor or you need to dilute it down so that it doesn't have too much delta line in it that really is delta eight how you can use it the oils they look beautiful for them and you can formulate them into different products like that so really guys that's what delta 8 is all about please subscribe to our channel on youtube like us on instagram we have all kinds of calculators for you guys to use on our website we have guides i don't know a lot of people don't know this but we have guide after guide after guide for you guys we have extraction guides we have distillation guides we have a hemp curing guide go to our website you'll

high-quality MCT oil using some canvas so there is a couple of steps to this and we do need a couple of different things so everything that we are going to be I have right here in front of us so we're going to need a crock pot for using this method of the making our empty tio which is a batch to the have right here this is some very potent stuff I found this out last night you're supposed to start low and go slow I definitely suggest doing that so when you're going to need for this is some MCT oil that you could pick up if you're in Canada at GNC health has some pretty cheap or if you go to probably any local health food store they're probably gonna have this stuff you're going to need some cannabis depending on how much you want the rear there are calculators out there and I will put a link for a calculator to kind of give you a rough estimate of how potent your your things are going to be like let's if you want to make gummies or stuff like that so I'm gonna put the calculator below and it'll basically just help you decide what you're going to do now when I made this little here I used 38 grams of cannabis as well as I don't know probably like three four grams of Keef and just the mixture of other candidates that I had around so it was pretty potent stuff so if you're going to use okay so to start we need to talk about D carving your cannabis or decarboxylation it's basically turning your THC a into THC which is what you are really looking to do if you're going to ingest cannabis now if you don't decarboxylate it really won't do much for you so what we're going to do so I guess what I should say is you have a couple of different methods of being able to decrypt leave so you can use the crockpot method because on high they usually heat up to around 220 degrees you put it in a calendar and you just put it there thank you news [Music] okay so there are a couple of different ways that you can be box decarboxylate your cannabis so you could either put it into a canning jar you can put it onto a cookie sheet or something like that or something like this here silicone cookie sheet and you can put this in your oven for about an hour at 225 degrees and that will decarboxylate your canvas this is the method that I chose to do this because when you do it inside of a canning jar with the lid closed you were actually keeping in the terpenes now if you were to just decarboxylate on a cookie sheet throw down a silicone on top of that that put your cannabis right on it you are actually going to lose your turkeys you're going to strip them out of your oil and that's something that I did not want to do so the canning jar method for this instance is a pretty good way of doing that because if you're doing your infusion in the same jar that you decarboxylated it you're going to keep all of your terpenes inside your jar which is great so let's start the process so in the oven 220 degrees for an hour what you're going to do is want to take this out every 15 minutes set an alarm and you're gonna want to turn your jar just kind of shake it up make sure that it's kind of everywhere mixed up and every half hour you're gonna want to burp the jar so you're only gonna burp it once burp it in the first half hour period then you take your cannabis out of the oven you are pretty much good to go so I have some footage that I use the making this oil here and this here is a pretty potent oil I had some last night and I can honestly tell you that you should probably really start slow and go from there don't don't overdo it I made some gummies and just like licking the spoons and the bowls I think I got my fill so yeah make some pretty potent oil and that's we're planning on doing here today it's you know so let's get started and we'll go from here [Music] so the reason why I'm wishing it up like this is because I have 473 milliliters of MCT oil and I know that that won't be a full jar up to here so we're just gonna squish it down [Music] all right that one's mixed up you see this mixed up pretty good here let's get this in the MCT oil and we're gonna get into the slow cooker [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the reason one of the reasons why we did it into the canning jar meant that was so that we were able to keep the terpene profile over animus now if you were to just decarboxylate on a tray we wouldn't got the same abilities out of it so we would have lost all of our terpenes [Music] this here looks like it's just to say covering at all and we got maybe like a couple teaspoons left in the bottle [Music] so perfect [Music] [Music] all righty guys so we dropped her in there and now you just gotta let her do or think what we're gonna do is just I guess probably keep filling this crock pot back up with water as imagine it's gonna get pretty hot and we're gonna lose some of its kind of the steam out so we'll just have to keep an eye on so we'll come back and check them in this problem you tomorrow all right guys so it's been about 12 hours now we put it in a little midnight last night it's just a little bit past noon here and 66 degrees Celsius one hundred and forty nine point seven it's temperature that it's been going at on high and if we take a look at her oil when first put it in it was clear oil now we can see it's a nice dark green delicious looking oil let's see if we can maybe get under light here a little bit sassy we'll get you a better shot your moment with flashlights alright alright guys so I've got my measuring cup I've got the strainer that sits in it I've got my cheesecloth what I'm gonna do is take this out of here this is actually pretty freakin hot play with and we're just gonna let it cool off for a little bit and while that's cooling off let me get some cheese bot open [Music] get a couple little laters wrapped around here don't really wanna be able to see through it but I would like to filter out most of those kind of fine once particles so I've got me one of these Curie filters and that's really gonna get all the very fine fine fine stuff out of it so that's what I'm gonna use for the very fine stuff so for now we're just going to pour it here into the cheesecloth get out most of the large particulates and then we're going to do the finds with this year we should have some awesome future oil and then with this taintdroid we can do lots of things with make some gummies well I don't really know lots of things but other than just that using this nature but I really want to make some gummies and that's what I was thinking about doing so if you guys are interested in that let us know and we will make a video for you on how to make gummies you can probably start to see this I'm not sure if you can see some camera not butter there's a nice green oil nice green danger I think what I've done here is underestimated the amount yes I have underestimated the amount the cheesecloth I would need to strain this out [Music] [Music] oh yeah there's quite a bit in this cannabis though [Music] you've got a clip holding this and now we're going to just do we're fine strain into our jar that we're going to store it in a little bit better review here my messy cupboard cannabis all over it alright [Music] all right so I've got a lid wash to clean ready here what I'm going to do is I'm going to stick a notice I got some MCT oil it was made November 5th 2019 and we're just gonna stick that on here now I'm gonna grab a flashlight so we can kind of see this here so we can see here it is a greenish oil we put it in it was Coulier clear clear and now it's a nice green so what you're gonna want to do the store this oil is it want to put it in a nice cool dark place some people recommend putting it in the fridge and that's one of the benefits of the MTT oil if you put it into the fridge it will not solidify like it does if you were to use coconut oil and I believe that also preserves a little bit longer as well so there's definitely some benefits of using the MTT oil so here you have it guys I hope this video was easy enough for everyone this stuff here tastes really good this tastes a lot better than the textures that I was buying from the licensed producers and with 38 grams plus a couple of grams of Keef this [ __ ] it should be pretty good well so we're gonna try some out and yeah we'll go from there [Music]", "_KOUuNB0N9M": "[Music] what's up everybody Alex from uncanny here and today I want to talk to you about the difference between full-spectrum broad-spectrum and isolate based CBD hemp extracts [Music] I get this question all the time and it is honestly a pretty confusing topic people throw these phrases around without really knowing what they mean but today I'm gonna tell you exactly the difference between the three so first let's just talk about what this spectrum really is in full spectrum a broad spectrum and the spectrum really refers to the different compounds that are in the natural extract so when you think of a CBD oil it's not just CBD that's in that oil there's different fats there's different terpenes potentially different cannabinoids and other things that create the full picture and so in that sense a full spectrum product would be just that it has the entire full spectrum of naturally occurring compounds that are found in that extract so on the totally other side of the spectrum would be what's considered an isolate and as that sounds it's the CBD that's been stripped away and isolated from all the other naturally occurring compounds in that extract and then in the middle between an isolate and a full-spectrum extract you have the whole range of broad spectrum and as that sounds it doesn't necessarily have the full set of compounds but it has a lot of them or most of them for example at uncanny wellness we remove the THC from our products so that is technically part of the spectrum which is why we don't call ours a full spectrum extract instead it's a broad spectrum extract so it has the CBD it has the terpenes the flavonoids and all those other naturally occurring compounds in the extract a common misconception that people have is that you need THC in order for CBD to work properly there is some truth in that because THC and CBD work synergistically together but you don't need the THC for the CBD to work going off of that something like an isolate would work it just doesn't work necessarily as well as a full spectrum product so full spectrum is going to have apps everything in it as such if you remove any part of that spectrum whether you're removing the THC or even if you're distilling down and concentrating what's in the extract you're getting into the territory of broad spectrum so really most of what's out there in the market is gonna be a broad spectrum and not a full spectrum because full is just a very absolute phrase and as a natural result of the processing and extraction and refinement in to that final product form you do lose certain parts of that spectrum another important thing to understand is that the spectrum a full spectrum broad spectrum directly relates to what's known as the entourage effect and the entourage effect basically says that when you have CBD in conjunction with the other naturally occurring compounds that it's usually found with it has a greater amplified effect versus an isolate which is just CBD has no entourage has no other components of the spectrum and is less effective than a full or broad spectrum product so you can kind of think of it like there's more entourage effect happening the more full the spectrum is and as you start taking things away you're removing naturally-occurring compounds from that spectrum you're losing members of the entourage and over time you go all the way to an isolate format which has no entourage effects happening whatsoever the nice thing about a broad spectrum extract is that you can do something like THC removal which is what we do and that's nice for people that may have to get drug tested or just don't want any trace THC in their system or maybe they want to give it to their kids or a pet or they're a pilot or any reason like that they can still enjoy the benefits of the entourage effect and of a broad spectrum CBD extract without having any residual THC because the legal limit for hemp products is 0.3 percent THC so a full spectrum product could have at most 0.3% but you could easily remove that making a broad spectrum or end up removing everything for an isolate for most people the best option for a CBD product is going to be a full or broad spectrum extract isolates are kind of the pharmaceutical reduction of CBD it strips it away from everything else reducing its holistic nature and making it more controllable as such isolates are the cheapest form of CBD available and a lot of times people will actually just throw isolate into a product to make it a really high milligram count and then end up charging you more even though you're getting a lesser quality product so when you're out there trying to figure out which CBD product is best for you it's fair to either ask the company or look for where it says it on the label to see is it isolate broad spectrum or full spectrum and that should help you decide exactly what you're looking for so in summary on one end you have an absolutely full spectrum product that's gonna have the most other compounds besides CBD and it's going to have the most entourage effect on the other end you have an isolate where the CBD is stripped away from all the other naturally naturally occurring compounds there are no extra compounds in the extract and there's going to be no entourage effect and then in the middle you would have the range of broad-spectrum extracts that don't have all the naturally occurring compounds but have most of them and you're still getting the benefits of the entourage effect because of the turbines the flavonoids the polyphenols and all of the other array of compounds that are naturally present in a CBD hemp extract so that's it that's the breakdown between full spectrum and broad spectrum and isolate thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed this video please give it a like leave a comment down below if you want to share your thoughts and make sure to share this with friends so that they can understand the difference between these three forms of CBD as well that's all for today see you next time peace [Music]", "E7MvGH0yMNU": "disclaimer in no way shape or form does the information of this video replace medical advice this video's purpose is to shed light on cbd and how it could be used to treat anxiety amongst many other remedies and medications out there is school stressing you out your job giving you anxiety or can you just not fall asleep at night well this just may be the video for you the use of cbd could be an effective and safe way to alleviate anxiety stress and improve your sleep but what exactly is cbd cbd is short for cannabidiol which is one of two compounds found in cannabis the other one being tetrahydrocannabine or thc for short what you may notice is that the chemical formulas of cbd and thc are almost chemically identical but they both elicit different reactions within the body the chemical structure of thc that is found in marijuana is what gives you the feeling of being high while the chemical structure of cbd which is also found in marijuana doesn't give you the feeling of being high but affects the body in different less noticeable ways cbd is known to elicit relaxing and soothing effects without the feeling of intoxication that is usually associated with marijuana marijuana and hemp are two types of cannabis plants marijuana contains a high concentration of thc with some cbd this contrasts kemp as hemp is bred to remove the majority of its thc content leaving the plant as only a good source of cbd this means you cannot get high off hemp derived cbd oils but how do we know that cbd is effective in treating anxiety one study outlined an experiment done on 65 men and women that were classified to be obese majority of the participants were in their 20s to 40s in this double-blind experiment some participants were given hemp-derived cbd oil or an olive oil placebo daily for six weeks alongside their normal diet throughout the six weeks the participants were asked about their feelings of stress as well as other factors including their overall well-being anxiety levels and sleep quality participants were also asked to complete physical activity on a regular basis the study found that overall participants who were given hemp-derived cbd were coping better with stress experiencing improved sleep quality and quantity and showed improved pleasure in life amongst many other benefits so how have people been using cbd cbd oils and creams are currently being used topically to reduce pain and inflammation teas coffee blends and even cbd infused beer help with anxiety relieve stress and help with sleep cbd has also been used to help with withdrawal symptoms panic attacks insomnia depression as well as ptsd although there is little to no side effects of cbd use as well as no proven tendencies for abuse or dependence potential cbd is still relatively new on the market cbd studies are still in the preliminary stages as long-term effects are still unknown so please before trying anything new we recommend you speak to your family doctor and inquire about cbd and find what works best for you if you are interested in learning more about the use of cbd research currently being done or the science behind it please refer to the links in the description of this video [Music] you", "YDVZV7NDI2I": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis kool-aid so let's get into it [Music] the ingredients to make your cannabis kool-aid would be two to three packs of kool-aid next you're gonna need your sugar we're gonna be using two cups total i'm gonna be using one and a half cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar i'm gonna be using a one gallon pitcher to make my kool-aid and the last ingredients to make our cannabis kool-aid would be your cannabis simple syrup if you don't know how to make the cannabis simple syrup no worry i'm going to leave the link below so the first thing i'm going to do is measure out my sugar [Music] i just measured out one cup of sugar so now what i want to do is take a bow and put my one cup of sugar in that bowl now set the bowl to the side now i'm going to measure out one cup of sugar but this time we're going to measure out a half a cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown [Music] sugar [Music] all right guys so once you measure out your one cup of sugar put this to the side and what we're going to do is get our pitcher [Music] and add your sugar to it [Music] now add your kool-aid [Music] now mix your ingredients all right guys so now what we're going to do is move this to the side turn your stove on high now i'm going to measure out two cups of water [Music] put your pot on the stove and add the water once your water start boiling add your sugar let the water boil until your sugar is completely dissolved all right guys my simple syrup is now done so while your simple syrup is still hot add it to the kool-aid now mix everything together [Music] so now what we're going to do is add some more water to our pitcher so if you want to you can use water out of the sink but i'm going to be using spring water [Music] once you add your water to your pitcher just mix everything together [Music] now i'm going to put this in the fridge for a few hours [Music] all right guys so i've been about five hours my kool-aid is now cool so now what i'm going to do is infuse our kool-aid using the cannabis simple syrup all right so now what i'm going to do is measure out one cup of cannabis simple syrup so now i'm going to add the simple syrup to my koolaid [Music] now i miss it together [Music] all right guys my cannabis kool-aid is now done thank you for watching this video don't

seeker of weed wisdom and here's your host gracious giver of cannabis knowledge Jake Brown hey thanks everyone tuning in to the cannabis show we talk all things weed hash that all things weed and that's the serious marijuana news along with the fun stuff as well if you vanished visit the cannabis Co right now you can read about Jorge Cervantes tips for growing cannabis in any climate you can also get the lowdown on the new 160 million dollar greenhouse being built in New Mexico and watch the cannabis weed critic Soham Shahs video strain review of cherry Jeep diesel today how are you I'm wide awake and ready to learn teach me hey I am wide awake on too much coffee thanks pretty servants he always tells me how bad the office coffee is the first time I've chosen to indulge I feel uncomfortable oh that's uncomfortable thank you let's get into it here's the week in weed starting in California experts are predicting that celebrity weed brands may have an advantage in the state's new recreational market who would have guessed that California likes celebrities oh yeah from the big screen to the Oval Office and all the way to the grow room people like them very much and while no one knows cool received the first recreational licenses in the state existing medical marijuana dispensaries could have a leg up that's why celebs like Willie Nelson several Bob Marley's children Whoopi Goldberg Tommy Chong and Snoop Dogg are hustling to get their branded weed products on shelves Damian Marley for example partnered with another company in the cannabis space to buy a former prison in Coalinga California and turn it into a 77,000 square foot weed facility which has to be really disappointing to at least a few prior inmates unfortunately for the famous it's still legal to trademark your marijuana on the federal level so state assemblyman Rob bonza has proposed state trademarks in a bill that also bans weeping billboards near freeways so basically most of California if Saturday Night Live sketches are to be believed he also wants to develop tests for stone drivers now let's go to Albania or the Delaware of Europe okay fun fact number one both mother Teresa and the Belushi brothers are of Albanian descent so in fact number two Albanians love growing weed which is why the Albanian government is deploying thirty-one hundred officers to crack down on cultivators in the country authorities destroyed two point five million plants there last year alone and that was actually a quadruple increase over the previous year okay that sums it up on obey Nia right yeah okay curry moving on a retired California preacher was busted in Texas with over 400 grams of cookies and we're not talking about communion wafers in what turned out to be a tragic story philip glenn of formal Pentecostal minister and prison counselor is a medical marijuana patient in his home state but learn the hard way texas doesn't care oh man Blanton was going to visit his hospitalized granddaughter in Houston he told ABC affiliate KTRK Houston quote I'm a grandpa so I'm thinking like a grandpa and Grandpa stache included about four ounces of cannabis flour and dozens of infused cookies the latter alone could land him I have to sentence as much as five to ninety nine years or life plus a ten thousand dollar fine now let's go to the cannabis policy and business writer Elisha Wallace's with this week's quick hit that apparently Alicia is now plural Colorado's medical marijuana registry is going electronic with a new online system that can churn out red cards for patients in a couple of days but to some residents the switch hasn't come free of glitches the transition has resulted in a spike in wait times for mailed applications the turnaround time that was thirty-five days or under now is in the realm of six to eight weeks while the registry hired temporary employees to clear the mail and backlog and address the slew of phone and email queries an additional hiccup came when some patients who tried to register online hit a barrier their doctor needed register first registry officials say they expect to clear the backlog and return to the 35 day turnaround by the 1st of April some lawmakers say 35 days is still far too long and I've called on Governor John Hickenlooper to intervene in the matter the registry will be completely online by 2018 for the cannabis time Alicia Wallace with this week's quick hit all right thanks Alicia our first guest is CEO of the Julian Marlies cannabis company juju royal give it up for Travis Belcher everybody hey hey thanks so much for coming on appreciate it thanks for having me right all right so how do you get involved with what you know a legend and who has a really wide variety of cannabis products now so originally I came from the entertainment industry and Julian and I had a mutual friend okay I think a guy yeah and where were you based at this time Atlanta okay so you're in Atlanta you got a fresh guy knows Julian he's like alright you gotta meet Travis right or were you like I need to be true it was a little bit of both okay I like that a little bit of both but I did a lot of reggae shows back in the day I used to be in the nightclub business and music business for a little bit yeah so I just kept my relationships and resources and reached out when we decided to develop this concept an idea and where did this idea start was it like hey we're going to open a dispensary or we just gonna what where do you start when you're a celebrity we print we just wanted to create the idea was just to create a brand okay just a brand and we wanted yeah the model was to co-op with producers and processors in the industry so we never had a plan - we do have a future plan of opening up a flagship dispensary hopefully in Vegas or New York somewhere hey it looks like it's going to be the spot everything I read about Vegas is like money going in I know that they're really excited so that would be the flagship store but you started off with product what was like the the first product in the cannabis space it was our disposable vape pen in Washington okay yeah so you went into vape pens and where were you going like THC CBD - both yeah co2 okay cool yeah and so started off in vape and in Washington yes but you could have expanded like recently when I I'm trying to like keep up with this for me um but like where are you at now so California Colorado Washington Oregon quirt Oh Riko just expanded into Puerto Rico when you get into Puerto Rico well we just signed a licensing agreement with the producer and processor down there about two months ago congratulations thank you Thanks wait so and so that'll be kind of a mix of medical and recreational it sounds like medical at this point mm-hmm but recreation so in the comic books like the fast-tracking the recreational market or program you know the big trend like we covered up top is the now celebrity weed strains I've covered them all I covered the good that Tommy Chong's was great I covered the bad snoop you got to work on that stuff man could help this didn't know it was real bad how do you go about coming up with you know a signature line that reflects Julian so Julian is very engaged and involved with our process when we select streams and work on our genetics so we've been working on a genetic program project for the last six six months now where he was involved his favourite strain is lambsbread okay well yeah right my fianc\u00e9's favorite strain - so she's going to be really happy to hear this I let him know yeah yeah so he's very instrumental when we decide what strains so he of course he enjoys testing oh so we've got four proprietary strains we're releasing in April that's just right around the corner right like a like 4/20 launch kind of thing sort of yeah the little prior to 4/20 smart because there's always so much going around right or twenty but yeah we don't want to get lost in what's going on with 4/20 noise there oh yeah okay so so do walk me back just a couple steps so when it's like hey you know I really like lambsbread is it going out trying to find those genetics are you working with somebody to breed what that process is like so we've hired we have a genetics guy on our team now our hairy Bluestein spend growing for about twenty years is pretty good at what he does so three of forty years then you better be yeah yeah so myself and Julian and Harry we kind of sat down and discussed the strategy and so we're going to have four hybrid strains for Jamaican strains crossed with other strains some pushes and some interesting so kind of a way because I think that that's a frustration even from people from Jamaica is that they you know try cannabis from other places and it's a different market in Colorado people want stronger they want different structure right so I love that it's kind of a way to marry the tradition which you know is very much sacrament on the island with kind of this new cannabis culture absolutely that's the whole idea so it so it's kind of lamb spread crossed with or is it a bunch of different I'm sorry I'm such a wiener right now I'm like that's okay yeah so we have to land race trains okay and to Jamaican straights they're not necessarily land racer their little strings and Harry has done a pretty good job of breeding these trains and genetics and so we've got Jew GOG which will be released into Anna April heavenly Heights lines domain and jungle cheese those young cool she is oh that might be my new favorite name in cannabis and by the way so is that that I one of the things that always trips me up is that here you are national brand and Puerto Rico I don't really know which that's why for are you guys staying but you're trying to manage this and have consistency across all these states is there a way to introduce these genetics say the same thing that you're doing in Colorado into Washington into California and how do you manage that it's going to be tough yeah yeah it's going to be difficult but we're bound by the restraints of policy regulation and sure compliance at the same time so we've we were lucky enough to get our genetics into Puerto Rico as they were setting up the light our light rate so yeah they have a grace period I think of 90 days or something like that to get all their genetics in so we got them in there so Harry hurry up yeah we were able to get a few we got a few strains here in Colorado we got obviously we got them in California it's still kind of great market there we were able to slide in there but it's tough I mean you have to get in in the beginning and get those strings into their catalogs early nice I kind of like on a bigger scale what does cannabis mean to Julian because I think that that's when I talked to people about especially celebrity weed lines I'm like yeah you know Willie Nelson has his line I don't think Willie Nelson really knows the difference between a lot of different types of pots for example of you he admitted on those tour buses like indica sativa I don't really know I got my weed ladies that handle that so I always like to know you know what what's a artists connection to cannabis yeah I can't speak for all artists and we don't have any weed ladies on our team it's just me Julian and Harry so Julian has a very special connection to cannabis in my own own opinion he's an advocate an avid smoker and he's extremely in tune not as you know he's learning as it relates to the technicalities and genetics and strains and things of that nature he's still learning it's still a learning process but his enthusiasm is through the roof yeah that's what counts you know like he's very engaged absolutely yeah very cool you getting there yeah I think we all are and I'd like to bring them maybe we can bring him on the show sometime in the future so he can speak for himself well I would love that I don't want to speak for him too if you're watching out there we would love to have you and thank you so much Travis we'll have a bit more with you it's just a bit but now we have our own experts in the phrasing of blazing professor Pat with this week's entry into the new cannabis lexicon edibles any cannabis product which is consumed orally and digested is considered inedible whether it is the stereotypical pot brownie or one of the sophisticated orally active cannabis capsules edibles are often recommended as the best choice for those who want to enjoy the benefits of cannabis without actually having to smoke anything cannabis consumed orally is quite a bit stronger and last longer so it is always best to consume a little bit at a time in order to allow the full effects to develop for example I have asthma and can't smoke so I just be edibles instead Thank You professor our second guest to the set is the founder of a recent award-winning disciplined company join me in welcoming Jim Viviano to the cannabis show hey how are you having absolutely my pleasure and thank you so much for coming on I love it when the guests shake it I think you're the first - did you have to do it you would call it a kiss I would never do it again unless you're handed I got you today hello generated some friendship already I want to ask you so I want to make sure I get this right Jim congrats on your win at the high west cannabis dab off can you explain what a dab off it's quite a thing to tell you the true okay it's a whole experience it's an experience right so trying to differentiate amongst all the competitions that are out there today I think what they were trying to do was bring in some of the the hottest names and concentrate and you know laws the way they are on the regular patience they make it difficult for public consumption they pull up a bus to get on the bus have a dive or 10 whatever here there's a work for you and then you got to come back and you know be a sound mind to judge what you like the best I guess ok so there's a judging Pro so it's my understanding all right some people get a variety of different concentrates they try them on a bus as many as 10 I could kicad AB all day if you want it ok there's no limit as though much you could dab and then you come back and you score these concentrates of now yeah well okay so what were you scored on that's you know I think people were looking for you know flavor maybe the structure of the concentrate you know concentrate staking on different forms these days what's your preferred structure yeah well we make distillate so we make more specifically high terpene wide spectrum discipline and you know wide spectrum meaning it refers to the breadth of cannabinoids that are active in in the concentrate okay so you're talking about thct HCV CBD CBN what other can cannabinoids do you working with right CBG CBGB and CBG is important because it's a precursor to THC so I think a lot of research will be it will be coming to light here shortly about that CBC as well CBL but you know the advantages are with with our process is yeah it's truer to the plant not only in what are the active cannabinoids and the active terpenes in the material that you're consuming but it just keeps it closer to what Mother Nature's intent was and you know that's one of our big goals that a son so we've been talking to a few different people that are working especially in the concentrates industry on separating out terpenes separating out cannabinoids finding ways to mimic what the plant is doing almost by taking these these parts and trying to reconstruct it it sounds like what you're doing might be more true to say the entourage effect where you're really getting what the plan intended in a concentrated form that accurate that it's really accurate actually Jake so okay thank you for one day and one day only I might play one on the Cannabis show okay so Jim that's the the idea behind hpw s yeah I know the acronyms are getting out of control but at the end of the day to make it really simple what we're doing is we're isolating the components that have value to you and your body and we're removing everything else and when we put it all back together at the end we think again it's true or to Mother Nature's intent it's a cleaner hi and there's there's benefits also in our product in that it's it's pure there's zero parts per million of of any solvents and it's like a certain acceptable range of a ppm right or on say would you say any is too many no not necessarily and I don't want to get into you know why do you buy all but you know genuinely curious yeah but Edison what's important to us is producing a product that is going to meet the demands of someone who isn't willing to put a hydrocarbon like butane or propane into their body on a regular basis and so you know we're advancing the science to help consumers choose a product that's going to better align with their lifestyle if you had something that registered anywhere above 0 ppm would you personally release it Addison no if it's it's not a part of the fabric of our company it's not but but then again you know on occasion I like a dab of some live resin that you know pretty high in butane but you know we're looking to bring up put a product on market that's going to appeal to someone who has a conscious lifestyle someone who wants something that there's not going to be a regret in the short term or long term about how they're using the plant now how much of that is what goes in say travis has some you know great organic material that he wants you to process for him first me I have a dirty grower I don't know how to do anything with the plan I'm just spraying it with Eagle something because I just don't want to get sued by any chemical manufacturers but does that affect ow I mean hundred percent of its what goes in is typically what comes out and you know it's our job to work with quality material and isolate the most important compounds and deliver them in a fashion that is is going to make sense for you on how you consume it but I've talked to so many growers are like yeah you know this harvest didn't work out we had powdery mildew or mold you know we're just going to blast it is there some stuff that you can kind of overcome through creating concentrates or is it like it really it's garbage in garbage out well so what we do is we extract with co2 and then we distill via molecular infracted fractional separations and we are actually a you and I are subsequently blue okay so you're doing you're on the molecular level we could get to a molecular level yes and but what that allows us to do is even if some material came in that was sprayed with something that perhaps you weren't interested in and we're able to find these these compounds and pull them out and so it's it's not a goal bar to work with dirty material is one who were quality material but this this is how the industry is advancing it's it's it's fascinating amazing how long has this been the case because this I mean every time I hear the next thing like when I'm talking flower I understand flower to a certain extent there are a few things with my growth regulators or people are starting to have different conversations but with concentrates how long has this even been the case well I mean this technology has been in the pharmaceutical world it's been in food science world and like anything else with this maturing industry it just takes time and exposure and here it is I expect it to be completely different a year from now really ideal yes I think I look at something like rosin and everybody was pressing Rosen a year ago and that it was the new big thing and now it's acronyms but you sound like you have a great acronym so so at the end of the day you win this dab off okay so some kids you go way back just for our category you want to make sure that's quite yet okay we won the distillate category and this was gating lot of momentum right now because of its ability to be to produce a really clean product but you know not all distillates created equal a lot of distillate is made today from the leftovers of a butane hash oil extraction to get the remaining THC what we're doing in one or other maybe two other companies are doing in Colorado is we're applying that science but with you know Mother Nature's intent again at the forefront in our extraction process that's why we use co2 okay so if somebody if I could try and wrap my head around that yeah Jim I love it you're blowing my mind sorry you're saying they don't know it's fun but some people are essentially taking like the scraps and making like butane gravy or like distillate gravy at the with it at the end of the day yeah that's that's again and I love gravy and so do I pour it on but also yeah I guess the starting product of just great meat I would take over the grill all right thank you for helping me greatly I think we can work with that so what's what's become the market for this because I know that education is always such a barrier for introducing especially new concepts to consumers out there so what are you seeing in terms of people that look at specific types of concentrates as a lifestyle choice right so I think what we're seeing is the consumer is spending more time educating themselves and learning what it is that they're putting into their body and that's just a function of a maturing industry a maturing consumer and as those trends continue I think you're going to find folks gravitating towards product that more closely aligned with their lifestyle right so Colorado is very active it's very it's very health oriented and I think you're going to find consumers that are going to be looking for plant material that was grown responsibly and concentrates that were extracted responsibly as well and that's going to result in folks demanding to know what's on the label but like when you're walking through Whole Foods and you look you're you find folks reading labels to make purchase decisions this is where cannabis is going okay so do I because outside of the label there's a lot of debate about what the best consistency is you know whether things should have you know little pockets or they not what I think what's something that somebody who's not familiar with concentrates can do to help identify something that could be either potentially harmful or something that wouldn't align with their lifestyle right so you'd want to look at what solvent was used to extract the cannabis oil from the plant material after that you just want to see what's active in the concentrate you're purchasing so active ingredients and that's going to be your cannabinoids of which it is said we have six or more active cannabinoids in on all of our products it's going to be terpene content people know something as a lot of terpenes is there like a telltale yeah that's Turkey but it's the loud factor right today and yeah no but that's just really putting your nose into it you know and you can look at you know the wine industry and how you judge a glass of wine and concentrates are are right behind following closely behind that industry and and so it's you know different strokes for different folks and you know I expect there's going to be great diversity of cannabis concentrates going forward and we just want to give the folks of Colorado an option that we think is great for the Colorado lifestyle what a last question I have to know what went into that disc so that was the Award winner yeah so it was New York City Diesel and that's a yeah it's a phenomenal strain and you know honestly I can't get one because it just it takes a grade it smelled great I can you know I can't say after a trip on the bus how many folks could actually tell you what got them more highs we all the loud but yeah it was like my mom's mind though that she'd be like oh the thing that smelled like gasoline smelled the best hey yeah obviously man that had nothing to do with a bunch of people being on a bus for a while right it's like really getting acclimated to it right this pairs well with the gasoline super funny fun having pairing notes that might be something you read on a label someday whoo like that pairs well with what a drink Travis back in and I want to find out from both of you although I feel like this is going to be a real softball which do you prefer consuming flower concentrates or edibles starting with me sure flower yeah I'm so flower gaya and we get anybody on is goal justice blow you out of mine prefer consumption for flower joints joints yeah yeah do you still twist them up or cuz I I prefer the tones oh I prefer tone see I never I still haven't done a cone yet I have a friend like squares by and he doesn't buy like the pre cones he knows how to get the paper right the neighbor and the filter and oh and he does it himself yeah yeah it's so weird like that he's I'm talking about you man oh you should sits there he's not here but I'm just pretending he's watching this he definitely doesn't okay so a good cone do you have a favorite of the line that you've tried so far those juju og - Jo Jo Jo GI like is it is it like a sedative og number is it is it like a true hybrid or more awesome true hybrids I'm keep a dominant okay yeah very nice and then clearly edibles for you know at edibles denna they don't agree with me always literally that well I you know I like concentrates I also like flower I mean in order to make a great concentrate you have to understand the plant and so yeah I agree and here's the thing about edibles I don't feel like I can control the outcome uh I mean like a joint I can pick up I can swim for a little while I'm feeling higher than I should I put it that yet you get that immediate feet yeah right yeah edible once you start that train ride yeah you're on take it off it still don't get all again right I mean it except that anywhere USA not very good at stage the movie Lion basically on the train I haven't no yeah is this alright so get on the train and he couldn't get off but it was the story of a young boy in edible all right so do you produce your flower in house no we don't we don't so we're looking for relationships with with growers that have you know that grow according to the standards we hold our brand to alright and then would you be are you producing concentrate based on the flower you you want to stick with a flower no I'm not matchmaking right now I'm not other step ahead II already I was already more card yeah you are no actually we're working on a strange specific line lad rising shattered wax yeah I think it's a now I guess you really have to have those connections in this industry right you have to know the flower guy you have to know the concentrate guy what's that process like working kind of across the aisle of for both of you yeah I mean it's we we like to say and we believe this firmly that the relationships we form in this industry our greatest asset more than the intellectual property we have in the lab and and so you know we're looking for partners that that have an aesthetic and a set of values that align with what we want to do with our brand and that's everything and then you're just looking for good people you know in our community here is still so small in a smaller in so finding you know finding those those quality relationships is job number one I agree I agree try the same for you it is just a relationship building so I'm actually you're doing that on a much broader scale at this point yeah absolutely it's all about the relationships he's absolutely right finding the best people to work with is the hardest part you find people who have we're really good at what they do and they have this amazing skill to produce really good products within their business acumen is a lot less desire you know it's like you try to find that balance of skill and business acumen and those are the people that I look for and to me that sounds like you're describing perfect like the music industry finding people that you want to work with at all so they have the talented people especially talented growers or concentrate makers can be so I mean I hard to work with and yeah difficult difficult right so what's the process look like when you were trying to set up these relationships is going in and watching them do the work on the concentrate is going in and touring a grow and what's that process like yeah I mean it starts with product first right so you know our due diligence is at the head let's let's go find somewhere far it's pretty bad album yeah for sure oh okay yeah yeah that's that's that's part of you you want to see them in their natural state right so you see your shoppers are out there yeah they are and yeah and then it was I feel like I just blew your cover yeah is even larger beard and have all available yeah look like the rest of the hipsters in Denver but but yeah you know and then it's always interesting finding out where people came from before they were in Canada and that's a telltale sign sometimes I know they come in from the corporate world are they coming from another entrepreneurial pursuit that you know would pay dividends for the mentoring that's at this industry sir yeah have you ever a secret shop actually I have a secret shop but I sent somebody to secret shop nice yeah I think that I always say but doesn't lie and what's on there was on the shelf is you know always the best reflection of what committees up to and for us I mean we're the environment in which they grower or process or whatever I like to go in and check that facility out and make sure that they are who they say they are and right you know they're compliant and those sort of things those are most important yeah I talk to a lot of growers that are never see at their grow I'm like okay you know it's good to know who's putting in the work right alright well that takes us to the time of the show where we put our guests to the test with the pop quiz or you gentlemen ready ready yeah I think so yes I'm going to hate me for this one okay oh yeah all right well we will start with start with you Jim question number one Manman claims a Maine Minton it sounds like as they my main man ain't but a man from the state of Maine claims that mineral mana trailers are interfering with blank is it a commercial lobster businesses II ham radio signals sea heroin dealers or D Maine Canada relations hmm well I must miss that article so I know I'm warning ya I'm sorry to do this alright I can read them to you again I don't think it's going to help well giving Maine's proximity to Canada let's go D that is incorrect alright just a chance to steal is it commercial lobster businesses ham radio signal or heroin dealers commercial lobster businesses alright we have a chance to go packaged in two options ham radio signals or heroin dealers I I guess there might be some need to use radio so let's go with the radio signal is correct so alright someone how to get it a finally at one point and yeah apparently so there's an FCC rating for grow lights but a lot of companies lie about being FCC wrong so if you have the defunct light people can go around with their ham radio and find your grow so I wants your girl growing it doesn't want anyone to see it not my girl this is a problem my am radio here all right ghost overdue is going to go to Travis in recent meetings over Denver's social use initiative I three hundred one of the most contentious issues has been the relationship between marijuana and what is it a commercial advertising the children's education see all L qahal consumption or D really sweet nature videos I thought people are going to laugh at D I would say alcohol that is correct all right we had it all tied up two points at one point piece that's out scoring works Mathis art it is especially when you're adding one than nothing yeah they can't figure out the drinking along with social you too and that makes sense I mean right I mean if Denver's doing an amazing thing by bringing this to the public let's not let something like alcohol and impaired driving get in the way is there how did it how do you come up with a system to make that work because I feel like for a lot of businesses you're not allowed to sell pot you're not allowed to sell alcohol people can come and consume you've got to make it work for businesses on some level right and I look at events like concerts every concert I've ever been to people smoking also drinking added in the end of the world I would what's the answer is it just mandatory lyft and uber for everybody I've had to get start you come in and you just like hey this is my over driver I mean it's the responsibility you know of Denver and you know the great folks that put this initiative into place to make sure that it's a success and so you know things like alcohol did you know could get in the way rather being a success I think there the writing the bill and hopefully they get it they get it live here soon we need places to go consume and drink lots of coffee apparently all right it's going to come back to Jim I believe question three man sentenced to federal prison over his scheme to send edibles through the mail went by which alias is at a the health nut D the Hamburglar see Benjamin Deng : or D the totally legal doctor viagra okay so a guy remember reading the Cistus was in Massachusetts and I believe was the health nut that is correct he was shipping to all over I was doing chocolate bars through the nail don't do that you do that not care for that and the judge was like screw you've made it and you read through the judge used like I think marijuana is the worst thing along with drugs you're ruining our society he got a year in one day in federal prison before sorry health nut alright chance to tie it up here back Travis we've been talking about upcoming Colorado legislation on the show HB 1710 82 to measure now yeah the best known of all good uses the acronym best be est to stand for what is it a budding education state tuition is it be building excellent schools today is it C banning extra state taxes or is it D wrongs established only for smoking tobacco I'm only four is lower case yes I'm gonna roll with B that is correct building excellent schools today ways and gentlemen we have a tie and so we will go to our type Richter oh and this is such a terrible question I was really hoping and and after is this all right so the toy this is good a word you can buzzin at any time by saying your own first name I'm going to read you also on the blank the fill in the blank if you don't know just from the blank I'm going to just start reading multiple choice answers again remember don't give me the letter of the multiple-choice give me your name is stephane sir and that's a multiple-choice letter here we go Corey Stapleton Montana's cheap election official made the following statement recently all three states Oregon Washington and Colorado they do blank and they're all mayor Awana all the time stage two is that what you want because that's what you're going to get what was the blank is it they do all-you-can-eat buffets and they're all marijuana on States too how does it be the they do all mail-in ballots and they are all marijuana all the time states do we're going to get through this gentlemen they do see all new gentleman's clubs and they're all the marijuana all the time states to or D they do all drive-through pharmacies and they're all with that Jim all right I'm speaking into very very unconscious juices be he is correct and is a winner congratulation if you do the mail-in ballots you're going to get all the marijuana they're really worried voter suppression alive and well in the great of Montana

from gold leaf scientific and I'm gonna be talking today about steam distillation of terpenes so why is this important it really comes down to what's unique about the plant when you think about a cannabis plant the cannabinoids themselves are rarely unique for most strains what you'll find is that it's either really THC dominant or really CBD dominant and not a whole lot of in between that isn't to say that there are unique cannabinoid profiles out there but they tend to be sort of rare but when it comes to the smell or the essence of the plant there's a million shades of gray every strain every plant every phenotype is gonna have small little variations in the smell so it's fairly easy to have a unique smelling plant but it's pretty too hard to have a unique cannabinoid profile plant this is important because market forces tend to commoditize this simply means that people try to group things together and try to associate a price based on that group when it comes to the cannabinoid profile of plants you could essentially group the plants into either being THC dominant or CBD dominant or maybe other but it's too difficult to create large groups based on the smell and this is because small variations and the smell itself can cause pretty drastic overall effects but this only works with certain essence or certain strains profiles etc for example Lemony or a citrusy smell is really easy to recreate whereas a very earthy skunky smell is really hard and when you think about it and artificial flavors have you ever smelled a strawberry that smells actually I should say is an artificial flavored of strawberry this smells actually like the real thing I have it I don't think it exists and there's a very good reason for this when you think of a smell think of a sound like a symphony certain pieces may have only a few instruments playing and may be pretty simple whereas other pieces could incorporate all the instruments in the orchestra attempting to recreate the sound of only a few instruments is easy but in order to create the sound of a whole Orchestra you need a whole orchid Orchestra what this means is that simple smells that are only composed of a few dominant terpenes like citrus smells are cheaply and easily recreated whereas other smells may have such a complex mixture that recreating the smell is just economically unfeasible in short it's gonna be a lot cheaper for you to extract the essence from a strawberry instead of trying to recreate the whole smell and the same goes for the canvas plant there's just certain strains that are just almost impossible to recreate by extracting the terpene profile from the these plants you are capturing the true essence of the plant itself distillation and basically the way it works is that you would put water and your boiling flask here the boiling flask would sit into a heated hot plate or stirring mantle and then you would place your your material your plant material up in the bio flask here as the water is heated it turns up to steam it rises up through the plant material it forces the terpenes along with the steam to flow up through the steel head and over to the condenser section where it condenses it turns back into a liquid and flows down this section here and into a receiver flask and once it goes into the receiver flask what'll basically happen is the terpenes are gonna float to the top and the water is gonna sink to the bottom and then from there you could use a pipette or a separatory funnel to separate the two a key point to the steam distillation process is to keep your temperatures low generally you want to keep your vapor temp and your water temp below 60 Celsius now water at atmospheric pressure boils at 100 Celsius so you're gonna need to use a vacuum pump to reduce the pressure enough to make it boil at less than 60 Celsius this is really important because if you allow the temperature to increase too much it'll start to degrade the terpenes and give it a grassy type of smell and because we're extracting the terpenes you could of course dry out the material and do your solvent extraction afterwards you could also potentially extract from live plants or wet plants but in my experience this tends to more easily degrade and it's a lot easier for it to take on a grassy smell so I generally like to use dried material I find it just much easier to use make sure you store your collect terpenes well keep them at as low as temp sure as you can if you could flush out all the oxygen and insert some inert gas that's even better if you leave them exposed to the air they tend to develop a kind of a pickle smell this will happen in your glassware too so it's super important that you clean out all your glassware really well after each use it's interesting to note that terpenes are part of the plant defense system in fact there's just one of the many different defenses that a plant may have and use when it comes to defending you against bugs plants use trick homes and terpenes to defend themselves although most people would pronounce it trichomes the correct pronunciation is tricking the root word meaning hair so the trick home is an evolved hair follicle the base of the base where the stock is often mineralized and hardened and the tips contain cells that secrete terpenes and other plant compounds these kids serve to aggravate or impale a bug sticky and viscous luke loose liquids could cause the bug to be trapped once the contents of the trichome trickle are released the scent may trigger predators this may attract a wasp or some other type of predatory bug to kill the defender similarly when it comes to mammals the plant has found a way to mimic the sense of other predatory animals the picture over to the right is called a manned wolf it's a yeren happens to smell a lot like cannabis this just may be a coincidence but I believe this to be a case of mammalian attraction of predators if a deer happens to graze on some cannabis and releases the smell of it it would attract predators it's not so far-fetched considering the bug happens the same way with bugs on the micro-level plants also battle the same very problems that we battle on bacteria viruses fungi plants have to deal with these problems too they use a host of different chemical compounds to achieve this and terpenes tend to be a very all-encompassing plant defense mechanism most of them tend to be antibacterial they hurt or cause death to viruses and fungi as well and when humans use terpenes it usually tends to have a positive effect on human health but you have to keep in mind that plants have developed these tools for specific reasons oftentimes these tools tend to be very powerful sometimes they are toxic compounds certainly they happen to be toxic to most bugs so don't become complacent in their benign nature there is a type of Bush that grows in California and terpenes that are in the plant material that fall off the plant and collect on the ground are very high in a specific terpene a terpene that is toxic to all other plants except for the plant itself this causes the bush to kill all surrounding competitors and to fill in its space with its own sometimes even environmentally stressful conditions can cause an adverse shift in plants sometimes during a drought plants may produce a large amount of terpenes or some type of toxic compounds to prevent grazing this can cause otherwise benign plants to become fatally harmful if you're doing any type of solvent extraction chances are you're losing a vast amount of your terpenes this is because as the solvent distills away it carries the terpenes with it again a significant fraction is lost terpene percentages as high as 10% are easily achievable as long as the terpenes are extracted first then a solvent extraction is done on the cannabinoids and the resulting terpenes are added back in by splitting your extraction in the two parts you're saving what would be left this not only means that your yield is going to be much greater it also means your extract is going to be unique and flavorful in fact I would say that the unique effects associated with that strain are likely due to the combination of terpenes present as opposed to the cannabinoid profile so the old assumption that sativas are kind of going to have more of an energetic I and indicas are going to have more of a sedate of effect is likely incorrect in fact it's most likely the terpenes that are giving it at a unique all the terpenes and the cannabinoids work together to create a synergistic effect this is often called the entourage effect and basically what this means is the combination is far more powerful than any single component this is because the nonpolar nature of the terpenes tend to make it much easier for the cannabinoids to cross the blood-brain barrier so a small amount of terpenes added to the cannabinoids can have a significant effect on the potency a raw terpene less distillate may only be about half of the strength as a very terpene rich extract so make sure you save the Terps this is Ryan from gold leaf scientific signing off if you have any

and we're in the kitchen at civilized HQ down here in Venice Beach California we're in the kitchen today because we're going to make some DIY topicals this is going to be an infused topical infused with cannabis obviously doing topicals yourself gives you the freedom to choose you know the quality of flour you want the ratio of THC the CBD you want or other cannabinoids if they're present the scent you like the medium you like you may be vegan you may not want beeswax in your products so this just gives you all the control for the topical we're making today you're gonna need coconut oil shea butter flour cheesecloth a container to put it in and a stove and an oven Toodee carb and to infuse the oil with step one is going to be decarboxylate in your flour what decarboxylated does is it activates all the cannabinoids in the flour if you've ever eaten just raw flour you'll know that you don't get high from it it doesn't have the same effect as inedible versus when you cook it in a brownie per se that's when the psychoactivity starts happening and essentially all that does is remove a co2 molecule from the THCA and it becomes THC so today I've got some Henry's original ritual flour it's CBD flour which I really appreciate around 2530 dollars for this eight it's got 500 milligrams of CBD in there so let's get started so in order to decarboxylate your flour you're going to grind it up and put it in the oven I've got 3.5 grams here I think that's a good start for today you can do more you can do less just do your thing so here we're grinding up the flour this just increases the surface area it helps all the heat reach all the areas of a bud we've got our pile of flour we're just going to spread out a little bit we're gonna try our best to preserve the terpenes by cooking it at a lower temperature we're at 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 minutes so now we're putting it in the oven we've got our timer set and we'll check back in in 20 minutes all right so we've got our decarboxylated flour and the next step is putting that into our coconut oil so we got a cup of coconut oil we're gonna start simmering this we're gonna melt the coconut oil and start simmering the flour into it so right now I'm just getting the coconut oil down melting it so it's a liquid the last thing you want to do is burn off any cannabinoids keeping temperatures low and a very low slow simmer is gonna make sure that your cannabinoids are retained and chillin inside of the coconut oil because not only will it be weaker if not completely inactive it'll smell bad it'll taste bad if you're gonna eat it much more to the consistency that I like that's smooth smooth liquid so now that our coconut oil is melted it's clear and it's liquid and its pretty and it smells good we're gonna put our decarboxylated flour into the coconut oil you ready and this this is where the magic happens this is maybe the most important step this is the easiest step to mess up if you let any of this get too hot it's gonna be you're gonna be starting over which nobody wants to do so what I'm doing is just carefully monitoring this a little bit of movement is good that means that he is moving things around but as soon as you see bubbles or smoke or anything like that then it's too hot so patience is key we're gonna start the timer again for 20 minutes and we're just gonna simmer this it's been 20 minutes on the stove I've turned the heat off and we've got ourselves a hot hot little hot little pot of pot alright so the next step we're going to put the cheesecloth over this bowl in order to pour our cannabis in there or cannabis oil and all this cheesecloth is going to do is catch the flower and so we'll just be left with infused coconut oil [Music] so putting on these gloves really lets you get the rest of this oil squeeze out it's gonna be warm it's definitely warm but the gloves help and you're just gonna squeeze that little bit of oil out all right so we've got our coconut oil in our Bowl and our next step is going to be adding the essential oils and adding the shea butter to thicken it up and make it more of a topical I'm not one to put pure coconut oil on my skin some of you might so you can really just stop at this step if you just want to smell like weed and coconut oil these next couple steps are just to kind of make it more for your mom or more for your own personal touch or say you don't want to walk around smelling like a toasted cannabis plant so I'm adding our shea butter in there now so I am now going to put some essential oil in here hopefully that's too much because I love this smell yeah that smells good so I'm just gonna separate these into different jars one of my favorite things about using cannabis flower especially prepackaged cannabis flower is you can use the jar again this is what I'm going to store the topically [Music] very DIY usually you would want to use a funnel or a baster or maybe a pot with a lip that you can pour but you know you work with what you got okay so we've got three different jars they're all the same right now and if you're happy with how it smells if you just want to do one scent for yourself then that's it you're just gonna put these in the fridge and let them chill and once they're cool it's just as just like any other topical but today I'm just adding some more little lips so I've got some Jasmine essential oil put a couple drops and let's see if it's beautiful I think some bergamot oil would be real nice and this one one two three four stir it these little babies up make sure that oil is evenly distributed well the only thing left to do is cool it down here we are four little jars yeah that's it folks we've got our DIY topicals if you're already getting flour at a dispensary if you already live at home if you already cook for yourself it's really not too extreme to be able to put those two together and make yourself a nice little topical or lotion you can add whatever else you want aloe vera gel vitamin E anything else it's the choice is yours as as we say here your body your choice", "2kxn1RBNNSI": "hey push and black open up late at night lately thinking

potion", "xKHP-1wefq8": "- Hi, Andrea Meharg here\nfrom revealcannabis.com, where I teach you how you can use cannabis to live a healthier, happier life. And today's video is all about how to make cannabis infused beverages. This is really exciting for us Canadians who don't have cannabis infused\nbeverages on the market yet. They will be coming in October of 2019, but for right now, I'm gonna teach you how to make your own. Basically, what I'm\ngonna show you how to do is to make a simple cannabis tincture that you then add to the\nbeverage of your choice. I'm gonna walk you really quick how to make an alcohol tincture because I already have a longer\nmore detailed video on that that I'll link below. And at the end of this video I will provide you with a recipe book that can hopefully stir\nup your creative juices for what you could make with your cannabis infused tinctures. So let's get started. I'm gonna show you what you'll need to make the tincture first. Okay, first thing that you have to do is decarboxylate your cannabis. So, basically this is\nheating your cannabis up so that you are getting THC or CBD instead of what's naturally\nfound in the plant, which is THCA or CBDA. The easy way to do this at home is to put your cannabis into a mason jar and put it into a preheated oven at 240 degrees Fahrenheit for one hour. The reason you put it in the mason jar is it helps to keep down the smell. However, if you have one of\nthese beautiful little machines, you just put your cannabis in and press the button and away you go, when it's done it shows a different color. Again the advantage of this is that you get more of the\nTHC or CBD from the flower. After you're done, you are\ngoing to grind your cannabis just slightly to increase\nthe surface area, you're not trying to turn it into powder. So you just zap it a couple of\ntimes in your coffee grinder. If you don't have a coffee\ngrinder for cannabis, that's okay use scissors or\nyour regular cannabis grinder. So I'll show you that it looks like that, right now the nugs and I'm gonna go zap it off camera so you don't have to listen to it. So, put your ground up\ncannabis into a mason jar, same mason jar you used to decarb it, if you used the oven which is fantastic. I'm all about less dishes. So it looks like that when it\nis just a little bit ground. And then you're gonna\nadd in 1/2 cup of Alcool, or Everclear or whatever you're using. So I'm using seven grams of cannabis and one 1/2 cup of Alcool. You can increase the\npotency of your tincture or decrease it by using\nless flower or more flower, less alcohol or more alcohol. So I'm gonna shake this up, and then all you do is you\nput this into a crock pot that has water that covers\nthe amount of your tincture, and you're gonna put this\nin your crock pot on low for about eight hours\nand then you'll be done. So, thanks to the magic of television. I already have a cannabis\ntincture ready to go. So when you're done, you simply dump it into a\ncheesecloth lined strainer. The other thing I've seen people do is use a reusable nut milk bag, so those are bags that people use to make almond milk or cashew\nmilk and they're reusable. So you put it into your little satchel, your cheesecloth satchel and then actually like get right in there and really squeeze this. You do not wanna lose any of your beautiful\ntincture to the garbage. I know people do lots of stuff with the satchel of cannabis leftover when it's infused into butter or oil. You can make it into high chai or you can just dump that\nright into some baked goods. But when it's done with\nalcohol, it tastes terrible and I haven't seen any\ngood uses for it yet. So if you see a good\nuse for this at the end, please let me know in the comments. Otherwise, just squeeze\nuntil you feel like you've got it all out. You're gonna store this\nbeautiful mixture in one of these to keep it away from the sun, and then I'm gonna show you how to make some infused\nbeverages, let's go. Before we go any further, I wanted to point out three things. First, make sure that\nyou open your mason jar that's sitting in the warm water about every 1/2 hour to an hour while it is infusing in there to let go of some of the pressure, that's called burping your mason jar. Second, if you are trying\nto get a CBD tincture, then just make sure that you\nstart out with cannabis flower that's really high in CBD. This is a great recipe to have on hand because you can really\ncustomize the ingredients and get the exact type of\ntincture that you'd like. In fact, some people even\ninfuse other herbs and flowers into these tinctures. Let's think about some\nof the delicious drinks that you can make now that you know how to make a cannabis tincture. So this is really where your\nimagination gets to run wild. Basically any drink that you drink can now be infused with cannabis. You just take a couple\nof drops of your tincture or a dropper full of your\ntincture, and away you go. So lots of people love to make lemonade or just put some into their coffee or tea. People infuse or have cannabis\ninfused Pop, Coke or Pepsi, whatever it is, you can really\ndo whatever you want with it. The only thing to point out is to avoid mixing cannabis with alcohol. Let's talk about dosing. How do we know how much we're getting in a dropper full of\nthat cannabis tincture? There is a way to get a\nreally good approximation, it's not gonna be totally perfect, but this is a good way to\nget a good approximation. First thing is that you're gonna find out how much THC or CBD is in your flower. If you're buying lab tested cannabis, then you can just look at the label and it will tell you how much\nof those components are in it. If you don't have it with a label, and you do know the strain name, you can head over to\nleafly.com and type it in and they'll give you an approximation of how much you THC it might have in it. And if you don't have any idea what it is then you can take a guesstimate. Average THC concentrations\nright now seem to be around 15 to 20%, so take a guesstimate. And once you know how much\nTHC or CBD is in your flower, then you can go to this\nhandy-dandy dosing calculator. So it's at the wakeandbake.co website which I highly recommend if\nyou haven't checked it out, and all you do is fill out\nthis happy little chart here. So the Tangerine Dream that I infused had 15% THC and 1% CBD, and I use seven grams of it and I infused it into 1/2 cup of alcohol. So I know that in my whole infusion, there's 1,050 milligrams of THC, and in each teaspoon,\nthere's about 43 grams. So let's go back here and\nsee what we can do with that. I just wanna say though, even though you're using\na dosage calculator, that does not absolve you of the responsibility of\nstarting low and going slow because every time you make\na new cannabis infusion, it can be slightly different, so don't depend on the dosage calculator to give you the exact precise dose, make sure that you try it first and see how this particular\nbatch fits with you. So, most recommendations are to start with five milligrams of\nTHC or less per dose. So let's talk about my\ntincture that I just made. We know that it has 43\nmilligrams of THC per teaspoon, and each teaspoon has five milliliters. In tincture bottles, the droppers are standardized to one milliliter. So there's five droppers\nin one teaspoon of THC or in one teaspoon of tincture. So 43 divided by five is about 8.5 milligrams per each dropper. So in my tincture for each dropper fall, it's about 8.5 milligrams of THC. If I was trying to get\na five milligram dose, I would have slightly\nover half of the dropper and that would be my dose. It's really easy to adjust\nthe potency of your tinctures. If you wanted a more potent tincture, you would add more cannabis\nto the same amount of alcohol. So maybe you'd add 14 grams\nof cannabis instead of seven. If you wanted to less potent tincture, you would just add less cannabis to the same amount of\nalcohol and away you go, you can really customize it. I'm gonna give you a recipe for a delicious strawberry-mint spritzer, that you just put a couple of drops of cannabis tincture into\nand then it's infused and you can have a great afternoon. So what you do is you\ntake a cup of strawberries and a 1/2 cup of fresh mint and a couple of tablespoons of sweetener, whatever you're gonna use\nand mix it up in a saucepan so that it really begins to\nbreak down and come together and the mint releases its oil, it's gonna smell super beautiful. So do that, it takes about 10 minutes and then let it cool down and put it into a\nblender or food processor and pulse it until it's smooth. Grab a glass and fill it\nup with some spritzers or soda water and then put\nin a couple of tablespoons of your beautiful\nstrawberry mint concoction that you just made and however much of your\ncannabis tincture that you want and stir it up and you\nhave a beautiful infused, delicious cocktail.

they how can you use them let's get into it shatter is the extract for the plant it's like a resin it has to be smoked at a certain temperature that's why we do the dabs with the shatter still has the terpenes and all the medical properties in the shadow after shatter you can get things shatter like like the sauce this is a taliban sauce i'm mr. tally man if you like your man's [ __ ] try out the taliban saw this is the same as a shatter it still has some medicinal properties left in it and you can smoke it the same way we'll show you in a moment now this is raw THC distillate 99% pure Eureka makes this there's no medical properties left it's just THC you can dab it you can vape it you can mix it in with your buds any way you want to do it now let's be have a change to everything we just looked at but if you don't like smoking you can always take your oil extracts in lieu of smoking ok the first one we're gonna try is our tally man sauce make sure that we're all heated up here [Music] so it's a little different from shatter it's a little saucy air that's why they call it sauce you have to scoop it up it's almost like a jelly see that kind of looks like that caviar stuff you see but it's not Taliban sauce indica all right [Music] very tasty very sticky very the tally man extract what a big hit that was a nice taste it's not as nice as shatter now shatter has more of a Turpin taste as more of the flavors in it that was a little milder but it was really nice and I got a really good buzz off that let's open up the shatter and take a look at it this stuff right here is sweet skunk Alabama cool in it's a hybrid now shatters are always over 80 percent THC so little dabble Ouya what you can take bigger ones if you want to play around I always find it hard to see when I have these white papers I like the see-through plastic better make sure I don't jump the shatter oh yeah very clear another another shatter I like when we have a bunch together because you can really tell this one kind of misshapen ooh buzzer oh no that's bad yeah it is a little cloudy I like when we have them together because you can really tell the difference in the colors next time we do a shadow one will bring three or four oh it again and let you look at the difference in the colors now let's take us sweets junk Alabama little cloudy but gone you can't meatball [Music] [Music] Oh way better taste Oh more predominant taste than the than the extract it's a very all the shadows have that real lemony citrus taste waste not want not so far the extract gave me a smash and almost knocked me on my ass the shatter gave me energy gave me a real good buzz now we're gonna go for the 99% distillate yeah you got a quarter right on there so and the thing is when you press this it keeps coming out if you're gonna take this much you're gonna get double coming out begin see it keeps coming see I mean I'll just take a great big one this is a bigger need to take cause remember this is 99% all right hold that smokey thanks man let it ride [Music] [Music] [Music] - ticker smoke it's more harsh than the to feel it a lot of people say that they like their dad studying their distillates I don't find any difference in the Highness where a shatter might give me more energy because you don't get hybrids to tea but when you get a distillate it's 99 percent THC you're getting the same smash every time whereas if you want sativa with the shatter you can get the energy do you want an indica you can go final thoughts for extracts and distillates if you are getting medicinally high stick with the sauce or the shatter and if you just want to get whacked use the extract 99 percent THC because it works and don't forget to check us out on Instagram at the weed connoisseur underscore and don't forget hit

d-line oil dispensers contain distillate marijuana concentrate with reintroduced terpenes for flavor and effect now you can medicate with our concentrate distillate in a variety of methods in a more precise way the first step to assembling your d-line distillate oil is to take it out of its packaging next you'll be removing the childproof cap from the dispenser by pushing down and twisting counterclockwise then remove the rubber cap from the top of your d-line oil vial do not discard these four you'll need them for storage when not in use next you will retrieve the applicator tip from the bottom of the dispenser to do so pull the base straight out from the bottom of the dispenser remove the applicator tip from the dispenser base hold the white base of the applicator tip and turn counterclockwise to place the applicator tip onto the d-line oil vial push down and turn the applicator tip clockwise to securely fasten it to the d-line oil vial you are now ready to use your d-line distillate oil using your thumb and forefinger to grip and twist the d-line oil vial slowly turn it counterclockwise to push the medicine up and through the applicator tip please note do the viscosity of the d-line oil twisting of the vial may require some force as you twist the d-line oil vial you will see the black plunger move upwards inside the vial pushing the medicine up through the applicator tip if you have dispensed more d-line oil than desired twist the distillate vial clockwise to attract the medicine back into the vial be advised that it may not be possible to retract all the d-line oil into the vial once dispensed and always remember to start low and go slow we recommend the minimum point one milliliter dab to start it's about the size of the tip of a ballpoint pen this amount will deliver about 80 to 90 milligrams of cannabinoids it's better to start with the smallest dose possible and take a second if desired afterwards to attract the d-line oil back into the vial twist your D line oil vial clockwise so any deal I know remaining in the applicator tip retracts back into the vial from there you'll be removing the applicator tip from the D line oil vial grip the white base of the applicator tip and twist counterclockwise make sure to clean any residue from the applicator tip before twisting it back on the dispenser base we recommend alcohol wipes or cotton swabs with rubbing alcohol as the most effective cleaning solution then you'll be twisting the applicator tip back on the dispenser base turn the applicator tip clockwise to secure it to the base once secured to the base replace the applicator tip back into the bottom of the dispenser push straight up into the dispenser then you'll be putting the rubber cap back on the top of the vial to prevent any leaks and the childproof cap for safe storage push down and turn clockwise to fasten the cap for safe storage your d-line oil should also remain upright and that is Netta's d-line distillate oil [Music] you", "i3oUc6F0rUw": "[Music] hey guys this is Leon and you have reached the vibe tribe today we are gonna be making a Tincher with cannabis infused alcohol we have it right here this is called Everclear it is 190 proof and just to say how strong it is vodka is usually 80 proof and this is a hundred and ninety so it's very strong it is illegal in most places I believe in Canada the only place you can get it is Alberta but I will put a link in the description of where you can order from I've heard of people having success getting it that way so the first thing we have to do to make Tincher is we have to deke our VAR marijuana which I have done in a different video I will put it also in the description ok so after you have D carved your marijuana you're going to measure out 7 grams you just need to get a little scale like this you can get them from a 420 shop on the scale here it's 7.0 which I have already done for all of my jars so I have 3 separate jars here there is a lot of people that say different things on about how long you should have it sitting with the alcohol and the marijuana so I'm going to do a little experiment and we are gonna try out three different ones to see which ones are stronger they all are the same lead so let's begin so the first thing you're going to need to do after you like I said after you D carve your marijuana the first thing you're gonna do is break it up and put it in one of these jars you're just gonna break it up and smell their little pieces like this breaking up the weed before the tin sure helps release the trichomes faster which are the resin glands of the pot plant so that's where the THC and the CBD and all the other active cannabinoids are so you have to break it up to fine it's not going to be oxygen exposed for very long interesting fact tin sure actually dates back thousands of years and is in the Guinness Book of World Records ever clears and the the Book of World Records for being the strongest alcoholic drink in the world so that's pretty interesting [Music] so I'm not breaking this up very much just a little bit just to expose all the trichomes that are inside okay so this is a very effective way to extract the cannabinoids out of marijuana alcohol does really well with that so you're just an open up your every clear from the reading I've been doing supposedly you can't smell anything but I can smell things so I'm not going closer I'm not a big fan of alcohol myself but I do like the gummies made from this alcohol so you're gonna do it at 240 mils we're just gonna get close everything doesn't have to be perfect we're just gonna get it as close as we can that's good enough and you're just gonna pour that right in there [Music] I've already broken up all this weed that are in these bottles everybody is different with with alcohol and with with marijuana everybody reacts differently with it I personally get really sick when I drink alcohol but for some reason I can handle eating the gummy bears that I'm gonna make from this no problem so you're just gonna seal those and also if you can't get the Everclear you're not able to find you can always use Bacardi 151 proof which you should be able to find in your local almost or LCBO or wherever you go you're just gonna shake it so there has been people who think a couple hours is long enough to be able to get an effect from this Tincher and there's other people who think longer the better or longer the stronger so whatever and you want to do we're gonna do a little bit of our own experiment to try it out and we will see what happens there I really think my opinion longer the better because with even cooking oils if you let them sit for a little while not too long because they do go bad I find what the cooking oils but if you leave it in there for three months it is better than when you just make it so I guess we will see after this is all done so for now we will let you guys go and we'll be back in two weeks one eternity lay down alright guys we are back it has been two weeks and we have let our Tincher sit in a cool dark place I shook it three to four times a day as you can tell it looks very green it did get greener the longer it sat in there I noticed after a couple days it was not really too green but then it changed a lot darker as we got closer to the two weeks so you just gotta take off the lid and you can get one of these little strainers probably from likening the entire there's anywhere that sells kitchen stuff and some people use coffee you know coffee filters but i i've always used this for everything so i'm fine with this so you just put this little guy in here like this and you just pour it in so the reason why it turns green it's actually the chlorophyll which gives the plant to the green color it helps the plant out in a whole bunch of different ways but that was why the teacher turns green and chlorophyll is actually very good for you it has a lot of health benefits including like helps you with aging and increases red blood cells and it is a very good antioxidant so you just want to try to get out as much as you can [Music] okay and then I just want to take one of these little guys and just push it out so for me the alcohol smell is still very strong but I'm very sensitive to the smell of alcohol so that's probably why and if you do have any issues with alcohol if you've had an addiction with alcohol in the past I'd probably make gummy bears with coconut oil instead because you don't want to have a relapse and I will do another video about how to make it with coconut oil as well so just let that drip much you want even leave it sitting on there for a little bit make sure you get all of the teacher out of there and then all you have to do is put the lid on it and store it in a cool dark place until you want to use it and that's how simple making teacher is so I'm gonna make something out of this and I'm gonna come back to you guys and let you know how at two weeks it turned out and then I'm gonna come back with another one or four weeks let you guys know if there's a difference between the two and four weeks and then I'm gonna do another video on the six weeks to let you guys know if it does matter the longer you leave it so we will see okay we'll be back tomorrow I'll let you guys know how it went see you guys later eventually alright well I went ahead and I tried might intro and I have to say at two weeks it turned out really great I'm very happy with it so I'm really excited to see what the four and six weeks turn out like because if it's stronger I probably won't want to eat a whole gummy bear I found one gummy bear was fantastic which I will make a video about how to make gummy bears the best way to use Tincher is actually putting two to three drops underneath your tongue and just leave it under there for about 30 seconds and then swallow and then it goes directly into your bloodstream so it is the best way but you can actually put this in you know a couple drops in a cup of warm water you can put it on your food you can put it in gummy bears anything you really want you can use your drops for so I hope that helps you guys with any pain conditions or just if you want to relax but I'm very happy with it so I hope you guys enjoy the video and I hope that you have no problems making it if you do let me know and I will be more than happy to help you out so comment like and subscribe to the vibe tribe see you guys later peace", "l7dP70VFo90": "site is going I can't even read my Twitter feed I [ __ ] these people I don't live if I don't put my glasses I don't know what the [ __ ] they're saying oh my people don't get depressing it actually I'm saying psychosis is a different thing okay okay I think we are discussing overall mental health yes I mean look I'm saying this because I really think that this is something that I've made a big turn over the last few years with myself that I don't quit bathroom break yes please go I don't think marijuana is as safe as I used to think it is I used to think it was benign I really used to think there was no big deal but I have a friend that I discussed the other day who was a really confident [ __ ] muscular a handsome man that never did anything and he took a marijuana edible to go to sleep and for two weeks this guy was like this is a different guy not that I was taught it's not Rafi no a different guy he took it and he experienced suicidal thoughts and and all these he had like severe consequences I think that the human beings we vary so much biologically that to just make this overall blanket statement of what's good for you is good for me is irresponsible and I've been irresponsible as saying that well one reason it's interesting what out reason I think that alcohol is so widely accepted despite all the problems it causes and again alcohol can certainly cause problems yeah is that alcohol affects most people pretty much the same way you know if and you sort of know if what somebody looks like when they have one drink when they have five drinks got some dress I've got some friends that get those gerbil eyes you ever see when they start talking crazy but you sort of know that and you sort of know how long it's gonna take to clear your body and you yes cannabis is so different it's a really complicated drug and it does affect different people in different yes and also the tolerance has changed yes so you know people say well two and a half milligrams of THC you vape it that's like one drink for somebody who you know who doesn't use but then if you if you're a tolerant user you can use 200 milligrams in a day that's 80 drinks it's a weird drug and then there's the issue of eating it yes when you eat it your body produces something called eleven hydrogen's on a tab alight it's a far more psycho action you were all along for the ride when that happens yes you are yes and it can take days for it to get out of your system I know many people have eaten marijuana edibles and then they call me up the next day like dude I'm still hot yeah yeah so so so I think I think the legalization community has sort of said for years like oh there's basically no downsides to this there's only upsides the cops will bus smokers they'll be tax revenue all these people have a way to get high that's clearly safer than alcohol and unfortunately that's just not true I think you're right and I think the the issue that people from what I've read are having with your book or people that are marijuana advocates that think that your position is unbalanced and that you've ignored the positive aspects of THC in terms of like what he was talking about cognitive benefits for people with psychotic episodes and that you were only focusing on the negative plead guilty today yeah because I think that for 20 years people have only heard the positive right eye I think that's I think that's also I'll plead guilty that myself because I think that I've only been discussing the positives and one of the things that I've tried very hard to do and one of the things I've learned how to do from doing this podcast and experiencing criticism and communicating with a bunch of different people with a lot of different viewpoints is examine my own positions and try to figure out am i coming at this from a truly balanced position or am i trying to support a conclusion that I started out with and I'm trying to you know somehow or another back up my own work or back up my own just my own statements and and and sort of prop them up instead of being really honest and objective right it's very difficult to do listen I wrote a book called tell your children that yeah about marijuana mental illness and violence you're I don't think you can you can think that that book is gonna be a compendium of the pros and cons above if you want to tell your children the truth though you really do want to tell them the pros and cons right and you did indicate Alex you said you know we should tell people the truth yeah in the book right so you know I think that when you're telling and you're saying that that you're telling the truth and Alex I'm agreeing with you that you're telling part of the truth right but part of the truth is you know a little bit deceiving and deceptive it in some ways right you want to tell the whole truth when you tell the whole truth then you give the whole story and then people can actually make you know a good informed decision based upon that like if people are going to just read one part of the story then of course they're going to make a decision just based upon that one part they're not going to make you know an informed decision based upon all of the price and because of that people are going to make you know some very poor choices I completely agree with that but to me the last 20 years have been an exercise in the other side in the legalization side doing a very very good job talking up its arguments and essentially there's there's almost nobody on the other side there's this one I bet what's got Jeff Sessions you had the [ __ ] goddamn attorney general that's telling people that good people don't smoke marijuana that's literally a quote yeah God that little morons not an office anymore but that's that's a terrible thing to say people don't smoke marijuana there's a lot of wonderful people who smoke - is not true and and and by the way I think this is a personal choice okay especially for adults yeah okay and and you can make bad personal choices you go look I play cards I'd love to play poker I'm said that on this trip to LA I didn't get to go to a poker room but you can go a new casino and you can see people of Los Angeles but you can go to a casino and see people who've lost their houses it doesn't mean that gambling should be illegal it also means that there's less and more dangerous forms that device in your hand where you can bet on what the next pitch is gonna be gonna be a ball or a strike yeah that's more dangerous than my having to drive to the commerce and play there and one hundred percent or 98 percent THC that an 18 year old vapes is a lot more dangerous than a 5 percent you know CBD 15 percent THC product the doctor heart might suggest his patient uses once a night to go to sleep but that that's the message that you know we should be putting out there right we shouldn't just be you know focusing on one side of the story like that part you know should also be you know and in the book and like you know your book you know in some ways has made me rethink the way that I write you know because my first book was co-authored with Jeremy cost and called friendly fire you know my second book that I'm writing now is called cannabis for PT G so it's how to transform post-traumatic stress into post-traumatic growth right because I feel that and you know we all know examples of people that have you encountered really difficult obstacles in their life and some people have you know succumb to that stress and they've gone down you know the wrong path kind of thing and then other people have used that stress to their advantage and they've actually become you know better because of it and you know CBD and THC can both help facilitate that process you know when you're looking at someone like like a veteran for example you know the hallmark of someone with PTSD is someone who doesn't leave their home and they can't sleep at night so like when I see a debt in my office a lot of the times they'll be leaving their home like five to ten days a month right so when you give them CBD and this is really important for people understand CBD has been shown to decrease learned fear that's incredible right so if you can get people outside of their home because I'm not talking about again you know someone who's you know too nervous to like go to a you know at the bar with like the friends or some like that I'm talking to people who like you know it's difficult for them to go to the grocery store just like pick up a few things so you know those are the type of people that I see in my practice with CBD is really excellent for that then when you look at you know the the nighttime component you know THC again is excellent for reducing nightmares that's been shown in studies and it was even shown with one pharmaceutical drug now blown again I don't really use now blown very much because it's only one cannabinoid and I do believe in the entourage effect and using all of the cannabinoids so I don't use that that much but that shows that she she can reduce nightmares and you know if you have you have you have PTSD I mean if you talk to someone who has PTSD and again this is this comes from a clinician support of you they will tell you I will try anything and that's the same way when you get with like you know the parents of kids who have see shoes all day nobody wants to see that yeah and like Alex you know if your kids you know ever started getting getting seizures which you know I hope I hope they don't because it's it's terrible you know what it can do to people but your when if that ever happened you know I would hope that you would consider you know CBD as a potential treatment I think she's not against that I think we have to be really clear as tension like CBD you know again CBD at all I don't know I don't think anybody is I think no one really is arguing except maybe the federal government in certain levels is arguing against CBD that's probably some pushback from the pharmaceutical industry the reality is CBD has proven to be at least as far as I've read very safe and very effective for a bunch of different disorders especially those that are about reducing and have it something do with inflammation or seizures yeah one of my good friends his son has developed seizures and CBD knocked it out just killed it this is very recently you know you're somebody who's you know who's a cannabis user you obviously know a lot of users why do you think it is that people you know in legal states where they can really express a preference they can go into a dispensary know exactly what they're buying why is it that they want such high potency THC product because they get used to it your tolerance develops it builds up you know every year we do this thing called sober October well we don't do any no drinking no no pot and then we do some sort of crazy challenge me and three of my buddies and when we do it what it's it's very interesting how your tolerance is radically reduced like I'll smoke pot at the end of that month and I'm like holy [ __ ] like I don't even know what I'm talking about in the mid-sentence and I'm just bullets creaked whereas you know now like I smoked a little weed last night did some stand-up had a great old time there's no issues with it at all but I'm used to it and if the weed that I smoked last I assume you don't smoke right I do not okay if you and me were together last night and I gave you a hit of my joint you'd be still there in the corner in the fetal position gone what and the [ __ ] is going on because the marijuana is ridiculously powerful but once you're accustomed to it once your body acclimates it's really not that big of a deal the problem is you you're dealing with a lot of habitual daily users and for those people like my friend Joey Diaz there's a video of him giving this other comedian how many milligrams of those stars of death Oh Tilly like when we give Owen what did he give oh I think just one he ruined his life and about 200 to 250 oh I made a video but the day changed Owens life like literally [ __ ] the guy's head up like he went outside he vanished he's gone yeah well I think I think there's a real argument to be made it's particularly with him well I was gonna make two points on that so you definitely can develop a tolerance yeah and I tell people all the time trying to take at least one three-week break but the evidence does show that if you stop for four weeks generally all your receptors return and it'll be like you've never used cannabis before yeah and that's even with people who are really really heavy users I can go back and get the study but I mean these people are you using I'm pretty sure it was like close like seven joints a day well really heavy users and noop dogs a good example of that you know my friend Tony Hinchcliffe his good buddies with Snoop Dogg and he said Snoop Dogg just smokes all day and he just like is always high and you know you're like well what do you do when you're not high he's like what I'm never not high so everything he does he is high as [ __ ] everything he does look for that guy it's not that big of a deal and for the way he lives his life like he's just a relaxed easygoing guy it's no problem you could be high all day and live his life and he's obviously wildly successful with this strategy yeah loudly second point I was gonna I was gonna make on that too though was there does not appear to be any tolerance at the cb2 receptor so she she attaches to the cb1 receptor and that's and that's where we know we can get tolerance you know some people you know they they have some pain they use some THC and sometimes they need a little bit more same sometimes asleep you know they use THC it'll work and then we'll stop working with CBD - we haven't seen that meaning like the people who you know get get seizure control generally they don't need to increase of dose like the girl I was talking about earlier you know I first subscriber I think when she was 20 and she was by him 20 she's 25 now she's never increased her dose and she's just used the same amount to CBD for the last think we should really stop talking about CBD I just wanted to make a note on the on the Italian someone I just want to make a note that CB to the doesn't appear to be tolerance it's all yeah it's just there's just such a significant impact when when it comes to especially edible THC it's a there's a significant impact on people's state of mind and it's not always good no that's just a fact we", "toRkngfi0x0": "what's up everybody welcome to the channel today we're going to be making cannabis vegetable glycerin so let's get into it all right so to make my cannabis vegetable glycerin i'm going to be using a mason jar for the whole process [Music] once your cannabis is in your mason jar get ready to decarb your cannabis so we're going to put this in the oven for about 30 to 40 minutes and the oven temperature that we're going to be using is 240.

mason jar [Music] so i'm going to be using roughly 3 4 cups of vegetable glycerin so now i'm going to add this to the mason jar [Music] now we're going to add one teaspoon of sunflower that's a thin [Music] all right guys so now what i'm going to do is add some mct coconut oil to my mason jar now this is optional you don't have to do this [Music] now put your top on now what we're going to do is

cannabis so grab a cheesecloth [Music] [Music] all right guys my cannabis vegetable glycerin is now done so now what i'm going to do is put this in a mason jar but before i do that i just wanted to let you know remember when i first started i started with 3 4 cups of vegetable glycerin currently i only have a little bit over one half but a little bit less than three four cups of vegetable glycerin so you may lose some of your vegetable glycerin during the infusing process and also during the filtering of your cannabis so in my mason jar there is a little bit of vegetable glycerin left but i was able to get out as much as i can so no worries but i just wanted to let you guys know that but let's put this in our mason jar [Music] all right guys my cannabis vegetable glycerin is now

found in marijuana with marijuana legalization becoming mainstream what is the actual difference between CBD and THC inside you right now there's a biological pathway at work called the endocannabinoid system that helps regulate your mood appetite memory and pain sensation THC and CBD though hijack this system this is the chemical structure of THC also known as tetrahydrocannabinol if you are feeling fancy and this is the chemical structure of CBD also known as cannabidiol what you may notice is that their chemical structures seem almost identical they have the same molecular formula which is C 21 H 3002 and both of their masses clocking at 314 grams per mole but there is one extremely important structural difference where THC contains a cyclic ring CBD contains a hydroxyl group and this difference in biochemistry actually controls whether or not you feel high in order to fully understand why you need to first know about the cb1 receptor in your unstoned to sober body your cb1 receptor is affected by a neurotransmitter called an and amide which controls generation of pleasure motivation and feeding behavior in your unstoned body and manda mine is released after exercising and it's what causes a runner's high THC structure is so similar to Ananda mine that it fits in perfectly to the cb1 receptor therefore causing you to feel high CBD on the other hand because of the hydroxyl group is different in shape and does not fit into the cb1 receptor therefore it doesn't make you feel high but CBD does bind to other receptors in your cannabinoid system affecting you in other ways a lot of excitement came around a 2011 study where a few dozen people with social anxiety disorder were asked to speak in front of a large audience some were given CBD some were given a placebo those who were given CBD reported significantly less anxiety there are also many animal studies showing CBDs anti-anxiety and anti-inflammatory properties which can explain why some people say it helps with their anxiety and with chronic pain research is also discovering that THC can actually a head Grove eight psychotic symptoms while CBD on the other hand may help with psychosis so what happens when you consume them at the same time one study found that due to CBDs biochemical shape it can actually bind to the cb1 receptor and turn it off in a binding pattern known to biologists as allosteric inhibition this means that CBD actually makes the THC unable to bind as well and therefore decreases how high you feel if you vaporize marijuana with 25% THC and 0.1% CBD you will feel high as the THC is going to bind to the cb1 receptor with little interference from CBD if you consume marijuana with 25% THC and 12% CBD this more CBD will inhibit the THC from binding to the cb1 receptor decreasing th DS effect and leading you to being less high where marijuana is legally sold likely they will indicate what percentage of THC and CBD is in the product you are choosing which will help you to understand the effects that will have on your body in the end THC is a chemical found in marijuana with a chemical structure that makes you feel high CBD is a chemical found in marijuana with a different chemical structure that doesn't make you feel high but it can affect your body in other less obvious ways there is still conflicting research and a lot more to understand about both chemicals with more states and countries legalizing marijuana hopefully increased research can uncover more details about how these two chemicals affect us because weed is now

so let's get into it [Music] to make my simple syrup i'm going to be using an eighth of cannabis all right guys so once you measure out your cannabis the next step would be to decarb your cannabis so now we're going to put this in the oven for about 40 minutes and the temperature that i'm going to be using is 240. [Music] all right guys my cannabis is now the card remember guys once you decarbon your cannabis your cannabis should be brown if it's not brown you may want to decarb it for a little bit longer [Music] alright guys so now we're going to start working on this simple syrup so let's get into it so the first thing we're going to do is add our water [Music] once the water starts boiling add your sugar i'm going to be using a half cup of brown sugar and a half a cup of white [Music] sugar [Music] all right guys my sugar is now completely dissolved so now i'm going to reduce the temperature and add the vegetable glycerin [Music] all right guys so now i'm going to add our cannabis [Music] now that your cannabis simmer for about an hour on low all right guys so it's been over one hour so now we're going to string the simple syrup [Music] [Music] all right guys my simple syrup is now done i'm going to pour it in this little container right here so you guys can see how it looks my simple syrup is now done thank you for watching this video don't forget to like share and subscribe peace [Music]", "oa-HfwJCqTg": "so today we're going to the labs to see how we can make crystals and other interesting things today I'm gonna show you how to make pure 99% cannabis crystals now it doesn't matter if you make THC or CBD it's the same process here we're making CBD right now in the lab the process is very simple you need a two you need some sand you need some liquid take the extract put it through the column put some liquid inside apply some pressure and there you go you have to wait now if you don't apply pressure you're gonna wait for many days but if you have the pressure it goes very fast you need do it a couple of times in order to get the purity so to get this pure beautiful crystals sometimes up to five times depending on the raw material you have now we have been working very hard to find a way to do this on a coffee machine but I can tell you that I haven't figured that out yet however I think we're gonna work hard on it and in this method you know it's not that simple because you can't buy this everywhere in any supermarket it's very specialized if we look at it in a perspective of CBD and THC first this will be CBD and this will be th see there's a small difference in the molecule so CBD will come out fer first and then teacher will come out so it's very simple just to optimize you have a column okay inside the column you put some very fine sand now you put the mixture of different molecules on top of the sand apply some pressure and the material the sand material will be the filtration material and we'll separate small molecules from big molecules because the small molecules will travel fast so through the sand and the big molecules will travel much slower and some will not even travel if they're too big okay and this is chromatography very simple I'm gonna show you how it works with a color so what happens when you put the extract through and extract you know it's not so colorful you're not gonna see that much but I'm gonna put some color inside so you better can see how it travels through the column now we take the color and we applied in our chromatography machine put the lid on apply the pressure [Music] so the question is whether the crystals appear they will be deluded in your liquid then you have to put it on the coffee machine to evaporate and you will have your pure crystals in the jar simple so let's look at the big machine this machine here is the same as the tube you saw upstairs just much bigger and the pressure system is much bigger here but the principle is the same take the extract this time you take more of it put it into our container and put through the system where we have the sand the small sand yeah and then you get most likely pure can have no it's out in our case pure CBD after doing this process several times next time I'm gonna show you how we do on big scale in real production that's big it's even bigger than this one because to make kilos you need volume you just have to make few grams maybe this will work but we need two kilos so we need a bigger factory for that we tried to make this process simpler and we tried also to develop a method of how to do this in a coffee machine still not working we're working on it how to tell you that and if any of you know how to do it well give us some hints cos we have tough time doing it all right but anyway once we have the solution of how to do it with a coffee machine to pure 99% crystals we will share with you until then stay tuned and don't forget to subscribe [Music] [Music]", "SpUypFOXg9A": "[Music] what's up everybody cupid's here and today we're going to talk about the three most common types of cod concentrate shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called now the names of concentrates usually refer to either the extraction method or the consistency some people refer to all concentrates as wax but we'll try to get into the details because it can be confusing and there's no dictionary definition on some of these yet so you will hear people using one term for multiple things for multiple terms for one thing so when i first started buying legal concentrates in colorado in like 2014 like 95 of the concentrate options were shatter crumble and butter or wax as it's sometimes called and a lot of times all three of these would be called wax or having a sale on wax it would refer to any cured resin that they had so most of what i would get was bho but all this is ethanol extraction and they're still using these terms because we can still come out with these consistencies and it's interesting because this crumble in my opinion is uh more waxy or buttery than the wax and the wax looks a little more crumbly than the crumble it just goes to show you that the terms aren't exact not all crumble is a hundred percent the exact same consistency not all waxes it's just general terms to try to keep them categorized like shatter for example shatter usually refers to as the lighter clear stuff that you can feed through you can't really see through any of the other ones in this one i go to break off a piece it should snap off but there's different types of shatter i mean i've had glass like shatter where it doesn't bend at all it's not malleable in any way it snaps when you try to fold it there's shatter that's called pull and snap where it's a little bit stretchier you can kind of stretch pieces off and they snap off eventually it's still shattered but it's a little bit more malleable and then i've also seen really sappy shatters where it looks like this but just a slightly melted or a slightly warm version shatter is probably the most popular out of the three of these and most people would think that this is the best it can have higher thc percentages but sometimes that means lower terpene percentages now these these two the crumble and the wax are very similar consistency a lot of the crumble that i've been getting in florida is really really dry sometimes crumble ends up looking like that where it's just really dry kind of powdery this video is brought to you by boom head shop the loudest online head shop they carry all kinds of bongs dab rigs vaporizers accessories cleaning products and more check them out and you can save up to 20 off with the cupid's code that's boomheadshop.com when you're making shatter you usually spend a little more time purging out all the fats and lipids when you're making that butter consistency sometimes you'll whip it up while you're purging it so as far as differences goes they're all very similar they'll have similar tastes they'll vaporize basically about the same it's just how they're handled now i don't really like crumble and shatter that much they're my least favorite they're the hardest to handle concentrates in my opinion if you get a really hard shatter it'll break off when you try to go get a piece or crumble sometimes it's really hard to handle really hard to scoop it's super dry sometimes it just smears all over the container and you're trying to get it off and there's just a thin film of it on the inside so i'm hoping this video gives you a little insight on the consistencies the terms aren't too literal they can mean a variety of things there's a bunch of different things you could call shatter a wax or crumble that would fit the criteria or fill that category when i first got into dabbing shatter was my favorite i thought because it had the highest thc percentage that it was going to be the best one oh man biggest numbers in this one but then i learned after several incidents of handling it losing some it was my least favorite to deal with it's usually the least flavorful out of the three there so out of the three i would say butter is my absolute favorite crumble and shadow are [ __ ] i hate those consistencies they're the worst anyway if you like this video

watching venom 4/20 right back that's a weed station I don't smoke weed how do you know it is 4/20 what the [ __ ] think of me well no I'm dumb hello I'm Benna 4:20 and today we're gonna be looking at how to dab CBD isolate the things you're gonna need are gonna be some CBD isolate torch banger dab rig you're gonna need something to scoop up the CBD isolate so either some type of dab tool or a little scoop you're gonna need a carb cap a q-tip or I actually like to use fold it up a paper towel some rubbing alcohol always helps to have a thermometer to know exactly what temperature you're doing things first thing you know wanna do is warm up your Bangert if it's glowing red-hot you're going probably close to a thousand degrees easy so give it some time to cool down if you have a nice thick banger like this one is it might take like 30 seconds or so I say the optimal temperature is right around 600 to 700 degrees somewhere in between there we're gonna say hi to the Panda where's my cat Pandora and we're good so we'll go ahead and grab a scoop here like that [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] nice and the stuff I got that tastes like pure it's a sweet like sugar or something then you're just gonna want to take a like I said I have a little paper towel I just like to kind of tighten up and fold up and I ducked it in some rubbing alcohol already you just wipe it out like that and you were good to go so that's basically all there is that was a nice low temp one I did there I mean it was not harsh at all tastes amazing the benefits to dabbing CBD are awesome I absolutely love having this stuff around really good for anti-anxiety it actually makes you really relaxed it's good for pain relief for sleeping it has a lot of the medicinal qualities of like smoking a bowl except for you don't feel stoned at all it also tastes amazing it's enjoyable to smoke as well plus I have a lot of friends who don't like to dab something don't even like to smoke pot and is really fun taking dabs with them like it's [ __ ] awesome I would highly recommend it like I said I will always keep some CBD isolate around just to have I'm ever not feeling super cool like like I said I don't wish anxiety on my worst enemy so anything to combat that I am all for between that and having something that my non-smoking friends can dab with me that's just [ __ ] awesome I highly recommend you do your research and get it from a trusted company I got this from IHP refinery like this one from I HP comes with a [ __ ] lab testing and all that [ __ ] on each individual batch I mean make sure you know you're getting there's a lot of shiftiness in the branding of CBD products check out my video on CBD and I go kind of into detail about that way more otherwise I highly recommend it and I can't recommend this stuff enough like it tastes like [ __ ] you [ __ ] sugar dude it's crazy it tastes like [ __ ] amazing like dad and cotton candy or something it's great [Music] [Music] [Music]

screwing it and you know some C cells they're like packed on somehow and they're very hard to get off those come with you know a lot of pre-fills you I don't know you can try to rip those I don't I

this is not a full half GM using right now there we go and don't worry about being too perfectly you see it's a little spread out all over the place but it's not a big deal just cap it on screw it

it", "d2SkQ_yL8CA": "now then it's a campaign that this morning is followed very closely last summer we were first joined on the show by Charlotte Caldwell whose son Billy has to be epilepsy or Charlotte was pleading with the government for a special prescription to license and distal cannabis oil for her son you cannot take away an antiepileptic medications you cannot stop it abruptly yeah it has to be weaned in the first done things so I'm sayin tune that chord this morning please give me back at police medication today because he needs his medication this is not anything to do with recreational but you're just silent as death warrant so please give it back he's not a doctor Philip he's a minister so he should be listening to the doctor in Canada well after the success of Charlotte's campaigning the law was changed and last week marked one year since the perception of medical cannabis was legalized in the UK but despite the change in the law many doctors are still hesitant to give out the drug and we're joined this morning by doctor Javed Abdel Moneim to separate the fact from the fiction good morning new you so first of all I guess we should understand that what what is it in this cannabis that's supposed to help medicinally well there are there are lots of compounds in cannabis it's a whole plant but the the ones that people believe are active are called cannabinoids there are two that are most important it's CBD you may have heard of that and there's another called THC now that's the one that can cause a high it can cause ill effects but CBD is the one when in combination people think could be the ticket so what is the current law in the UK well the court as you said it changed that just about a year ago law says that specialists not GPS that's the important part specialists can prescribe cannabis based medicinal products only if other treatment options have failed and if they feel there really is a benefit so there must be NHS guidelines in place for prescribing cannabis what do they say yes now the guidelines are there the guidelines are very clear medicinal cannabis can be prescribed only when clear published evidence of benefits exists and other treatment options have been exhausted now those are in draft but that's pretty clear it makes it very very difficult to for example you're certainly not going to get it from your GP right but you've you visit this is the cannabis with the THC in it the because CBD you can you can you can buy absolutely it's available over-the-counter CBD that's that's deregulated in that sense and THC is still the part that's illegal but the you know the evidence over which works in what combination from which diseases is that is what's still not why aren't the doctors prescribe why is it not being prescribed it's a combination of things firstly that guidance it's pretty clear if you if you haven't exhausted other treatments you shouldn't be doing this secondly it called for more evidence there really isn't enough evidence out there that's utterly clear about one agent versus another and thirdly its infrastructure for example Billy had it prescribed but it cost him a thousand pounds a month the import licenses the customs the the protocols for moving the substances into the UK just aren't that so it sounds like the evidence in the infrastructure needs to catch up really with what the laws say and the THC but just explain why is that so helpful what is what what is it so there you go all it's a THC III say it as an acronym it's the high causa that's not necessarily as helpful it's the CBD that is and no one knows how or why and it's certainly the CBD that has more suggestion of help in chronic pain in epilepsy that's difficult to treat and so forth but there are also people who wish that both should be used in combination you say there is a lack of evidence is there evidence ongoing are we actually looking at this now because it's essentially it's a natural product absolutely and it's been around for thousands of years so there was a call for evidence into eight research areas there is soon to be announced potentially a trial a project looking at about 20,000 patients to follow them over the next two years and that's been brought about by a group of patient advocates a certain charity and actually a cannabis medicine or cannabis production company and and and the NHS group that looks over this has said it would be great to have this evidence so watch this space and is that currently sort of a range of conditions that we know that it's helpful for absolutely I mean it's actually licensed in the NHS for use in after chemotherapy it's also licensed for severe epilepsy but again this is only when other usually licensed medicines have been exhausted and the patients aren't getting the benefit from what's already around and more commonly used now people who buy the CBD over-the-counter they say it's useful for sleep for anxiety for potentially for appetite people use it as creams for their skin a whole host of myriad of ailments but that's slightly different that over-the-counter sort of you do they work let me know they are they good the evidence just isn't there but does that mean they don't work I mean cuz there's a lot of online evidence of sort of testimonial where people will say oh my god this has changed my life so it's that only count that I will listen I'm I'm I'm listen if it's CBD not known to cause harm right if it works for you placebo or otherwise I'm quite happy because it can get very expensive but I mean it depends sort of the the what you're buying and how much is in it and this that and the other because it varies and I think that's the problem that people find they're going doing well I don't know what's right for me I don't want to buy exactly and the over-the-counter CBD is actually only a food regulation type item so that isn't thoroughly controlled like a medicine sometimes you don't even know what's in the bottle to you mention that it's this is this has been ongoing for thousands of years people have taken cannabis for ailments for obviously for other reasons why is it taking so long for this and there there are mums and dads desperately concerned about their children why is it taking so long I think there's a social cultural eminent element doctors just aren't used to prescribing this one too the evidence just isn't there the last guidance that came out in August really did almost put a hold on it but that's going to deliver potentially next week they'll finalize the guidance I don't think it'll change much extremely upset about I'd be happy to be wrong yeah thank you thank you I'm coming in today you", "87FgbwgR34E": "hey guys welcome back to the do gross on today's episode I'm gonna show you how to make edible chocolates I'm gonna do pretty much from the start to the finish starting out with infusing butter and enough with a really simple way to do chocolates we're not making it from scratch we're just infusing like baker's chocolate with our and fused butter [Music] well for this batch butter I decided I wanted to go with green crack which is a hybrid strain but it's it leans a lot more towards a sativa side so it kind of wanted a good daytime high-energy kind of butter to make these chocolates with [Music] so I did want to make this butter fairly strong fairly potent and I had two cups of butter and which is basically four sticks of butter and I infused a quarter ounce of this group of cracked flour into the butter with the magical butter machine the first thing that we have to deal with our cannabis is 2d carbon so throw it near oven at 250 ish degrees and spread it out a little bit and make sure it's in there for about 31 well that does is it transfers the THC a and to THC psychoactive property in cannabis so you definitely need to do that before infusing it in the oil little tip if you guys are using this magical butter machine is while your d carbon erat cannabis just throw your like hard butter right into the magical butter machine right now and start it up for an hour on low temperature just so you can melt your butter and then it's ready for the D carb wheat as soon as it comes out [Music] well after 30 minutes in the oven I pulled out all that weed and took it off the stem no need to put the stems in there and ended up having 12 grams of cannabis that went into four I'm sorry two cups of butter all you need to do is just add that right into your butter solution that you have all warmed up and add a little bit of soy or sunflower less at it as well that helps to emulsify and combine the cannabinoids to the butter I love this magical butter machine though it does it all for you adjust 162 hours once everything's in there you are good to go to set it and forget it for two hours [Music] all right so let's talk about dosing that is a thing that's really hard to find exactly the right the right metrics on how to get it I found this website this calculator out there and you need to know the starting material the THC in the starting material I know the screen crack is roughly 20% so that's what I'm starting with and if you're using trim you might not really know what you're getting so this one I wanted to get a more accurate test on on the exact THC percentage per serving [Music] I was gonna be melting down 12 ounces of chocolate and I was gonna add two ounces of the infused butter so I knew that for the 12 ounces of chocolate I was gonna have roughly 210 milligrams of THC that's going to get infused in that entire batch I didn't know the final amount of serving still after I poured it and that's how many the runner and the first one so the first set of chocolates so I do that that was roughly 5 milligrams per chocolate in the first batch all right so after two hours next step is we just have to classify the butter away from all the cannabis material that's left in the bag so there's this bag comes with the magical butter machine which is basically just like a strainer so pour it all in there squeeze it all out get all the butter through hopefully you don't get too many solids that come through with it there definitely want some milk fats that came through but was able to pretty much clarify that out by just pouring it into the jar before I was gonna add that to the chocolates you do lose some starting material as well so even though I went in with two cups of butter I only came out with about maybe a confident corner of of the butter I probably could have done a little bit better like squeezing out more but that was the clearest stuff that I got and that was the stuff I was happiest with so yeah only about 1 and 1/4 cup but off of the two cups of butter I started out just by doing a small double boiler thing you can warm up chocolate however you feel like this I just boiled some water put another pan on top of it in the water and poured in the chocolate chips from there so 12 ounces of chocolate chips and 2 ounces of the infused oil [Music] after that just start for a few minutes want to make sure it's obviously very evenly infinim mixed in they might want to separate a little bit I actually did add a tablespoon of some more lesson to this as well to help with the emulsification of the oil and the chocolate [Music] the first bachelor did two ounces and wanted to see how the consistency was they seemed really good when it popped amount so the second one I was like maybe we can make these a little stronger so I added three ounces to the next batch which ended up being on the dark chocolate chocolate chips that who meld up here [Music] now all that's left to do is just pour them into your molds I use these silicone molds I got off of Amazon I didn't need to oil them at all they pop out super easy so yeah just forms for an ear molds and then right under your freezer only takes about 30 minutes for them to firm up once you have your final count about how many servings you have then you can actually see how many milligrams of your THC is in each serving so my first batch I kind of overfilled a little bit all the way up to the top and I got like 40 for individual chocolates of this semi-sweet stuff with the two ounces of infused oil which was roughly 5 milligrams per serving my second batch the dark chocolate I used 3 ounces of oil actually a little bit more than that and it ended up making 62 I want to say 62 servings so a lot more servings and that's visit and pour in the chocolate quite as much but the THC percentage was roughly the same because I used that more THC infused oil in the whole batch you I have all sorts of different containers and stuff for flour and inedible so I put some of these little ten summons bags and then I'm gonna be leave them in my refrigerator for I don't know maybe a week or so eating them once in a while but also just want to let them dry out a little bit there a little bit moist so yeah leave it in the fridge for a bit and I think they'll be good on the shelf for at least a couple months and that is it I think that is the easiest way that you can make chocolate edibles they're not making any chocolate you're just melting down existing chocolate adding your oil boom done simple as that so it's gonna work for a lot of us that aren't expert cooks like myself and yeah I think these things will be great so check out the magical butter machine if you're interested at all in making infused oils you won't regret it I'm going to post a link down below that you can click as well to get it off Amazon and if you've watched a couple of these videos that though if you subscribed and hung around got more videos coming up about once a week and yeah I think that's about it for now

concentrated vaporizer cartridges and pens before we get started with the review I would like to thank the guys at steezy for sending out the cartridges that we're using today and setting up this review if you'd like to learn where to purchase them or to learn more about them please check out Steve's e-comm or find them on weed Maps now let's get started here's the unboxing of the steezy starter pen kit this is the pen that you will need if you're going to use any of the steezy cartridges inside of the box with the pen you have an owner's manual instructions warranty information you also have a USB charging cable and the steezy vaporizer unit itself and you can see we have a real simple kit there nice-looking little vaporizer unit but of course you're also going to need a cartridge that we're gonna unbox one of the indica biscotti and inside of the cartridges you will find also an owner's manual to tell you how to use it as well as the cartridge itself and you had you can say this is where the magic happens with this product here and we'll get it and talk more about the oil inside of these cartridges in just a second but first let's take a closer look at the pen and the cartridges themselves the pen is actually metal I thought it was plastic but upon inspection it's actually a nice metal pen there you've got the microUSB charging cable in the bottom and at the top you have the elements or the connectors that will connect it to the actual cartridges it's a really nice shape and design and it's very very small and stealthy it fits right in the palm of your hand and it's very light and you can see at the bottom of the carpet cartridges there's a little cap that comes off and that shows you where the connections is that'll connect it to the device you plug it into device the device flashes a couple of times blue there's also a light at the bottom on the heel of device and I'm not sure if it's intended but that cap that was on the bottom makes a perfect little dust cover to keep the land out of it and so yeah that that's pretty much it on the device list now to get to the most fun part of it at this little usage and the testing of the steezy concentrate pin first you're gonna charge it up that blue light there will be red while it's charging it once it's fully charged it turns blue you know it's fully charged and then comes the hard part and isn't making a decision we had 12 different flavors to choose from we had a for each of the indica as the hybrids and the sativas three or four of those were actually flavored as well but most of them were just strained specific and I tell you what they taste spot-on this is some of the best taste and cleanest wax I've hit it's a very very enjoyable experience the taste is smooth you can get a big hit if you inhale for a minute it does after about 10 seconds or so it will automatically cut off but believe me you'll have plenty of big enough hit for maximum head this pin is really great it's so easy to use the taste was incredible on all 12 of those different strains believe me I've tested them all and they're really amazing they're a distill it so they're out 90% THC and man you can really feel it let's go to the pros and cons oh the pros are that is so super easy to use it it's very clean of all these cartridges I had there was no leaks no breaks or any kind of problems with any of the cartridges the taste is amazing you can get big hits or you can get small hits and it's very strange specific no additives and the extract themselves cons are the battery life is a little short and the packaging on the cartridges tastes a little bit like or smells like on the issue anyway I still think it's great I'm gonna give it 4.5 stars out of 5 it's amazing so if you are in the market

cannabinoid association as i've previously stated this industry is brand new to everyone this is especially important when considering law enforcement professionals at the local state and federal levels remember that literally overnight plant material that looked and smelled like marijuana suddenly became a legal commercial scale agricultural crop similarly unique chemical components contained within or derived from this new agricultural commodity went from being completely misunderstood to being completely protected at the federal level as a result of such a drastic and immediate shift in policy consumers entrepreneurs law enforcement professionals and their regulators have all been struggling to interpret this legislation as accurately as possible unfortunately that has created a bizarre avalanche of misinformation throughout the industry the remainder of this video intends to clarify the legality of emerging cannabinoids such as delta 8 thc at the local state and federal levels now i've had the honor and privilege of working with a lot of cannabinoid industry professionals for those of you that haven't met me personally my background is actually in chemical and legislative consultation so back in the day i would help explain chemistry to legal professionals so they could craft better legal strategies for their clients and i would explain law to scientists so they could understand the significance of their testimony as fate would have it this is the exact background necessary to analyze legality of delta hthc at various legal levels i want to start by addressing the dea's interim final rule that was issued back in august of 2020. a lot of industry professionals incorrectly assumed that ruling would somehow impact the legality of delta 8 thc at the federal level the following serves to clarify why that is not currently the case but before i go any further i want to begin by emphasizing my respect and support for the dea for all of its agents and for all of its legal professionals they are hard-working americans that are working every day to protect our best interests and enforce the laws as written you know they're not the bad guys that are out trying to destroy the cannabinoid industry and the reason that's important is because firstly congress is the law making body with constitutional authority to write laws and pass bills so the 2018 farm bill which was crafted by congress and signed into law by the president clearly establishes legislative intent that specifically protects hemp as currently defined now this protects the plant cannabis sativa l and any part of the plant including the seeds derivatives extracts cannabinoids isomers acids salts salts of isomers whether growing or not as long as it's below 0.3 percent delta 9 thc on a dry weight basis this is important because regulatory agencies do not have the constitutional authority necessary to change this law until congress passes an amendment or updates the language of the farm bill in 2022 this federal definition of hemp that protects delta hthc and other emerging cannabinoids remains the law of the land secondly the language of the interim final rule doesn't target delta 8 thc instead it references synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinols now while delta hthc is structurally considered a tetrahydrocannabinol the language of the farm bill specifies that its congressional protections supersede the classifications found in the controlled substance act furthermore delta eight thc isn't usually synthetically derived now while it can be chemically synthesized from non-hemp derived precursors it is generally derived from hemp via the isolation of cbd again not only is delta 8 naturally occurring in the plant it is also derived from the hemp plant both of these characteristics make the compound federally compliant under the 2018 farm bill now i know there's a lot of you out there saying that obtaining commercial quantities of delta athc involves a synthetic process and here's why i fundamentally disagree take for example terpenes right there are hemp derived terpenes there are plant derived terpenes and synthetically derived terpenes now if i take my hemp i run it through steam distillation i isolate some of the terpenes are those now synthetically derived terpenes of course not the addition of a man-made process to consolidate isolate and or derived a chemical that doesn't impact the idea that it is still naturally derived in order to protect the legal nature of your delta athc you need to prioritize seed to sale traceability you also need to make sure that you are licensed in your state and you are following all of their guidelines including local labeling laws finally it is important to recognize that while federally protected delta athc is not legal in every state municipality for more information about protecting your deltae production and sales please reach out to our organization directly i very much appreciate your time and consideration i look forward to speaking with you in person best wishes from the american cannabinoid association", "f7h9Y6ZAHSo": "okay that's how you refill dizzy you'll see there's these little holes here there's an empty cartridge the first part is getting this thing off it's very hard on the gram carts I couldn't even do it here's the half gram but you just want to rip it off essentially put a little pull it sometimes you might use your teeth but don't ruin your teeth and there's the little hole and this hole actually is perfect size for the syringe so the syringe goes right into that hole if you want to and you somehow can't fit that syringe in there you have a different style syringe you could pop this rubber off just make sure that when you refill it these little things all line up and fit in there properly if there's not proper air suction it will not activate so we'll go ahead here and we'll do it the easy way which is you have a tip like this tip here's our still it syringe taking off screwing let's go right in that hole fit through it need to go south will happen there take it out but the other half in there there you go I don't even fill it all the way up that's fine it's good enough and then pop that back on and you got a refill it's dizzy cartridge yeah", "33Tow5gDvoI": "they explain to my viewers what RSO is in the most simple terms you can so as we hear that term a lot tomorrow RSO is basically a full plant extracted with ethanol oil so you get all the benefits of the you know the fact that wax is the lipids and the terpenes of the cannabis plant we more focus on we use freeze pure hundred proof of ethanol we use we get our ethanol down to freezing temperatures and do a quick wash so we focus more on extracting just the cannabinoids experiment the fats and waxes that go there give you three process yeah okay that's why ours is usually a lot better color than your traditional RSM oh so we don't really consider it too much our our Morikawa a CEO for alcohol but it is all fully activated it is generally it's just harvested over which is what you're actually wanted to take this", "0Q2l2WXNsWE": "Trulli was excited to offer a new solution to a challenge that patients are having when using our true clear syringe this is what the syringe looks like true clear is a concentrate so it's very very thick and at times it can be difficult to plunge out of the syringe so true leave now offers a true clear syringe warmer it comes in two separate pieces the first piece is the actual warming device itself the second is a button battery pin with the charger so let's talk about how this product works and how much easier that makes using Tripler one for using your true clear warmer is to make sure you have your button battery fully charged this USB chargers and any USB wall port or phone charger accessory once it's fully charged remove the battery let's head it aside you're going to connect the warming chamber to the button battery step two is to turn on the button battery vape in to activate the warming chamber you're going to click five times within three seconds now to heat the true clear syringe you're going to insert the syringe with the tip side down with the lid on it's very important if you don't leave the lid on and you warm the syringe up too much the concentrate may come out of the tip you also want to make sure the plunger is fully showing out of the warming chamber that way this doesn't get warm and you'll be able to easily handle it now step three because you want to hit this button two more times and it's gonna go on a color cycle of warming and when the color cycle ends your syringe will be warm enough it's about 10 to 15 seconds if you remove the syringe you should feel warm to the touch step 4 is to remove the cover and dose out the syringe if your syringe has not heated up enough go ahead and run the cycle again it may take 15 to 30 seconds to get it to the appropriate temperature but it all depends on how warm the syringe already is maybe how much concentrate is left in there so now it feels a lot warmer again you'll remove the tip and push out the appropriate dose Step five when you're done warming your true clear syringe you want to pull back to get the oil back into the chamber wipe the lid with some rubbing alcohol to remove any residual oil true clear so it doesn't get you sticky put the lid back on and then turn off the pin by clicking five times within three seconds so let's talk about price on these two accessories the reason they're sold separately is because the true leave true pair warming chamber will actually fit into any button battery vape penned by screwing it in so if a patient already has a button battery stick pen they can buy this separately and still be able to warm their true clear the price of this is twenty dollars the true leaves silver button battery pin is also twenty dollars again this can be purchased individually to use with the apart Rajas or together to use with the true clear warmer they're both priced separately at $20 but if patients need to buy them together because they don't have the button battery pin already they can get both for $30 so again the warming chamber is $20 individually the pen is $20 individually but if patients purchase them together it's $30", "ATDB4zmZKlE": "CBD cannabis oil has attracted a lot of THC the CBD what is CBD CBD has well and truly brought the cannabis plant into the mainstream it's touted as having loads of health benefits and can be found in all sorts boils creams wine teabags sweets you name it and it's been all over the headlines but for something so talked about there's a lot of uncertainty about how it actually sits within the law CBD is a major compound found in the cannabis plant it's thought to affect the receptors in our nervous system and have broad medicinal benefits potentially treating conditions like anxiety insomnia and chronic pain but it won't give you a euphoric high and it's legal pure CBD is legal unlike its counterpart THC which is the other major compound found in cannabis THC produces the psychoactive effects that get you high and it's not legal in the UK but it's difficult to separate CBD from THC fully as they can come from the same plant now it's important to make the distinction here between hemp and marijuana hemp is legal to grow in the UK with a very low percentage of THC marijuana on the other hand refers to cannabis which contains more than this legal limit the home office says it's legal to grow industrial hemp containing up to 0.2% THC with a license however this is commonly misunderstood as applying to CBD products technically the legal limit of THC in finished products is 0% and research into the industry has found that a lot of commercially available CBD products include traces of THC this strict limit isn't currently being enforced and is unclear how it would be in the future right now the booming CBD market is frankly a of a mess the existing regulations are complex and vague and there isn't a standardized way of testing CBD products or labeling them instead every CBD product out there is subject to different regulations depending on what type of product it is so let's take CBD oil as an example is probably the most popular CBD product and it's classified as a food supplement not a medicine even though that's what most people use it for this means the CBD oil you find on a shop shelf won't have gone through tests and clinical trials like a medicine would have and it can't make any health claims on the bottle plus dosage guidelines and prices vary massively and you have to rely on the manufacturer's assurances that the product contains what it claims to and then other CBD products say cosmetics or veyts are subject to different regulations so at the moment got a situation where we've got a product that is super popular everyone wants to buy it everyone wants to sell it but the problem is no one really knows much about it particularly legal status of it and whether or not it can be used as a food product whether or not can be used as a cosmetic product and if it can whether or not it can be allowed to have a certain quantity of the narcotic element in it in this country technically you shouldn't have any THC at all in the product itself if you want to travel with it then you're going to have to check with the country that you're going to whether or not they will allow CBD oil to be in your possession or for you to use it or even travel with it some places won't even let you take it on a plane and to check that I would say look on the website of the government of the country that you're traveling to and if it isn't clear which in a lot of situations it isn't clear just don't travel with it so currently whether your CBD oil shampoo or tea bag complies to UK regulations or contains what it claims to is far from straightforward but thankfully there is momentum behind initiatives for independent product testing and clearer regulations because the CBD boom looks pretty set to continue and until the benefits are proven in clinical trials and regulations have caught up treat CBD with caution it's an exciting area of research but there are still many unknowns about dosage drug interactions and the effectiveness of over-the-counter CBD [Music]", "unk9d9fqyXk": "I was interested in chemistry from a young age when I was in fifth grade I wrote down that I wanted to work on epileptic cures and work on research for disabled children when we were seniors in high school the teachers sent it back to us and it was kind of neat to see that I was going on to be a research scientist making the tools that doctors can provide to patients I was introduced to cannabis as my brother was working at a construction company and was asked to build a dispensary and through that effort became more aware of the whole community went out into the public and started talking to some of the individual patients and I myself had my own medicinal need so I was curious how much could this be effective for me which types of medicines might be best THC and CBD are both used across medicinal use and adult use THC is rather psychoactive where CBD is not really early you can see research that suggests CBD might be very helpful when you go talk to a lot of the dispensaries they're not really aware of what CBD or a non psychoactive use of cannabis might be like what if a lab was present and could tell them how do we really start to put medicine into medicinal cannabis when we first started that was the first question was why would you ever touch that stuff well when you look at it in a different fashion when you understand that it could be very beneficial in therapeutic uses helping you know epileptic children or other individuals who might be ailing or helping people reduce their opioid use you can look at cannabis in a much broader fashion than just THC rates patient here in Southern California I was really concerned about HIV meds that promotes cancer on the long term side effects I started having tumors in my head my ears my temple CBD it erupted cancer drove so I started making tinctures for myself the picture is a liquid form of cannabis I notice my autoimmune system was really starting to kick down though I'm really fine and life's good I rely a lot on the lavatories reports I want to make sure that it does not have any a mold or mildew and safe for people to just the predominant amount of work that happens here is analytical chemistry so what molecules are present in which products I can figure out how to say this type of cannabis product is going to be best for this consumer I really have a winning solution lawmakers have established the laws now the regulator has to establish the rules and details of those laws so they're really leaning on laboratories in their experience to say hey scientists that are out there that have thought about these problems what do we need to know as a regulator so that we can get these rules set up in the right fashion we have to educate through research and scientific understanding these professional associations such as the American Chemical Society have message boards they have networking event and they're all geared towards bringing these people together who have been largely isolated in the past through the cannabis chemistry subdivision we're seeking to validate the good works that people are doing and provide additional collaboration opportunities and ways for people to explore this expanding space the world is very bright for chemists to get engaged inside of cannabis and really take a fresh look at it and say how do we harness this natural resource that we could use in different types of ways to improve society and the world around us [Music]", "sjqhtoh7xLQ": "so you'll take this part of the plan and that's eventually what becomes the CBD it is yep yep at med farm Colorado's first licensed cannabis research facility CEO Albert Gutierrez walked us through how CBD is extracted from a cannabis plant to oil first it goes to a co2 extractor and is further separated with ethanol we're gonna separate the waxes and fats and we don't want in the product from the cannabinoids that we do want to see VD smell then the ethanol is separated in what's called a rotary evaporator that's usually about 75 to 80 percent cannabinoid content so what is this machine this is a white film evaporator we're loading that cannabinoid content that we just got out of the rotary evaporator into here and we're gonna let that content seep down into this jacket right here so you'll get CBD testing it then 90 to 99 percent purity and we'll test it right after this but that's going to be very high quality products and we call it that the money jar and this idea you might have a little bit as well okay for testing just to see can you extract it more from here absolutely her choreography we can extract it and make it isolated to be booty recessive teen performs a series of tests to know what they're making oil this is just a base and we can make into whatever we need to make out of it what you're gonna make creams tinctures who can make pills CBD can also be crystallized this is the crystallized form in the powder form of that no THC in here strictly CBD is testing at 99.9 percent purity then put into a product and shipped out to consumers buying into the CBD trend for today Kristen Dahlgren NBC News Denver you", "-vZQhYfwizs": "health alert now on cannabis and cardiovascular health a warning from the american heart association they find that marijuana is linked to an increased risk of heart trouble including heart attacks and heart failure janae norman has the details good morning janae hey george good morning yeah would you believe that during the pandemic the marijuana business is booming already on track to outpace all of last year as the aha took a look at how both recreational and medicinal use impact cardiovascular health this morning as sales of marijuana soared during the pandemic a new warning from the american heart association that the marijuana millions use may actually be hurting their hearts in a new review of studies the organization finding cannabis use may be linked to an increased risk of heart attacks and heart failure there have certainly been reports of people with heart rhythm abnormalities hospitalized patients who have more complications of their heart attack for example when they're hospitalized with a heart attack or heart failure dr rosemarie robertson the deputy chief science and medical officer of the aha cautioning more research needs to be done after multiple studies found smoking the the in cannabis could shrink blood vessels that feed the heart and lungs i think it's clear to us that using marijuana thinking that it might help your heart or be good for the cardiovascular system there is no evidence for that the evidence that it can harm you is also anecdotal but there is some researchers also finding that edible marijuana appears to be associated with even more harmful heart and psychiatric complications because of the amount of thc absorbed into the body system but cbd is different studies finding that the portion of the marijuana plant that doesn't produce a high has actually been associated with a reduced heart rate and lower blood pressure this as purchases of marijuana spike when the country went on lockdown in march more than a dozen states deemed cannabis stores and medical marijuana dispensaries essential businesses in colorado retail marijuana sales in may were 35 million dollars higher than in 2019. and both oregon and washington state seeing their cannabis sales spike through the late spring and early summer as consumers spend more time at home and so more research is needed and the aha suggests that the dea remove cannabis as a schedule one controlled substance so that it can be widely studied because as it stands now as a schedule one drug cannabis is defined as having no medical use and a high potential for

earth my name is chilly back at you with another day pass video and in today's video we're gonna be talking about something super fun today we are going to be comparing delta eight versus delta nine and decide really who wants it more and which one is actually better [Music] okay so we're gonna be smoking a little bit of delta 9 yet egg um got a little bit of bud we're going to get you a little shot here is the bud that i'm smoking on today it is literally nothing special there we go nothing crazy nothing crazy at all and we got ourselves a new bowl boys the other one broke alright that bowl this is the new bowl so that way i don't break it rubber and then you just pop this out to clean it uh yeah so if you are new here remember to like comment subscribe all that good youtube [ __ ] if you guys do not know you won't know i'm on twitch twitch.tv slash chillydilly link in the description as always now let's grind this weed up and actually get into the [ __ ] video eh okay so i wanted to take the time to compare the two of delta delta nine really sit down think about it think about the points and think about this argument okay so delta a being on the rise and with this still being legal right now with you being able to buy it online with all that stuff more people are getting into it and you have two halves of a crowd one saying i don't get high and one thing i get high as [ __ ] if you check out my delta 8 uh negative video you can just go through the comments and you can find people arguing for days about how it gets them high and some people it doesn't uh anyway let's get into our first point okay anxiety all right so i think we both know you know if you've smoked delta nine we both know me you everybody watching this video that regularly smokes sale tonight we've all smoked a strain of delta nine that has made us paranoid as [ __ ] you know what i mean it could just be a certain strain bro smoke it next thing you know you're [ __ ] geeking out um it's not the best we have saved the best for last this is our favorite we played it before before the police officer who himself calls 9-1-1 after he and his wife decided to unwind one evening by mixing up a batch of pot brownies here are the best parts bon appetit i think i'm having an overdose of this my wife okay you and your wife yes overnose of what marijuana i think we're dying how much did you guys have uh i don't know we made brownies and i think we're dead i really do time is going by really really really really slow did you guys do this on a regular basis no this is the first time that we've ever done it you've never done marijuana before par yeah i have you've never had this reaction to it before ever let's just go on the redwings game what what's the score in the red wings game i'm getting uncool i don't watch the runway i don't know you just you know what i mean i make you uh question your life decisions and yeah pretty much it can be a bad time you know what i mean but with delta eight it's the opposite uh it's meant to be less pair like it takes away the psychoactive effect so you're supposed to not be paranoid you're not supposed to have anxiety so yes well for the most part with delta 9 you don't really get anxious every experience that i've had with delta 8 i didn't have any anxiety at all not one bit i felt just fine honestly all right let's pack a bowl boys let me know what you guys are smoking on dab on eating on anything you're doing to ingest the lovely thc cheers boys oh yeah man that shit's good that's the good [ __ ] let's hear it again boys cheers that's rough okay so pretty much i'm gonna say most people have smoked up tonight dozen nine got anxious paranoid most people delta it's the exact opposite so we're gonna have to get this point to delta eight okay now for the next one this is a pretty controversial topic i feel like um you know and all of this really is when you think about it because you're gonna have groups of people that are like oh it doesn't make me paranoid and then groups that say that it does you know what i mean the next one price you like that the price anyway so the price right so this is gonna be a hard one to really even discuss about but i'm gonna throw in all the variables for the most part so i live in a legal state an illegal state so i don't have medical marijuana i don't have recreational marijuana um i buy it i get it when i get it that's it like a lot of people that watch my videos you know what i mean so for the most part i know there are people out there paying 20 a [ __ ] g which is crazy my boys don't don't just don't just smoke delta just try it at that point and then you got people that live in like colorado and they're paying [ __ ] 130 for an ounce of some [ __ ] that you were paying 20 a g for so with that said i think for the most part especially in legal states but is cheap i mean it's pretty cheap you can buy an ounce cheap you got mid shelf top shelf all that good [ __ ] pretty cheap even uh you know people that i know get it cheap i find it cheap in most areas you know what i mean um but delta eight is pretty consistent about the price now you'll find people in my videos that post links to delta eight cards that are ten dollars i don't know about those websites i don't really trust anything that's ten dollars when other people are selling it for 35. maybe that's a dumb thing on my part but like i just think okay you get what you pay for you get what you put you know what i mean like be careful what you play in your body that's all i'm saying okay i'm gonna buy these shady ten dollar cards so for the most part delta eight because you can't really buy the bud because there's no really bud um you can it's just cbd with delta like sprayed on it but that's we'll get to that later anyway those a cards can vary really anywhere from like 25 to 50 bucks to you know 35 40. the gummies are about 25 to 35. uh i'm honestly gonna have to give it to delta nine on this because in most places delta nine is cheaper than delta eight now i understand that people pay that price especially in illegal states because it's legal and they can get it and then they know it's going to work so i'm still going to have to give it to delta 9 on this just because i feel like really at the end of the day delta 9 is cheaper another thing the higher [Music] okay so once again i know this is going to be a very controversial topic hold on let's hit the ball boys cheers we're gonna have to pack that again i know this is gonna be another controversial topic just because once again it's really all up to the person but i think uh you know what i mean if you agree with me on some of these points please let me know so that way it adds to you know you know what i'm saying anyway uh the high so in my experience and most people's experience of smoking delta a they do get high but it's not as long lasting now that is also based on you and i imagine your tolerance and how delta a or delta 9 reacts to your body but delta 8 high definitely lasts shorter whereas cell 29 you know what i mean you smoking eight blunt or something and you're [ __ ] hot for a hot minute you eat a couple edibles you're hot for a hot minute you know what i mean uh with delta eight it doesn't last as long in my personal experience at least um and even comparing like delta a edibles and delta nine edibles well first of all just be careful with edibles i'm honestly thinking about making a video of the true dangers of edibles and how [ __ ] crazy they can be let's uh 10 likes 10 likes and i will do that okay so the delta edibles compared to the delta 9 uh felt a little stronger but only in the aspect of they made me lazier whereas the delta nine edibles made uh more of a tripping experience more psychoactive so i enjoyed it more because you know when you smoke delta nine like a part of you knows that's what you're going for so i'm gonna have to give the high to delta nine okay so right now we got delta a1 delta nine two okay and another point that i wanna make that honestly this is a no-brainer um speaking of a lot of these that kind of go hand in hand is uh the legal situation so obviously we're gonna have to give that up to delta eight right away just because it's more legal and others like it's just more legal anywhere than delta nine so the option of getting it in hand and buying it online is so much easier so i think that's really a no-brainer um i don't even know why i really added it i really just wanted them to be like neck and neck because it makes it two and two okay so anxiety delta eight one the high delta nine one price delta nine one and then this one i mean it's i know i know you're like that's a no-brainer but you gotta throw that in there because a lot of people that watch wetube or watch my content especially a lot of them don't live in legal states so like this makes it easier for these people so for the last one the one that is really going to make the difference the one that's going to make them one of these two win okay so it's neck and neck right now and yes the last final item on the list is the product [Music] yes i know that's once again you're probably thinking what they're like look you got to think about the product itself you got to think about delta 8 how long it's been out how it's made right now it's still almost being like it's almost new now at this point being made because they're putting it in carts and they're not really doing much with the edibles to be honest like they have some cool stuff sour candies whatnot but they're not making gourmet food they're not making chocolate they're not making all kinds of stuff that delta nines already been making um hold on before we get more into this cheers boys okay so delta a really you you can't even buy deltae but you can buy cbd bud that has delta eight sprayed on it now i understand that you know what i mean but like delta nine off rick that's the first thing people think of is weed but okay okay well let's talk about the cards right seems like delta it's really like trying to push the cart situation especially with how big it is right now but guess who still wins that delta nine because delta knight has already been make doing this and they're going so many steps further to make sure that people don't buy fake cards so they're adding their own unique thing to it they're their own brand like they even had batteries designed just for that brand so they're already winning by having so much more options whereas delta i feel like is in its infancy stage of just making these products so it could get bigger and it could get better but you can buy delta wax i'm pretty sure yeah so like they have that but guess what delta 9 has so many other forms that gets you high higher higher you know what i'm saying speaking of getting higher let's smoke you both i didn't know i could do that uh so yeah man gonna have to give it to delta nine on that one they do win just the product alone it's better better everything about it so the final score three delta nine two delta a now if you guys have enjoyed this video let me know in the comments below if you have made it this far i appreciate it so much remember to subscribe for all the new videos if you guys enjoyed it i hope you did i hope you guys with me much love guys be safe i will see you guys in the next video okay", "iHZIAA-tsVA": "all righty easy bakers so today we're gonna be making cbd infused hot cheetos if you haven't already follow me on instagram at daverny freeman and let's be gang gang so go ahead and hit that subscribe button now let's move on to the video first you're going to start off with your infused butter i did not clarify this butter so the little gunk that you see on it is from me not clarifying it and i really kind of don't care to clarify it but that's just my business if you guys want to know how to make and fuse butter definitely comment down below and i'll get up on that thing girl so now i have melted down my infused butter i put it in the microwave for like 30 30 seconds and just stir it around and it should admit that melt down very easily so i'm just going to go ahead and use my rubber spatula and stir this around and i'm going to portion out my chips so there really isn't a cut dry type of cookie cutter when it comes to dosage it really just depends on you and how much you would like in your bags of chips i'm using five milliliters um that's my little dropper that i'm using right there to determine what my dosage will be per bag um this bag i made i believe i made like two to three ziploc bags of this and i was able to determine that each bag had about 23 me um milligrams of stuff inside of it and to me the average milligrams are five so i think that's kind of pretty good so whatever you use your cbd for you don't want to overdo it but you can definitely kind of calculate that if you guys really want a detailed video on how you can calculate this then we can go from there but you just want to make sure that all of your chips are nice and covered not soaking wet but covered enough so everything can infuse well then you want to lay them out very like in a single layer i really take my time to lay them out in a single layer because if they're on top of each other you're going to kind of like if that defeats the purpose basically so look you want to put a nice even roll do not overcrowd your pan like we never do easy bakers then you're going to move on to the next step now that i have them in a single layer i'm just going to add a little bit more butter on top of them because i'm a little extra and i like for all my foods to be a little extra when you think you got enough i'd like powder you don't so i'm going to put this in a 350 degree oven for three minute intervals taking them out after the three minutes just to really check on them to make sure that they're not burning because maybe they will burn when i tell you they will burn grow they will burn burn so i'm taking that same rubber spatula that i use to mix up that butter and just kind of mixing them around again just to make sure that everything is evenly coated and nothing is sticking down to burn then i'm going to go ahead and place them back on in that oven for another three minutes until they get to the smell in the infusion that i like [Music] and what you guys are seeing here i'm just trying to make sure that they're not on top of each other so much just trying to make sure they get that even layer as much as i can and i end up placing them in the oven about three to four different times for those three minute intervals [Music] just between you and us girlfriends good judy's honey if you guys get this video up to 4 000 views i can definitely show you how to make cbd infused butter tinkeridge as well as all so let's just get these views up and you guys will know how to make all of these good stuff [Music] so now i'm just going to let them dry for about 10 minutes but now that i'm done with that i can pick it up and you guys still see there is a crunch still to them it is not soggy like some other people they're very crunchy they're very nice and just to add up that flavor i'm just taking a little bit of chips putting that in my food processor grinding them up until kind of like powder because i want that heat just to be like packed out um the people that i invite to my parties and different things like that they like as spicy they like it crunchy hey so that's what i'm doing right now just giving it just a little razzie dazzy and i'm putting this over on top of it so when it dries it all just dries together now this is definitely an optional step but that's just something that i personally like to do and i also just put a little bit of tinkering on it too just to make my people really feel the effects of that cbd so that's just my preference with what i like to do but you are going to just let these come just dry a little then place them in your bags [Music] [Music] [Music] so you guys this was only about two bags i just did two bags and i thought it had 23 but with two bags it was at least 45 milligrams inside of both of those bags hannah so girl we were we had fun period [Music] and i'll also show you guys how i heat seal my bags too i just take my flat iron since i do not use them for my head and i just put it on the bags just like that i do this when i use my nerd ropes and heat seal my nerd robes in my cheetos in the smaller bags i just didn't have any smaller bags so i used ziploc bags this time but as you guys can see it is sealed you don't have to worry about anything becoming stale and that's what i love about these cbd chips and cheetos i can just heat seal them in and i can just get them at any time they last for as long as chips last on the chef baby when i tell you girl thank you for watching the video and i will definitely talk to you on my next one", "dNScXlq2iPA": "hello home girls and home women over the world let me ask you something have you ever listened to Bob Marley while making love am i right hi I'm Laura Wilcox and this is feminine now ladies it is my distinct honor to get to announce to you today that we'd Lube is here ladies I want to make sure you get all the information you need so that's why I am going to sit down with a cannabis expert I just have to find one first so just give me one second hi yeah operator I just need to talk to a cannabis expert please what do you mean you don't have a listing for that sort of thing what do you mean you're calling the cups all right I love you bye-bye all right let me rethink this approach we're talking weed Lube which is a new thing what is this product how does it work this product is basically cannabis dissolved in coconut oil and probably people in New York don't know too much about it because right now it's only legal and available in California and Colorado so we're gonna we're gonna try this we're gonna just spray it on our hands and we'll see what happens this is in the name of scientific research I smell like a bomb so the ingredients are medical cannabis oil liquid coconut oil and love Pro so we'll see what happens not like half an hour though right right that's that's the issue is that you gotta be patient wait and see so absorbing cannabis through your skin how it is how is that different than like doing like a volcano bong right before you know having sex actually the absorption through the skin is not as good as when you smoke it or vape it or in even eat it however the mucosal tissues so not necessarily the outside the vulva where the clitoris and the labia are but the inside the vagina and the Batchelor mucosa you're gonna get more absorption in that area so it's kind of its kind of like your vagina is getting high what is that I didn't even know what could do that well there's lots of ways for them to get high this is just one of them right I did it's got a life of its own down there and it's not telling me anything one of them is dilates blood vessels so you get increased blood flow to the area that's alley oh there's work exactly we have almost as much erectile tissue as a guy does just internal oh so we have inside buggers how do you you know I don't feel like a different a little moisturize but yeah yeah but maybe I was just hungry does smell we don't run into any police dogs on the subway hungry turns out your third-grade teacher was right we are each a unique beautiful flower so it's kind of hard to know how something like we Lube is gonna affect your body specifically now while marijuana is not like a new thing products like for ia's we Lube our new and that they're specifically designed for female pleasure yeah I don't hate that right yeah but don't forget they don't mix well with latex so it'd be like really really careful guys okay yeah so uh if you'll excuse me I've got something I want to try until next time come back next time okay bye hey man I hope you enjoyed that totally awesome weed episode of BAM at if you want to see more subscribe

Melissa kept handing me money to stash think at the end of the night I had about 190 bucks the I didn't get to bed till [ __ ] 6:00 in the goddamn morning so yesterday I was dragging ass and even

a biblical ability to keep it simple and basically there's just [ __ ] alleyway you're not alleyway but a big [ __ ] you know open spot and people want to go to that [ __ ] and that medical building especially when you're busting caps letting people know you're there jerm had to [ __ ] basically use some of his [ __ ] Rambo skills because these guys kept trying to hit up [ __ ] get in the hospital [ __ ] you know my internet [ __ ] up last night at about I think midnight so I just got off line and I think pretty much right after that [ __ ] because it was nighttime when I logged out so it's probably another 20 minutes before daytime came and then the plate you know when daytime comes in Daisy people start running around [ __ ] my [ __ ] balls I haven't wore [ __ ] pants for like a [ __ ] week you know your shorts [ __ ] you know for a week and you put pants on this for rethought and those that's just what it comes in there's a little thinner isn't it oh yeah it's definitely not watered down but I'm diluted you know but now it's plenty potent this is interesting ninety nine ninety two point two all right no Stevie [ __ ] I like that see me [ __ ] I [ __ ] I smoke to get high not to [ __ ] feel good it brings up all Badfinger when I was beat as a child I loved it it makes me harder makes me hop beat my kids no I want to a lot especially cuz it's summertime those little [ __ ] will not stop fighting nothing I guess we're yeah well I like they're fighting so much I'm afraid it's gonna attract the predator because predators only come out to hunt humans on very hot so that when there's a lot of violence going on it's gonna be one of those summers and the Predators gonna come to peddle t'en and start [ __ ] taking [ __ ] schools and [ __ ] on the team we killed the killers this time yeah that's that one for German what for for the killers I don't know I'm the one I guess take it i boy killed one person and Daisy and Ivan find almost a month that was on the beach I found him on the beach and I start fighting him with a stone knife and then Jerome almost got me killed cuz he's like used to use the can and it was a soda can not a can of food if it was a can of food now that's a great fish thank you [ __ ] people up eat up where there was a can of soda I've no good fish bug I killed them barely before a guy barely got it and took their [ __ ] stuff go hobbling off and even the [ __ ] forest that [ __ ] is bit was pathetic but yeah I've got one kill under my dog's eye we're gonna tattoo for every [ __ ] killing Daisy watch two months you'll have to Katz's sounds about right so what's the bike look like is it everything you dreamed el it's not here yet oh that's any town and the ups and just waiting for ups to get here alright catches whenever they gave you what time do they usually show up I'm gonna get that out of your eyes since I'm a nice owner okay but yeah it's out for delivery I know so hey it's obviously better than a stone night I don't know about that there's a stone knife on them that's what they start you out with there's a stone knife a flare a can of soda and a piece of fruit juice and then from there you gotta [ __ ] get everything yep just start searching for [ __ ] I mean at least they leave you with something yeah it makes it nice most people just use like if it's nighttime they'll crack the flare they'll still run to the road because you got that whole Beach line or whatever [ __ ] where you spawn so much he'll just run to the road find a street sign figure out if that's any workers the map so big and if it's not anywhere near where they want to be they like we can commit suicide and then they'll just keep checking signs until they're where they want to be otherwise you can get spawned [ __ ] in an hour and a half away from your team and I don't think people like waiting on me for sure you know doing that my waited on same people coming to me yeah you know but I know must suck waiting you know gotta wait a [ __ ] hour half for jackass to get up in he get killed halfway through you know so it's better just to keep killing small and it was fine yourself yeah we're gonna have to try this that experiment sure my god dick no kitty no gonna have to try that experiment yeah be careful so you don't die but the can so did your hidden no me and him could take all of our gear off I can have a knife he can have a can of soda and then we can fight till our [ __ ] whoever goes into the red first no fight to the death me me monkey but everybody loves those death fights no [ __ ] dying be farther away than [ __ ] you yeah but I think I would have killed them faster if I would have kept the stone I'm not saying you're wrong I don't know what would have happened I thought that was my first combat to the death situation scenario Zhanna bud smoker yes no kitty you like me and hope like that go then okay now go away I'm gonna keep I'm gonna keep [ __ ] you up figure it out I don't want you up here no no you're gonna learn no no oh [ __ ] the rim Michigan [ __ ] yeah it's a hello show footage over the fort as a Ford truck I love giving a road head in it it must be an automatic

yeah that is a woman almost felt like plastic for a second this guy's gonna die and he still here does this take to put a bike together you got any more donors we can hit more stoners compressing boom a like now careful not to hit any of these brake lines yet because without that front tire and my caliper will close tick tornado you have a tick on ya like that twist actually works for ticks yeah I was thinking about the 26 but I'm sorter I'm a smaller person so if you can get the whole Bolton hole what's China and North Korea have a short have those penises they're both socialist and abuse human right so that's obvious what's the model code um no it's m'kay it's MKULTRA no it's none k5 yeah MKULTRA yeah I'm taking a writ possibly fun for the straightening yeah she's a string or just ruler what and get his handlebars I just stand above it hold it was my [ __ ] front tire if my foot I know petals typically they're imprinted on I don't think right this one said right I don't want threads in regular and one threads in the backwards that's a little tip yeah what's the one that's always messes with me of these stuff so I'll just thread it one way I don't feel nothing yeah I like the mk6 frame that was a little out dude I just tighten this thing Dan there all the way to sort of a with my fingers I have to cinch it down but that's the weird three wheels right here some allowed was coasting just went brake levers were I want to why aren't you answering the question what was the was the [ __ ] question [ __ ] now you yes the message boards getting filled up too quick alright it is so yeah it is difficult I was doing penitential yeah answer Eric it is you listening it yeah I want to see him when he rides and he's done I had no judgment though I haven't wrote once bikes yet not gonna be able to write it in here I can't take a PlayStation camera out so check it make sure to another one I'm gonna make sure this is all stable - yeah these bikes they generally they break about here that's why the frames are real cheap people break them there and then break them right here I'm gonna try a backflip on today No why the [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] what the [ __ ] big deal alright I only care about what happens here in a minute but not in my state my town today what the [ __ ] do you expect us to do go invade China we've been doing that for years you know what that does that cost us money so I prefer to save the American dollars and say [ __ ] if they want to [ __ ] do that whatever we don't need to be the world I guess if you want to see them on the bike I'll point my camera towards the route point the camera towards my security system so yeah when he goes out there I pointed up towards the security cameras hey guys can watch him fold this [ __ ] thousand dollars no no he's trying to be community cab that's for [ __ ] it's a trial spike through obstacles it is the rock crawler of bicycles yeah my bike into one too just with my sawzall and my welder [ __ ] you pretty much have one out there 26 inch version of that out there [ __ ] you still not drug that bike out there weighs like twice as much as that one does it yeah dude any but you probably got the lightest bike in the park at the moment yeah see Mike's probably lighter than a couple of kids bikes I think when I lets picked up the Box Mike the only person who has the bike even close to your way is Artie because he popped the Danny MacAskill bike that orange well yeah yeah he spent like four grand four and a half grand on it for the exact [ __ ] bike not the one he rode but he did and it's probably still not that light definitely nicer though our cheap fighters from China that that's fact that's big businesses fault for wasn't [ __ ] to make more money I mean you got money corrupts you know if it's cheaper to make something in China most American [ __ ] business [ __ ] people will vote off to make it in China to make more money that's well we're not the only country that does it trying to make sure countries all kinds of countries you know I don't know what to say that because you know if I was in that position I'd probably do it too but what I can make five million more [ __ ] dollars and just my [ __ ] my profits my annual income not to mention the 20 million for the [ __ ] the factory well what would you going to China boys I'm getting a Ferrari I'm getting a private island I'm getting maize [ __ ] you the logic simple what would you rather do you want to spend five dollars and make ten and you still have what do you want to spend $8 we don't have the option to buy [ __ ] that's made in America it just cost four times as much you off to D&B and buy [ __ ] that's made in America and oh it's just it costs more so if you watching you still can't it a good thing with my bike it's not American her it's not Chinese it's it's why he it was made in the the [ __ ] know they know they're made in Europe ya know most most of the trials bikes you'll find are all made in Europe and that's this way there's no don't you that's why they buy [ __ ] from Walmart you know but the people who do care will go and pay the extra money and get the more quality I don't you know yeah I could have bought a mountain bike to do some of this stuff like I mean in the company is if the company can get away with spending $2 in making ten they're going to it's as simple as that that's why some products start out amazing that's why I'm [ __ ] a mongoose when they went to Walmart and first start doing Walmart bikes back in the mid 90s their hoopty it was a [ __ ] beast that hoopty those tweakers are still riding hoop keyframes they like that's the kind of [ __ ] bike they [ __ ] built yeah though no and now they sold out specific cycles and they're they're starting to make shitty [ __ ] anyways you know you can still get next to something bellow which is owned by Pacific cycles do you know Pacific cycles owns all of it huh next branched off they have their own corner company now that's why I was able to get that [ __ ] why that Genesis that I've got is actually worth a [ __ ] everything I want to inspect that bike now to see if they [ __ ] took any stamps off or tried to go over it it's a next-next company incorporated with their website I have no clue but that's what that bike is it's next company incorporated to Genesis and you know it's a Walmart bike but it's actually a good [ __ ] Walmart bike next that's because Mongoose went to [ __ ] was the last time you saw Bob goose that wasn't either broken dented or damaged because I bought mine offline they don't sell them a Walmart anymore they also still have the badass Mongoose the three grand was amazing you just can't tell no looks next bike company I need to find Paul Anderson they kick his ass well though your dad to the house y'all all right yeah right go ride that thing in the gravel once that's tight man I got a phone aren't there hex keys in the back of the dinghy Titan for muddles yeah as I say what are you doing man scratch your [ __ ] up you know you can still get good expensive mongooses I bought a mid-grade one I bought a pump Berman jump one might be a bigger one a 5.5 maybe some pebbles have them yeah yeah my [ __ ] come on gooses right there 26 a single-speed the teal or turquoise and turquoise or contoured to turn it's not athletes though I think they just

Gill heads [Applause] have any more action down there max first rule are the phone off second rule on it I'm pretty sure this is a 6 6 s plus 6s plus I gotta make points with her cuz I kind of clover Anthony pissed me off Saturday night trying to be the boss well he kind of is like no he's not he's a goddamn instructor for drivers he's not a yeah I think I'm gonna sell the pickup to Jimmy payments he said he'd set up and I [Music] anyway said I'd take 150 out of the count every week and there every month and put it in mine I go okay that's about six payments at 150 I go there's something funny going on other than of course it won't run straight or smooth but I went on started it and started but of course didn't run smooth I go I went up this morning I checked the dipstick it's about four inches above the the full mark I go I could have swore I took some out of there somebody messed with my head put more oil in there or is something not working right I think thinking something's not working right but I got online and you know nobody had any all they said was you put too much oil and well I I don't know I won't sell to if there's something you know really wrong with it I'll start up and I don't know how it can keep adding oil but unless it's not yeah I'm thinking well it's not cycling through the motor and just going up the dipstick I guess one thing I could do is I could drain all of it and see how much is in there I think I just changed I mean didn't change the world on that I guess that's one thing I could do is just change the oil and filter that way it would take away all that that's another 20 bucks they got to spend and iPad batteries are hard to do they can be done but you got to take the whole iPad apart too much money into it I told him I already got over a hundred bucks in repairs I was asking 1,200 but it doesn't run worth the [ __ ] I'd sold to him for a thousand oh and we're having a yard sale out at the barnyard but it's another month away so I have time to get the boat ready for it they said donating to the social fun I told TIFF can go I what once all my boat four thousand bucks I'm not giving it to the company let's have other [ __ ] that's worth money I mean I've my old clothes and stuff I'll donate sell a bundle of clothes for you know two thugs next rule was disconnect the battery it's like when you're working on a car or anything else you know cards trees come in handy I know what happened to mine hey I just kind of getting tired of seeing Amanda trying to impress me drinking vodka psych of course she's got to buy the expensive Russian type I told you a car D tastes the same I mean vodkas vodkas I like whiskey she was I can't compete with him I had dollar hookers he gets what a [ __ ] odd thing to bring up now she's already sent us and booty pictures I'm afraid or claim she sent her medical records to him and the Pope you know I wasn't sure cuz I looked at the picture I was like [ __ ] is that John he looks oh ho yeah he's getting aging he's you see a hell of an athlete well I saw him walking about a month or so ago he was noticeably slowed down I think he added his beer is locked across 10th Street bridge walking [ __ ] John yeah it's just weird cuz everybody this family is attorneys and outgoing and pillars of society just just he's not a bad person it's just he likes the booze you're an apple man all right you made people wait on your hand and foot people's nature God is that 150k a year it's not bad depending on where you live if you live in Manhattan or something than yeah I probably pays for anything hey yeah that's not bad apples got the money to pay their employees is there anything putting the laundry to get to disinfect your clothes they have bleach for colors Walmart it's about three bucks a gallon so it's a little more than regular bleach but you can use it with colored clothing you have an encounter with a big woman or something no no just getting all that stuff they came out of all those clothes I stuck him in the bathtub yeah yeah with the iPad there is a couple different styles there's the ones where the digitizer that's the touch part and the LCD are one part those are a [ __ ] to get out but the iPads that just have the glass on top of digitizer than the LCD underneath them and to separate it's about two separate deals it's a lot easier because you can just buy a piece of replacement glass for like five bucks if you're gonna do the job and you don't have to worry about damaging the LCD when you're working on the ones where they're placed together you can't screw that up you can't otherwise yeah it's gonna cost you 90 bucks for a replacement screen versus 10 bucks for glass and 30 bucks for the LCD for other styles of iPads switch the camera a little bit so I can use this table yeah Darwin let somebody take this hammer that - yeah I saw them load cloning up yes a guy that's gonna reserve get it running to see a blacksmith Darwin's out there with the shovel this my recorder never Co then you on lunch or something Michelle ones working harvest drive an 18-wheeler who are you working for Sheldon he knows all the surrounding farmers for the most part at least their last names sometimes what is this whole unit there set the screen that's this the screen with a Scott device because this is the main computer board right here so that's what does all the thinking or whatever from there you click in your battery so your battery operates from there these are the home button so that's it operates the home button to communicate the other one is for the actual screen free to the image you see and the other one is for the touch and the speaker's connected with one of those so that's just how they all communicate to the main computer so basically everything they're just but they're just plug in parts there that's the secret of working on iPhones it's really easy it's just you just got to remember everything is really tiny and if you're working with crappy tools make sure to ream agna ties them every time that's the worst thing ever is dropping a little screw and trying to find it even in a controlled environment where your floor super clean and there's not stuff everywhere it's just they're hard to find they're tiny and here we go when iPhone sevens and up you want to be very careful removing the home button because the home button is assigned to that phone and cannot be replaced this one can be but you still want to be careful how I just got about now if it was an iPhone 7 I would have took 10 times longer yeah make sure to get any kind of broken glass off of there otherwise when you reinstall it it's not gonna sit flush and the customer will be angry since the home button kind of does everything on an iPhone alright next up the speaker and all that you know I like working on iphone 6 as I could do this all day long what the [ __ ] an atomic wedgie most wedgies heart when I was a little kid I gave you on ripped your underwear surprising the beat me for that and Jimmy City knows this gals got a bunch of fishing tackle tries to sell the price would have to reflect what it is but yeah that when they have that yard so I can try to sell the boat plus I get rid of that pool table and everything on top of about everything so I'll have a month to work on yard sale stuff now all that's left is the plate but I got all these screws memorized kind of a surprise on my people I see with busted strains still using I just try not to break my phones you got looking on the computer that 383 stroker is a small-block I thought it was producing about 450 horsepower respectively it's reasonably priced by ground good it has a great loaner the thing is it might turbo you know fuel-injected my 327 did a couple other things too and if we could get close to four out of horses last personal driver was Chuck he got hurt I show get into the into the garage there slaves or robots or whatever they sometimes they pick those things in there just way too but just poofed up to the popped got a drop it to break it in yeah I don't think so customer can do that now it's just a matter of transferring everything over I'm gonna take off this damn death tape factory yeah careful you hit right there yeah that's a sensitive piece I'm gonna put the plaster back it would probably melt in there if you did it this is just a heat plate and dissipate the heat because that battery gets so hot that it's so and I guess they don't let that transfer to the screen so yeah they put a heat play then it's Besim trick stuff on it something made by DuPont I'm sure all right well I'd seen where the massive little sting operation for people trying to sell rocks some are stolen they got ship like FedEx or something somebody stole the package so there are some simply rocks floating out there but NASA's trying to get all the ones anybody ever tries to Sullivan NASA's write on their eyes I don't have to be in black market and sale yeah very expensive somebody go up there and get something and bring them back and try making money just selling moon rocks mr. angle what's going on fixing a phone somewhat real quick that's good because I normally do I don't want all that [ __ ] on Facebook for goddamn reasons like that from that day on Kevin never touched alcohol the kid he wake up with your face and your buddy shorts think it's a woman I can't do this buddy it's hard to tell I think it is a guy matter large woman it's not good you know what Indy Racing I didn't realize there was a champion out of [Music] England those a black guy Hamilton British whatever they call it like worse times to make time you see a black racecar driver and I is the poster boy for Gran Turismo though with that though once you get lead in a road not a little Road course the street race it's hard to pass by the best way to passes it hits but he had got out front never got past what I watch yeah I almost got beat up a few more times after you love Wow that damn foreigner guy running the ship after we're out of buns all right Tom $2.00 of hot dogs I'm some for two bucks and everything's going all right I guess I saw a man well then all suddeniy change his mind is there alright now it's two four five I'm having telling people two dollars and those people still hang on weren't you just selling those for two dollars I'll give you a dollar for one now trying to rip up like it's not me I'm just the cook kill the messenger wasn't organized gonna have menu up there with prices oh that's what he did there there was there was a little white piece of paper where she couldn't even you couldn't even see it I can't I sold those damn dry steaks for 15 bucks thought people bought them to you though yeah I'd try I need anything I'm gonna stake here for 15 bucks I don't care I'll take it but I mean it comes with the risk you know luckily all those cops were there okay after every thought those [ __ ] to stick around jigs I left there two o'clock in the morning it's not a hangout for 20 minutes so when I get back I can have someone help me up will be here will be here what clay I had my gloves on me cuz that gruel was greasy so when I was trying to manhandle it by myself [ __ ] it was feet of God that I got it in there but then I go to the circle-k [ __ ] Randy's in there [ __ ] knowing everybody in there I could all

profit I want 30 from for gas to get you there kept kind of beating around the bush finally he hands me his debit card so I got 30 bucks and fuel in the truck and still had the 50 I nobody was trying to do it's like [ __ ] you man it cost you more yeah and you wouldn't have got a cab at that hour either and I guess Chuck got hold of the promoter for this bike week and I guess they haven't called midco for our transportation they're gonna have the cab company do well the capsule I got like three big vans it's like you got to be [ __ ] kidding me that was it's not I think they're gonna at the very last minute as long as they don't talk to Gabe about Gabe [ __ ] he can oh they don't have Tony just gotta kind of got air case that guy say and I Melissa said yeah well he was a boss one day

I've got to go do some extreme laundry dragon lady style and go bring two giant bags and then take over half the [ __ ] laundromat laundry Matt doesn't mind they'd like that that's animals my kids are a little more refined and I like it cuz it's only a dollar 75 to wash their dryers we're still the same dryers but they've got two industrial ones where a quarter gets you six minutes so I can take four loads four to five loads and put those in just those two giant ones and I can dry them all they've got the big ones there too it's like three bucks to wash or something like that kind of spin D but you know you only washes sleeping bags or a blanket a couple times a year unless you're a real fast sneaky person are you sleep with dogs what she but it's still just good to clean it can't hurt that's been outside for a week Oh students probably treatment all right well I'll be back I'll run this up Tiffany by yourself yeah it's working I only had one fly on me this morning and that's just because Anderson opened it up and let one end yeah the kids don't like tell him to stay away from him when he's got it on all right they're 15 bucks pretty easy to install yeah bedbugs don't just go away yeah I know I helped him out with this place you mean I know how to [ __ ] eradicate him I've had the problem before in fact I still find a couple [ __ ] every now and then to [ __ ] I'll be in the RV and I'll [ __ ] [ __ ] thought I got rid of you but that's what happens when you live in an apartment complex and your neighbour is a [ __ ] crackhead and starts working with a guy who buys the storage units the people don't want and starts piling that [ __ ] up right in front of my [ __ ] door from 1:00 in the morning till 5:00 in the morning then all of a sudden my couch right next to that door all of a sudden gets him on him then when I call him out on it he [ __ ] acts like he doesn't know what the [ __ ] he's talking about then I [ __ ] tell my manager my manager [ __ ] tells everybody their numbering dogs in to search my crackhead goes and [ __ ] does some [ __ ] to his [ __ ] place when the dogs can't [ __ ] smell a [ __ ] then I get into the $5,000 bill we got rid of the old mattress I took the old bed frame out yeah no seriously the crackheads [ __ ] in ruined my [ __ ] life they cost me five [ __ ] grand now I haven't paid yet either and it didn't even [ __ ] work either cuz the [ __ ] in the five thousand dollar bill is some guys come in with these [ __ ] big heaters and they heat your house up to 140 degrees and supposedly that kills them it didn't but I wasn't going to tell the manager that and get [ __ ] charged another $5,000 you know if it [ __ ] like oh well you brought him back in [ __ ] it wasn't me it was the crackhead because the guy works for this guy named are called we sell stuff and this guy seriously buys the storage units the people won't buy imagine like storage wars when they open up the nasty ones and [ __ ] there's full like garbage these are the ones this guy bids on then he hires crackheads to sort it all out at their houses I was pissed whenever the manager letting no we'll [ __ ] move inch I was like yeah I don't think he's gonna work here check oh what's all right it's just gonna be him and his dad I knew it - I'm a great judge [ __ ] character except for unzip Daisy my god [ __ ] fool me on Daisy and then he took acting classes though but no that's why I want to [ __ ] kill crackheads now because whenever I moved to the RV I didn't have them at all and then [ __ ] all of a sudden start getting them again because they [ __ ] that they know they're smart they've been around a long [ __ ] time but yeah I see about one every week and I kill it but no I they end up getting in the RV pretty bad cuz I had a built-in couch hide a bad thing so I kept trying for how the [ __ ] the cuz you know I kept all my [ __ ] super clean so I couldn't figure out what the [ __ ] was going on well that couch was built into the wall so there was a [ __ ] space back in there wooden nobody could get but they could get so whenever I [ __ ] finally just sounds like alright we got to rip the couch out I can't figure this out rip the couch out oh god man it was [ __ ] horrible so yeah it's [ __ ] shitty you know now they're just hard to get rid of cuz they can just get into so many nooks and [ __ ] crannies dude you know this [ __ ] Oh believe me I checked those lines over on a person's leash I want to kill Noah you ever seen the crackhead know us you never heard of the crackhead Noah hangs out by we sell stuff has a vest like one of those [ __ ] orange vests on who rides a bike looks like [ __ ] I don't think I've seen looks like trying to go seen him but looks like Trevor off grand theft auto almost yeah I talk about how that guy gave my [ __ ] apartment bedbugs because he was working cause he was working for me so stuff any [ __ ] he was that guy buy storage units they're nasty nasty yeah oh yeah I know I working for him and Noah was putting [ __ ] on my doorstep up at Haley place all night for months put a stove for your doorstep yeah cuz he live right next door so you know Haley place is with the [ __ ] upstairs and how the doors are right there you know yeah from 1:00 in the morning till 5:00 cuz there's a crack at he'd be stacking [ __ ] up and [ __ ] doing his crackheads sorting right there on my [ __ ] porch awesome my couch got bedbugs so I told the [ __ ] manager the manager pre-warned everybody that dogs were coming since either cracking he wouldn't brought a bunch of dope clean this [ __ ] place out real good he used some chemicals and [ __ ] you know and I didn't do it to my place because I wanted to let it just here I got him get the [ __ ] rid of him you know yeah and she told him that but they couldn't it came from Noah's place and I'm like they came from Noah's place they all sudden got on my couch that's right next to my daughter right next to where he stacked all that [ __ ] I mean that's obvious you know cuz the doors I have a crack like that under him he knows I mean after that a crack like that it's still be no problem you know so I got stood with a $5,000 [ __ ] bill well they didn't even get rid of it so I didn't even tell her [ __ ] that so I just [ __ ] moved out I was like you know I'm not gonna deal with this [ __ ] most parasitic [ __ ] insects dude they're hard to deal with man breed like crazy yeah I just got a Herc in this place I already gotten bad ooh Hercules yeah [ __ ] like I clean my [ __ ] that's why I only find one a

work I know what you're gonna do on your break every [ __ ] time though you'll be out in the parking lot [ __ ] around on your bike yep that's exactly what I'm doing because you got that hole or pothole or parking lot that has a couple of balance curbs tear that you go around even making a cars out there I [ __ ] around down that way see how far I can make it I have a feeling I'll be able to get what ways I can get quite a ways on my other bike the tires how low they are and how thick those [ __ ] are now it's a trials bike dude oh yeah if I flatten the tire I'll probably have to have special tips for that thing that [ __ ] tires I have to have a specialty for might be a next tire that's not as near as wide I'm Dan next tire looks like a [ __ ] Walmart bike tire [ __ ] convert that those [ __ ] things I seem to have left my house my house is trailer I'll take one of those [ __ ] police menthol yep I figured about by their fire-roasted menthols guys that menthol no more all many

so", "jyAGlb8PMRc": "hello in 1996 my life was forever changed when after a botched back surgery I was left with severe chronic pain this began a cycle that lasted over a decade of fentanyl patch neurontin methadone Norco a myriad of pharmaceuticals that at the height had me over the next decade on 26 different drugs a day what I was left with was overweight depressed unable to work unable to even drive a car but more importantly what I was also left with was chronic pain because we're opioids are an excellent option for people that are in acute suffering they are not the best solution for people having chronic suffering such as mine so I went looking for other solutions about this time I met a woman by the name of K kurta Posse and k was a self-described waken Baker each morning she would wake up and she would pull out her little pink Hello Kitty pipe and she would have a couple of Puffy's so I judged K very harshly I saw her as a drug user but she also told me something very interesting and that was that she was making pot brownies for her boyfriend who had chronic neck pain and that he was able to use or eat one of her brownies before bed at night and not have to use any harmful pharmaceuticals to sleep through the night and that got my interest because up to that point we all had heard the hype around this but all of a sudden I'm like there's got to be some science here so I I started looking for solutions and the first thing I did is I went to a doctor in California who was willing to write me a recommendation to use cannabis and I thought great I'm gonna go and I'm gonna see this doctor and I'm gonna walk out of there with a prescription and know exactly what to do but instead what I got was a sheet of paper with a list of dispensaries and he pointed to one of them and he said this is the Nordstrom of dispensaries so I suggest you go there well I love nor DS so of course that's where I headed so I went over to the dispensary I stood in line I walked up to the counter and I said to the young man behind the counter now that I know is called a budtender and I said okay I have chronic pain what do I use what do I do and out from beneath the counter he pulled a rice krispies treat a bag of caramel corn and a chocolate brownie and I'm looking at this and I'm thinking what how do I use it what do I take and he's like well I have no idea you know I just like this one and it no it kind of makes me and I was like okay great this is not science this is not medicine I need to go and find out more information so I then made my next stop was it heme con well heme con fulfilled every stereotype that I had about cannabis I mean you had your young ladies with the body paint and the strategically placed pot leaves you had the I heart vagina signs along the wall you had the the deafening boom box you know boom boo-boom boo-boom and I'm trying to listen to the vendors and I'm asking them questions and they're giving me answers and and I can't hear anything but what I also heard while I was there was the same girl in the body paint was treating irritable bowel syndrome with cannabis you had the person with the chronic pain seeking answers the social anxiety looking for answers with cannabis so I thought there's got to be something here and I'm since I'm obviously not finding it I'm gonna have to go figure it out myself so I went next and I bought a couple of ounces of something called xxx chem dog and I got it at the granny rate and I went home into my kitchen and I started making this I could not believe that my pain had been so affected by this plant that I had gone from level 8 to a level 2 almost instantaneously when I had taken a puff of it and that no doctor up to this point had ever bothered to mention to me that cannabis was an option how was that even possible so I thought what is it going to take for a doctor to be able to recommend cannabis effectively for treating patients just me so I made this in the kitchen and I can add the oil and I'm looking at it and I'm trying it and I thought okay what is it gonna take so that a doctor feels comfortable actually recommending this for its patient so what are the keys that are gonna be there the first thing is there's gonna have to be lab tests associated with this product if you do not have a lab test associated with the medicine you do not know how many milligrams of each cannabinoid is in there you don't know what you're taking you don't know how to take it and you can't be consistent and frankly a doctor is only going to want to prescribe or recommend something that can be done consistently and accurately the next thing is the doctors going to have to do a very in-depth patient intake process because they're going to have to have all of the same questions that they would ask in treating any disease but then they have to incorporate a set of questions that are specific for cannabis use in itself the next thing is they're going to have to very well understand this plant and the properties of it there are over 500 chemical compounds within the cannabis plant and each one has its own medical potential within it and so how they work and how they work together is very important that a medical professional understands when making this sort of recommendation and the next thing is they're going to have to have a way of giving you specific dosing instructions for each disease that you're treating so that once they do start this feedback loop that they can see what's working and what's not working and refine the data and keep making it better and better I'm a process engineer finding patterns and establishing with data is just the logical way to figure out something and turn it from a plant into a medicine so I went out next and I got a whole bunch of different varieties of cannabis and I was very excited I made all these oils I sent them out for lab results our lab testing and lo and behold I sat down and I'm looking through all these labs and I'm like what am I looking at I have no idea what any of this means I do not understand I don't understand what beta carry a saline is I don't know what Elsa PI I don't know what any of these different components are this so I need to get more education on this because the thing that's fascinating about cannabis is that it is really a pharmacy and a flower because you have all these different compounds within there you know everybody knows about THC and CBD you hear about these in the press there's the misnomer that one gets you high and one is the medicine I would flip that and I would say one isn't of much value and the other one is really good medicine meaning the THC that's a different talk but let's go ahead and stick with this but you also have other cannabinoids in there like CBN and CBN is the one that helps to make you sleepy you have THC v which we believe regulates the insulin uptake in the body so there's all these other you then have all these things called terpenes what terpenes are what you taste and what you smell in a terpene for example in in lavender you have something that's called a little lool that's very calming if you've ever picked up a lemon and held it to your nose and smelled it and had that uplifting feeling that it gives you that's limonene that's also in cannabis so we know that it has all these various components within it and we have to see how they work together I learned about something called the entourage effect now this isn't an actor with a bunch of fans hanging around him this is how all the components of the plant work together in the case of cannabis the whole truly is greater than the sum of its parts because you can buy isolated where they just use one component of it but it is not going to work anywhere as near as well as when you have all of the components together so let's talk about a piece of chocolate cake you could have your flour your butter your sugar your eggs your vanilla your cocoa all of the ingredients that go into a piece of care of chocolate cake but you certainly are not going to have have the experience of eating a piece of chocolate cake and that is a nutshell what the entourage effect is so now we know that we have to have the whole plant so that we have this entourage effect we know that doctors are going to be able to have to dose it correctly but what is in fact a dose because people don't understand that so what a dose is is how much you take and how often you take it if the doctor says I want you to take two in the morning and two at bedtime that's your dose if the doctor says I want you to take one three times a day that's your dose if they say take ten milligrams in the morning and 20 milligrams in the evening that's your dose now what is the therapeutic dose a therapeutic dose is how much is required for you to accomplish what your objective is for example if your objective is to sleep eight hours a night the amount of cannabis that is required to get you asleep keep you asleep and allow you to wake up after eight hours feeling refreshed that is your therapeutic dose if you're suffering chronic pain it's not the amount that knocks you on your butt it's not the amount that gets you high it's the amount that gets your pain under control to a point where you were still a fully functional member of society that is the therapeutic dose it's not just how much you can use so now let's take a look at what is not a dose all right because I hear all the time from people I'll say how much are you taking and they'll say oh I take a one-to-one or I take a one to five or I take a twenty to one well that's great that's a ratio that tells me how much you have one component is in relation to another but it doesn't tell me what they are it doesn't tell me how much concentration of each one is in it just tells me the relationship between two different molecules it's also not the number of drops if I say how much do you take and you say four drops or two drops or five drops if I don't know how many milligrams are in the whole I have no way of knowing how much is in an individual drop and then lastly the most important in the United States in particular where we are not on the metric system however the medical community is a milligram and a milliliter are not interchangeable one is a weight and one is a volume so you need to know how many milligrams of the cannabinoids or whatever the chemical compound is within the volume of whatever the product is whether it's an oil or a cookie or a rice krispies treat alright so let's take a look here at a theoretical therapeutic dose now I want to stay right here before I go any further this is not a particular dose for our therapeutic dose for anything for anybody it's strictly for the purposes of the disc demonstration and I have it up here and I want you to also before I go any further I want to say that no doctor in their right mind would ever recommend somebody start out in a dose this high you always want to start out very very very low and increased slowly until you reach your therapeutic dose but let's take a look at this for a minute we have a recommendation here of a THC dominant medicine that from the doctor they want you to take 25 milligrams a day divided into two separate doses with 1 5 milligrams in the morning when you get up and 20 milligrams about 1 hour before bed they wanted to have several of these different terpenes in it if possible and they want you to take it sublingually which means under the tongue thus the picture of the person sticking their tongue out at you a little bit rolling stones so I'm going to take that and say ok now that you've got this how do we take that information and convert that over to going to a dispensary to buy a product to match it so I'm going to take this as a typical infused oil because it's sibling wool we need to use a tincture or something that can be done under the tongue and let's take a look into a blow-up of the label alright so this on this label I'm going to look along with you it says it's an extra-strength THC product it has 30 milligrams weight of THC within each milliliter the volume so 30 milligrams per milliliter tells you how much is in there we also know that this is going to be about one milligram per drop because we know that a rule of thumb is when you have an infused oil it's approximately 28 to 30 drops per milliliter so in this case because it's 30 milligrams per milliliter it's gonna be about one milligram per drop so in order to achieve the five milligrams in the morning it's going to be five drops and for the twenty milligrams before bedtime you're looking at about three-quarters of a dropper or 0.75 milliliters to achieve that and that will give you precisely what the doctor has recommended for you so I encourage you when you leave here to go to your local dispensaries and look at the myriad of products that are available on the shelves today they come in all forms they come in capsules and waters and all sorts of other things and take a look and go up to the budtender and ask to show you what some of these products are you have the benefit now of a regulated market which means that you now have proper labeling so everything is easier to tell what is in it which really makes eases the way for you to begin your exploration of what cannabis products may work for what ails you and I just one last word of caution remember always start very low and increase slowly thank you you", "TsRh2eqB9Rc": "[Music] medical cannabis is legal in many places in the united states and can be used to treat everything from depression to insomnia and now some dementia patients are self-medicating with cbd products without proper evidence of what the impact may be the researchers are now playing catch-up just beginning to study the possibility and efficacy of a cannabis drug for people with a spectrum of cognitive impairment issues recently researchers at king's college london are trying to use cannabis as a better alternative to antipsychotic medications that are currently used to treat aggression in patients with dementia but often come with dangerous side effects what are the differences between the two better known compounds in cannabis thc and cbd does the difference even matter thc is the main psychoactive component while cbd is primarily a relaxant thc is more potent than cbd producing the same effects with a lower dosage while the legality of thc usage is divided across state lines cbd is largely legal while thc causes temporary side effects such as slower reaction times and memory loss cbd is predominantly free of any of these effects at present researchers are trying to repurpose a cannabis drug named satifx which is an oral spray license in the u.s and the uk the drug which contains both thc and cbd was originally used for treating patients with multiple sclerosis and is now being repurposed to help treat dementia it attempts to target symptoms of agitation and aggression seen in patients with dementia the drug is designed to be a safer alternative and perhaps more effective treatment for dementia currently there's a scarcity of pharmacological treatments and some of them are rather damaging and dangerous especially in the long term so they would prescribe off-label antipsychotics for more severe cases of agitation in terms of side effects satisfaction is a relatively innocuous substance when compared to other antipsychotics it has common side effects such as increased dizziness dry mouth and risk of increased falls particularly in an elderly population even though it still has some side effects it's already a licensed drug that had gone through rigorous and objective clinical trials we already have much better awareness of what the psychological risks are overall speaking the cannabis drug with thc and cbd has therapeutic potential in a behavioral sense it may increase drowsiness which is similar to a calm and relaxed feeling but we still have to wait for the results to know whether cannabis is effective for treating dementia you", "GcLpuOoOS8E": "[Music] it's not uncommon when people come in for them to describe to us that they've been experiencing atypical behavior acting in ways that aren't like themselves and this is not so uncommon with post-traumatic stress disorder [Music] and people with post-traumatic stress symptoms often attempt to take care of their problem on their own people drink they use substances they misuse substances as a way of coping seven to eight percent of the general population each year are affected by post-traumatic stress disorder or ptsd it manifests itself after an individual goes to a shocking stressful or for lack of a better term a traumatic experience leaving an individual in a very disturbed state the disorder can affect people of all ages and is commonly seen in military veterans victims of sexual assault or abuse and even witnesses of terror attacks and natural disasters symptoms of ptsd can begin to overcome an individual three months after the traumatic event and these include flashbacks where you relive the event over and over while even feeling the physical symptoms such as the racing heart and sweating [Music] individuals with ptsd can have difficulty falling asleep difficulty concentrating and can feel socially isolated develop extreme anxiety while also having depression within the brain the hippocampus amygdala and prefrontal cortex are the primary regions that are affected by ptsd while the neurochemicals cortisol and norepinephrine which are responsible for the stress response also tend to show increased activity in ptsd patients imagine the worst possible day of your life now imagine reliving that moment over and over and over and over again and with each passing moment the fear that it may happen again only grows greater for a lot of ptsd patients they only see one solution one effective way to cope with their problem and this leads us to substance abuse in recent years ptsd has been shown to have a link with substance use disorder in which individuals frequently use these substances to cope with their struggles but today we'll be only focusing our attention to one of these drugs cannabis or more commonly known as marijuana so what is cannabis cannabis is a psychoactive drug that can be smoked ate in an edible form and drank in liquid form the psychoactive substance within cannabis is known as thc also known as tetrohydrocannable this is a molecule that is responsible for eliciting the euphoric effects that it is known for cbd is another major component of cannabis however it is not relevant to the studies we will be examining so when canvas is ingested it causes the brain to release dopamine which is the reward chemical for our body and this is the fundamental mechanism by which cannabis affects our brain body and mental state so now we've talked about ptsd and we've talked about cannabis but how do they relate to one another we'll take a look at two studies that examine the effects of cannabis on ptsd does it help or does it hurt the symptoms in a study conducted in 2014 researchers examined 2 276 military veterans who were diagnosed with ptsd their findings were astonishing following an analysis of their symptoms they found that those military veterans that never used cannabis had the lowest level of ptsd symptoms such as depression anxiety and sleeplessness however it is interesting that those who started smoking cannabis following ptsd diagnosis saw a rise in violent behaviors in contrast those who stopped smoking marijuana also saw a decrease in certain ptsd symptoms [Music] in a more recent study conducted in 2020 404 individuals with ptsd were put on a medical marijuana regiment in which they inhaled cannabis these individuals tracked their symptoms on an app for 31 months and had a total of 11 000 responses they tracked symptoms such as intrusive thoughts flashbacks irritability anxiety along with many others after analyzing the results the researchers concluded that there was a 50 percent decrease in all ptsd symptoms immediately after using marijuana like all studies there are some limitations there needs to be more controlled research so we can truly understand the effects this is a new and advancing field and it's necessary to explore all avenues to see how cannabis can improve or deteriorate our mental health now where does this leave us can we say for certain that cannabis cures ptsd definitely not but we can certainly also not rule it out as a potential treatment what we can say though is that for certain individuals cannabis does prove to lessen the severity of their symptoms while for others it may increase them like any medication before taking any course of action it is best to consult your doctor and understand both the possible benefits and the risks this is demystifying medicine presenting ptsd in cannabis help or hurt you", "pKhxhErghM8": "hey guys what's up this is recreational 420 and today we're gonna check out the consistency or the concentrate consistency called clear now this stuff is called clear obviously because of how clear it is and you can just see right through it and so basically this is one of the more like potent like as far as like what I've had personally this is one of the more potent forms of concentrates something to remember is this stuff typically you don't this this is a this isn't a solid like a shatter this is more of a liquid so if you leave it on its side like this like overnight when you wake up it's gonna be all down here and it's real hard to like try to take off off from the edges so that's something to think about and you always want to have it right-side up like this just so you don't lose any and so that it's easy for you to work with it and then as you guys will be able to see so when you want to get your dab it this one's a little bit harder to work through it's a little bit more effort to like break it out super super sticky but once again I mean as long as you're careful and you can kind of do like what I'm doing here you're gonna avoid making a mess and you can just get yourself a nice little like a nice sized dab there and that's about like my normal size dab especially for this stuff because it's so potent this has been one of like my more favorite things to try but yeah this is what you would consider clear this is what and what it looks like as you guys can see it's super like viscous super sticky super like just you know sticky this stuff if you get it on your hands it's gonna definitely stick around and not go anywhere it's gonna be a pain in the butt to try to take off so you really don't want to do that too much you want to be as careful as you can so you don't lose it and that's about it when it comes to this stuff if and this is this is typically a distillate now I'm not I can't exactly 100% by definition give you what a distillate is we'll look that up and I will find it for you guys and I'll make a video about it but this is what you would call a cannabis distillate and you guys are welcome to like google it and figure that out and then like I said I'm gonna make a better video explaining exactly what it is for you guys but I just wanted to give you an idea of what the consistencies like so like when you're in the store and you want to go check it out if you want to pick something up you know more or less what to expect once you get home anyway this has been recreational 420 I hope you guys enjoyed that and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "Q4SzpaHq-u0": "[Music] so I'm in a massive cannabis field right now

startups have sprouted up to capitalize on the cannabis and CBD boom in the u.s. the city has become a trailblazer for cannabis much like Denver after marijuana was first legalized in the u.s. Chinese entrepreneurs are convinced they can turn their country into a cannabis superpower China already has the infrastructure and the know-how since it produces half of the world's industrial hemp that's mainly used for textiles and paper but here's the catch in China cannabis is actually a very sensitive topic junsu PCL ba you fool tryna shop that's because it contains not only CBD but THC the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high I feel very safe in my new outfits anyone caught selling products with THC risk spending the rest of his or her life in prison or worse face the death penalty and by extension CBD consumption in the country is also illegal so when we visited one of the world's largest CBD extraction plans it actually felt like we were touring a prison here there are dozens of surveillance cameras barbed wire and every door is locked with a coat oh wow looks like a Star Wars control room in here but what's illegal for the country turns out to be big business and authorities aren't stifling that instead they've put in place very strict regulations on CBD production will mention condom a girl who should say go onto the King Kong Shah Jahan I want to know do you have tests for your employees like drug tests taken I sure go on tea time away gg-get you're not so this apparently is CBD it's kind of muddy looking it kind of looks like a black bean paste or something this factory runs 24 hours a day seven days a week pumping out 1.5 tons of CBD a year so this is what the world wants pure CBD extract and the most pure CBD can be sold for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars per kilogram we went to Shanghai to meet a Chinese entrepreneur who sees this raw material from Yunnan as a golden opportunity to sell CBD Shanghai you have a dollar debt not sure rockefeller count all Summer Sun leads the Chinese branch of CII acts an American financial firm that analyzes companies in the US for Chinese investors when they looked at the CBD boom they decided to open a company in China one may watch other Hayashi be the to me my own son says to really win big it won't be about just selling to the US eventually he hopes one day he'll be able to sell these products inside the country so Chinese entrepreneurs like son are starting to educate Chinese consumers he's selling CBD free products that are legal in China this influencer is testing one of sons products it contains other extracts from cannabis plants but he's marketing products to Chinese consumers as CBD it doesn't have any CBD is that misleading jungle vine hemorrhage at all tension the PR DVD shriveled up see my logo for some beer [Music] as companies anticipate the CBD market in China to open they are starting to invest big in the cannabis of the future - Oh Madonna Mia don't really match the home the country is quickly catching up to the US and Europe and entrepreneurs believe their country will eventually surpass competitors as a CBD powerhouse in production but most importantly consumption yoga since in the trainee at the Tantra pompe oh ho Chun Chiu geranyl woman shampooed on the tree most Wakana shaman a fan for that room to come here time at sea for sure young leo says China can only succeed because he expects the country will do to the CBD industry when it has already done to dominate other industries like smartphones plastics or clothes what can you make voice in the sugar-free trinomial the I woke up you will I depart from your dumb out that wrong with the changing wait wait huh [Music]", "mUsgphRYaKQ": "what our publication demonstrates is something quite important I think for understanding the biology of the human intestine and its function what it doesn't show is really the the clinical applications this information yet we have a long way to go to make those strongly correlated in terms of what actually can be used and applied for patient populations what we've identified is a mechanism by which the intestine naturally protects itself from inflammation people wondered how that occurs because we're kosta bombarded by not only bacteria but also all kinds of things that we eat and some people suffer from colitis and other conditions related to the inflammation that occurs in their intestine what other people don't so what's the mechanism and how do we control that from happening all the time our publication that's coming out identifies cannabinoids as a critical element to protect the human intestine from that that Auto inflammation that can occur in response to these environmental cues we've understood a lot in terms of how inflammation can be induced and and that's very common but we'd like to know is how people really can be protected from that inflammation and so we've been looking for now the factors that the body naturally makes to protect us that was more difficult challenge it's easy enough to find the things that start the fire so to speak it's hard to find the fire extinguishers that are sitting there quietly waiting to be turned on every once in a while as they're needed so it's taken us a long time to get to this point to find out how to protect ourselves from these inflammations and where the cannabinoids do is they actually provide that that sort of passive kind of suppression system what we're very concerned about is making sure that people appreciate the value of this and the understanding of it that this is not anything more than an explanation of how the inflammation occurs at this one location in the body it's not a we're not condoning the use of application of anything at this point because we have a lot more studies to do to really understand how to apply this best", "_NZRC5BB2nw": "you see you guys cello's nice and stuff was not wet everyone throw something woo I think I need [Music] hey guys welcome back to pop my 420 I just want to take a second before I even start this next video and thank you guys like 1 1 1 1 1 1 I never expected it to hit over 1000 subscribers on YouTube so I just want to thank you and keep watching and if you haven't seen my last video please go watch the last video because actually you're gonna eat that video for this video so why are you down there watching that video make sure you subscribe and you get that notification bill so you know every time that I'll put it into the video up guys I'm gonna do a cannabis gummy bear and I'm gonna use the cannabis coconut oil that I made in the last video to make it so before I also get started guys I want to say this already I am NOT a chef I am NOT a perfect cook I'm just a mom like I said you can always do whatever you want there's no judgement but I'm gonna use a simple recipe because I'm a mom that's always on a go so I just want something quick and easy right now I'm on the west coast so it's gonna be Memorial weekend in a couple days so I just wanted something like I can chill out pop in my mouth gummi bears are always appropriate I have my regular jello you can use any flavor you want this one guys happen to be a six ounce we only gonna use 3 ounces I only had a thick box so normally when you buy this jello get the three ounces until you figure out how many companies you want to make we're also gonna be using a gelatin this is a 1 ounce box it comes in four packets we're gonna be using all of those four packets if you are vegan you cannot use this gelatin there is another substitute for individuals who are vegan so please don't use this if you're vegan shout out to all my vegan Watchers also we're gonna be using that cannabis infused coconut oil that we made in the last video this is a 4 ounce on jar by fall they make all of those mason jars and as you can see I left it out just so it can be liquefied because we're gonna mix that with our water look at that gold green that's nothing but gold green honey anyway so this is a 4 ounce star I have a bunch of them they were referred generated all that did was just took it out a couple hours before this video and let it come to room temperature and as a just sidebar I have some citric acid I'm gonna try to play with this after we make the gummies because I know you can make like your gummy sour so we could probably turn it up a notch if you want to there we go we got that citric acid so and I have a little measuring this is like a little measuring cup where it comes like 2 ounces 4 tablespoons I find it easier when I'm trying to measure out liquid cannabis so and we have a spatula and whisk is going to be important and these are just two measuring one is a half cup one is a four for my cannabis in my water measurement so you can use any shapes of cups long as you have a 1/2 cup a 1/4 cup and a whisk and a spatula that's all you need so let's get started guys so I'm gonna start out with my 1/2 cup and I'm gonna just fill it up with some water and that's what's gonna go into the pipe I dropped a little bit so I'll just add a little bit y'all don't tell nobody alright and what we're gonna do is put this puppy on and I'm gonna put it at like a low medium I find that you don't want it to cook too fast okay guys now that we got the 1/2 cup of water in I'm taking off my mason jar and as you can see my butters been out it's melted but it's starting to come back together so I need 1/4 of this so I have a 1/4 cup you might can't see that but that is and it just makes it easier to scoop sometimes you find it to get messy so I'm just gonna use this too together with that water and ain't gonna hurt nobody to add a little bit more cuz I know y'all like to turn it up up and you can also less let's get these gummies poppin yo we gonna make sure they live that's the young folks eh okay so mater we have I 1 4 plus that I added of the cannabis infused coconut oil we're just gonna let the let it heat up and infuse a little bit together then once we do that and we see it kind of coming together we're going to add those four packs of um gelatin so I kind of like wanting to do its own thing because it should have all been liquefied already but it all started coming back together so i'ma just let it spread out a little bit and now that those two are coming together I'm now gonna add those four packs of gelatin and what I like to do is just open them up two at a time make sure all the good stuff is at the bottom of the envelope and then that way I can pour it in and whisk it so you're not like pouring them individually and then they start clumping up on you I hate that so let's put all of them in there try not to drop the packets pop mine so the whole idea mmm excuse me voice just went out it's to whisk so it dissolves so we want all of that together all of it does just start to come together because you can see if you know yo is not all the way liquefied its clump up with the gelatin packet so I just find it easier when you just start getting three ounces I just happen to have a six ounce box I think I picked it up by accident and you can use any flavor I know some people use kool-aid I've seen videos with kool-aid which is pretty creative I've seen videos with food coloring which is also creative so you can get like so creative with this stuff guys don't take it like so serious that oil coconut oil is so good I'm so in love with it okay guys so like I said I have a six ounce box and uh I don't want to use the whole six ounce because if I did use the whole six ounce I would just have to double all of my measurements so if I had a half cup of what I would have to go to a cup of water so I could have used it but I didn't want to make a zillion coming so I'm gonna measure out three ounces my little cup here is two ounces so I know I just have to add one more element after this wash and I'm gonna add it and whisk it at the same time because I don't want it to start to clump up on me one more ounce in there and guys if you feel like it's like I don't know how to explain it maybe like a little too thick I have seen videos other videos where you add a little bit of water to it and I'm not saying like you know it ain't supposed to be super liquidy of course because it's gelatin I mean you know it's the gummies so it's supposed to have a little thickness to it but sometimes you find it just a little it's not coming together around just don't be afraid to just add a little so I'm putting in this last so that was a total of three ounce of that lime jell-o and as you can see it's turning green and you need to whisk even aside so make sure you get the sides of the pot and you want to whisk until all of that jello is totally dissolved and once it's all dissolved I'm gonna turn my heat up so it can come to a boil which I'm gonna start kind of now turn this up and I'm gonna I'm just turning it up maybe to a medium fire so I can start boiling and then once it starts boiling guys what I want to do is let this simmer for five to eight minutes now it's gonna be your choosing all the time the reason I said five to eight minutes because you want to try to keep some consistency the more you make this stuff I realized as far as cooking and enough use meant and the longer you cook things the THC potent it's burning off so I'm gonna be be cautious of my timer and if you could see on minds and say 11:50 to five minutes from now we'll be 57 so at 57 is gonna be my time to take this off and start to get it into those moles maybe cuz you don't want it to get cold so and I'm gonna for five to seven minutes and also be stirring whisking I'm sorry that's the better word whiskey hey guys as you can see it's boiling up it's getting all good and make sure in between your five to eight minutes that you're whisking and then you stop so what you want to do is just whisk in between let it boil up whisk again we'll be back in a few minutes guys it's gonna be ready all right guys our clock is at fifty seven let's go and turn that off see how nice and bubbly it is the green done came through in the jello I can clearly tell from my whisking that you know it's it's solidified together so it's ready to do what it does when it goes into molds and make jello now guys like I said I got these molds from probably Michaels and I made it with me from the East Coast so you can go anywhere I've seen YouTube videos where people literally put them in ice cube trays and I ain't mad at you if you can find some dollar ice cube trays and put these in do it stop saying like so serious and have a little bit of fun so spatulas always won't come in handy guys cuz you can do this with I just want to make sure that my camera guy sees that that's spatula cuz you're gonna leave some stuff on the side so okay this is the difficult part is pouring it in I don't have no trick if you know a way to get this in I tried syringes it takes too long this stuff moves quick so I'm just gonna use my half cup of my measuring cup thing I had and hope that this works so at least with this I can scoop the handle important just like that you're gonna get stuff on the edges don't worry about that you can always shave this stuff off I'm using this heart mold I probably won't even have to use these other moles because I only did the three ounces if I probably would've did more I would have been able to fill probably all of them up so we wanna that's why you want to make sure you get this in here pretty quick cuz it will solidify when you really quick so what I want to do is just take this and honestly y'all I think I'm gonna just eat this so I'm probably just gonna get my high on now because if I can't eat it yoshua can I think I'm just addicted to the cannabis oil cuz it just tastes so good for real so I'm gonna put these in a freezer you can put them in a refrigerator I just find it if you put them in a freezer it kind of makes it come together a little bit better I'm gonna leave it on this parchment paper that way if anything drip off it can stick right to this and see the good thing about the parchment paper guys look you got some little extra gummies coming on the side look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that look at that that's what I'm talking about I think I might be high already but it's okay I'm at home this we're gonna put in the freezer for about 30 45 minutes we'll come back with the video and check on them and then I think I'm trying to turn up a notch just a little bit to make them like sour why not we'll be doing be right back alright guys so we're back we've given the gummies 30 minutes and let's get ready to take them out I tend not to leave mines in there that's a whole 45 minutes just because I don't want my gummies frozen so guys I got the parchment paper I'm just gonna use that paper and what you're gonna do is just kind of flip them over and you should be able to pop these puppies out let's pray they come out for me come on baby and remember we said we will have the access of stuff around it and again I told you what I was gonna do with that oh I don't really care about the perfect dummy because I'm not perfect so I don't care and I'd say are so good you can do any flavor remember and I love that they all just coming out which is always a great sign that there I was getting ready say cooked but there hold it correctly not cooking so guys and pop these puppies out and then what we gonna do real quick just turn them up a little bit and put them with I'll make them sour so as you can see guys here's on those Tommy's there's me eating them all right I got Lobo I got my measuring cup this is a half cup I'm gonna scoop out sugar yes people do some sugar in a ziploc bag so I'll put 1/2 cup of regular white granulated sugar and then I'm gonna just do like a tablespoon of citric acid no I lied I'm gonna do a tablespoon and a half I want to and that's the citric acid you can get it from right where the kool-aid is in Walmart and then you want to just start it up together like that now of course you guys are a lot smarter than I am I'm sure if you know something else that you can put in this to make them sour share it with me so what I'm gonna do take that out the way and then I'm gonna just pop these in and make somebody sour because I can that's what we want to do and then guys what I would do is put these back in a refrigerator they're kind of like let on kind of coke this is it this was mine do it yourself make gummies out of jello and not knowing what you're doing and I can still be to work in and out work and I got some dummies no don't take your gummies the work can get fired you see you guys the devil's nicest up was not wet number one notice I'm sorry whoa now I do think that lump with the citric acid does make it ten times our but the amusement tastes good then consistency in a dummy like some time you get gummy snake falling they all wet this is not so I did a good job on this I think I'm right now alright guys so that's it so until the next time I see

since we're speedos smells like a [ __ ] on the swim team everybody's had you know like bad experiences in the lab or you're trying it for the first time or like definitely you know hmm like for me we infamously like we we spent you know we spent a good amount of money got a consultation on how to make it clear like you know maybe 2015 [ __ ] okay we just got to Vegas and we had the [ __ ] cougar or run in five days took us to make [ __ ] like 250 grams and discipline it do like we didn't know we was like our first run like we didn't no we're doing two five days to making it we have it on the [ __ ] a hot plate with a magnetic stirrer and shit's [ __ ] shaking I'm like you know my buddy my partner's [ __ ] he walks away for a little bit I'm like zoned out for a second [ __ ] [ __ ] shakes blind rates up vibrates aw spills on the wall all down the [ __ ] inside I'm like I don't know what to do don't like sitting there like what the [ __ ] were like scraping it would look buddies and [ __ ] later you're like trying to [ __ ] put it back in weed likes our project for the week you know completely [ __ ] it up so what is like the worst experience that you had an end lab damn that's a tough one I've had a couple you know I've worked in a few different labs done multiple different forms of extractions so what's up to keep it to keep it distillate related just go here to the couple uh dealing with this cougar roars - you know the load the load flats and everything like that did the load flats or receiving flash you gonna do before out I was going to pour out transferring for another you know another pass to transfer him from the receiving back into the load has had it sitting on our on my ring stand I was holding it I was holding a house like it was been a long day tiredness getting ready to like pretty much just load that back up and like take off for a day with the next shift handle it in the morning you know mm-hmm and so I kind of stopped holding classically bracing it was hitting it with the heat gun and I just kind of zoned out yeah like you were saying and it I can just tilt it over a little bit it was too too fast for me to get it and broke the stem on the load flask and instantly just felt it was just oh yeah it's it's all over the floor and the carpet just I'm trying to get some of it got on me because I tried to catch a rose I don't know I've been doing that in my hand so in the carpet like water why do you think about like how much like money oh yeah definitely bring in something grams at least that's that's not even the worst one the price of gold right just [ __ ] on the carpet you're just like dude we just said he just just recently he just had a mason jar on the on a hotplate and I haven't cracked yeah just a mason jars I've had problems back back now I was doing like back from doing winterization yeah yeah you don't [ __ ] with mason jars don't want no I said let's do because that could close them the thing about is like yeah yeah you know but well my lab partner loves them so much there's just like it's easy to like I out you know miss other is just like a [ __ ] it's a pound yeah over a distillate you know I mean yeah and they're just they're hella cheap you know oh yeah way cheaper than those Griffin flasks yeah for sure and much cheaper than these little [ __ ] yeah each one is crag dude but one of these no one of the mason jars on I can imagine definitely how'd it happen back when I was doing like regular of like BHO extractions you know with this [ __ ] to luckily with this [ __ ] sometimes it's so stable they'll hold it together yeah he did somehow work it out for sure yeah there's ways around though - yeah and this glass isn't the worst thing that can get into your distillate you can rerun that [ __ ] yeah never been there it's just a [ __ ] like oh yeah it's just tilted all over again um getting into the big boys now are you oh I think we're going with one of your turf [ __ ] didn't even go if we got a couple right here these ones are is right here with natural cannabis turfs we got kosher tangent and kosher codes and we got some CBD this how you're feeling can you to balance out little CBD just [ __ ] for your soul we'll check back in before we get these monsters in or keep using hires your [ __ ] I'm staring at them I just like waiting on a king yet and higher bro what do we have to get higher that's the point of the show so I think we should just go and on one of these dad Wars Turkish lives or what early I don't do these do wanna tear you into the same run with my it's gonna be hard to get all of it out oh you know I do the whole thing no no just like used to are these half grand fools they're full grams actually I say we just try to take the biggest glob as we can down just want to go the same flavor we're gonna do different flavor thinking you got the pineapple gummy bears right there it's definitely one of the favorites okay whatever you want to do man yeah both do that one alright let's get it in Oh or just come you to close up on this is fine I think you skip other you know why get this turned up yeah just press this turn it up I think I'm gonna go to 700 because let's split it yeah quartz distal it can go a little hotter anyway you know yeah but with the quartz it seems to not work as well I need to get another barrel coil for that I didn't notice here on the tie over there yeah okay I like the tie I'm gonna go down oh [ __ ] you got me [ __ ] do a million things yeah I had to get a substantial tab in super low tech that sounds like a good number I'll [ __ ] put my go-to last time we did bigger dabs and like hotter temps each side okay so by the last dab the point five dab it was up to like [ __ ] 850 how to handle it torture again oh man but here we are man here we are about to do it all over again you really gotta like learning you know you know yeah I don't really rocked you know either I like to [ __ ] quit bangers all about the I just like the banger just um yeah look what I'm gonna get for a takfir the next I want to get to excel quit bangers and then just get the barrel coils on them yeah I have to do the email because it has to be like consistent with three totally you know person so yeah definitely and then if we word it with the mic like we were to torch a bang horribly ruin these guys may not be happy really [ __ ] you we're out see you [ __ ] later never doing that again I am dude I [ __ ] man I'm not the [ __ ] distillate master did do you that's [ __ ] you yeah I wouldn't say master yeah how big do you go I just want to try to go as big as this never would let me go honking a spirit of divorce I have to go bigger so that's only [ __ ] right dude if you didn't know it's probably thinking am i doing here I don't know Matt what's yours is still looking very similar I guess I gotta go baby I'm just gonna ruin myself let's get it let's try to get after it all right that's looking pretty substantial actually I think that that is definitely looking healthier than mine flavor Wow you feel like yours is getting so much more smoke over there yeah this [ __ ] rig [ __ ] lips shout out the pill man Thank You Phil and Luke Wilson um Luke Wilson man yeah [ __ ] crush it so this segment of the show is what we like to call hot or height so hot being it's super dope hi bean it's like yeah [Music] [Laughter] [Music] so PTFE sheets okay I like them hotter hi I say they're hot ha yeah I mean especially if you've got some good-looking stuff I feel like as far as like parchment it doesn't really turf you stuff your parchments gonna absorb it you're gonna lose a lot of the strips at least in the PTFE if they're people aren't putting it in jars feel like they should be putting super turkey stuffing PTFE for sure if I agree if it's super Turbie shatter yeah I mean PTFE sheets are more expensive than black shorts though are they I mean yeah I guess I had some I was trying to do the distillate on - I'm thinking like the raw would be stable in that it kind of worked but if it was a hot day it were they going to at all or so it's like there's no point yeah there's jargon I think it looks cool look amazing I'm in Vegas knows just about didn't her mother [ __ ] glass honestly I like it I feel like some of their [ __ ] I for sure some of the type definitely but as far as like all their basic [ __ ] like that was like pretty pioneering like you know like they did something cool they put a team of glass artists together and developed like pieces that they're what they want it to be known for you know now a lot of those main artists that were originally like mothership team all do their own things like wave mm-hmm clay was a mother ship artist or does crazy [ __ ] he's kind of known for like the Kleins mm-hmm like mothership has those too you know but that's kind of what he was known for have you ever owned a militia piece no no I have a bunch of buddies who have them but I've never bought one yeah I've had a mothership bucket yeah you know but [ __ ] happens yeah cand we'd uh I don't know I feel like in some ways it can be good but it's as a consumer it's annoying you can't [ __ ] open it unless they have a display one a lot of time displays are never really a good representation of what you're trying to buy it's sitting out for a long time you know but uh my buddy buddies it is [ __ ] I really liked all the weed I got with him like shout out green dog hey he uh he did it he did a really good job on his I really liked his ship but at the same time I have seen other people open their cans and would be like moldy weed in there not gonna name any names but like it happened from like big reputable companies and sellers like this am I supposed to do with this and it's like if you had been able to see it you would have known I'm not buying that but it was in the [ __ ] can yeah so I don't know it's hit or miss sitter Mir so I'm gonna say hype though no water clear - I wanna see I've never messed around with it but I feel like it's a little high you want to a gala post-processing yeah that for product that's gonna probably not it's probably going to turn back into it's gonna oxidize eventually and like yeah it all does yeah especially with something that's like that connoisseur product exactly it's gonna sit on the shelf for a while it's going to oxidize and I think we water it you can definitely categorize like all the rows a all that type of see all the color like clear that's becoming people are like remove that purple [ __ ] like I've seen a bunch of different yeah like the Rose a is definitely the where the rose gold is definitely the most common I've seen yeah check this out rose gold distillate ever that's dope if you're making this I might as well put in a [ __ ] be fun pretty much I mean that's where I'm headed ya know but there's definitely a place for jars of [ __ ] dis lit yeah I like the CBD because no time Sam like here's just dark if your shits dark he might as well throw it yeah you know I'm saying yeah there's a period of time where I was just I when I just got ahold of the [ __ ] we just started making it in our lab and I was I just dabbed it straight for like three days a my throat just like that's all i dad was almost like the roar yeah just raw here this was like it was crazy how he'd Alison owned I see this was like 2015 or time you notice back when I pretty much started doing this [ __ ] we just started doing it I was like there's no you know no terms is just the raw this list yeah and I just dab and that's all it was always like there's always like to Dad's it destroyed II yeah my girlfriend love my girlfriend loved the raw because she never really liked the flavor would be too intense you know she's like that Ron just gives me so [ __ ] stone like it was insane it was insane and then like I dabbed it for like three days fits all I did like a lot you know [ __ ] woke up one day knows my girl was just killing me I was like dude just caked yeah okay comes with any dads you know and yeah any excessive excessive dabbing for sure category Potter had I honestly love them you know I've had good ones I've had bad ones like I love them the first one I ever had was from like the og like to pretty much to do to turn to everybody on to him at least I feel like it's IG ZAF goo head staff to head oh gee Thai stick Koenig are yeah you're he's calling Thai sticks Thai stick that's that's first oh hey good thing we got that foot on there keep it nice and stable they leisure class nice and stable that's what I first heard of them was Thai sticks mm-hmm and the first one I had dude I was I woke up the next day like oh my god I was like a weed hangover type [ __ ] I was like destroyed yeah straight-up like I was it was like a hangover but that's wrong I didn't drink at all like we're about that [ __ ] get after these two [ __ ] dogs yeah that's holy [ __ ] got that everyone dude make anyone a beer now shout out two tracks of tracks in that panic IPA you do me great every time I appreciate you and appreciate my friends over at blue collar guys who recommended the painting all right we got next oh yeah that was kind of rhetorical question but still I think I've had some kind of obnoxious [ __ ] I don't know if you saw that weird not trying to knock on anybody but did you see that weird like flamethrower thing they had dude I didn't it was like a weird metal tree structure in the middle where all the [ __ ] music oh yeah next to the last nauseous and you could go up and pull this chain and it would blow this huge [ __ ] flame that would make the entire area ara\u00f1as by its million-degree love even Coco see ice cube I was like this a moment ago and these guys are pulling the [ __ ] hot thing we're like dude I missed ice cube so I'm making it a million-in-one degrees exactly it's like ice it out cut out let go stop it cut it you cut it you need to cut it you need to cut it out dude seriously just [ __ ] cut it out and see a [ __ ] later right all right on the dad for question floor I've been [ __ ] dreading this your treadin is ready what is this one you got here all right this is some cookies from ocx Joe always let the cookies suck it in pick it up on the table page your book Cheers [Music] [Music] [Music] so as a person as a research as a person sighs the Persian as a person that makes hash what do you look for when you buy hash is it my potency color what's your preferred consistency you look into the potency but not a lot of you won't have their [ __ ] like they're just a little get maybe they're getting their [ __ ] tested but they won't have it posted with their stuff you know so it's like you're not really checking like maybe the budtender Lynch you know this one tested at this present but I mean you don't really know unless you see the results but um I pretty much try to look for I've pretty much decided or figured out like at least to me smell is the best determination obviously you want to look at it too you want look at the color like you don't get anything that's to Dart like I mean I've had good dark [ __ ] like really good dark amber all that was amazing but but generally the darker it is the older the material was you know you know but smell my spell like smell is the best indicator so obviously you're not tasting it before you buy it I mean unless you're lucky but a lot of times you're not tasting it before you buy it so I try to go off smell if it smells good it should [ __ ] taste good right no kinda go kind of go hand hand in hand you know I've had a couple that weren't the case you know I just think there was something wrong with their extracts like there's something maybe the material wasn't the freshest or was sprayed or something like that I was like whoo that is not would have tasted or not what it's not like I just threw that [ __ ] away so it's like sometimes it can be misleading I've tried it pretty much buy from the company tire you trust no and [ __ ] yeah so many I'm using the game is just like [ __ ] with some meaning it's just like there's so many people that they [ __ ] with that I don't know so they can work in vain or something like that though he does a good job he just does really good work so okay I'll try that out I trust you you all right I've been drinking since Bob let's get it it's good I have a hard time getting this vision off the horse whatever we'll figure it out I'll figure it out but take do that back right there [Music] five Cheers Oh Oh what was that that was the cookies that was more cookies yeah otherwise I taste it anymore bigger damn I guess so out of all the heavy rigs they you've owned some dope-ass glassblowers obviously everything so who would you say fell off or maybe like maybe not fill up like who want you [ __ ] with like it's a wall my [ __ ] with yeah that I used to [ __ ] with yeah I only want to get too into it with names I'll say yes this dude right here is [ __ ] you not told you that story earlier about thing like that but he helped he hooked me at like the year before was like another piece collab that he had done with another artist like when I was going through some [ __ ] did partial trade with me on some oil and everything like that so help me out I was able to still get a dope piece I guess I'll say artist my old favorite artist was mr. gray I don't really [ __ ] with him anymore that right there you know you know he didn't fall off he's still incredible artist I just type every time I've done this show that happens he's gotten worse why do I do this I didn't really fall off he's enlike it said you didn't Craig waters he's older if he's like og artist he just feel like he doesn't treat the people who respect his art appreciators are the right way you know it's like a collector like I had like three or four pieces from him collab solo pieces like pendants like a lot of [ __ ] that I was like in love with that was like my face still I still like it when I see it but at the same time it's hard for me to support somebody who doesn't really like have too much respect for his fans he's probably just like looking at you like oh you're just some [ __ ] kid who spins hell of money on ball you know like that's why yeah you're right but then it's like when there's people like this is like we're just you just really really really just a nice [ __ ] guy I think it worked with me even even worked with me on this like gave me a good deal in that piece and like I said yeah the first piece I bought from him like he hooked me up they did a trade like they didn't have to do that [ __ ] at all everybody else is always just like my let's try just want money definitely that's cool I get it that's their job well you [ __ ] made it [ __ ] through I made it you can [ __ ] plug anything you want that's your camera right there brother use a [ __ ] chance Rolla

coming at you with another video man before we get into this one i am a new jersey medical marijuana patient this video is for 21 plus 18 plus and all that good stuff man so you know there is cannabis use in this video so everybody knows you know what i'm saying but yeah uh yo y'all see the title man there's some [ __ ] i want to talk about man i've been seeing a lot of videos going around about this recently bro like actually a lot of videos bro i seen a video from vice about this about this topic i seen a video from a youtuber named distributor michael i seen uh another video for some spanish dude on youtube i forget his name but you know he made a video about this too you know so i'm gonna talk about this man but real quick before we even get into this i'm gonna roll this blunt and get back at you with the top man all right we're back we got the blood rolled but yeah man you know we got some crazy [ __ ] to talk about man you know and really it makes sense bro what i'm about to talk about to me it does it makes sense but then it doesn't make sense at the same time but you know before i give you guys a topic i'm gonna go ahead and [ __ ] light this one up man cheers don't forget to like and subscribe too if you you know if you're a new person you haven't subbed yet you know go ahead and drop us up actually youtube is saying you know apparently like [ __ ] eighty percent of the people who watch my videos unsubscribe so if you could definitely hit that sub button that would definitely help man i said definitely twice right there on accident but we light this [ __ ] up man a little bit of a floppy blunt man remember man this entourage was all [ __ ] up we had all types of stems and it had a hole in it i had to fix this [ __ ] but yeah topic of the video man is the east coast getting hit with sprayed cbd you know or getting hit with him you know meaning all these packs and stuff that's coming through the mail to the east coast is it getting hit with cbd or hempman you know sprayed cbd sprayed everybody basically what i'm saying is a lot of videos is going around you know or a couple videos i've seen a video on vice about this i seen a video from distributor michael is it somebody who posted a video on youtube with like 10k views on it and another video i saw from spanish dude right and basically they was talking about how and these are people on the west coast man and they're telling you how basically there's a lot of good looking hemp out there that's just cbd products you know and it's not even thc and you can get it for like four or five hundred a pound or less 300 a pound man you know and uh they said that the west coast they've been really just taking that cbd product [ __ ] like that put thing like 40 pounds of it spraying all of it with uh with with you know distillate just spraying it with distillate so it's you know so it's really you can't really see it but i don't understand it i mean or not even like just the distillate spray i guess not even spraying it with distillate you know but spraying it with like some spray some distillate spray so you still get high but it's like you're not really getting a natural tree high or some [ __ ] and you can't complain basically you know how all these [ __ ] be having [ __ ] plugs on snapchat and [ __ ] bro from cali and [ __ ] and a lot of people get shipped to them and it's like bro basically them [ __ ] in cali is just cutting corners getting these pounds for 400 spraying it with some distillate and some terpenes which don't cost nothing bro and making like a thousand dollars on a pound charging 1400 2 600 off a pound whatever a straight cbd flower like with with spray with distillate so it still gets you high you can't complain but that's some crazy [ __ ] man imagine right now smoking cbd flour sprayed with distillate i'm saying that'd be crazy i mean i know i'm not because this is some dispensary blood from breakwater but man like imagine i was though like you know i was in that shit's crazy and everybody by the way it makes sense man because like on the streets when it comes to weed there's times where there's these dry spells and [ __ ] like october time around there and around that time bro the indoor harvesting is like you know it's like daddy bro there's not really much indoor going around you know because it's all sold by them you know at least that's what i'm hearing and it makes sense because there'd be droughts out here in jersey or not even in jersey just in any illegal state there'd be droughts in like you know like random times like october or some [ __ ] like that and it makes sense man that it aligns with cali's with their little their little droughts that they be having and then it'd be a drop for a little bit but then after a little bit there's a whole bunch of weed getting shipped out and it looks like garbage bro like think about it man these exotics bro right right most of the time exotics be 60.8 50. bro i was getting good ass weed four years ago three years ago two years ago even forty dollars or less thirty five dollars a [ __ ] eighth thirty hours an eight twenty five any of some good weed i mean twenty five and eighth was kind of low you probably not getting no fire for 25 but 30 35 40. i never went over 40 of some good ass weed that really was like the same [ __ ] that [ __ ] is getting this exotic for 60 man and i feel like the only reason why this exotics for sixty and eighth or seventy and eighth is really lasting is because of this little [ __ ] sprayed hep situation that that's going on you know i mean i feel like it's a real thing it might not be man educate me if somebody's from cali and they know what's going on educate me man this [ __ ] stem is like sitting on fire if y'all see that but it man it makes sense bro don't you know because why else would these 60 [ __ ] apes really be selling like this bro it's because all the [ __ ] is the spray the hemp you know i mean this is just a theory i don't know if it's [ __ ] facts or not but maybe all the [ __ ] that [ __ ] is just selling right now and it's going around it's just spraying him you feel me that could be possible and that's why [ __ ] just feeding for that exotics even though it's going for crazy prices it raised the demand if only because all this [ __ ] is going around that makes sense man and it creates it's crazy because like if you think about it about two three four years ago the weed just to me the weed that was going around like getting sold by everybody every weed dealer just had it was fire you know or majority of [ __ ] had fire you know good weed that you could always buy and now if you look at the areas who had fireweed they be having [ __ ] now bro like straight [ __ ] and it really makes you think who the [ __ ] the plugs is not even the plugs but the big plugs you know like the [ __ ] and cali who be shipping it because bro this is a known fact that 90 of the weed around be coming from cali and it gets shipped to the mail bro that's just facts or either that or it's homegrown that's the two things you know at least in the u.s like if you growing it yourself all right you got that but majority of the weed that [ __ ] are selling just comes through the mail straight up and it's from cali and it'd be you know i really do be do be thinking they'd be selling [ __ ] you know cbd packs and hitting it with the uh distilling bro that makes it makes a lot of sense at first when i heard this i was like nah that's [ __ ] especially a [ __ ] like me who i take pride in weed so it's like bro i i like you tell a [ __ ] like me that and you're like i'm looking at you like you're [ __ ] crazy like [ __ ] i'd be able to tell if my weed was cbd or [ __ ] weed yeah i'm saying but then i saw on youtube on instagram and [ __ ] like bro in california there's some indoor grown [ __ ] cbd hemp weed that would not get you high that bro literally looks like some fire as we from the dyspo like that'll get you smacked so it's like bro that [ __ ] is tricky bro like [ __ ] really could be getting hit with that [ __ ] man i i didn't want to admit it at first but bro [ __ ] could be getting hit with that it's crazy to think about man like if you just look at the quality of some [ __ ] weed and it it really like it looks like decent weed but then like if you look at it bro it's like there's not really much trichome action on that [ __ ] bro like you gotta really pay attention to that and even if it is bro it's not like i don't know bro i just it's crazy because even going into a cbd store in jersey oh that's gonna start fire i'm gonna put that out my hair actually went right on this almost started a fire but he was going into a cbd store in jersey bro i went to a cbd store and smelled some of the buds that they had and this is in jersey smell some of the buzz that they had i'm like damn this should smell like it's really like a pack you know i mean it didn't look like no zaza you know or whatever his eyes are you know it didn't look like no exotics obviously there's nothing like that for no but it looked like some fire but that [ __ ] would just get off the street and it got me thinking like damn bro [ __ ] can really just spray this [ __ ] with distillate and sell it you know it's the same [ __ ] thing i mean you're getting smacked the same way it's just not the natural weed you know that's crazy to think about man that's why man i graduated dabbing majority i mean i bought a quarter weed today from the dyspo today i've smoked three blunts out of it probably nah i wouldn't say that i'd say four blunts out of it probably this is like an entourage you know and that shit's almost gone bro i'd probably say it's like five grams left maybe maybe more maybe less i don't know probably less than that man to be honest with you so and bro and our dispose be a hundred ten dollars a quarter at breakwater hundred dollars a quarter so like you know that's [ __ ] crazy man i know a lot of y'all listening to it like i'm never in my life paying that much what the [ __ ] hey bro you can on the street you can get quarters of gas for 50 bro you really can you can get quarters of gas for 50 60 but it's like at the end of the day man ever since seeing that video it's like you really don't know if you're getting sprayed bro like you really don't i've seen like i literally watched the video of a [ __ ] showing some good ass [ __ ] good looking weed and the [ __ ] was hip doesn't get you high and it's like damn you know and if you just like you just at least around my area bro if you look at the quality of the weed to me besides the zaza and the raja exotics all that [ __ ] besides that the quality of weed in general just normal weed enemies blind has went down bro for unless it's some platinum i'd say because platinum is really growing in like new york new jersey philly around here like that platinum that should be official you know that's not a spray that that should be grown around here but other than sour too sour be official too that [ __ ] growing right in new york but other than that [ __ ] bro like all these other shits that [ __ ] be saying they having sfv and [ __ ] like that bro you never know man this [ __ ] because it's just you know i don't know man it's just too normal looking man you know not even normal looking but too dull looking man you know i don't even know but then again then you got this is a whole another story you got pgr's with weed man you know so then if you're not getting that sprayed hemp [ __ ] if it look like it's you know just too dull and it might be some sprayed hair then you got you could have some [ __ ] [ __ ] that looks like some zaza and it could be some pgr weed man so like wait is tricky man 20 20. weed is tricky it really is and it's the same [ __ ] you know why like why wouldn't these cali plugs cut corners and make this money man you know these [ __ ] in cali shipping this [ __ ] bro because at the end of the day you're never gonna find them in person like the [ __ ] the [ __ ] who buying it off them you're never gonna link in person for real like you know you're just doing business through the ship and [ __ ] and then also it's like bro you're not gonna know for real bro like if you smoke that [ __ ] you get high you're just gonna assume my word i'm hiding it's just you know it's weird it might look like some [ __ ] but it's meat or it might look like some fire and get you high you might think oh where there's some fire whole time [ __ ] hit you with that four hundred dollar five hundred dollar ounce nine ounce i mean pound of hemp you know that's crazy to think about that [ __ ] crazy to think about at least when you gotta make carter [ __ ] you know for a fact that you're not getting hit with that because the dispensary is not getting this [ __ ] [ __ ] girl that [ __ ] right there you know but then again bro it's like i don't even at my point i don't even smoke much bud like to be honest i just dab delta eight now man a lot i got 60 grams coming in today this is switching the topic a little bit but hopefully today later on i have 60 grams of delta 8 here then i got to order some terpenes i want to order some empty cartridges i just don't know where to go to get that so now i can make my own carts and [ __ ] have a couple cards chilling but i plan on and i want to do a video for this i'm going to use 20 grams of delta eight distillate and make eight [ __ ] brownies bro that's two thousand four hundred and fifty milligrams a piece of delta eight you know so bro and i'm gonna eat a whole thing whole thing i might [ __ ] around to eat half of it you know but i plan on eating the whole thing and jeez man but yeah bro i wanted to talk about this sprayed him situation man that was you know me talking about it you know and my bad if i was talking a lot before i even got to really smoke but i just wanted to get that out of here i had all the [ __ ] [ __ ] in my head none of this [ __ ] is written down none of that i had everything i wanted to talk about in my head off rip so i was like we get that [ __ ] out now we can kind of just smoke and talk man you know but yeah that that [ __ ] is crazy man and my bad if i repeated myself a lot too i just wanted to get everything out but yeah man that shit's crazy bro when i heard about that [ __ ] at first i was kind of angry i was like bro no way i'm getting hit with no [ __ ] like and i don't barely buy wheat off the street now you know i don't barely but when i do there's no [ __ ] way that i'm getting hit with no hemp and not knowing it you feel me but it's like you think about it you think back it's like damn it was sometimes when i bought off the street where it just wasn't smacking like i wanted it to and it was cheap of course but it's like if i'm getting it for the low how much is these [ __ ] getting for and where are they getting it from man they could be getting this ship to them or they could be growing it themselves you never know man something to think about i said it's crazy man i don't know how many of y'all buy weed off of street vendors and [ __ ] i really don't but i saw that video i saw that video months ago actually and i just thought of it today because i saw it again and i'm like yeah i'm about to make a video on that [ __ ] people need to know about that man that's something that has to be talked about is the east coast getting hit with him are we you know like that would be insane bro that would be insane and especially how many real smokers is on the east coast [ __ ] you smoke weed every day bro that would just be an l for us man if we didn't if [ __ ] didn't know you feel me but like i'm a real [ __ ] bro i'm gonna go back and think like damn and i've always said it too bro i've really always said like bro it's crazy how the weed i used to get is like smacks harder than the weed that needs to be having now and the prices is just ridiculous now like if you look at it bro i posted some a picture of some weed i was getting it looked like some [ __ ] that [ __ ] would charge 64.84 nowadays i got that [ __ ] for 35. i said the price i bought it for in the video and this is two three years ago man it's like wow prices have changed the times have changed that [ __ ] is crazy [ __ ] blood flavored up and [ __ ] so what happens when you got these [ __ ] stems you got extra paper on there trying to cover the [ __ ] holes and [ __ ] that blunt came my other blunt cave all moldy so i'm not even gonna roll this [ __ ] up or nothing man [ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] paid what two dollars for that [ __ ] too man you know what i'm saying but these edibles up i plan on i don't know what i want to do man i don't know if i want to do a video of me making them i'm gonna definitely do a video on me making them the 20 grams going in and everything i have a whole video of that 20 grams going in man 20 grams on the scale everything but you know i don't know if i want to do a video of me off the edibles like a quick update video type [ __ ] like you know me i'd say like two minutes to me and like let's say 30 minutes in you know and then i pause it come back come back another 30 minutes after that give a little two minutes of me see how i am and then pause it come back another 30 and keep doing that [ __ ] that's the video i want to upload but the only thing that sucks about it bro it's like i feel like it would be bad quality because i don't got no pc or nothing to really edit my [ __ ] bro once i get a pc which i plan on getting i was gonna get the ps5 but i've been trying to get that forever bro i have the money i've had the money to get it literally for like [ __ ] three months an hour since it came out basically and i just broke you can't find it i there's no stores with it it's i can't get it online it's i can't get it so i'm gonna just get a pc man but i don't know if i want to get a i can't build it myself bro and i'm not about to pay i'm not about to [ __ ] get all the parts and pay for somebody to build it for me that's just going to be so much [ __ ] money i think so probably gonna have to buy a pre-built my range is like 800 is the most i'm trying to spend i don't need nothing crazy something i can run for tonight you know damn high as hell i just started talking about the pc but yeah man definitely plan on getting that so i can get better quality videos for you all man you know keep uploading i'm really [ __ ] sick that they uh deleted me at like 700 subs last time man i would have been and that was three four years ago bro i would have been up there right now with the channel bro this is like the fourth channel i had sadly bro youtube don't [ __ ] with me man youtube does not [ __ ] me well they don't [ __ ] with weed bro really because they deleted me because of weed that's why i got deleted we and i had one copyright from uh some music and i was just getting flagged oh just because of my weed i was just getting flagged for the weed every video man they [ __ ] me over bro i don't even know what time it is it's probably like one o'clock in the morning i don't know if i can check that on fire first thing what time is it the time is 12 56 a.m that's it there you go boom 12 56 a.m man one o'clock i was right there pretty [ __ ] fake though like a lot of y'all but yeah man how do y'all feel about this situation i just broke down to y'all do you think we're getting hit with it especially if you're on the east coast do you

really does make sense just at least from around where i'm at the quality has went down in certain areas i used to have fire and fire the qualities really just went down overall unless you're buying this expensive ass weed you know which is ridiculous and that's this is just an illegal states man if you're in a legal state like where you have recreational weed by all means bro y'all are fine but if you're somewhere where it's completely illegal and [ __ ] aren't getting it shipped to him and [ __ ] like that y'all [ __ ] could be getting hit with the hemp you know especially these plugs who'd be shipping wax and [ __ ] like black spell they'd be shipping like crc down [ __ ] packs and [ __ ] or even pine resin i've been saying or seeing already if you go to reddit fake dabs on reddit bro i don't know what the [ __ ] that little hand motion i just did was but if you go on reddit type your fake dabs bro that them [ __ ] be getting shipped their [ __ ] most of them they post like yeah i got this [ __ ] to me or plug got this shipped to them and and it'd be like pine rising and [ __ ] like that i'm like bro if they wanted to send that [ __ ] then i'd [ __ ] 100 believe the uh the hemp situation with the weed man that shit's crazy actually the first time hit breakwater [ __ ] forever man let me know if you guys want to see some of the weed uh maybe next video if i remember i think the next video i'm gonna do is gonna be the brownie video though to be honest so it might have to be the next next video after this video i'm probably gonna go in i don't know i might play some fortnite or i might just watch some tv you go to sleep i'm kind of tired man it's one o'clock in the morning i might take a look dad and go to bed matter of fact i think i'm gonna take a dab right now for y'all the last dab i took i was coughing like a [ __ ] too i don't even have any delta eight left really to smoke i don't think i got a little bit in here i don't know if i can even get it out this is the 98 percent really [ __ ] to be honest with you yeah it's really not nothing left i really shouldn't have took i took like a grammy and [ __ ] and put it in some [ __ ] call uh some hot chocolate and i was [ __ ] smack boys let me go ahead and uh i guess i'll dab i don't know what i'm gonna die like i said i'll dab some nothing nine i haven't done that in a while unless there's something left in this in this rolled over labs i don't think so but we can try oh there is there's a little dab left why is this just so runny like that bro that shit's annoying uh there was a little dab left it's kind of hard to scoop it out though man we're gonna get this dab out of there bro come on [ __ ] it's right there i'm literally [ __ ] touching it it's just so hard to get out bro [ __ ] that i'm about to die from d9 man oh that looks like a fat ass blob right there damn i just can't [ __ ] get it it's too runny man tried to get the d8 out man tried there's a whole bunch of d9 or d8 let me see if i can get this off i can't really get that all right i'm back i actually got some of that delta eight barry white a little tiny bit left that was in here now my hands [ __ ] sticky as hell but got that someone dab that real quick put some of that in there this is actually another the third banger i think i bought now in the past couple months i got a this carb cap always gets stuck in there so i gotta like heat it up real quick that's probably not even going to do anything but boom that [ __ ] always gets stuck in there man leave a pretty nice dab in there [ __ ] take this dab hi [ __ ] y'all all right i already know how this is gonna go so i'm gonna [ __ ] around and turn the fan on right now man cause i already know i'm gonna be called for like a [ __ ] actually only my third dab of the day too cheers so i'm gonna clean this [ __ ] bro this [ __ ] is like clogged at the bottom all right that should taste good as hell that barry white from [ __ ] highest elevation south florida i slept on this this [ __ ] right here bro i haven't been smoking like i smoked it all but i didn't smoke it too much man like it wasn't my favorite but wow this [ __ ] tastes good the high is nice really tastes fire", "al6-nQkbQXk": "it may be the color of honey but the high you'll get from this cannabis concentrate will be anything but sweet if you over consume shatter can contain 80 to 90% THC but what is it and how is it made find out on this episode of Wheaties II by the growth up you might have heard of shatter a potent cannabis concentrate made from butane hash oil it's one of the many forms of butane hash oil or BHO in league with wax and cannabis oil used in vapes shatter is the solidified hardest form of BHO earning its nickname because it's transparent and can shatter like glass it's highly potent containing 80 to 90 percent THC according to Health Canada and its effects come on quickly and can last for several hours for that reason it takes far less shatter to get you high when compared to cannabis flour which generally contains up to 30% THC but how is shatter made and how do you consume it firstly shadow is made from the trichomes of the cannabis flower click the letter i' in the top right corner of your screen to watch our video on trichomes and learn just how critical they are to your high to make shatter the trichomes of cannabis buds are separated from the flower using butane and extremely flammable and dangerous gas once separated the trichomes are collected and heated to remove the butane the new substance is mixed to a creamier texture and then solidifies into shatter making shatter is very dangerous and it's not recommended to do it at home people have died or been seriously injured trying to create shatter and this is definitely not something you should do I this is because making shatter or any other BHO involves using butane gas in the process in the extraction process butane gas becomes a liquid and then evaporates when heat is used to remove it from the concentrate since butane is heavier than oxygen after it evaporates it can fall to the floor creating a very hazardous situation especially over a hot stove top this is not the only risk when it comes to BHO though any form of BHO weather shatter or otherwise is highly dangerous to consume orally there's the real risk of poisoning here so shatter and other be a chose shouldn't made into edibles that's because there's a possibility that not all the butane was removed when creating the BHO with all that said shatter can be a pleasantly potent concentrate if used correctly and with care shadow is consumed by heating it and then inhaling the smoke you can consume the shatter by adding a small piece of it to a pipe bomb hash pipe vaporizer or dabbing rig be cautious with dabbing rigs however because they can reach temperatures as high as 400 degrees Celsius and should be handled with care and keep in mind that while shatter can be baked it might be trickier to do so and you might prefer vaping another type of BHO very potent and not for the faint of heart shatter is one of many concentrates available from the cannabis plant and likely better suited to more experienced users thanks for watching we DZ by the growth up subscribe to our channel for more cannabis content and hit the notification Val so you never miss an

for today guys hopping straight into it so I got this new thing man this right here folks might be the most discreet way of some getting high in 2020 I'm telling you right now I'm calling it right now guys this is the most discreet way of getting high in 2020 so hop in straight into the product review man we got some infused cannabis infused inhaler yep you guys [ __ ] her too right this this right here this right here has to be the future of [ __ ] getting high dude and being discreet because if you guys don't know man it's an inhaler it's an inhaler literally it doesn't have no combustion there's no smoke and no odor it's just straight-up dis linen hailer and it's pretty much like an edible think of it like that guys each time you puff you're gonna have five milligrams and I think it says Oh 250 puffs so they say they claim that this thing gets you pretty freakin high and it within just an inhale let's see if we could do it man so I would just busted out right here to normal you know in the parking lot whatever the case is in my car but we're we're private already but the whole point of this is to be discreet out in public right so why don't we go out and just test some [ __ ] out guys so we'll see you guys in a little bit so I actually [ __ ] forgot to unbox this you know I'm already high so let's go ahead and do it so rip off the top the top right here comes into this little an ice pack you mean twist it let me show you guys how it looks open so boom this is the inhaler right here guys see if I could get out the Sun right here has a little puff fish right here infused a little gold tank right here and pretty much what you have to do is you have to turn it upside down whenever you're gonna use it and then you're gonna shake it you're gonna shake it for like three seconds and that's pretty much gonna move everything around so whenever you do press it to inhale everything's already there all right so I'm not gonna do this right now open till we get into our next location so while we're waiting for this peak say that take so damn long we bust this thing out right so you just flip it upside down like I said shake it thirty seconds get it home and I'm pretty sure from here all you have to do is just need help so Cheers you know this thing tastes like dis Allegro it tastes pretty good at tasting lemony no smoke he'll never smoke at all mm-hmm all right we're gonna hit it one more time tastes pretty good it tastes like lemon so cheers guys infused inhaler it feels like you're taking like a quick little hit for you depend on receivers I feel it dude that's weird it's pretty literally like an inhaler like if you ever had it in a trailer before you know when you hit it you get that little smoke that comes into your frigging lines in books but this one has been caught it's pretty good this thing is so discreet it's like honestly no one around me because assuming anything I'm hitting this [ __ ] I'm being highest like I could already feel it it's actually pretty good honestly so shots and fees for making this location number one so alright guys so as you guys see right there man that [ __ ] is [ __ ] discrete right but if you guys ain't hearing me earlier in the video man there is only 5 milligrams per puff so for the for the people with the heavy hitters out there man this [ __ ] is not gonna get you super stoned I do not want you guys buying this and going I was expecting to get super super baked you know it is for the lightweights even but honestly even for me when I took those two inhales it did do a straight up head change in a body cheat I felt more relaxed so I would say this is like it kind of like a micro dose because I think that's what they label it as micro dosing and honestly if you guys don't know micro dosing is pretty much the perfect dose in order for you to feel a certain change right so shout to infuse for making that you know you don't want to over consume because then your tolerance builds up all that stuff and you don't want that to happen man so shout out to them for being discreet and you know making sure that well we're consistent with our hits and like I said if you guys are a heavy hitter I do recommend hitting a cartridge beforehand if you guys are gonna be out on the go cuz if you guys obviously are using that it to be discreet you you and still wanna get super beta i do recommend first hitting the cartridge and then hitting that later whenever your destination so we got right here man a tree bass clear and we're gonna be taking a fella right before we go into our next destination guys so choose if you guys have never also tried tree-based men and one of the few companies that have been out there for a while and this thing is good dude look how clear it is fire this thing is one of my favorite cartridges of all time and it gets you pretty nice and big so in pairing this with the infuse definitely a game changer so like I said we're at the next location so let's go ahead and go inside and get more baked more discreetly guys so like that so the next location guys sure there's people looking at me so all right so next location guys let's say you're shopping for a [ __ ] pillow right to let your head after you're doing get your pay to just [ __ ] so you just want to get high bro you just want to get how you feel I like damn I just I'm playing a pillow I'm not high so what you can do is just bust this [ __ ] out okay honestly just be like discreetly magic dude I'm telling you this thing hits like Lily no 1p we're passing by you don't even notice anything man this thing discrete discrete - one more time and people were looking at me dan you miss a she's so infused go copy your head sell some if you're trying to be discreet",

Association grab media headlines before the meeting even started sources like WebMD would have you believing that smoking pot drastically increases your risk of stroke let's see what sources like healthcare triage think about that too the research the study we're talking about today published in the journal stroke reports that marijuana users between 18 and 44 years of age have significantly higher odds of having a stroke than non users using data from a national survey collected by the CDC the authors concluded that recent marijuana users were 82 percent more likely to have a stroke while the risk of more frequent users defined as those smoking 10 or more days per month went up to almost a hundred fifty percent come on a lot of people smoke pot if those between the ages of 18 and 44 were really a grave danger of stroke don't you think we'd be seeing a lot more strokes in this age group feels like I've mentioned relative versus absolute risk you know once or twice but here I go again 80 to 150 percent are the relative risks and since absolute risk is way more applicable in real life that's what we should talk about relatively risky over on Twitter took the time to figure this out for a lot of studies sensationalizing the news including this one and according to his calculations the absolute risk increase of stroke for frequent pot smokers is point five percent zero point five percent we've covered what we know about marijuana use before we did not specifically mention stroke risk in those videos mostly because there's not much evidence to justify it there just aren't a lot of non case control studies focusing on stroke and marijuana use the few that do exist suffer from the same problems mentioned here along with the fact that it can be pretty hard to get honest self reporting of marijuana consumption which is what all these surveys rely on and finally the studies that do exist contradict each other some studies like this one report an association between marijuana use and stroke another study analyzing only male data reported no association between those two factors the current study reported higher use for frequent marijuana users that also reported cigarettes and as the author's point out in their discussion other studies do not report an association between marijuana and stroke once cigarette and alcohol use have been adjusted for so all we can do for now is remind you of what we've said before the level of harm currently associated with marijuana is much less scary than that of other things like cigarettes or alcohol it's likely real meaning greater than zero so take that into account but don't panic we can always use more data especially with changing marijuana laws and more and more people use it and we'd probably need it to be better data especially for it to be newsworthy hey did you like this episode you might enjoy this other episode where we go through all of the harms of marijuana italy's what we know right now

www.allaboutdoors.com of oil", "pAOZ1Z_KFrw": "so we have a regime in Canada where there's actually laws that allow for recreational use as well as for medicinal use and the medicinal side patients have to register and the cannabis use has to be authorized by a physician rise on the recreational side basically anybody can go and buy cannabis at an approved licensed location so you have two regimes which I believe creates some issues when it comes to use on the medical for medical purposes because patients basically have open access to cannabis what we're seeing is that there's this expectation and the patient side that cannabis is going to be this wonderful treatment for their pain and on the science side there isn't the evidence to truly support that and so I feel very strongly that there's a there's a need for well conducted trials to truly evaluate the benefit of cannabis in this setting but it's almost like the horses are out of the barn patients want it and we have to find ways to better educate patients engage them as well as do the research to actually show whether it's going to be helpful or not as health care professionals we are because the scientific evidence isn't there there isn't the knowledge to use cannabis for medical purposes pain management for example in this setting and so we have a large information gap from the perspective of cannabis and its use in the setting which product to use how much THC how much CBD the dose which way and it should be administered so there's a lot of questions that as healthcare professionals we have and yet again I go back to my comment earlier that patients still want to use it so we have to find a way to embedder engage patients so the consultation service at our Center was really the result of clinicians telling us they were having patients ask them about the use of cannabis for medical purposes in the oncology setting and not knowing what to tell them we had developed some expertise within the pharmacy department I basically went to them and said we can do this we refer patients to us we screen patients we try to better understand what the patient expectations are in terms of the use of medical cannabis or cannabis for medical purposes we assess them in terms of their symptoms and then we feel if there's a need for cannabis or that cannabis may be an option once traditional ways of managing that say pain have been exhausted then we lead the patient and the clinician through the process of registering with with the government approved grower choosing the products and then dosing the product helping the patient go through the dosing of the medication to see if it's going to benefit them we also follow the patient to assess whether it's working or whether it's having any side effects so in a nutshell that's the program we're trying to ensure the safe use of cannabis for medical purposes in our patients can stay with the medical the cannabis side I think there are I actually believe there is a role for cannabis in the management about adverse effects of chemotherapy and/or the symptoms that cancer can cause itself there's a tremendous amount of research that needs to be done and that's the exciting part in terms of understanding the underlying mechanisms in terms of side effects and how cannabis can be used to address or to target these underlying mechanisms so we have a research program that we have started looking at very specific adverse effects of chemotherapy that may be immune related and how cannabis can actually modulate the immune system to reduce the side effects for example taxane acute pain syndrome is a is an area that we're very interested in we think that potentially fatigue could be managed by cannabis certainly anxiety seems to be a really important issue with with our patients and we've had some success in managing anxiety with with cannabis in that setting through our consultation service sleep disorders also seem to be at least from our experience and the consultation service seem to be amenable to the use of cannabis as well so I think there's a potential for a broad range of uses once we have the research to prove it", "6EijIa_g7c0": "how's everybody doing this is John with CNC connoisseurs and we got a good one for you today all right today we're gonna be having a good look at some canna clouds vape

butter right now I have a piece of cheesecloth here that's folded in half so you make sure that it's double layered and I also have a little strip that I've cut off already and here is half a gram of decarboxylated cannabis so I have my cannabis in the middle of my cheesecloth and I'm just gonna fold it up like a little present so make sure that it overlap and this little packet so I'm just gonna take my little packet and tie it up with my piece of cheesecloth I'm just gonna stick it in to my jar and I'm gonna fill it up with oil give it a little shake make sure it seals and here I have a pot of water it's not quite boiling yet we want it to be at 200 to 225 degrees so I'm just gonna carefully placed it in clear you also don't want your jar to be touching the bottom of your pan or your pot if you have another lid from another jar you can place it underneath there you can place a dish towel underneath there I actually have this really great metal basket that came with my pots and I have the water about halfway just one enough cover the level of oil in your car so we let this go for two hours I pulled it out and let it cool down and now it is time to unseal this we're just going to fish out our little packet squeeze out all the oil we can see this is about as much as we can get out of this guy and there you have it you're finished oil so you can use this oil by itself like you would any olive oil you can use it to cook with in your pan you can use it to make salad dressings or you can use it to bake with which is the first my favorite thing to do if you liked this video be

accent my name's Samantha Miller I'm the president chief scientists of pure analytics and chief science officer of Humboldt brand products really excited to share with you today everything that I can about major and minor cannabinoids and how they work in your body along with some great things about current research on PTSD cancer neuropathy and more so let's get started you know cannabinoids are substances that are produced both in plants and in the human body and they're responsible for some but not all of the effects that you experience from cannabis and in fact some of the other effects may be due to things like terpenoids and flavonoids phyto cannabinoids are one type of cannabinoid so you'll hear the terms phyto cannabinoid and endocannabinoid phyto cannabinoids are the ones that are produced by plants the cannabis plant is the only plant that's known to produce really significant amounts of this viscous resin and when you look at close-up shot of the surface of a cannabis plant you can actually physically see the phyto cannabinoids accumulating in the resin glands so the resin glands are those little structures on the plant have a little stalk with a ball on the end and that's where the phyto cannabinoids actually accumulate so the THC and CBD are right there in those resin glands endocannabinoids are a very similar class of substances but what's really interesting about them is that they're made naturally in the human body you know back in the 80s when I was a little kid we used to see these commercials this is your brain and this is your brain on drugs and you'd see the two eggs in a frying pan it was really interesting to me to learn was that we actually didn't even know that there were things called endocannabinoids or something called an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that's a natural architecture for interacting with cannabinoids and that's actually the reason that humans have such strong interactions with cannabinoids is because we have this natural architecture in our bodies to interact with them the endocannabinoid system is a network of receptors in our body receptors we can think of receptors as little docking sites right in your brain and all over your body these little docking sites that cannabinoids connect with and cause all of the different things that you experience from them let's talk a little bit about THC and CBD and CBN those three together are often referred to as the major cannabinoids the reason is is because they're often the most prevalent although current analysis is showing that cbc maybe should be called a major cannabinoid these days as well because it's present in almost every sample and at a decent level sometimes higher than CBD the relative amounts of THC and CBD are of a lot of interest to people right now you hear people talk about ratios one to one and two to one and 15 to one and twenty to one and it matters it matters how much THC relative to CBD there is because those are specific for specific ailments so a 20 to one CBD to THC cannabis flower or tincture for example may be good for addressing one thing like seizure control where a one to one or a two to one CBD to THC substance or tincture might be the best thing safe for pain relief so the ratio is specific to the application so that's why we care about ratio and that's why we talk about it a question I get asked a lot is is there anything you can do during the growing stages of the plant to change it from a THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no you know I've been asked is there a nutrient can I water starve it can I change the light can I do anything to it to change that THC plant to a CBD plant and unfortunately the answer is no whether a plant is THC dominant or CBD dominant is actually determined by genetics so if it's a 15 percent THC planner is a 15 percent CBD plant the fact that that's the dominant cannabinoid isn't something that you can change but what you can change is the total accumulation of the plant so that can be affected by growing conditions you know if a plant doesn't have the right growing conditions nutrients soil and water it won't produce as much cannabinoid and the final potency percentage won't be as high so that is something that you can affect now there's three main types of cannabinoid ratio that you can consider there's cannabis that's very high THC there's cannabis it's very high CBD and right in the middle there is cannabis where you have equal amounts of THC and CBD and again which bucket cannabis ends up in high CBD high THC or equal amounts of the two is determined by genetics of the plant THC is probably the cannabinoid that we're all the most familiar with it's the one that's been talked about the most it's the one that for a long time people attributed most of the effects of cannabis to this one molecule to THC we know more than that now which we'll talk about throughout this presentation today but the reason that people talk a lot about THC is it has some pretty big effects you know THC is the main psychoactive or intoxicating component in cannabis you know when we talk about that it's to indicate that there's a shift right and the way you feel in your emotional state when you consume THC now THC is referred to in a few different ways out there you'll see THC you'll see Delta 9 THC Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol so those are all the same thing THC is generally the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis but that's been changing as more people have focused on developing more CBD strains and we'll talk about CBD a lot as well today one of the fascinating things about THC is that it actually exists in different forms in the plant so you actually have THC acid as its dominant form in the growing plant and THC is the form that you find after it's been heated so when you put something in your pipe and smoke it you're actually doing some chemistry converting THC teach the acid to THC now there's a lot of confusion amongst patients about THC acid and THC you know a lot more is known about THC THC acid is just coming into our purview as something that we're interested in and we want to know about the researchers who are the original people who pioneered cannabinoid research when you ask them at the conferences you say ruff Raphael Michelin like why aren't you studying THC acid he was like oh there's nothing to it there's nothing there it doesn't have strong effects in the body near Raphael's around it's because of people who went out there is evangelists and as early adopters and tried this and have built bodies of anecdotal evidence to say there's something interesting going on here with these acidic cannabinoids so THC acid is the form it's in like I said before it's been heated that means in the growing plant or in dried material let's say on the shelf in a jar and dispensary that's the form that most of it is in the conversion of THC acid to THC is called decarboxylation that's a big word I like the word activation more and I think it's a little bit more intuitive so you'll hear me use the term activation and decarboxylation interchangeably at room temperature decarboxylation can actually also occur over time so as your cannabis sits in that jar you can actually have some of that conversion as well so it's not entirely stable smoking or vaporizing activates or D carboxylates THC acid and turns it into THC making it available for those experiences that you're most accustomed to for reliable decarboxylation of THC acid to THC you know a lot of people are interested in that because they're making their own medicine at home if you want to do that my best advice is to heat your raw cannabis you know don't put it into butter first but just the raw cannabis itself on a baking sheet in the oven so if you pre-heat your oven to 212 degrees Fahrenheit and you bake it and keep it in a thin layer to make sure that the heat can actually penetrate all the material he did for 90 minutes and you'll have great THC acid to THC conversion so so why do we care so I've talked about this thing exists we have it how do you convert one to the other so but why do you care about it well the reason you care about THC acid and THC and the difference between them is because the effects are totally different and in many cases the therapeutic application is totally different depending on the patient and their needs and what's right for you it really depends on your desired effects and the relief that you need THC acid has been exciting to people lately because there's a lot of new people coming to cannabis and they want to try it for the first time they've got one hesitation though that's the intoxication component to it maybe they're not comfortable letting go not having control in that moment so THC acid preparations tinctures especially you can find THC acid in are a great way for people to try cannabis for the first time without a whole lot of danger of fear of intoxication there's a lot of interesting findings from these bodies of patient anecdotal evidence that we've been putting together to show that THC acid has some pretty substantial anti-inflammatory properties and may have some anti [ __ ] properties as well more work needs to be done on that but there's some clear indications that there's more to learn there you know when I talk about THC acid patients are really you know interested and concerned how can I get access to that like what kind of products can I find THC acid in well the the most direct way is through juicing so you can actually juice raw cannabis both the leaves and the flowers if you're juicing flowers you do need to add a little bit of water into your blender as well or school turn out quite right wheatgrass juice blenders juicers are actually the best ones to use because of the way that they process the material some juicers can actually activate the THC acid and converts it to THC during the process of juicing because of the amount of heat that's used so you want to use a juicer that doesn't have a lot of heat if you're concerned about preserving your cannabinoid acids glycerin tinctures that are made without any heat or alcohol tinctures made without any heat are another place that you can find acidic cannabinoids water extracted hash will often have a small amount of activation but you can keep the majority of it in the acid form as well and you can capsulize that so you can take it as an oral ingestible as a capsule so those are some strategies in ways that you can access acidic cannabinoids and try them if you're interested one of the other things that's been interesting as i've have worked with several patients concerning the use of THC acid and THC is there's a distinct time-phased effect that's different for THC acid what we've learned is that if you're interested in pursuing THC acid therapy you have to try it for a while to make sure you're actually experiencing the benefit for many patients is actually up to three to four weeks after daily use that they truly start to experience the benefit I have a lot of patients who approached me and they say Samantha you know I'm trying to choose is it THC acid therapy or is it th which one is it that I want you know aren't we funny as humans that way right we want to be an a/b thing but really the answer is it's probably both you know I myself I have fibromyalgia so I deal with chronic pain and there's days where I have really acute days they're really bad days acidic cannabinoid therapy on a daily basis is something that can lower the overall symptom level of someone who has a condition like mine chronic pain condition but on those acute days I probably need some THC and so they can really complement one another so the acidic cannabinoid therapy to bring down that total level of symptoms that you're feeling and the activated cannabinoids to really help you deal with that in the moment situation because THC as you know you feel very immediately and can give you that immediate relief if you need it to help promote your quality of life and keep you functional for that day when you are pursuing THC acid therapy especially if you're doing it to avoid intoxication you really do need to make sure you understand that there is going to be a small amount in that activated form THC present so you may still feel a little bit of psycho activity but it certainly should be a lot less than if the whole thing was activated again most of our evidence around THC acid therapy has to do with patient anecdotal evidence that's been gathered by various clinicians even dispensaries who are doing their own research there's a certain dispensaries have gone on a mission to gather data and figure out what's really happening with some of these unique substances some of the things that we've observed are reduction in inflammation and muscle convulsions in spasticity but the one that fascinates me the most is changes in cognitive development in children who are taking acidic cannabinoid therapies we see some really amazing shifts in their behavior both from THC acid and CBD acid we see changes and emotional intelligence in speech and cognition I'm fascinated to see what the further research on THC acid reveals and we should be really fascinating people often wonder what's normal for THC should it take care of my pain should it take care of my nausea like what is it really supposed to do for me there's been a lot of research that's been done there's certainly more to do but we have some really clear ground that you can stand on and say THC is great for these things it's great for mild to moderate pain relief and it's become because of that has become a great option for people to wean themselves off of opioid therapy say from post-surgical pain for some people they can deal with post-surgical pain using cannabis for many people that's a challenge and they often need the opioids for a few days but cannabis can be an incredible tool for getting yourself off of that addictive medication as quickly as possible so you don't experience those side effects control of nausea is a very significant finding around THC people with cancer and AIDS and who are taking a lot of different pharmaceutical regimens to help get them through their condition off an experience a lot of nausea and also the need for appetite stimulation as we all know THC does a great job at appetite stimulation sometimes when you don't want it to THC can also be a great solution for insomnia for many people helping people go to sleep and then stain is sleep a little bit longer the one thing that we should always consider especially for new users to cannabis who are trying THC for the first time is that for some people it's not always totally a great experience so if you suffer from anxiety or you find yourself on the bipolar spectrum or with schizophrenia or with conditions like that THC may exacerbate your condition so if you fall into that spectrum you really want to make sure that you work closely with your doctor if you're just thinking about exploring THC dominant cannabis and your therapy regimen and make sure that it's the right choice for you and then it's done in a controlled manner because everybody needs to be successful and their therapeutic regimen that one might need a little bit more guidance and some THC levels for flowers are really interesting you know in owning the lab for the last seven years it's been fascinating to actually watch that potency average rise in addition to the the potency average of flowers rising you see all these other kind of new products coming out but a lot of people wonder like what's normal for flowers what's average what's high what's low so in Northern California where my laboratory does testing we see the average range of THC dominant flowers to be about sixteen and a half percent once you get over about eighteen to twenty percent that's near in the strong range and over 21 percent you have a lot fewer strings that qualify and if another dividing line is 25% you do have some strains that perform over 25 percent THC but it's a lot fewer than below so it's good to understand what average ranges are and also that there is actually a value associated with those ranges and so if your economics of cannabis use matter to you then it might be good to understand what things fall into your price range and how you can best use those in your therapy regimen there is a whole class of patience right now who's really interested in the mild to moderate range of THC potency especially older people I know as I get older my response to THC definitely changes we often have a lower tolerance level for it as we get older so those lower THC products say 10% THC and below are becoming more attractive to those new people who are coming to cannabis for the first time so just because it's low potency doesn't mean it's bad it just means it's right for a different person than something that's high THC so we've had this explosion of concentrates especially in California I mean in every legal market I'm sure but I'm here in California so that's where I see it the most I remember the first time I saw a BHO wax I remember the first time I saw a shatter and as a chemist I was fascinated by it and I asked them about it and they wouldn't tell me anything it's top secret in others videos all over YouTube the times I think all of this stuff so it's certainly no secret anymore and as the secret has gotten out the proliferation of it's been amazing and what's really fascinating is it's really changed the potency thresholds that people are accustomed to and that they expect in the marketplace so interesting to know that Keefe you know so that's a cannabis that's been run and over a dry sieve say and the resin glands collected generally doesn't get over about 30 or 40 percent THC and more often it's actually a little bit below that with hash so traditional hash like you used to see coming se out of Afghanistan and Pakistan in places like that which you actually don't see much of anymore generally ranges between about 10 to 60% with average being at about 48 bubble hash which is water extracted hash still popular all it's waning in its popularity as other extracts come into the market co2 extracts and BHO extracts and all these different things that people are doing but water extracted hash you know averages at about 50% and really tops out around 65 or so you do have a few rare ones that go higher than that but the average is a real solid 50 percent wax or BHO or shatter co2 extracts you know those are chemical extracts so bubble hash hash and Keith are all made by what we call a mechanical process right where you physically remove resin glands and gather them and press them together whereas these new concentrates are totally different so they come from a process of chemical extraction so the extraction of cannabis with butane with co2 with propane some with nitrogen there's a variety of things that you can use but that chemical extraction as you might expect as much more efficient so you get much higher concentrates um ranging upwards of 90 plus percent definitely something to be careful with if you're a new user but can be a great source of relief and very concentrated dose of cannabinoids if needed for the right patient let's move on to talking about CBD a lot of talk about CBD people are really excited about CBD you know when I first started speaking to patient audiences seven years ago I would ask people who's heard of CBD in here and I get a couple hands half timidly raised when I asked that question to an audience today everybody raises their hand until they know what CBD is which is a really cool thing to happen in five or seven years so why do we care about CBD and what's the buzz you know what is it all about well it's different from THC in many ways in both the way that it makes you feel and a therapeutic applications so CBD has been called non psychoactive or non intoxicating the way I like to say it is you'll still be able to operate heavy equipment afterwards probably so CBD is a great option for people who again who are seeking cannabinoid therapy are a little concerned about the feelings of intoxication they might experience from THC and would really prefer to take baby steps in to cannabis they feel safer so CBD has become one of those things that people can try in a safe way in a safe place in addition there's a greater level of permissions right they've been created around CBD both legally and culturally in our society and that entry point of that kind of environment of permissions that's being created for CBD is really exciting because it's really been the impetus for changing the conversation around cannabinoid therapy focusing on the medicinal therapeutic and less on the psychoactivity and intoxication components that have historically been our kind of cultural association with cannabis CBD is interesting in that it's usually found at low levels so sub 1% less than 1% but in some cannabis it's the dominant cannabinoid although that does occur more rarely than with THC there's a lot of efforts underway to create more CBD strains their seed collectives there's independent growers there's companies who are making products now and they want the only specific cannabinoids to be present especially CBD so there's a lot of work around developing more CBD strains and creating more access to CBD for patient population so interestingly CBD like THC also has an acid form CBD acid or CBD a fascinating of course that both of course are non intoxicating as CBD is not intoxicating if THC is present though it's good to understand that you may still feel some feelings of intoxication so CBD does really lower the overall feelings of intoxication that you're going to feel from THC because of the way that they interact but you still may feel a little bit so if you do feel some intoxication don't be surprised it's because of the THC present the therapeutic uses of CBD and CBD acid are different a lot less is known about CBD acid fewer people have used it but it has been the one that has shown some pretty incredible shifts in children who are using it again as with THC acid the time to feel the effects are different so with CBD acid therapy you may need to be using CBD acid tincture or juicing three to four weeks before you actually feel that overall reduction of your symptom level one of the best stories that I heard about Beadie acid therapy was out in the village of Mendocino in Northern California and I was visiting a little collective out there called the Leonard Moore cooperative we've done a lot of work to try and promote CBD and there was a patient of theirs that had ALS and it was a fairly far advanced case of it and she was about to go into Hospice and the family was really upset about that they really wanted her at home you know everybody does better at home and so you know there in that moment of desperation and they were gonna try anything and they got some juice to cannabis from Leonard more cooperative and that juiced cannabis being given to her on a daily basis is what kept her off of a feeding tube and kept her out of hospice and so she was able to have really an incredibly higher quality of life through CBD acid therapy and there's there's so many stories like that we don't have enough time to tell but it can be a very powerful alternative to the drugs that people are using or the care regimens that we start to pursue as as people go into end-of-life so like with THC acid there is a recipe for conversion if you need to convert CBD acid to CBD say for a product or a tincture that you're making to help with your own therapeutic regimen and there's some specific conditions so again heating raw cannabis in your oven so not in oil or anything else is the best way to do it you want to spread it out on a baking sheet pre-heat your oven to 295 so it's a higher temperature than with THC and heat it for ninety minutes and you'll get great CBD acid to CBD conversion if you don't go to that 295 degree temperature your conversion probably won't occur or I'll occur in a partial way so really important that you hit that temperature and because it's important you hit the temperature I recommend that people buy an additional temperature gauge for their oven so you can often buy them right in the grocery store and the little gadget aisle you can hang it right in your oven and make sure that you're actually at the right temperature because I'll tell you our oven thermostats are terrible for the most part I have learned so when people are looking for CBD and they're looking for it the flower form they're often kind of restricted to asking about specific strain names some strains that you can look for that are likely to be CBD dominant are things like tsunami Harlequin canna tonic Harless sue can ASSU stinky pink diesel and of course Charlotte's Web that we heard about a lot from Sanjay Gupta interestingly stinky pink diesel was the first I know it's a funny name was the first high bead high CBD strain that was isolated and identified here in California through lab testing that happened at Harbor side it was a strain that came out of very very small growing community in Mendocino County called Koval oh and I remember doing a seminar out in Koval Oh about six years ago now in the public library there and as a very small place about six people came and the woman who actually had created that strain and submitted it for testing and was it was actually there so it was a pleasure to meet her she stills got those genetics and is holding on to him tight you know that's one of the things that's been interesting about CBD is because it's been so limited in supply and there have been so few people who have held the genetics there was a tendency for a long time to hold on to them and and not share them with people what's really exciting is that we've had some producers and breeders and creators like Lawrence Ringo who made all of their genetics available in seed form to whoever wanted to buy them so that's been a really exciting change in CBD is it's now very publicly available for people who say want to grow it themselves or work with it themselves the therapeutic uses of CBD are different from THC complimentary but different so it definitely deals with pain just like THC does but it attacks pain from a different side than THC it definitely reduces inflammation as THC does but it specifically deals with pain due to spasticity and there are a lot of chronic pain conditions that originate from muscle spasticity fibromyalgia multiple sclerosis I mean epilepsy it's origin is spasticity and that's why you've seen CBD become a go-to therapeutic alternative for many people who suffer from these spasticity related conditions CBDs also been shown in some more modern research to be very effective for eliminating chemotherapy induced neuropathy and also neuropathy in general even diabetic neuropathy so that work was done in a very formal setting and was actually very clear so CBD has a lot of different uses especially for people suffering from chronic pain one of its other major applications is as an anti-anxiety substance so CBD for many people who suffer from anxiety really seems to provide them incredible relief now I never recommend that somebody go off of their anxiety medication without consulting their doctor but for many patients they've been able to either find it as a compliment or a substitution for a more traditional pharmaceutical regimen that they were previously on CBD has also been shown in some research to perhaps have some anti-tumor activity for particular types of tumors a little bit later in the presentation we'll talk a little bit more about that research for people who are using CBD and THC together they have some interesting interplay with one another that's good to understand because they become tools in your toolkit as a patient and a user with a therapeutic regimen that you're trying really to have be successful so CBD actually prolongs the effects of THC and the way that it does that is actually inhibits the enzyme that breaks down THC in our liver so when CBD connects with that enzyme it changes its shape and so THC doesn't fit in it very well anymore and can't be broken down and so it recirculates and we experience it for a longer period of time CBD also reduces the feelings of intoxication from THC so when I tell people that CBD is gonna make their THC last longer they're alright I'm gonna get high for longer well it's a little bit different than that you'll probably be less high but your therapeutic benefits will last for longer so it's a point at which we have to kind of separate those two ideas the expected CBD levels for flowers are a little bit different than for THC especially when we're looking at CBD flowers that have a one-to-one or a balanced ratio because think about it you couldn't have 20% THC and 20% CBD in the plant right no one to another they 40% cannabinoid and they just don't accumulate at that level no lab has shown that result yet so the only time that you really see CBD go above 20% or even in that range are in those 20 to 1 CBD to THC flowers oftentimes and say a one-to-one CBD flower you'll see something like 5% CBD and 5% THC or maybe 7% and 7% so the levels are a lot lower than you see in those THC flowers that we've really optimized for potency over so many different years how high the CBD level is again depends on ratio so if you're dealing with a twenty to one you can actually see CBD levels up as high as twenty but with balanced or with lower ratios you're going to see them more in the single-digit range so that doesn't mean that it's poor quality and I know we have this idea that cannabis at a certain percentage means that it's low quality so you kinda have to throw that out the door when it comes to CBD it's just an entirely different thing to consider let's talk about cbn a little bit you know it's gotten kind of a bad rap and you know there's a reason why it's a byproduct of THC degradation so when THC degrades it becomes CBN that usually happens in the presence of UV light and oxygen and I used to say to the growers that I would talk to you so don't put it in the turkey bag and throw it in the corner of your room and little light run across it and back and forth all day because that UV in addition the oxygen the bag is going to cause CBN conversion a lot of dispensaries and people in the kind of open market of cannabis view CBN is a negative indicator of either processing or age on cannabis that's true but it has to be taken with a grain of salt it really only applies to indoor grown cannabis outdoor grown cannabis is going to naturally have a small amount of CBN present due to the UV that's impinging on it from the Sun and the weathering that's happening as it grows in the outdoor environment during the entire grow season so not uncommon to find say 0.5% CBN in an outdoor grown flower that's been perfectly grown and perfectly processed and is very fresh so CBN is not always an indicator of negativity either in the growth conditions or in processing so good to understand that it also has some interesting therapeutic benefits one of the ones that's interesting to me especially is around cardiovascular effects it actually decreases heart rate without decreasing blood flow so can bring your heart rate down some animal model research has also said that CBN induces feelings of grogginess I actually did some consumer testing along the way in developing the humble products to look at CBN and I found very clearly that CBN is a very dose dependent substance and that at low doses can be effective as a sleep aid but as you go into moderate and high doses actually seems to be contraindicated for sleep and can be alerting to many people so there's a very interesting finding and in fact found throughout our work that LOC cbn dose and a dose of THC accompanied with Mersin are virtually equivalent so let's talk a little bit about some of the minor cannabinoids THC and CBD and CBN we hear about those a lot there's other ones that have started to percolate up you know we hear about them here and there but we don't know a lot about them part of its because not a lot of research has been done so there's more work to do but there's some interesting things to look at CBC is one of my favorite I think it has a lot of promise you know CBD has been shown to be a very powerful anti anxiety substance in the preliminary research that's been done CBC has been shown to have 10 times the anti-anxiety effects of CBD Wow interestingly CBC is present and elevated amounts in juvenile plants and then as the plant grows older and matures and flowers you have lower CBC levels there have been some plants that have been isolated that are CBC rich plants and they are actually mutant plants that can't produce THC and CBD very well and so because they can't produce THC and CBD very well the CBC is allowed to accumulate the reason why is that they all share the same starting material so this little pile of something called CBG acid inside the plant and the THC enzyme the CBD enzyme and the CBC enzyme all grab on to that CBG acid as their starting material to convert to become the cannabinoids that they eventually are THC CBD and CBC so when the THC enzyme and the CBD enzyme aren't grabbing any of that b:g acid it's just left there for the CBC in Xiamen it goes to town and starts to accumulate uns that's the only time you really see it at appreciable levels in a mature plant so there hasn't been very many of those identified so that's kind of that's the search right for the ambitious grower out there is that CBC mutant CBC's also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects as well cannabidiol or CBD is an interesting one as well it's non psychoactive or non intoxicating as a CBC by the way again anti-inflammatory and pain relieving effects seems to be a theme right you hear from almost every cannabinoid THC CBD CBC now CBG we're hearing that pain relieving an anti-inflammatory effects so if you're dealing with pain cannabis is a great solution or a great thing to drive for people you know we often hear about cannabis and glaucoma and I don't know we've all probably heard Peter Tosh this song where he talks about it too right I always associated that especially with the way people express it and talked about it what it had to do with THC but if you look at the research you'll see that what was actually shown to be reducing intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients in the research that's been performed with CBG in many of the cases that have been identified so it's also an interesting molecule to look at therapeutic li CBG acid as I said is the precursor to both THC and CBD in the growing plant but you always have a small amount of CBG that's left over and sometimes it's not a small amount it can actually help growers look at an indicator of whether or not they allowed their plant to mature longer so a mature plant that was harvested in an optimal time probably have 1% or less of CBG maybe up to one and a half percent but you can see plants with as much as five or six percent CBG present in them basically what you're looking at there if it's not a genetic mutant is a plant that was just harvested a little bit too early that balance and that varying balance between the different cannabinoids as well as the other substances of the plant at different points of maturity and harvests are some of the things that shape preferences that people have say for early mid to late harvest products THC v also has a lot of buzz about it tetrahydrocannabinol it's a mouthful there's been limited research on it it's a very rare cannabinoid in my laboratory we've isolated three different cultivars of THC cannabis over 5% by weight so those are very interesting all in one small community in Mendocino so they've been kind of collecting genetics it's sifting through to them to see if they can find th DV and a few of them have the animal model research assist some interesting things about THC v relative to THC and that is is that the presence of THC v is thought to bring on the feelings of THC stronger and quicker so it quicker hi that's more intense but also has a shorter duration I said call it the quickie right if you can actually find the THC v cannabis there's also been research people say hey Samantha where do I get some of that diet weed and I say diet weed well what's the diet weed the diet weed it turns out is th T V cannabis so there's been some animal model research that suggested that it actually prevents the munchies which if you struggle with your weight and you smoke cannabis may be a significant issue for you not being proven out in humans yet so as soon as we get more THC th T V cannabis for everybody to try we'll have to run that one to ground and see if it really is the diet weed but there's a lot of people excited about the prospect of that right now there's also a related compound on the CBD side called CBD V Orkin a bit of Eron CBD v and THC v are both what we call propyl cannabinoids they have a three carbon ring on them that what makes them a little bit different CBD v is also a non intoxicating cannabinoid and it's thought to perhaps be one of the differentiators in CBD dominant cannabis that has greater or lesser efficacy for epilepsy treatment so interestingly in in groups of epilepsy patients who have been trying lots of different CBD strains we find that they don't all work the same some work better than others they maybe have the same CBD to THC ratio so you can tell it's not about that it's not just about the CBD and THC well one of the other things it's present can be CBD v and some preliminary animal model research has shown that CBD v has significant anti spasticity properties so it may be that the anti spasticity properties of CB DV when coupled with CB d really create the best solution for a lot of people when treating epilepsy and spasticity but more to learn on that as well there's a lot of exciting research happening right now and it's an exciting time in that our government here in the u.s. even is allowing more research up to this time a lot of it has had to happen in more international places in Spain and Italy and Israel and Canada who have had a Amsterdam who've had a greater level of permissions than we have there's been a few pioneers here in the u.s. dr. Sean McAllister is one of them he's out of California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco and Sean is a true pioneer you can you two of him and watch him all day if you'd like to what Sean did was he induced tumors into animals into rats so you can actually buy cancer many people don't know that but you can buy cancer and you can give it to things as in a clinical setting so these rats were given cancer and they were allowed to grow tumors in this case breast tumors were the specific case study that I saw from from Sean so he showed a picture of this ugly tumor on this poor rats chest and then he made CBD THC injections into that tumor and after 30 days of the injections at the right ratio of CBD to THC that tumor completely disappeared and the next thing that Sean shows is a picture of a rat with nothing but beautiful pink skin on its belly and if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes I probably wouldn't believe it because it's such an amazing transformation so Sean's work is really exciting he's really diving down into whether the specific cannabinoid ratios that are needed to treat a specific type of cancer Sean was a rebel he got his first research grant under the auspices of actually demonstrating that cannabis wasn't good for you and and bless Sean for that because that was how he got the funding to make these findings now the NIH is willing to fund his research at face value as a benefit for finding cures for cancer so that's an exciting shift as well there's been a lot of research on PTSD we have a lot of people in our society these days suffering from it from all of the wars that we've had recently addition to just the stress and pain of this fast-paced culture that we're all living in right now so there's been a lot of looking at how can cannabis help these people recover and come back to normalcy and enjoy a greater quality of life well we've shown that THC when it stimulates the cb1 receptor can interrupt memories and we all know that cannabis affects our memory wearing work and if personally in anecdotally but it can on a on a more clinical level so when your memories are disrupted that way when you have PTSD it can actually let you have that break where you can get control and get control of your thoughts and control that looping and that focusing on that negative experience you had which is the root of that PTSD so again through animal model research and showing that stimulation of the cb1 receptor eliminates these long term negative memories there's a real prospect of hope for people who are suffering from PTSD using cannabinoid therapy instead of other pharmaceutical alternatives there was some great research at Temple University on chemotherapy induced neuropathy as well neuropathy is the degeneration of the nervous system and there's a lot of pain associated with it the study found that when CBD was administered before the chemotherapy that could actually completely prevent the onset of chemotherapy induced neuropathy so for those people that was you know an amazing amazing shift they in a 2010 FDA clinical trial they actually concluded that inhaled cannabis significantly reduced neuropathy as compared to placebo in human studies so fascinating to see the FDA and 2010 was actually doing this research which is not well known so some great things on cancer PTSD and neuropathy and one that's really been in the press a lot lately has been treatment of epilepsy that's happening through the activated CBD being administered to patients often in tincture form or orally ingestible and it's causing incredible shifts and changes in people who suffer from frequent seizures I had a story from a fellow who called me and he went to tell me about his four-year-old daughter and you could hear the sounds of him making dinner in the background all of San sounds the family I liked him from kind of the first few words he said to me was hearing and he said you know my daughter has 800 seizures a day and basically that means she's in an intractable seizures all of the time I'm really desperate to find something to help her they've got her on all of these drugs or causing all these side-effects and she has no quality of life and no interaction with the family it was a very sad story and he didn't live anywhere near me in my state so I was able to help him with was information about CBD and strain names that he could look for to try and find something to help her he called me back about a month later he said Samantha I want to tell you about what's happening I said you know she was at eight hundred seizures a day and we've had her on a CBD tincture now for a month or so and she's down to one seizure a week and later on that young lady was down to one a month it gives you chills when you think about I mean can you imagine eight hundred seizures a day was no that's one every you know every if you figure out how many minutes there on the day and that's pretty much a constant seizure so the fact that CBD can bring this kinds of relief to people is something that's opening doors and opening minds about cannabis as a therapeutic alternative sir so many of these complicated drugs that are currently being used to treat these very serious conditions so it's I'm excited to be a part of and share with you this current research and maybe help open your mind and your landscape of permissions for trying cannabis and for supporting it in the use of your families", "DgH97erLA90": "when I was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer giving me perhaps 10 years to live it did feel like things were falling apart give it here give it here okay but just because conventional medicine doesn't have a cure I refused to believe I'm out of options there are many stories on the internet of cancer patients who say their lives have been saved by cannabis like Darren Blackwell who was just days from death at the age of 14 the doctors had done all they could his mum who'd been giving him cannabis oil for the pain boosted the dose and Darren made a sudden recovery Darren lamb bill nice to meet you how are you I'm getting itchy hello Carly how are you five years later he still fit and well I was bones and flesh and fat all in nothing else there was barely any blood in me so he come just give you a good path to death yes yeah then you didn't die yeah yeah that was the difficult compartment because because I wanted to die so the dying part was easy you just have to relax Inka like deal without how I had accepted it the crucial question is to what extent you feel that cannabis kept you alive ninety percent Manchester I was gone mentally just walking around like a zombie and then I came back and I recovered really quickly it was really strange it kick-started my immune system and my bone marrow it helped do something to it there's no doubt about that the addition of the cannabis helped Darren's story fills me with hope but while he's convinced that cannabis saved him there's no medical proof so to discuss the science of it I'm meeting dr. Peter McCormick one of the top cancer scientists in the UK so what's the difference between cancerous cells and regular cells yes so cancerous cells start to grow uncontrollably and become a large mass and they don't respond to the stop grow signals that normally come from the body so basically these cells are not getting the message from management that they should be dying correct or they're just not lit they're willfully not listening correct okay so how do you make them this well you try to identify what makes those cells unique versus a healthy cell and put in what we call a silver bullet to try and kill those cells and what's the closest you come to the silver bullet in this case we're studying cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid is a small molecule naturally occurring in cannabis at Eva's cannabinoid receptors you can think of as radio transmitters of cells and what we've discovered is that one of these cannabinoid receptors is higher expressed in cancer cells so there's more of it in a cancer cell than a healthy cell and we're trying to take advantage of that imbalance to kill off and tell that cancer cells stop growing so if you put the right kind of cannabinoids into that petri dish there it'll kill them off correct that's great what about in my case I've got advanced prostate cancer metastasized it's in the bone yeah so we've done some work on prostate cancers and it looks like in certain cases you can get prostate cancers which will respond to cannabinoid there you", "lK2pxyo3R8Y": "hi there I'm Mandy Lee the host of try this and try this is an educational show that is all about cannabis and cannabis products every Thursday we share with you how to videos and product reviews and much more to ultimately help you get the most value from our favorite plant and today we have for you for tips on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures so let's get to it let's dive in and let's try this now tinctures are extracted cannabinoids which are mixed into either an alcohol glycerin or coconut oil solution and they're ideal for people who are using cannabis for medicinal reasons or for people who are new to cannabis as well there's a few reasons for this one is that they're administered via a syringe so you're able to easily and accurately dose yourself in really small increments because you can basically count each drop as you administer it also the tinctures come in many non psychoactive options and they also carry little to no smell and involve no vapor or smoke now the most popular and beneficial way of taking them is sublingually so the solution is absorbed in the body through the oral mucus all and to do this you use a dropper and you place the cannabis solution right underneath your tongue you hold it there for about a minute before swallowing and then you will feel the effects typically in about fifteen to thirty minutes and the last you for about three to four hours this way of administering it the cannabinoids and the terpenes they're absorbed through the tissue lining into your bloodstream so this increases the bioavailability of the cannabinoids so if this is the method that you're interested in then here are four tips for you on how you can get the most value from cannabis tinctures now number one is specific cannabinoid options so when it comes to tinctures many people don't realize that there are many options pass the sativa indica and hybrid options that they're used to tinctures can be made with specific cannabinoids and some with different ratios of one two one three two one or twenty two one of a combination of cannabinoids to meet different patient's needs because each cannabinoid is known for helping to treat different symptoms and ailments and can cause different effects so you can find teachers that are in THC which is psychoactive CBD which is non psychoactive THC and CBD a which is the acid form of THC and CBD before it's exposed to heat and both of these are they're fairly new cannabinoids to be offered and studied their non psycho active but there are astounding results that have been discovered with patients who are using these cannabinoids for an assortment of different reasons number two is using whole plant tinctures from flower so here at green flower we tend to favor whole plant tinctures from flower as opposed to trim now the flowers are just the most cannabinoids and terpenoids aplan whereas the trim it doesn't have as many terpenes and it mostly has the cannabinoid THC in it so these types of tinctures they'll give you the fullest entourage effect from cannabis and provide you with the widest range of terpenes now the cannabinoids and terpenoids resides and with some trim only tinctures you just lose quite a bit of the medicinal value from this lack of a rich terpene profile so when entourage effect is present in many of these flower rich tinctures what happens is you have multiple cannabinoids and chirping that are present and they work together to enhance the medicinal value of each of their individual properties now number three is choosing alcohol extractions so we also tend to favor tinctures that are made from an alcohol extraction process since this process it's just the gentlest on the plant and so it keeps the terpenes more intact because some extraction processes they strip the terpenes from the cannabis and other ones like co2 break apart the bonds between the cannabis and the terpenes and then they reintroduce the terpenes then ultimately what we've seen is that when you keep the terpenes completely intact with the cannabis that's when you'll see the best benefits and the terpenes make the benefits of the cannabinoids even more effective in your system and they carry a bunch of medicinal value themselves as well now Alison Attell from treat well which is a leading cannabis tincture company here in California she said that with alcohol extractions she's seen that with her clients and patients that they're not building up a tolerance to the cannabis so they're able to use less cannabis to achieve the exact results that they need which is a really big plus number four is choose products with testing and proper labels so when you're purchasing tinctures there are a few that you want to make sure to look for and to favor you want to make sure that the bottle itself says how many total milligrams of THC and other cannabinoids are also present in it as well as how many milligrams are in each dropper otherwise you're not going to be able to accurately and safely dose yourself and then we also recommend checking the company's website before purchasing to make sure that the cannabis teacher that you're purchasing has been lab tested for things like molds and pesticides and consistency potency and residual solvent now if you are interested in learning even more about tinctures and all the different ways that you can use them to help enhance your

again with another quick video had to hit a prize this morning Friday January 3rd I hit a prize Irie boom boom boom grab a few things today but only one that I'm doing a review of right now I grabbed sour banana sherbert cartridge at liquid live present cartridge sour banana sherbert right there I also grabbed brownie Scout this is called brownie Scout by rhythm 34 percent THC I'm not doing that either and I grabbed another blueberry headband and I also grabbed this is what I'm doing the review up by oh Jesus butter by Cresco right there it's the bio Jesus butter by Cresco you see those stats to kind of small right there yeah let me get you open this up here not let you get a look at the what the wax looks like and I'll do a dab of it to different lens if I seem like I'm a little bit further back it's because I have the 50 millimeter 1.8 lens on my camera I wanted to try it out see how it looked different perspective you know I like doing different perspectives and stuff so this is back in my original spot in my chair in the living room and let me do a dab of this buy of Jesus I paid it I paid 65 bucks for the gram of the spy oh jesus not too bad for the gram of the Bible Jesus for 65 paid 70 for that blueberry headband again that stuff was good for 70 it's worth it nice bye oh Jesus that's looking real nice that's the bye oh Jesus butter live butter by Cresco very nice-looking very nice smell it smells amazing this is the bye oh Jesus let me do a dab of this you know what you know what I think of the bio Jesus of butter by Cresco don't some in two puffs go to throw a little in the puffs go also the first I want to bang a dab at this with you guys let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section this bio Jesus is coming in at 81 percent THC eighty one point four five nine and then THC is like one point zero five three so it's like 82 percent probably right around there THC not bad for bio Jesus now I have had violent Jesus and a cartridge before co2 cartridge but I've never had bio Jesus and abs and I did have bio Jesus and flour before which was pretty good it was okay didn't have much of a taste to it dull and lack of terpene profile the reason I bought this one here was this was only 65 bucks and the but tender pointed it out that they just got it in last night he said hey man you know we got five of Jesus in for $65 a gram I say hey man let me get one I was gonna grab jet fuel by rhythm but that was 84 the gram so when I saw up ahead by of Jesus for 65 that just came in they just brought it out this morning I was like let me get one of those instead about jet fuel but then I grabbed another because this is only 70 for the cured resin 93.2% cured resin for the blueberry headband and this flower here which is going to be pretty good that brownie Scout in that cartridge that sour banana sherbert cartridge which I paid for yeah I dropped about he see it was 235 I think I had $10 worth of credits so spent 235 the eighth was 55 this grand was 70 the cartridge was 55 and that Graham was 65 for the buy of Jesus yeah 235 bucks hopefully I can make this last me for a couple couple weeks I'll try to ration it out but I be smoking some stuff up and to had to leave so I really gotta ration this out so it's not set my timer I'm probably gonna have to go in a little early cuz I just a couple seconds there because of that little delay I did I was reading a text message yeah let me know what you guys are smoking on down in the comment section let me know what you think about this new 50 millimeter lens they said I am a little bit away from the camera now the camera is probably 2 or 3 feet from me normally the camera would be really close and I would have the wide-angle view but the cameras like real close to me with this way it's not so much of a wide angle but the picture quality should be a lot better on this video than the other ones alright Cheers bye oh Jesus that's nice it's got a nice um earthy floral kind of flavor with a little bit of a sweetness to it very pleasant very pleasant I like that a lot bye oh Jesus by Cresco yeah smells fantastic I am going to throw a little bit up in the puff go got to clean it out though darn it so I'm not gonna throw it in puff coat just yet I'll do another dab real quick oh yeah man that's nice this is an indica yeah I bought I bought hype this is a hybrid cartridge this is a hybrid this but a blueberry headband this is an indica to buy oh Jesus I know it's first thing in the morning it's uh what is it almost ten o'clock quarter to 10:00 and I'm doing dabs of buy of Jesus like I told you before if you're a veteran smoker and you've been smoking for a long time now you know it depends on what you want I want to relax so by Allah Jesus is good but if I wanted to be uplifted and uplifting then I would get a sativa like I said I was gonna grab the sativa the jet fuel the only reason I grabbed the bio Jesus is because it was $15 cheaper for the bio of Jesus and the THC content was exactly the same eighty one percent so 15 bucks is 15 bucks you know I mean this brownie scale was 55 cuz it's the rough cut they have rough cut and premium but the brownie Scout this was thirty four point eight percent THC love you'll be able to see it on the box this is real small 34 point zero seven nine yeah powerful stuff I don't know if I'm gonna do a review on that now I got all this stuff but the blueberry headband I'm not has already did a review I might do a review on that cartridge yeah very tasty Jesus mm-hmm mr. bio Jesus the box there's the stats see the stats there there we go I had a touch on it to focus right there yeah Cresco live butter by oh Jesus oh you guys have a great day peace I'm out", "qqvJOAV7oAc": "it was 2012 at the age of 12 that you then became one of a very very exclusive club one that you never want to get into one in seven billion five people on the planet have Langerhans cell sarcoma what's that there's not a lot of research into it so I'm not too sure on what it is it's it's very confusing yeah so that should treatment you were facing that the doctors recommended was a bone-marrow transplant yeah it was extensive chemo radiotherapy and then yeah and then bone marrow transplant and you didn't have just one transplant this was three that you had to have and and how did you get on with that well they failed until the first free yeah they were not - it's not too trouble so it's not it's not a big problem to have and then after that this isn't as a mum because he then really began to suffer ya have to watch himself and how bad was it um well after the fourth transplant they told us that you know the first three had failed and and literally all they had was one more chance for him they had one more bag of his own cells no more they were there you know they'd stress the the the thing to us that there was no more chances after this and and unfortunately three days after he had his final transplant he tracked his fingers down side of the bed and then picked up some infections now obviously infections with no immune system whatsoever and no way for an immune system to even even start to build within his body he was literally being kept alive by antibiotics that's what they told us he did get incredibly ill throughout his whole treatment he'd been very happy and smiley and he'd always been tried to be quite jovial but actually those last those last couple of months are very very difficult he was in a lot of pain you would given I think three days three days a week at most is what they told me when I asked him the the timescale you planned your funeral haven't you yeah to what extent all of it we're gonna do it was gonna be fancy dress and I'd chosen all the costumes for people and it was gonna be quite embarrassing for some of the people though yeah who actually said you want you wanted to go yeah I did he was looking forward to it after four years of treatment it's enough enough was enough so this story then takes at him yeah entirely different turn how did that happen through lots of research I've done lots of research on to see when his secondary cancer arrived and it was so unknown I then said I turned to the internet inside looking and and over the over the following months and couple of years afterwards cannabis just kept popping up people kept emailing me you need to try this you need to nice if he hasn't got cancer you know the cancers have gone this is now a completely different issue it won't work for him is no but I would dismiss it and dismiss it and actually came to the point where I was in hospital with Darren and he was so incredibly ill and really on a high dose of morphine he was actually now on fentanyl which they can't go any further than that and it wasn't working against his hand and and the other issues he had with his stomach and I asked the doctor for bedrock on which is a cannabis based pain relief so it's available in Europe and because I've done I didn't you know I don't know I wanted to go through the proper measures and she actually told me we can't because it hasn't been licensed for children so you know and and more of it came out but people just kept saying and I thought you know what what to lose and you've got nothing nothing nothing to lose it that's dying anyway you know so they just rejoin your antibiotics at this point there was no other treatment so you took this yeah and you asked him and you said yeah yeah I was happy to what did you notice how quickly to think oh my god I mean I honestly do the effect of it blew my mind it wasn't what I expected all I expected too it's done live a research and some people use cannabis to kind of alleviate their anxiety and and some pain and that's what Devin was really experiencing on day 17 when they said there's definitely nothing in his bone marrow there's nothing there you've now just got to wait seven got very anxious and said well how much longer do I have to wait they started to trying up the morphine introduced sleeping tablets and so that's when I actually gave it and within half an hour's hours it administered under the tongue sublingually it's just a tincture it's it's it's not the oil that people talk about it was just a teenager then what we know it's within half an hour to an hour but he was just chilled out he just relaxed the anxiety stopped he no longer was panicking and he was able to just he was able to be compas mentis which he wasn't able to be on the belly always the health-wise I mean actually things being tested against you your white blood cells began to go up yeah after five days or C they told us nothing in his bone marrow so gave it to him five days later when the bandages came off his hand and we saw a healthy fingers which we were told there was no way they were under there when we saw a healthy finger see the doctor started panicking this was now based 75 after the transplant and he was then Tony be there for three three days yeah and nobody has ever engrafted after fifty days so day 75 and all of a sudden his white count has appeared the doctors start running around frantically doctors from Bristol Children's Hospital were called in to do some more blood tests which I said well there's no point you told me on your week ago there's nothing there and obviously in the blood count it was there it's very small but it was there and to test the theory you actually withdrew the cannabis after a little while and the blood count started to go down okay so where are you now how are you now perfectly healthy I'm glad you're normal you stress this is this is this doesn't work for everybody this is not a cure no this is something that worked for you and you could be prosecuted let's be honest well the under current laws in England the world's cannabis is not registered as having any therapeutic value anyone using the drug if medical reasons could be charged for possession possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine fascinating story it was so happy that you're here and healthy good luck with the diner he

at this picture it looks like regular coughs syrup if you saw it in your childhood room would you think twice about it it's called cush the drug got a Miami Dolphins player arrested in Collier County this week and then he was cut from the team we sent NBC to investigator David Hodges to find out what it is and you know if these illegal drugs are hidden in plain sight being a big issue for parents and Peter the biggest danger is that they're far more pwned than anything parents may have seen or even tried when they were young so to help your kids we're gonna help you spot them at a quick glance you might not recognize it what does this look like to you ketchup pills that looks like marijuana syrup the final answer is correct Kush syrup found in the car of Miami Dolphins player and Collier County sold in a medical marijuana dispensary in California but not untouchable for kids in South West Florida pretty much everything through online channels you can figure out a way together Steven hill helps kids with substance abuse at Sal's care he says teens will try something like Co syrup just because it's new but I just think it's a different way to do it different and possibly more dangerous syrup has a thousand milligrams of THC the active principle of marijuana per bottle and if taken all at once 10 to 20 times what you're typically going against smoking a joy the side effects would be palpable a lot of times very erratic hallucinations and you can also get psychosis on a temporary basis so the the judgment and your behaviors are definitely impacted grown-ups don't know Lesley Robinson is founder of Street chicks and recovery which runs a marijuana adolescent prevention program in Lee County middle schools she also produces videos helping educate kids about some of the side effects of marijuana in products like Co syrup and it's so potent you're gonna be able to tell your child is high she says the best way for parents to spot these drugs is to pay attention to the new products on the market educate yourself on the other forms besides the bag and the smell the Collier County Sheriff's Office told us they don't recall ever making any arrests where this kind of syrup was down before but many of these drugs come and wave so the best advice for parents be on the lookout if you didn't buy it or authorize it question it for the NBC to investigators I'm David

been hitting on this for a little while this is actually the second one of these got two of these and about one and a half way through and let's take a look at the oil actually first so nice clear oil this is from colorado you can see a little eureka logo on there this is the ATF coming a 96 percent THC very strong very high I'm out actually tried some of this on the Hermes 3 and I tried it on seeso because I was actually I like to whenever doing a hardware review we like to do a comparison of kind of what the baseline is and a cartridge we're familiar with so see so we know it's kind of like the standard and let me compare to that so this oil very good if the 96% really mean anything not really because there's oils that have been in 80s that have been just as strong in fact I would say the AMA oils from Nevada are just as strong as this there's actually been a couple am am I've been been a little bit stronger but this is still awesome oil this is great it's really Rica and here's what it looks like all I'm saying is it seems like when stuff gets to the 80s and above I don't think that the THC helps that much more I mean I've I've had stuff that was 80% that has been better stuff that was 92% so that that's happened quite a bit actually but still whatever the percentages on this 96 it is strong it is good it tastes good and another thing I like about Eureka is it doesn't have that co2 II taste like some of the co2 cards might have like I think the the rhythm cartridge kinda had like a co2 much taste this they've gotten rid of the co2 is taste and it reminds me of w Bates because w of apes also has co2 oil but it doesn't have that co2 II kind of odd taste to it it tastes more like a distillate kind of thing so let's take a hit of it so you can see what it looks like I've been hitting on this battery it hits nice and yeah the oil stays consistent seems to vape pretty slow absolutely nothing to complain about it was 60 for a full gram which you know compared to Nevada prices that's a very good deal compared to Colorado prices it's probably about normal and compared to California prices may be a little bit expensive but overall Eureka ATF definitely we get it again I think it's a quality product and I can't wait to try more Eureka stuff definitely we'll probably just keep getting eureka stuff when I'm in Colorado so there's nab connection two thumbs up for eureka vapor atf syringe thanks for watching and have a great week", "z4dgBpnB9hw": "no no no no no no hold on what's up my peoples all i gotta say is the community asked

ready to go alright guys once again cheers okay um i gotta say they did a super great job um adding the delta eight to the flour and it doesn't have a nasty taste whatsoever all of these strings taste exactly like they're supposed to the girl scout cookies the uh the tahoe og the only one we haven't tried yet is that white wrench and i had to put that in the blunt guys this here see i got caught off guard last time i wasn't expecting that i wasn't expecting that but these cookies girl they go got the girl scout cookies going on delta a oh what a beautiful day it is and i like it a lot guys man i wish they would give me some more the girl scout cookies for real jesus man all right so i'm gonna tell y'all guys like this right now just from the few puffs that you guys seen so far from the tahoe and the girl scout cookies i am feeling really really nice right now really nice so effect wise i can already tell this is a lot stronger than cbd mind you i smoke thc also so you know i'm just not an everyday thc smoker i usually smoke on a weekend sometimes but my tolerance for thc is pretty high so trust me guys i'm putting you on something all right oh yes but now it's time to move on and let's get to the starter show okay here we go white runs from atl rx delta athletic we just gonna let this bad boy burn off a little bit oh yeah if y'all want to know what i rolled up in this is the bluntville the original bluntville it's one of my favorite leaves great job man you guys got a hell of a flower over there atl rx trust and believe me oh man this is legit guys this is legit this is legit legit guys legit legit well i'm already feeling real good guys i'm already i already i don't forgot about the video i started enjoying myself a little bit too much so let me go ahead i'ma close this out but i'm gonna leave you guys with a few words the information for this product will be on the bottom in the comments not the description in the comments all right i got a strike for that so we're not gonna do that anymore we're gonna actually abide by the rules this time guys uh it will be pinned in the comments and is there anything else before i go i think that's about it guys

spoke doctor signing out for now guys peace smoke doctor", "S-z_Qmm75q8": "[Music] hello and welcome back to the cannabis sommelier I'm your host Andrew Friedman thanks for joining me for another episode of food infusions today we're gonna make one of my favorite ingredients again a super versatile ingredient in the kitchen what better than hot sauce something you can put on absolutely everything now when you make a hot sauce it's really easy peppers garlic some acid these are the things that pull it all together and when we think about hot sauce it can really be any combination so when you look at my recipe you can totally manipulate and mold it put any special ingredient in that you like but what I have today is a pack of peppers we have habaneros we have Serrano's we have jalapenos I have half of an onion I have a nice little bunch of cilantro because I love cilantro but if you're not a fan of cilantro you don't have to put it in if you'd like to put carrots in go crazy put some carrots in make sure you sautee them I'm a garlic fiend I got six cloves of garlic most recipes call for three but I'm not Italian but I like what they say double it and vinegar very important the vinegar is what we're gonna put in the pan so I'm gonna saute my peppers onions and garlic all together in a pan I'm gonna put a bit of infused olive oil on the pan we're gonna get the oils juicing out of everything and then we're gonna end up putting it in the blender with a little bit more infused olive oil put a nice pan on medium heat get that going you could put your olive oil in whenever we definitely don't want to smoke this oil but we want to use it to help release the other essential oils from the ingredients so we put the oil into the pan it really helps get all the essential oils popping out of the delicious onion garlic and peppers that we've chosen it's also infused so this is the start of our infusion all right so we've been steaming our peppers onions and garlic for about five minutes now three to five minutes everything's getting a little bit softer you can see it sweating releasing its essential oils and what we're gonna do is just add about two hundred mils of vinegar white vinegar and we're gonna leave it to simmer for about 15 minutes and really release everything that's going on in there the Scotch bonnets the jalapenos the Serrano's all that delicious stuff [Music] a little bit of secret sauce it's been about 15 minutes on the simmer with all of our delicious ingredients we add a little bit of salt pepper a little bit of our secret sauce everything's looking fantastic nice and mixed together and the next step is just to introduce it to the blender and turn it into our sauce whoo that's a spicy Oh cover we've got all our ingredients in the blender that we've just simmered now there's a few things that I like to add fresh and just to pump up the infusion a little bit more so first thing is just a little bit more infused olive oil if you haven't watched that video make sure to click the card now I'm just gonna put a few more milligrams in there perfect as I mentioned I like cilantro and I like it fresh let's put some fresh cilantro in nice large pinch is what I'm gonna add today and then I have a few limes left over from making margaritas so I think I'm just gonna add three or four fresh lime wedges in here so now the easiest and most exciting part of making our sauce making the sauce really it's as simple as creating our ingredients like that and putting them in a blender we'll see how thick it is and see if we need to add more vinegar after a little blend wonderful smells delicious in here so we've got our sauce I have my container and we will just put it in there and let it cool now I'm really excited I have a really cool follow-up video to this one and I'm going to teach you how to take this infused hot sauce and we're gonna turn it into an infused salt you'll be able to use that salt anywhere popcorn just at on steak it's gonna be really really cool okay so our hot sauce goes in funnel always makes this much easier and isn't that beautiful that's homemade hot sauce nice thick delicious goodness no preservatives no additives I guess we're preserving with salt and vinegar that's all we really need at the end of the day there we go that was 500 mils of hot sauce I never actually get the amount right in the bottle so I'm even more impressed with myself not to gloat seal it up throw it in the fridge and because the amount of vinegar and salt in here it'll last easily three to six months my dosage there's about 150 milligrams of THC in this hot sauce you'll be able to dose it out everybody can use it on tacos and whatever you'd enjoy it with thanks so much for watching this episode I hope I hope you enjoyed learning how to make infused hot sauce please make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe and until next time Cheers what's my name what's my name the cannabis Somali yay", "PBWiZgrQ48A": "hello my name is Ryan from goalie scientific and today we are gonna be talking about winterization and dewaxing first let's begin with the definition pulled straight from wikipedia winterization of oil is a process of removing the higher melting point parts from oil like waxes or triglycerides by slowly cooling vegetable oils and felling saturated slides from the solvent used primarily for oils and salad dressings mainly applied in bio industry the most common oil that is winterized as a rice bran oil which has a high content of waxes fatty acids and lipids notice that it doesn't specify which solvent will be used it could be assumed that the initial solvent used to perform the extraction could also be used to precipitate out the waxes and higher melting point compounds typically the people that extract with hydrocarbons and supercooled those hydrocarbons to precipitate how the waxes would call that technique technique dewaxing while those that use a different solvent altogether like ethanol to achieve their dewaxing procedure would typically call it a winterization but the two are of the same thing and in fact if you wanted to call it the correct term it would probably be called freeze precipitation but the confusion is somewhat warranted the procedure may incorporate several different techniques but simply do waxing or winterization is simply the process of removing waxes but by removing something you're also purifying something and by removing the waxes you improve the viscosity stability or the shelf life so let's quickly summarize how the process is done first we start by using a solvent to completely dissolve the sample typically we would use ethanol and for the best results that's what that would be my suggestion it is crucially important that you completely dissolve the solvent there are a couple ways to speed up this process one would be to use heat a hotter solvent is going to be a more aggressive solvent the let the next would be to use agitation so hot plate stirrer would be ideal make sure you give enough time heat and agitation to completely dissolve the sample but if you want a visual indicator a quick test is to use a laser pointer to shine through the solution if a beam of light is found in the solution then keep heating and stirring it's not completely dissolved if however you shine the light through the solution and you don't see the beam in the solution at all then the solution is completely dissolved and you can go ahead and move on to the next step now it's time to allow it to cool and settle this is pretty easy just put it into a freezer and allow it to sit for an extended period of time at a low temperature the colder you have it the faster it works but too cold is possible so I would recommend to not allow it to cool below 50 Celsius I'm sorry negative 50 Celsius usually this would take 24 to 48 hours for a complete precipitation after that it's ready to move on to the filtering stage here you would use a filtration setup which typically consists of consists of a beautiful and filtration flask along with some filtration paper I would recommend quantitative a filter paper and the pore size would generally be around 20 for fast filtration and no smaller than 5 micron it's best to keep the whole process as fast as possible or as cold as possible that way you don't allow things to heat up and allow stuff to go back into solution and fall through the filter paper so how does this all work basically hotter solvents are more aggressive and dissolved more and colder solvents are less aggressive so think of the solvent will like a hand when the solvents hot it grabs a big handful as much as it could possibly hold on to but as a solvent cools down its grip loosens and now it's no longer able to hold as much now stuff falls out of the hands this analogy is exactly how it works your solvent at a warmer temperature completely dissolves your sample and then by cooling your solvent the solubility is decreased and the sample is precipitated out or in this case the waxes are precipitated out in general the heavier compounds tend to precipitate first and lighter compounds tend to precipitate last so in the chart over here to the right what you'll notice is the ethanol at roughly room temperature will be able to dissolve all the compounds below it so waxes cannabinoids flavonoids terpenes it could dissolve everything at room temperature however if you notice as the temperature starts to decrease the ethanol is no longer able to hold on as much and one of the first compounds that it tends to precipitate is the waxes but as stated earlier too cold can be detrimental so if you'll notice if you continue to go down like for instance below negative 50 some of your other compounds will tend to precipitate - such as cannabinoids possibly your flavonoids or even your terpenes at a certain point once you get so cold your ethanol will turn into a solid although cooling the solvent allows us to precipitate out most of the waxes we also employ a separation based on polarity to help us precipitate out the waxes even more thoroughly so what is polarity the common phrase in chemistry is like dissolves like so polar solvents want to dissolve polar compounds and likewise nonpolar solvents want to dissolve nonpolar compounds so by using a more polar solvent we could precipitate precipitate out more of the non polar compounds polar molecules are asymmetrical in shape and have a net charge this tends to force them to group together with other polar compound and therefore exclude out the nonpolar compounds it's important to keep in mind that polarity is not a discrete measure it isn't absolute things are not just simply polar or nonpolar there's a lot of gray area for example a compound might be smacked out right in the middle between nonpolar and polar and it might be difficult to classify it another interesting examples in motions and soaps these compounds tend to have a polar end and a nonpolar end and because of this they could essentially dissolve both polar and nonpolar compounds this is why soap tends to work so good because the water is polar but the oils and greases on her hands are nonpolar the soap unifies these two compounds and helps wash them away another separation technique is to swing the polarity if there's a range of solvents that could be used to dissolve your sample you first start with the most polar or nonpolar solvent then you do your extraction your solvent recovery etc then you read dissolve your sample in the opposite end so if you started with a non-polar solution that you extracted with you would recover all your solvent and everything use a polar solvent to reduce all your sample in it by using two opposite ends of the polarity spectrum you shake off the compounds on the most extreme ends so for instance if you were to use heptane for your initial extraction you would likely pick up everything dissolve everything cannabinoid acids flavonoids cannabinoids carotenes and waxes then when you swing over to your ethanol you're more polar solution you're gonna drop out your waxes but since you originally used heptane in the beginning you won't have any chlorophylls the same process could be done in Reverse so if you start out with ethanol you're more polar solution you're more likely to have more polar compounds like chlorophyll but when you swing them over to are more nonpolar solvent you're likely to lose the chlorophylls polarity should probably also not be underestimated small differences in polarity could have a Jurassic effect feel free to explore or discuss the eatest topics below you can also comment on this video or send emails any time and I'll try my best to respond to them as quickly as possible so as stated earlier temperature swings will cause precipitation so you could always magnify that effect by swing and an even greater so if you start with a hot solvent and then cool it down very cold you could use a lot less solvent a hot solvent can be anywhere from 10 to a thousand times greater effect same thing for polarity swings you could also have a much greater polarity swing and there have therefore have a more defined separation settling is also important allowing more time and reducing the agitation is crucial by reducing the amount of agitation you not only allow faster coagulation but the coagulation also tends to be bigger and more clumped together and this tends to reduce the filtration time needed another idea that we didn't touch on at all is pH if you alter the pH you will also alter the solubility which is the same effect we use to precipitate out other compounds by altering solubility that is so we've used temperature and polarity to alter solubility but we didn't use the pH at all so it stands that we can have a third hole another tool in our Arsenal to use to precipitate out other compounds even more thoroughly another thing to consider is time if you allow enough time and allow enough or a lack of agitation precipitation will occur even at room temperature so you don't have to actually cool it but it definitely speeds things up it'll probably take at least a week for stuff to precipitate out in any kind of substantial amount and to completely precipitate might take a month or more but it's definitely worth pursuing because significant expenses allocated to the chillers or freezers needed for the winterization process occur at a very low temperature so if you could do that and elevate a temperature you could save yourself a lot of money and a lot of headache okay that's all I got for now make sure you check out more of our

master-blaster and we're back at Johnny's green extractions Alright today, we're gonna show you how to make your own CBD edible oil, so if you have any arthritis Anxiety insomnia Back pain this might help you out. We're ready to start with our procedure As you can see we have a quart we're going to be working with a quarter pound of mazar-e-sharif I hope I pronounced that correctly because Where we live that was a highest CBD plant that we could find. I'm sure out in Colorado. There's a lot of Really high CBD plants. You could probably get out there What we're going to do is we're going to crush this up a little bit in our little bullet here and then we're going to fill up our 14-inch extraction tube And just show you some of the bud and it looks like It's filling up a little bullet now, we're gonna grind it a bit All right You guys I should mention that if you want to make your own medicine As far as CBD oil goes you have to work with a plant that is high in CBD You have to use a  marijuana plant, basically Indica sativa, whatever that has a high count of CBD because They can go up to at least 20% in these plants So that is crucial if you want to make effective medicine Almost make it like the material like you're all in a joint not too too fine Okay, we're getting close to the top we're gonna use These unbleached filters, I'm gonna put I'm gonna put three of them on So Get all the wheat off there all right, so We should probably stick these outside because we're sitting at minus 40 right now So you should end up if you order a machine like this You'll end up with some legs like this and the machine and I'm going to simply throw this together Set a legs and throw that bad boy in there Leave enough room for your can about right tighten their down And then we're going to add the can with the proper tip, which I have I Believe this is the one I was using that work quite well in there Strapper it alright, so this is ready to take outside and to Start blasting. We're gonna cool the tube off before we do it though, and then we're gonna throw we're going to throw three cans through 14-inch - Alright folks we're gonna set her off here outside This is the This is the juice. We got out of doing the extracting with the green machine. Now we've We've placed it on this element that is The spark resistant it's it's safe And I've set this to 160 F Normally, we don't do it that high for shatters and stuff but we're making a an edible CBD oil here and our next step here is going to be to decarboxylate it so that if you ingest it, you will get a medical effect from it and We're gonna do that at roughly 250 degrees Fahrenheit for about 20 to 25 minutes Then we're gonna soak it up into little syringes and it'll be ready to apply under your tongue also, this process here was done without a perjure because of the amount of heat that we used that was sufficient enough to Let all the butane rise and escape So it's a pretty clean product. This is also the same way as you would make your butane honey oil If you didn't have a perjure, that's a great option for you That's it subscribe you guys thumbs up peace we'll see in the next video", "J42pmHV8ZEk": "Transcriber: Almudena Torrecilla\nReviewer: Rhonda Jacobs When I was 33 years old, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. And like so many who've gone before me, that diagnosis changed my life. It changed the way I look at the world. And it led me to two very common questions that one starts to ask when diagnosed\nwith a life-threathening illness. How did this happen? And what do I do now? Now this isn't a story\nabout self blame. These are just common\nand natural questions that come from many in times like these. I actually found the questions empowering. This is actually a story about how those\ntwo questions led to a realization that I think can help\nto change the conversation around what means to be and stay healthy. So back to my first question: how did this happen? See, (Sigh) I felt like I had done\neverything right. What do I mean by that? Well, if I ask you, what does\nit mean to be healthy, to live a healthy lifestyle? What kind of answers do you get? Regular exercise? Balanced diet? Taking your vitamins? Annual checkups? Limiting toxic exposure to chemicals,\npersonal care products? Well, by all of these\naccounts, I was healthy. I had done the work. So I was angry, and I was frustrated that I'd followed the rules\nand I still found myself sick. Now, I had a friend \nwho a few years earlier had been diagnosed with breast cancer. And when it came to being healthy, she put everyone I know to shame. So I knew she would understand\nhow I was feeling. When we got together, \nshe told me something that would eventually change the way \nI think about health. She told me that her journey \nhad taken her to a place where she believed whole-heartedly  that she had not in fact \nbeen truly healthy. Not at a whole person level because \nshe'd overlooked taking care of herself at the level of her thoughts \nand her emotions. So what she was saying \nhad some subjective merit to me because I can relate to suppressing\nmy own thoughts and emotions maybe in order to please others, or taking on the stress\nof trying to juggle a thousand things. But then the pragmatist in me just wanted to brush that off\nas a little too woo-woo. Then again I had, you know, tackled all of these. And here she was standing\nright in front of me, the picture of health and vitality. So what could it hurt\nto look into this a little further? So down I went through\nrabbit hole number one: mind-body medicine. And for those who of you don't know, mind-body medicine\nstudies how our mind, mood, thoughts and emotion affect our body. So that would be things like \nstress management, stress reduction, like going for a walk in nature, \nunplugging from technology, getting a massage, meditation, (Sigh) mindful breath-work, and thought and belief awareness. So this would be something as simple\nas being more mindful of our thoughts, or something more concrete \nlike cognitive behavioral therapy, where you become actively aware\nof your thoughts and behaviors and then replace them\nwith more positive alternatives that in turn elicit\nmore positive emotions. I also started delving into stories that highlight the mind's ability\nto affect the body. Like the peer-reviewed account\ndocumented by Dr. Klockner in 1959 about a man who he called Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright was diagnosed\nwith terminal cancer and given only days to live. With tumors the size of oranges \nhe had heard or a horse serum that was said to be effective\nagainst cancer and he begged to receive it. His physician, Dr. Philip West,\nreluctantly agreed but was astonished to find\nless than a week later his patient was out of his death bed \nand joking with his nurses. Now, this went on for months until Mr. Wright read a newspaper article stating that the serum was a quack remedy and he suffered an immediate relapse. Now, Dr. West, testing out a hypothesis, said: \"Well, don't believe everything\nyou read in the papers,\" and then he proceeded\nto inject him with what he said was a super-refined, double-strength\nversion of the drug. Really it was water. \nBut again, the tumors melted away. Mr. Wright was the picture of health\nand vitality for another two months until he read what he felt\nwas a definitive report stating that the serum was worthless, \nand he died days later. Now, this is just one of thousands\nand thousands of examples that highlight how the mind\ncan affect the body. And, so I had my anecdotal evidence, which\nincluded the example of my own friend, and I'd like to say that I took\nwhat I learned and put it into practice and lived happily ever after. Of course, that's not what happened. And I don't think I'm alone in that, because many of us hear about how stress\nand emotions can affect our health and how mindfulness meditation\ncan make a difference in our lives and all of that, but many of us also \ndon't do anything about it. I had the stories and the theories, but what I really needed\nwas hard evidence, science to prove that it was true. I mean, we've all grown up\nin a world of, you know, Newtonian, science-based thinking, meaning if we can't see it\nor measure it, then it's not real. So I, like maybe, maybe many of you, didn't start to put these ideas\ninto practice just yet. What I did, and this is now getting into \nthe second of the two questions that I alluded to earlier,\nthe \"What do I do now?\". What I did is I started using\nmedical cannabis at the recommendation\nof my nurse and other patients. And it helped immensely with pain \nand nausea and anxiety and all of the really fun staff\nthat come along with cancer treatment. I also started joining online\nmedical cannabis user communities. And I was in awe at the spectrum of issues\nthat cannabis was helping with. Intractable illnesses that weren't\nresponding to other forms of treatment, like MS, fibromyalgia, PTSD,\nTourette syndrome, IBS, epilepsy, chronic pain, autoimmune\ndiseases ... I could keep going. The list goes on. But I started to wonder, how was it\nthat cannabis was helping with all of these unrelated conditions, because I can't think of another\nmedication out there that would be able to help \nwith so many illnesses. So how did it work? Well, down I went\nthrough rabbit hole number two, and this was a deep hole. In a nutshell, I learned that the reason that cannabis was working \nfor so many different conditions is because it interacts directly with \nour body's own endocannabinoid system. The endocannabinoid system is\na little known but massive bodily system responsible for maintaining homeostasis,\nthat's balance, in the body. It consists of a network of \nneurotransmitters called endocannabinoids as well as receptor sites, the most well-known being the CB1 and CB2\nreceptors, and enzymes. Think of it kind of like\nthe traffic lights of a city, keeping the streets moving smoothly. But if a light goes out anywhere,\nit will cause problems. Congestion, confusion. Cars and people will keep moving, \nbut without the guidance and the rules, the flow just won't be as efficient \nand far more susceptible to accidents. It's actually been called the most\nprolific and integrative system in human health and homeostasis, and even dubbed\nour body's own master system because of its role in maintaining balance\namong all the other systems of the body. Now, this is important because all illness\ncan in fact essentially be boiled down to some sort of imbalance in the body, whether genetically induced or otherwise. Now, if you haven't heard of this system\nbefore, you're not alone. And if you are hearing about it \nfor the first time, you may be wondering why on earth you haven't heard of this\nepically important system until now. And it's partly because it's newly\ndiscovered in around the 1980s, but also partly because\nof the stigma around cannabis, for which the system is named. Because scientists discovered the system when they were trying to answer\nthat same question: \"how does cannabis work?\" So they learned that compounds in the\ncannabis plant called phytocannabinoids actually fit near perfectly\nwith the receptor sites of the endocannabinoid system. So used properly, this plant\ncan help to activate, tone and support the endocannabinoid\nsystem when it's out of balance. So it's a pretty amazing plant. To say I became obsessed with\ncannabis and the endocannabinoid system is an understatement. I buried myself in research papers,\nlectures, courses, certifications, learning everything I could about cannabis as well as ways to keep\nthe endocananbinoid system itself healthy and balanced. Because while it's easy to say, \"wow, look at this amazing\nplant that we have; it's able to help\nwith all these chronic conditions and balance the body,\" and obviously I believe that; I've dedicated part of my life\nto spreading the message that cannabis is medicine. But it's equally important\nto look beyond cannabis as a single cure. Because when you look closer, you'll see\nthat cannabis is an important ally, but it's only part of the puzzle. So, let's use that example again\nas the endocannabinoid system and the traffic lights. Except for in this scenario, cannabis\nis like the friendly police officer that comes in to direct traffic\nwhen the lights are out. So the officer's doing their best, and certainly it's helping to keep traffic\nmoving in a more organized manner, but we still have to figure out\nor at least try to figure out how to fix the lights. So how do we go about fixing the lights? How do we support and heal\nthe endocannabinoid system when it's out of balance? Well, it just so happens\nthat one review study in particular looked at 325 other studies that all focused on what helped\nand hindered the endocannabinoid system by focusing on key\nendocannabinoid health factors, and here's what they learned\ndirectly affect the system. Exercise, and notice I wrote\n\"Pleasurable Exercise\" there - it has to be something\nthat you enjoy doing. Okay? Diet and supplements.\nSo a couple examples that I'll give you. Herbs and spices contain\nsmall amounts of phytocannabinoids, the same compound that cannabis contains. And certain healthy fats can actually\nhelp your body to synthesize its own endocannabinoids. Environmental exposures. So some pesticides will actually\ndownregulate the endocannabinoid system, have a direct effect with it. There are a few others\nI'm going to share with you. But before I do, I just want to bring\nyour attention to a sentence that really jumped out at me\nwhen I was reading this study. It said that the endocannabinoid system represents a microcosm\nof psychoneuroimmunology. And I had to look that last word up. In case some of you don't know,\nI'm going to break it down. Psychoneuroimmunology is the study of the interaction\nbetween the psychological processes, \"the mind,\" and the systems\nof the body, \"the body.\" So really it's just a fancy way of saying\nthat metaphorically speaking, the endocannabinoid system represents\na microcosm of mind-body medicine. So now hopefully you can see\nwhere this is all coming full circle and coming together, I hope. Because here's what else was shown\nto affect the endocannabinoid system: Chronic stress. So they looked at stress from pain as well as stress\nfrom thoughts and emotions, so repeated feelings\nlike anger, guilt, depression - something that is chronic\nmeans more long-term. That was shown to significantly impact\nthe endocannabinoid system. And activities that elicit \nthe relaxation response. So that would be, again,\nkind of that walk in nature or doing some yoga, getting a massage. They consider osteopathic\nmanipulation in that study. So why does this matter? Well, I said before that we live\nin a physical world, so for many of us if we can't see it\nand measure it, then it's not real. I told about how I had heard stories\nabout how the mind can affect the body, but I still didn't give it the same weight\nthat I would give to nutrition and movement and medicine. But when I understood\nthat my own endocannabinoid system, my master system for maintaining\nhealth and homeostasis, required me to start taking care\nof my thoughts, my emotions, my stress, my beliefs, it finally clicked for me. So I want to leave you\nwith a scenario to imagine, an idea of how this information can help\nto change the conversation around health, like I said in the beginning. Imagine if the message that we heard from\nour physicians and public health officials sounded like this: \"Listen, what if I told you that there's\nthis really important bodily system, call it a master system, and if you can keep it functioning well, it can do wonders in allowing your body\nto innately keep itself healthy, heal itself and improve the quality of life for those\nwith biological and genetic illnesses.\" If I told you there was\na system like that, would you want to know\nhow to keep it strong and healthy? And I think most would answer yes to that. And then they would go on to say, \"Great, \nso think of this system like a stool. Each of the legs represents\nall that's required to keep the system functioning well. And here's why we compare it to a stool. Each of those legs is an integral part\nof keeping that stool stable and balanced. If we remove a leg, or even shorten a leg,\nthe whole stool starts to wobble and becomes less efficient,\nless stable, less balanced. So let's design a plan for you\nthat incorporates all of these concepts as part of a healthy lifestyle.\" Imagine. Not only is that proactive,\nbut it's empowering. And I invite all of you to consider\nwhere your stool is wobbling. It's been said that mindfulness could be\nthe next great public health revolution. I believe it's only a matter of time\nbefore mindfulness, stress reduction, thought-belief awareness is every bit\nas important as seeing your doctor, taking your vitamins, eating a balanced\ndiet and getting regular exercise. And maybe the endocannabinoid system\ncan help to catalyze that. It's my hope that the more we understand\nthe ramifications of this master system, the more we'd be willing to develop\na truly integrated approach to whole personal health. Who would have thought\nthat cannabis, the gateway drug, could actually form part of the gateway to\nthe next great public health revolution? Thank you.

all of our faith cartridges are like dunzo check this out they're like it looks like there's something inside but there's nothing inside these I mean I could probably get like little baby hits but they're done I've been sucking on them dry bro like all of them we are out so the revival vape actually comes with empty hive cartridges you guys can see here and you just pop it open take this little thingy off and you can just pour your concentrates in there man simple as that so we're gonna take this syringe of beta my cream and we're gonna make a little vape syringe or vape cartridge with the syringe this is from nectar stick interesting people we see them at all the events they're always there pitching their stuff they sell these full grams in this container for $40 at the events it's probably gonna run you 50 or 60 out of dispensary but this one specifically normally they have like kind of ap flavors like strawberry cough and mango passion this and whatever I asked the guy what do you have for pain and it gave me this it's a ante what does it say pain relief sedative now actually that's upside down sorry guys now I actually hit these people up on Instagram because I was at the event you know I didn't necessarily get the proper explanation of the product you know it wasn't really the kind of place that you sit and you [ __ ] talk science and chemistry about cannabis and [ __ ] but I instagrammed them when I was like hey man I bought your Batum mersin I did I call it Mike Green earlier sorry mersin I bought your beta Mersin and I was curious I mean is this made with cannabis does this contain THC or CBD you know give me some give me some info about this all I have is the package and the package isn't too descriptive either zero PPM's solvent free ultra refined nothing doesn't tell you like percentages doesn't tell you anything so I'm curious like is this a pure I guess I should have explained it if you guys don't know with what beta mercian is I check it out on wiki because that's basically how I learned what it is it beta mercian is basically a component in cannabis it's like a terpenoid it's one of the things that are a part of the we'd like THC CBD CBN THC a all of those get you high and then there are actually compounds that give you flavor like limonene citrus scene or something lemons this is the citrus one hash machine there are a couple of different flavor compounds and these compounds are found in everything I could find citrus or limonene in limes I can find that in oranges I can extract it from those you know and it's also found in cannabis that's why some weed smells like oranges some weed smells like smoke it's are like smoke because you've spoken it some weed smells like like dirt and like earth you know like it literally has the same chemicals they're in those other things so this is one of those chemicals and if you smoke this chemical by itself or not smoke it but you know consume it it's supposed to make you feel relaxed sedative it's supposed to make you sleepy it's supposed to be a good anti and Kalama tori it's it's got a bunch of qualities you can read them all on the on the wiki so I got this and I was like man this should be excellent for medicating and then I had a realization where I was like isn't this the same [ __ ] that they have in mangoes that everybody says gets you higher if you smoke it or if you consume it so if I'm smoking like a really low grade weed or even if I just want to get higher supposedly if I eat a mango it's high in the Mersin and that is what gives me like a bigger high so I was like man this would be excellent for a cush Buster's or something where I'm like [ __ ] eating mangoes I'm literally gonna go to a scientist have him extract the Mersin give it to me straight up and I'll test it for you guys and I'll be like I'm gonna smoke a gram of this shitty weed and then take a hit of the mercy and and see if it helps then I'm gonna take a hit of the top shelf with the Mersin and see if that improves the hit as well and then do like control test like this is awesome so we're just gonna stick this in here like a mad scientist and just fill it up I want to I use it up I use half of this I want to leave some for dabbing but or just see if it even works let's just use less let's see if it even works you don't want to put all of your nugs in one basket you know what I'm saying I lost a little stopper there's like a little shirt oh there it is it's so tiny put the stopper in I guess I think I went the other way whoops got it all weedy so cool we do that and we're good to go let's try it out I've been smoking it I took it home you guys and I was like let's get [ __ ] up like we went to the event and it was like a marijuana edible sesh and if you guys watched the the podcast if you guys haven't seen it it's the podcast from the weekend of like May 14th May 15th like that and we talked about how we got trapped in the elevator we almost died going to like a weed event and if I get to the weed event and I don't even get to smoke that much or like get that high so I came home and I was like man I'm gonna take a huge hit and I literally smoked like a fifth of it at once and it was a immense hit it was super clean super flavorful particularly for the size usually you take a huge dab of something and it's really rough like it just it kills your lungs it's like it leaves you wheezing but it was super clean and a him Ian waves bro it was like at first like you kind of you feel a little bit after the initial hit but it doesn't like hit you and then like a couple minutes later you start you feel like almost like a wave hit you and like you feel like more buzzing more like higher and more relaxed and then like five minutes later boom like another wave a couple minutes later like another wave and eventually like after 15-20 minutes I was like oh gone I was just like laying in the couch like dunzo really nice I mean I smoked the point point to grammar but let's try it out I'll see how if it works cross your fingers for me I hate wasting weed drum roll please nothing I have to take the thingy out these thingies have the thingy the cartridges have the little stopper so I don't necessarily have to take the stopper out and it's hot I can feel it at the base it's just not it's not doing anything I'm glad I didn't put more one more time get in there get in there I think it's just so thick that it's having a hard time vaping it we're getting there we're getting there has a really good flavor to it it tastes it tastes very similar to the pickled monkey cartridges that we received I think they're using like a similar solvent free filler pretty sure now it's ripping brah brah it's ripping oh yeah it's pretty good it's pretty good I cannot tell you guys if it has THC or not in it I I can't offer the life let me tell you I would like to tell you that it doesn't and that I am smoking a pure beta Mersin and that this is simply the the effect of that because it almost feels a little different from a high when I take a big hit of this and I take a big hit of weed the high sit separately from each other if you know what I'm saying like one of them I like I know is like weed and on the other once it's like distantly in the back affectingly me very differently I don't know I wish they would get back to me on Instagram yo I hate when companies are like secretive about their process and like the products that they're giving you I'm literally [ __ ] smoking this and putting it in my lungs how about you [ __ ] tell me what's in this bro like people who make food have to literally list ingredients legally and that people who have these [ __ ] smokeable products don't even have to [ __ ] lab test it or anything it's crazy it was like a graphic the other day going around a mean and it was a I don't know the character name he's like a famous like character actor he has a curly hair he's like blonde and it's like um you have you notice you ever noticed how there's no more powdery mildew anymore ever since everybody to learn how to make concentrates and it was like like that [ __ ] like man you never know what you're putting into your lungs anymore you know like they could just take any weed they want run it and it just looks golden and good you know and unless it actually gets tested by a lab or something I'm not gonna know if it's safe or not to smoke so I hate when companies are like [ __ ] shady about [ __ ] like [ __ ] tell me bro like what the [ __ ] like I'm gonna go steal your process and whatever like as if there are like 10 other companies do right now how about you just be honest with your consumer base and let them know what they're literally smoking bro what strain is in this what am i even smoking is this even weed these are my questions I think they're fair I don't know but it's pretty far I ask these questions I semi complain but also smoke it also smoking I purposely did this one just so that I know I knew that I wouldn't necessarily waste the weed as much because I feel like big cartridges are more efficient than like dabbing like when you dab you just some of it burns away maybe it's too high temp of a dab like you're literally electronically controlling the temperature with the vaporizer so I feel like it's more efficient and what was my point with that right I wanted a lot of smoke because I'm actually doing a product shoot over there and I'm actually doing shots where like there's products all laid out and then I blow smoke and like smoke comes into the frame and like you know [ __ ] high production [ __ ] and it's actually been really hard to make like volumous smoke I literally that's why I have the illa Delft over here I was gonna pack a bomb hit for the shoot because I've tried vaping I've tried using is it here I tried using the dryer vape and I even tried taking a DAB and unless I took like a huge dab I couldn't get a significant volume of smoke so like look impressive enough on the screen so I have to pack some flowers bro into the old illy and start ripping I thought this would be it but it makes clouds but now I mean look at the size difference I mean if this made clouds this big I'd be scared like what is in this what witchcraft did they like make this with some make it do that but still pretty fire I'm gonna go get the weed pack up a bowl and I'll see you guys next time on the daily grind thank you guys for joining me and let me know what you guys are smoking on in the comments man you guys rocking a vape pen vape cartridge have you ever refilled one of these before do you make your own eliquid I think a couple of followers have mentioned in the past that they do their own like pg/vg mix or some [ __ ] like let me know in the comments I am really new to the whole vaping world so I am very curious to hear what people's personal preferences are particularly after they've had a consistent career token it up contouring on the vape level you know what I'm saying I'll see you guys next time stay regularly", "zNT8Zo_sfwo": "hey you feeling rough week really and the best way to take it is to put it under your tongue and rub it in you cheat don't do too much even the asleep on all that then you know you should do no don't try to communicate just relax see what happens we know from animal experiments that the endogenous cannabinoid system is very important in regulating motor activity that very type of activity that is impaired in Parkinson's disease from animal experiments we also know that boosting certain branches of the endocannabinoid system is helpful in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's finally from anecdotal information we know that certain patients who smoke marijuana experience relief of their symptoms I think you're calm down amazing he used just a single drop and his hands afterwards were rock steady and the dyskinesia left I bet it works most of the time oh did you guys see much oh yeah like we could really easy I wanna yeah please pretty angry that thank you my home state the number one frustration that I have is knowing that there is this untapped potential comes from what marijuana state is teaching us to generate new medicines and being stuck because of financial issues or politically issues that is extremely frustrating we now know that medical marijuana controls dyskinesia and yet it's not it's not available to us", "LrQfGr8yGWE": "welcome in this video I will explain what you can use cannabis oil for how you can use it and what the benefits are of cannabis oil made in cold methods furthermore I will explain briefly how I came to this method cannabis oil can be used for many projects such as cancer skin problems patents on digestive problems rejuvenation of bones and even your brain cells to name a few for skin conditions like eczema or skin inflammations or skin cancer the use of cannabis can be very effective and very soothing to for people with cancer the use of cannabis oil is very beneficial and ensures that our body can relax and it gets the ability to heal itself in addition it is a pain killer in his entire inflammatory it strengthens your immune system and has an anti-tumor effect it reduces the damage the femur therapy can cause to the nerves and brings the body in a more balanced state in the case of colon cancer laboratory studies show that it really works with lung cancer the sputum production will decrease and it prevents choking cold oil is highly recommended for Parkinson projects the raw oil has many active ingredients that are very beneficial to Parkinson when taken regularly this effect is also noticeable when ingesting Cokely obtained juice from the leaves of the cannabis plant how to use cannabis oil the application of cannabis oil can be done in a number of ways for two are the most efficient the one is on the skin and the second one is under the tongue the oil can be rubbed in daily on the affected area like a kind of ointment it's best to dilute the wheat paste with castor oil instead of other oils in the preparation process because castor oil is a bit thicker and easier to apply and it helps the wheat oil to pet deeper into the skin in the case of any other conditions the cannabis oil is taken orally you can do this in front of a mirror so you can see easily how many drops you take then drop the oil under the tongue and leave it there for a couple of minutes before swallowing it this is done because under the tongue the oil is absorbed by the body much quicker the dosage it's advisable to take the oil every day and to continue the treatment for as long as possible for paint projects it's convenient to take the oil every few hours to keep the analgesic effect constant when it comes to treating a tumor or preventing a cancer from coming back it's enough to take the oil once a day because every oil has a different strength it's very useful to test your daily dose with every new obtained bottle of oil you can do it very easily by taking for example three drops and the next day take four drops build it up slowly every day with one drop until you get slightly high if you're slightly high you know you have to take one or two drops less to set your dose if you become very stoned during this process it's best to relax and enjoy it the effect will decrease sometime the advantage of cannabis oil made on occult meth is compared to the heat of method cannabis contains at least 200 different potentially active medical ingredients other than THC and CBD because there's little research done about these ingredients there's also little known but what we do know is when heating it a lot of it will be lost this inspired me to do a little research on cannabis oil made in a cold method the most common cannabis oil is made with the use of heat this process is called decarboxylation and ensures that the THC acids are converted THC the THC and CBD strongly stimulate the cannabinoid receptors that are naturally present in our body these receptors activate human system and heal the body an additional effect is that the intoxicating effect of the oil is strengthened and therefore more suitable as an anesthetic painkiller in cannabis oil that is made without heating air the assets from the THC are preserved as well as all the other ingredients that are present in the plant the THC acids have a similar effect as the family let alone Aveda the pe\u00f1a from our body which is a balanced riparian molecule this molecule provides an analgesic and and diplomat ory effect it has a positive effect on the immune modulation of our body and takes very effective role in protecting the nerves in chemotherapy the pe\u00f1a itself is also stimulated by the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience in the use of unheated cannabis oil my personal experience with the use of cold oil is that it works very well it keeps and makes the body healthy if you want a stronger effect you can even use to both oils at the same time because they work in a completely different way I hope this video has given you more clarity about the use of cannabis oil if you have more questions you can use the comments or go to my website feel Ofcom thank you for watching you [Music]", "g7bApQhA1H8": "on today's video I'm going to teach you how to make cannabis infused butter or oil in the instant pot so we're gonna talk about why to use an instant pot how to do it I'm gonna give you a quick demonstration as well and then just so you know the instructions for this recipe are printed below so you don't have to write anything down hi my name is Andrea hard I'm a cannabis coach and educator and I post new videos here every Saturday morning I also offer private consultations over the phone in-person workshops around the London Ontario area and online classes from the comfort of your own home okay let's talk about why we use an instant pot well this is the number one advantage the instant pot internal temperature gets to 242 degrees Fahrenheit which is literally perfect for D carving and infusing and it's a nice constant steady temperature so you don't have to worry about fluctuations it also makes it so that it's really not all that smelly at all infusing in your instant pot in a mason jar is way less alerting to your neighbors then doing it say on the stovetop or in a crock pot and it is crazy quick this is why people love the instant pot or any kind of pressure cooker in general is because it makes things really fast the first step in the process is to deke our beer cannabis and that turns your THCA and cbda into THC and CBD which is what you want you don't have to grind it first you're just gonna put it into a mason jar close it up finger tight and put that into a bath in the instant pot where the bath water is about halfway up the jar so if your jars halfway full make sure that the water is halfway up the jar as well and you're gonna set it to 40 minutes on manual then let it release for 10 minutes natural pressure release and then release the rest of it pressure yourself and you have d carb cannabis in a flash you don't have to infuse this cannabis you could just use this d carb cannabis as a sprinkle on top of spaghetti or you could put it into capsules the point is you could use it right now as a ste carb you don't have to infuse but if you want to the instant pot is great for that as well so now you're gonna lightly grind the bud you're not trying to make it into powder you're just trying increase the surface area slightly add in your oil or butter make sure that it's melted first and make sure that there's at least of enough liquid to cover the cannabis that you have in there the more liquid you add the less potent your infusion will be then put that mason jar back in the instant pot and it's a little bath for 40 minutes on manual again ten minutes natural pressure release then open it up and strain it or not and you have cannabis infused oil or butter which is amazing super fast much much faster than any other way as for storage you can keep your your all of your abusers always in a dark and cool place butter should be kept in the fridge or freezer and coconut oil could be kept on the counter or also in the fridge the great thing about infusing cannabis into oil or butter is that it allows the cannabis to last for so much longer it doesn't degrade once it's infused into an infusion as for dosing there's no real precise way to find out exactly what's in your infusion unless you have it lab tested but for the home cook I have a little solution for you so this infusion calculator allows you to put in the information that you know about your cannabis and it will spit out how many milligrams of THC or CBD are in your infusion so I'm going to show that to you now this is at the wake-and-bake website and if you haven't been here before you should definitely check it out it's amazing so if you know the THC percentage of your plant material you can type it in because you have lab tested cannabis if you don't you can go to a site like Leafly and type in the strain name and get a general idea so you type in how many grams that you're gonna be using for my infusion that we're gonna do today I'm doing 14 grams into one cup of oil so I know that with my cannabis I'm gonna have 20 100 grams of THC and not very much of CBD and that in each teaspoon I have about 43 milligrams of THC so that's really helpful for me to have an idea of how potent my infusion is again this is not perfect there's lots and lots of variables to go on there but it's a great starting point and even if you have used the dosing calculator it is still really important that you start low and go slow and be your own guinea pig each infusion that you make might be slightly different and you don't want to have a really bad experience because you're going off of what you think will happen so I encourage you to keep a consumption journal and write down how does it make you feel how did you feel before you took it how long does it last keep all that in mind and that will help you really homey and Nona how potent your infusion is all right so let's get started I have here coconut oil you couldn't view this infuse this into butter or any kind of oil that you wanted but I'm going to use coconut oil this is sunflower lecithin we'll talk about this after this is bendy car and here I have my 14 grams of cannabis I'm gonna put this into its little water back in here again you want to make sure that the water in the pot is at least enough to cover what you have in the dark put the lid on and set the timer for 40 minutes and then walk away I'll see you in a bit as you can see my D carving is done it's already done about 10 minutes of natural pressure release and I'm gonna just let the rest of the pressure out open it up alright so I have some perfectly he D card to cannabis in here super hot careful when you're opening this so um D carbon cannabis will be a little bit browner than when you put it in your don't smell a little bit different once your cannabis is cooled off you're going to grind it up I have a coffee grinder here I have a separate coffee grinder for coffee or that would make for some very interesting morning the great thing about this method is that you can do it all in one meter so you're just gonna put this back in your mason jar then I have a cup of coconut oil that I've warmed up in the microwave first I'm also putting in a teaspoon of sunflower lecithin this helps to emulsify the mixture so that the cannabinoids don't separate from the oil it also helps the cannabinoids to enter your blood-brain barrier a little bit more quickly so it doesn't actually make it more potent but it does help to make it feel like it's working a little bit better however so I'm flower lecithin tastes like crap and you know I really hate it so I only had a teaspoon most people recommend a tablespoon to two tablespoons per cup but I recommend that you start low with that inserts and go slow and see how it goes for you then you just put it back in your jar and shake it up back in the instant pot before another bath of 40 minutes on manual and then we'll be done I've got my infused cannabis oil here you can now strain this using a cheesecloth make sure that you really squeeze the cheesecloth to get all the beautiful camera soil out you can then take that cheesecloth and dunk it in a tea and a pot of chai and then you can have some high chives there's still some medicinal benefit left in even the satchel of spent cannabis material but with this one I'm not even gonna strain it I started to add my unstrained cannabis oils and butters right into my baked goods and nobody seems to notice I'm gonna make this into cannabis infused protein bites and that would be next week's video all right if you have any questions I am super happy to answer them just leave them in the comment section down below and are you following me on Facebook and Instagram I really hope you do the links are below I post daily cannabis education there every day and if you head to my website reveal cannabis column you will be send some free stuff like an awesome recipe book and a video that teaches you how to get started with cannabis so why not head over there now until then I will see you next week", "UOHqixhs_Hs": "come on come on do you go do you like sweet baby boy alright we'll go after hi welcome to Angel's anything show thanks for coming on over it's good to see you today is a very special episode because I am gonna go through some items in this beautiful box that was not sent to me I picked it up nobody sent nobody sent anything in the mail but this beautiful box that I procured and I'm just gonna get into with you look I'm not saying if you want to get on my good side you have to help me acquire marijuana cannabis products but look it doesn't hurt I'm totally kidding basically um there's this couple out of Maine that follow my channel I think they may be found me from this jarred jam music festival review I did or something anyway New England fam we sing together especially fish fam or just jam band fam you guys know what to do they started following me on like Facebook I think um and then I started following them on Instagram and I saw that they have this THC CBD confectionary situation going on I picture it like them living on this big piece of land in Maine and just like in their sugar shack like the making of the candies but I don't know and then I shouted him out in my end of your vid I forget exactly what I said there's this really cool couple at watch that live in Maine and they make like CBD [ __ ] candies if you ever want me to review any of those for you on the channel like I'm happy to and they hit me up shortly thereafter saying that they had some stuff that they wanted me to try so I was very excited and also that was happening when I was going through my dry spell like a week ago that you guys saw and it was like it was like water in a desert you know what I got this box instantly I was like wow look at this this effort put in now if you're not hip to the scene you wouldn't know that this is a fish kind of a fish pattern the drummer always wears a dress with the same pattern but that's not even the coolest part looked underneath how cool when I saw how cool the outside of the box was I knew the inside can only cooler and it was now I already ate quite a bit of what was in here so I can't review everything but they wrote a very sweet note in the box which I was very touched by Oh see you the only one is left these are the three two one THC CBD fruit punch now these these are the three two one CBD to THC now I am not sure how many milligrams any of this stuff is but I always just say there was only one way to know you know you throw down the hatch so I'm gonna do one of these because I'm going out a little bit later and I just you know why are you relaxed my life is very stressful mmm you know the candy itself is very delicious I'm tasting a little coconut oil base am I wrong very good not it's like sweet and tasty but not like gross you know nice green apple flavor like I'm not [ __ ] candy connoisseur rouse them and this was tasty too and okay they sent to Wally's lollies they sent to lollipops I ate those as soon as they send them I had one oh my god half an hour later I just felt like there was like a warm wrap around my skull I was like I feel [ __ ] good a minute slowly faded away and I didn't feel tired afterwards I didn't feel tired at all so I said bucket if one was a gun second one's gonna get had that same thing happened oh yeah that's something I noticed with the other candy - it's like you feel high but like everything feels like it just feels like a warm blanket you know it's nice now the store which I didn't even mention the name of the store the store is called High Times confection they're on Instagram I'll link it below check it out even if you just like looking at pictures of delicious weed candy which I'm a fan of if you like to torture yourself because apparently South Dakota is gonna legalize weed before New Hampshire of course I'm a legal cannabis patient so naturally naturally and 21 plus 21 plus ok so this is hemp CBD one to oneself I think you say solve just most like nice lotion I used once I don't know if it's supposed to be like a pain relieving or just like a nice lotion if you guys want to let me know ok so I've saved the best thing for last this is a two to one THC CBD suppository and each depository is 20 milligrams of THC and 10 milligrams of CBD so pretty nice a suppository you don't know goes either up the ass or up the vagina I was thinking this would be fantastic for cramps and then I had a horrible cramps the other day and I got to tell you the last thing I felt like doing was sticking Li hand of a bloodied vagina so I I just was like it was a war zone down there so I stayed away I mean I put a tampon that was about it there was no room for anything else dan and I are doing the float tomorrow night and I thought Oh like the sleep perfect I'll do the suppository I'll go to the float I'll be nice and high and then I'll report back do a little bit of a product review is but I need your help guys I need your help should I put this up the V or the V and I'm gonna post on Instagram now asking you and I'm gonna have you boat and then whatever you vote is what I'll do and this is how you really need to be following my Instagram for this type of content okay it's the next day and the results are in actually the results were very mixed a lot of people said but a lot of people said vag a lot of people said why not both actually that was like the most popular answer so I went with the but for now but then maybe in the future we can drive the vagina okay so anyway we are heading to a float I'm going back to NH folks and I inserted the suppository I don't know it was hard like it wasn't in an actual pill so I like you know I don't know but I washed my hands with soap after so hopefully that's you know I don't want to contaminate the tank okay so I'll let you know how it goes I know you're not supposed to get like super header high more of a body high but this should be perfect for the float so we'll see all right guys we're post float post depository I'm super relaxed no obviously that's partially because of the float but I will say that once I like got into the tank whatever I was really easily able to kind of just slip into a relaxation and fall asleep and it was maybe one of the best naps I've had in the tank since I started floating the suppository insertion like I think I need to get a little more clarity on that I'm assuming I don't put like the actual plastic inside I feel like that'd be a bad idea but I think I need to get a little more precise like with placement and squeeze through technique but I'm gonna do it of the V next time because I think it would be so good for cramps but I'm feeling a super great super relaxed and gonna go home and make another meal delivery kit which you'll be seeing all about that soon so okay guys thank you for watching this episode of and slating show see you next time goodbye a lot of you wanted me to put it in the B some of you wanted me to put it in the B and the rest you wanted me to put it in the BMV I probably will cut some of this out but",

out you have the unit inside you also have a cartridge that comes in the top and then you have a USB cord I don't know where to [ __ ] USB cord is I got so many of these [ __ ] around I would have grabbed one and it definitely probably would have been the wrong one so if you mad that I don't have the actual cord that comes with it [ __ ] Oh eat all of them work any mini USB micro USB is going work okay so you're good with whichever one you use so at the end of the day those are the three things that come inside of the box let's see what else do we have okay let me show you guys the cartridge excellent so with the cartridge had to come with this plastic over here and down at the bottom so that it covers up the part that connects to the actual unit itself to make sure if that doesn't be damaged I'm sure and then at the top it has something covering the actual holes for the mouthpiece to make sure nothing gets stuck in there probably so you don't inhale some [ __ ] and then it's something already caught in there you know so that's probably what that's there for now this is a 1 gram cartridge on the site right here is how you actually fill the cartridge yeah you can see that so on your side is where you can fill it so I just held mine just right here and it was very easy to fill to be honest actually I didn't even have a syringe when I filled mine I used a dropper because I didn't have a syringe and it was still fairly easy to fill and I have had absolutely zero leakage issues with this so I'm really impressed with this I've gone through the cartridges so far and I've had no leakage so this is the third one that I made I made some silver pearl big truths if you want how to make your own Pig just check out the link and you'll know how to make your own big juice but I use this to do it okay so let me show you what the unit the unit is pretty thin I really like it I mean it's it's not too big at all it just fits in the pocket very easy it's not heavy so that's pretty dope you know you got a connection when you put it in and it snaps and you see the light so that so then I'm sure you guys heard the click so that's how you know that works and then on the side on this side you have an aircard okay so you hit it that's how you activate it if you inhale without your finger or your thumb or something on the air carb it's not you're not gonna get a hit you have to have your finger on the air carb just to get it okay so let's go on and show you guys how this works I'm gonna take my empty one out because obviously I'm not gonna get really anything out of that take off the little rubber dinghies and it says before you actually use the new cartridge to prime it it says to prime it you inhale in the cartridge about three to five times so that's what I'm gonna do because it says if you don't just gonna make it hard to get a good hit all right so I don't know that was five or six behemoths so put it in here you'll see the light okay and so how you do is put the finger cuz like see like if I have my finger over to aircar you get nothing so when I cover it get so I really like this because I'm able to get a very good taste off of my vape that I was able to make and it's very very sleek and very discreet and I can fill this up with whatever I want I can have my own Fulton ship to be able to smoke out of and my own unit and I don't have to be stuck with the 510 cartridges or whatever batteries I can find it fit bills I like this a lot so the only downfall that this has to me is depending on what type of smoker you are this has you know three holes on there I'm not sure if you guys can see that yeah there's three holes in there so you get a whole lot of vapor which means your cartridge goes down [ __ ] quick but if you're making it at home on your own like I do where it says THC especially if it's like cigarette juice or something like that I guess you would be good I don't do cigarette juice so I don't know how often that you know you really feel for something like that but if you're using this with THC or CBD juice it does have big holes so your cartridge will go down quicker so always keep that in mind but outside of that I honestly really do like this that's the only thing I could think of that's the downfall on it I think I've told you guys it charges down from the bottom but I think that's about it I don't think there's anything else that really needs to be covered on that but I think it's pretty good product like I say I got mine on small cart tail so shout out some small cartel shout out the candy pen for making it Ruby it's easy MA I think this is a pretty good write-up so I'm a highlight you guys a little bit later just remember subscribe hit the D so you can get a notification anytime I pull something I will see you guys in a little bit keep the peace going love each other I'm out we in the jungle smoking we in a jungle smoking legal", "ohMeUJPyRiQ": "I'm dr. Jason MacDougall I'm a professor of honestly 0 del University and I also too committee at the arthritis Society so cannabis is my family of hem the hem family and marijuana is pretty much the same thing it's just more of a slang term so we prefer to adhere to the scientific naming of cannabis cannabinoid is a hammock it's found within the plant the cannabis plant and it can also be a chemical that mimics the cannabis plant so it could be man-made or it could be naturally occurring in our bodies so they're actually three different types of cannabinoid there are the fatal cannabinoids which are the ones that are found within the cannabis plant the synthetic cannabinoids which are the man-made chemicals the pharmaceutical preparations and then they're the endocannabinoids which are the naturally occurring cannabis like compounds that a caramel produced in our bodies there were many active Cannabis the two most well known ones are THC and CBD THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol and that's the psychoactive component of cannabis CBD is cannabidiol and that has been shown to be effective at controlling pain and inflammation and but it doesn't have the psychoactive properties the same way that THC does so medical cannabis is the cannabis that's prescribed by your doctor and could be an either the herbal form either a synthetic form and there's some evidence to show that it can be effective in alleviating arthritis pain as well as inflammation and fatigue different ways of administering cannabis can be either smoked or ingested in oral form baked into cookies or produced in the oil of butters but they're also synthetic cannabinoids that can be taken as a tablet or as a spray underneath the tongue different strains of cannabis different types of cannabis and they vary and the amount of THC and CBD that they contain and it's important to know that because they may have different impacts in various populations of patients we'll just like any drug there are a number of different side effects associated with cannabis and so it may not be appropriate for all arthritis patients so we really really need more research try and understand the safety profile of the different strains of cannabis there's been a lot of experimental evidence to show that cannabis can be effective in treating the pains of arthritis as well as the inflammation and helping with fatigue but we really need more clinical studies to try and understand benefits and potential limitations of using cannabis so further research into medical cannabis is required so we can understand the different subpopulations of patients who may be responsive to medical cannabis we need to find out the effective dose of medical cannabis some of the interactions with other drugs as well as looking at different delivery systems you", "wdkZnx4hH34": "Gabriel your guardian her partner still works cannabis refinery and condors premium distribution we founded the company around our core values of

true flower vape cups these are from true leave I haven't gotten these in a while but uh I decided to go ahead and give them a try again these are $45 apiece I got a 10% discount so it's like what forty one fifty or something like that 40 50 maybe yeah so uh let's get them moving up and see what they will I guess we'll take a look at the THC is 19.6% THC 0.3% CBG pop it open there's a little jar in here and that is where you will find the cups the cups you say yeah the cups so first we got this cardboard box and here is our the cups inside the jar cups inside a jar you say yes cups inside a jar but why I don't know don't ask me wow these smells so good though man this whole I just want to keep my nose just like yeah just keep my keep that right under my nose all day long man it smells so good smells Jack Herer to me it's kind of a hard smell to explain it's a little bit woody not like a piney but more like woodshop kind of woody maybe like think of sawing through plywood or something and but it's like this sweet and perfumey version of that you know it's really nice I love Jack Herer one of my favorites for sure so well I guess we got to get into here somehow let's see what we can do here well that's interesting they're in these cups right what do you do with these cups mmm we'll see maybe I can fit him in my vaporizer you think I can fit these cups in my vaporizer oh man these cups don't fit my vaporizer or maybe they fit in this vaporizer I'll see if they fit in this vaporizer no these don't fit in this vaporizer either dang huh I wonder what I'm gonna do I have vaporizers I even have another vaporizer I tried it on that one before and it didn't work on that one either so that's three vaporizers that it doesn't fit wait a minute are these medical marijuana eggs do we have like medical marijuana chickens is that what it is I think that could be its medical marijuana chickens and they have to they have to hatch so wait a minute well then what do you how do you how do you use medical marijuana chickens I can only vaporize cannabis flowers dang do something I mean this is my medicine right it's medical marijuana I should be able to use it so I guess I'll get a block of wood and we'll just fix it well wait wait first let me do a little comparison here here we have unsmoked will vaporize above marijuana smoke can only be vaporized and here we have some smokeable marijuana this can be smoked and vaporized let's see what the difference is well this stuff looks like brown and green chunks it looks like something that naturally grew on a plant hey it looks like cannabis wow that's nice but this this is unsmoked you cannot smoke vaporize of all cannabis nope the problem is that this kind of cannabis is locked inside a layer of thir idiom and it's there's ancient mines that we have near the lime pit quarries and they're often you know hidden from view so nobody will find them but yeah it's hidden with it's filled with Floridian deposits and if you crack open the Floridian what's inside is medical marijuana you see that's how that works but there's some things you got to know about it you see marijuana unlike many other things is not fungible you see you can't mix these they're immiscible they will not mix together even if you try C you can't mix you can't they won't go together you can't mix them let's try it on a little bowl salad in there mix them up nope you see that they won't they won't combine so I don't know what to do I think my medical marijuana is broken should I call truly even ask him what happened to my medical marijuana dang well since this doesn't fit in my vape and it's locked inside of Flor idiom which is immiscible with any other form of cannabis yeah it doesn't even work right if you tried to burn this stuff you would probably it your house would self-destruct I think like that's how it works it's like a bit of a safety precaution all right let's let's get this thing open so here's how you have to do it just I was taught this by my a miner from Central Florida he's been mining Floridian his entire life he's even got a secret deposit on his own family property he won't tell anybody about but he took me to it and he showed me this technique so you take the mining hatchet this has got to be a mining hatchet in particular and you just go like that well you know here let's try this side there we go aha and now see this right here boys this is medical marijuana it's not like regular medical marijuana though nope this is vaporizer bull medical marijuana it can't be burned there's no way to do it it's impossible just like the same thing it won't even mix if you even try to mix it with another form of marijuana immediately they'll both disappear like they're into another vortex kind of thing there's a dimension portal that will spawn in that event and believe me it's all over quick you're not gonna get anywhere with that method so don't try to mix them now as you can see I can now break it down into smaller pieces it will fit hey that makes a lot of sense doesn't it so there's the inside of a Floridian nugget you can see the crystallization that has occurred on the interior let's give the the interior of the Floridian nugget a nice smell oh yeah and the smell is even stronger outside of the encasement of Floridian that's why you got to crack it open release the essence of the medical marijuana all right now I can vape it so let's get some of this cut up oh you know what I forgot to do I almost forgot to open every one of them and then weigh them so let me do that all right let's open this one up took a crack I'm going to use this I don't know any minor songs so I'll just sing a railroad building song hey you know it's good for your health probably that that's probably good for your health isn't it oh boy probably a good thing I'm going to press most of this then huh well look at it man it is covered oh it's covered in little tiny pieces of oh man what are they gonna do to my medical marriage alone why are you going to do that total medical marriage of Wow mmm I just put that in there and bust open the next one and last but certainly not least another tip he told me is got to be very careful because a lot of medical marijuana miners there is a significant percentage of medical marijuana miners who have lost their fingers now look you think I'm joking right here I'll use that book you think I'm joking you better be careful I tell you what see dang I mean this is ridiculous Floridian shooting across my damn kitchen come on now I got Floridian shooting across my kitchen I got this medical marijuana crystals from the inside of the Floridian nugget I'll tell you what they should find a use for that Floridian stuff it's pretty hard so there you go that's the the Floridian deposit and that's the outside casing of it let's get rid of that stuff and here we have all 3.5 grams of the medical marijuana let's get it weighed up and see what we got at that three-point-nine but you know what there's a little nugget of Floridian in my medical marijuana I got well Floridian chard that's better you want to get all that flaw ready I'm out of here medical marijuana because it wasn't meant to be inhaled or anything like that oh okay you see that right there no I dropped it I guess it was another little shard of iridium get the rest of them out of here alright now let's weigh it 3.9 so I guess the floor idiom is pretty lightweight too alright so that is a really great deal there 3.9 instead of 3.5 I'm liking it especially because you know some places like to cut it closely three boys farm one plant I got some multiple three point four is out of that batch that I bought luckily I know how to press rosin because then it'll filter out all those tiny little shards that happened but you know this is this isn't right you know that's not who thought of this that's not right dang it right at all iridium mine in Floridian nobody ever told me that there were Floridian mines I could have been mine in my whole life but here we are you know seems like they've been keeping it a secret for years and years and years",

symptoms mark then found that by grinding marijuana buds and heating them to 410 degrees Fahrenheit it created an immediate rescue response to his Donner's most violent behavior and by 10 she's usually back out here enjoying annoying life again for several years we were in fear of using it trying it giving it to her having it but now there is no fear for those artless who risked everything by posting the video of mark illegally treating Kara that more than 12,000 people have seen and by talking to us I just I got to the point where we looked at the law and said the law is not going to change unless somebody Gamble's in his post mark asks the Texans call their state senators demanding a public hearing on Senate bill 269 it would expand the access of patients with debilitating illnesses to use medical marijuana for Kara that law could make moments of calm come legally and if showing what works for her puts mark in jail so be it [Music] just saying if we want to make a

everybody this is jason wilson with the curious about canvas podcast thanks so much for tuning in once again so today i am really excited to finally be crossing paths with somebody who has also been in the cannabis testing world and extraction world product uh manufacturing standardization world um i'm here with dr jeff raber jeff thanks so much for being willing to come on the podcast today thanks for having me jason pleasure to be here absolutely yeah and for those that are listening that um aren't familiar with your background there's quite a lot we can go into because the workshop's been around since uh 2010 is that right correct yeah yeah do you mind sharing a little bit about um how you got into the world of cannabis testing and and studying the uh biochemistry of the cannabis plant and all of those awesome nuances sure sure happy to do so i was the end of 2008 my brother was working at a construction company and realized they were actually building a storefront dispensary in orange county california he comes home and says i think this is the place where they're going to sell you know marijuana i said that cannot be legal i have no idea what you're doing are you sure he said yeah they called it medicine and they said that there are medical laws for that so that really piqued my interest i had been working in drug discovery drug development and fine chemical manufacturing i'm working with new continuous flow technology tools to produce fine chemical intermediates at scale in efficient manners so we could manufacture in the um and you know he says it's medicine and i'm like well that's very interesting i go and look through the library go all over the internet and find out that there is immense medical potential for cannabinoids to impact this endocannabinoid system in my graduate career i worked on a classic compounds called the toxins and when you look at arachidonic acid it forms lopoxins leukotrienes and endocannabinoids so i didn't know about the third leg of the stool there but you know learned about it through this self-research if you will and thought what a tremendous amount of utility that could come from this plant if we are to look at it the right way harness all of its potential and really we could develop a ton of non-psychoactive utility as well because what had been happening as it was illegal and suppressed was everything was kind of geared towards fundamental you know one type of detection which would be physiologically psychoactive but what if we drove it towards other molecules or other uses because we could look at it from an analytical or molecular perspective if you will so beginning of 2009 president obama's on cnn says i'm going after drug trafficking organizations not medical patients i found that as the entrepreneurial green light i had my own medical needs and interests i had walked around the dispensaries long enough to see a tremendous amount of people could be helped but nobody would understand which product was right for them or what they were really getting couldn't understand dosing and also there's a product supply chain kind of purity problem what else is going along with the products right pesticides mold other types of contaminants so at that point it was pretty clear leverage your chemistry and scientific background and enter the you know the playing field if you will from a testing lab perspective because it should have low regulatory risks a high barrier to entry and could offer a tremendous amount of social benefit by understanding what we have in our hands and how to best utilize it so that was what we did and we opened our doors in april um of 2010 and started testing medical cannabis in california mostly in the southern california area and number of years worked in solely in testing and were very frustrated with that as many people didn't want to voluntarily test you know it's a very difficult conversation to say please you know spend fifty dollars to just know how much you have in your brownie when you're selling you know over a thousand brownies if you will um that the economics were pretty astounding at that point that people still wouldn't want to spend fifty dollars to help put a proper label on things um we eventually get through to them saying you haven't fully decarboxylated if you wanted to utilize all your oil the best way here's how you could maximize your you know effectiveness and stretch it out into two thousand brownies instead of the thousand that you made oh well i could double my money here's your fifty dollars sir really you know that economic argument kind of started to grab a little bit of attention um and in 2011 we saw the very big importance for testing terpenes right by the end of 10 we said why all these chromatograms for cannabinoids look highly similar they're almost identical but they smell different taste different and are driving different effects what's the differences here must be something relating to these terpene components and in 2011 we began testing for terpenes and gave it away for six months just so everybody could see the importance and utility of it putting it on labels sharing the information and starting the conversation of hey it's not only this you know amount of thc or even cbd that might be good for me but these other molecules really drive important decisions on what might be the best medicine for me um the testing was a challenge it still is a challenge today even a more difficult one perhaps but we started to leverage more of our background in manufacturing sciences and offering contract manufacturing services so understanding extraction methodologies how to do them with or without solvents how to make high-purity cannabinoids so that you could use them as ingredients and coupling that with our terpene-based information to create cannabis compositions that are standardized and consistent and that kind of fast forwards to today we offer licensing of intellectual property know-how and all sorts of tools that we have in our suite and offer it to people across the country in many different states to help them lay out their manufacturing facility choose the right extraction methodologies for them develop the procedures train the staffing and license um all of those pieces to them on an ongoing basis where we act as like the scientific support staff so we've got the core of scientists that know all the ins and outs of manufacturing efficiently testing through all the regulatory hoops and then how to create a great product that's consistent with the accurate label at the end yeah that's yeah that's really awesome and the the parallels between your work and sort of my professional path are so similar it's kind of funny because to back up a little bit going to the the cannabis testing stuff um when i got into cannabis testing in oregon it was right when uh testing became required under the medical program there okay um but it wasn't uh it wasn't really heavily regulated uh there weren't a lot of requirements on what can be tested or what yeah so so this uh this wasn't it cannabinoids and if you had mold was that where it started yeah it was cannabinoids mold and then there was a pesticide requirement but it was they just identified four broad classes of pesticides and no specific pesticides listed under those classes so you had you had some labs that were testing like one pesticide under each class and then like our lab we were we were just kind of thinking about a little differently so we just found a lab that specialized in pesticide testing and collaborated with them and so we had panels of like 300 pesticides and nobody wanted that panel at all [Laughter] and and there's these weird dynamics that i think a lot of people in the industry it's hard to appreciate unless you're a scientist trying to do some of this work when you come in especially if you're used to highly regulated environments and quality controls and uh you know iso and all these different things you come in and you're like all right i'm ready to do high quality analytical work and really you know drive you know science uh education and research in this field and then you start to find out most people really just want to get high thc numbers and they don't really want to know about their pesticides and the products and it became this this battle for years of trying to get people to value what you're trying to do and it sounds like you you ran into that yourself oh yeah yeah they didn't value accuracy or being able to find those problematic contaminants they said here's the sample give me a 30 thc test result like i don't think that's how this is supposed to work i'm supposed to tell you what you have not you dictate what the you know what the results are um and unfortunately you know there's still a lot of that going along and still a lot of that where they lab shop to try and get the you know highest thc number and i think the public is wising up to understanding it's not only about that it's about more than just one cannabinoid it's about you know all the composition that's there and if i have a lot of one that means i have next to none of the others so you know i think we'll start to see that correct itself it's taken a lot longer than i would have thought and regulations have made it really difficult to be a good lab um and you get punished for being accurate unfortunately so until they get out you know all the other bad actors it will you know be a little bit of a struggle for those who are really good operators unfortunately yeah absolutely and looking back to when you first started doing cannabis testing you know i mean the workshop was one of the earliest labs that i remember seeing come on the market because um this was stuff i was following before i actually got into the space to try to understand what people were doing and who's kind of leading that charge um did you start doing contaminant testing right away or did you primarily focus on um like potency and and chemical characterization our first decision was how do we quantify cannabinoids and we came out with an hplc when everybody else had only the gas chromatographs so it was a large education of what's this big giant word decarboxylation and what does that mean um you know the analysis is twice as difficult because you have all the cannabinoid acids and the neutral cannabinoids um the equipment was more expensive so you had to get more standards more expensive equipment but you had a much broader breadth of what you could test for and test more accurately right what exactly am i holding in my hand not what did my injector heat up and convert to other molecules and then tell me is there so if i have anything i'm going to orally consume i can't change it via temperature it's not going to work um so we made the tough decision let's go with the hplc first and we did cannabinoid profiling only after that we got some people to help us adopt a rapid testing method for microbiological contaminants so we had enough dispensaries that were going to be supportive of that effort that we could secure the equipment and do the rapid culturing techniques and then after that we moved to getting the gcfid and ms which allowed us to do pesticides and the terpene profiling so that was in the end of 2010 we did the microbio piece and in early 2011 we started the pesticides for just some basic pesticides with gcms and the terpene piece with gcfid so we've kind of evolved to getting all the pieces but out of the gate we started with cannabinoids well and that's that's common for pretty much most of the labs i've talked to and even in my own experience you've gotta and that's just how new businesses go to try to work your way up and build things out if you dive into the deep end too fast you can ruin a business um what did you notice early on when you started looking at pesticides and how have some of the contaminants that you've seen in canvas products changed over time because you've been looking and thinking about some of these things now for a decade yeah i think it was the first thing that we saw was it was really alarming so we saw the microbio piece and you're like okay so you know for the most part it's not too bad i think everybody could kind of select but you did see some of the samples we're like this is an entire microorganism party one in every class off the charts you're like oh my god like i don't want to touch that stuff in pesticides i think it was alarming that we were seeing tremendous amounts of plant growth regulators you know lots of things that would be maybe preemptively applied just so that there weren't things showing up rather than responding to a pest problem they just blasted the room and said i'll just overdo it to make sure i never see that show up because no one's gonna check and you know you show up with the ability to start to check and they're like oh wait someone said that i put that on here well that's not cool don't send it to those guys um it was alarming because we were seeing 70 plus percent of the products had something in them and we were not obviously testing a large percentage of the products but we were mostly given things that people thought were good right things that would have high potency numbers things that were coming from someone trusted if it's a voluntary test i'm going gonna spend my money on the ones that i think i'm gonna get a good label for and i'm gonna go verify it there were a few people that said i don't know this guy could you please check him out so that i can see if there's anything on here um so there was some of that too but the amount of prevalence that we saw was quite alarming and it led to our first publication when we said hey don't you want to do these types of tests you know the response was well why should i bother testing for pesticides is it really a problem if i combust the product and inhale it right are those things still there so that's a really fair accurate question why don't we go ahead and study that so we put some pesticides purposely on plant material we sent those through a mechanical lung system trapped them and captured them and saw that up to you know 60 to 70 percent of what was on the flower entered the airways so you were transferring a large amount of what's there into the the airway which could go directly into the bloodstream and it's very different perspective than eating someone some fruit we understand the toxicology of oral consumption of a lot of those but not via inhalation and i think that was you know a piece that we thought had to be done so we could help regulators understand this is a problem and here's some basis of information for why you might want to set action limits on what may or may not be allowed in the absence of any other information pertaining to inhalation of these things and it was i mean i think the lab testing job was kind of like the scary one and that you're like wow there's a lot of bad things out here i'm kind of glad i'm in this spot because i can filter through it and at least know what's good for you know me and my friends or those that we talk to in some respects but there are a lot of people being exposed to things that they really shouldn't be and there's this presumption of you know product quality and cleanliness when it's sitting on a shelf like i think there's just i assume as a consumer there's got to be you know somebody checking that this label is accurate and this product is okay for me but in cannabis like especially in the early days it was not so much the case we're better off now that we have regulations and some standards and they are requiring independent testing before it hits the product shelves um but if you're in a state where there's no mandatory testing it's still gonna be a very difficult game to get clean products i would say yeah i agree and and there's an interesting dynamic that has emerged even in the uh regulated states that have testing that now there's a consumer perception just like you said if you see it on a shelf you assume that it's safe now there's a presumption that if it's quote unquote tested it's safe with with a missing nuance of like well what was it tested for for and and what are the limitations to that too because there are things that we may not think about um that you know could also be problematic that get added to regulations later you know um it's an evolving game right and we saw the evolution of people put a lot of plant growth regulators and bad pesticides on the products regulations come out they adapted and adopted new methodologies and you you may see like the first harvest round if you will in a regulated system not quite make it and there's a lot of failures but they quickly change that and then make it you know through the next round and i think we've seen immense changes in a very good fashion to product quality and cleanliness where a lot of these things that were utilized on the plants during the agricultural efforts in the previous days are no longer applied and we don't see you know alarming amounts of plant growth regulators or a lot of pesticides so i think we have seen that correct itself to a great fashion um and some still learn the hard way or didn't know that they had a problem or it came from somewhere else you got to track it down that it was bad soil or the water table in some respects or overspray from their neighbor unfortunately um so those learnings have gone on and i think we've seen a great improvement in product quality now and cleanliness now to the point that you're making is this good for me well you know how much are you taking which one are you taking which way are you taking it and what all is in there um and i think you know last year with the the vape crisis and the valley scare it really alerted everyone to say hey these things might contain things that shouldn't be inhaled via these devices in this fashion now i can you know apply as much vitamin e acetate to my skin as i probably would like and it's not going to be a toxicology concern to a grave extent it's pretty fine it's going to become vitamin e and it will become acetic acid so vinegar and vitamin e and i think anybody has major problems with this break it down inside of a vape device where it can form a molecule called ketene which is highly reactive and can really react adversely with the lungs okay that's a very different problem so just because it was safe for you know topical use doesn't mean it's good and okay for inhalation use and that's kind of the point where we're at now we're like you know evolving our understanding we still have lack of toxicological understandings in these molecules and the fate of them via these devices based on how they're used in these types of formulations it's an exceptionally complex picture right and you can just see like you know regulators heads going like oh my god i can't believe we have to deal with this one next i thought we just figured out that the packaging had to be child proof you know it's you know i i didn't take chemistry in class and some of the in school some of these um state regulators are you know tax specialists or you know specialists in writing rules because they follow a process but not really because they understand science or detailed biochemistry toxicology and chemistry i mean it's a very technical piece and now i think the communities around everyone's trying to offer their perspective but in a regulator position it's very difficult to appreciate who's being honest for honesty's sake who's telling me accurate info why might they you know be you know saying one thing over another is it for their business or is it really because that's what they truly have data to support like this is not a harmful product this has been used so much and we do have kind of like ongoing running use right we have seen a lot of people consume cannabis we know when they've combusted these molecules inside of the plant it hasn't generated alarming problems or we'd have seen them by now so you know we can say we're not starting at zero but maybe we're starting only at like number one or two and we have to get to you know ten to a hundred we're not quite sure how far we have to go but we do have some info to kind of shape the best position today but i think the honest conversation is we don't know all those answers and they might be much more unsatisfactory or difficult for us to understand um but we're doing the best that we can you know given all that we can today yeah absolutely i mean we're really i mean this whole industry has been held back for so long there's a lot of catch-up that we're doing to even understand these different products that are being made and all of these little nuances these little differences and everything and and one thing i wanted to ask you going to another point that you made that as the regulations around cannabis testing evolve in different states you still have these bad actors that are producing inflated numbers or passing stuff this was a really big deal in washington not too long ago when they finally did an audit of the state system and realized that a lot of labs were not actually doing microbiological testing and stuff um what are some of those dynamics that are at play that are allowing some of these bad actors to continue operating that well they also had 40 percent uh thc numbers in the flowers in washington so yeah i think the analysis said hey this lab that's giving the highest thc value seems to have the majority of the market um is there a possible correlation here yeah yeah zero product failures like wait a minute um it's very difficult to do accurate what we would call round robin or ring testing with actual live samples on the laboratories so how has the regulator gone about trying to say this laboratory is technically competent and capable and able to do the task that we're asking them to do and are doing it right time and time and time again um you know there's two parts precision and accuracy so did i couple my arrows together and did i put them in the center of the target so i can have them all coupled together but they're like off the entire target and it looks like i'm doing fairly well because they're all coupled together all my results come out the same but i have a systematic error that made me miss the target i wouldn't know that unless i compared it against other labs it said wait a minute my arrows are going to the center of the target our numbers are wildly different so it started with you know emerald scientific ring testing but the where that started because of regulation and the federal illegalities wasn't here's your plant sample to go check it's here's a standard in a vial crack this open inject it and let's see what you get which is probably more of a calibration test than it is of an actual sample prep test and how you're going to go reporting the real samples that you're testing and amazingly in the beginning people couldn't even have their machines calibrated right so whether you were doing everything else right if you didn't have your machine calibrated right you still were getting wrong numbers and maybe even systematically wrong so i think finding ways of building much more solid ring testing scenarios with live samples where you know you've put these pesticides on and they can find it in the matrix where you know you know these groups have gotten the accurate potency numbers within reasonable standard deviations and lab accuracy limits and then blindly sending them samples when they don't know the ring test is coming would probably be you know a much better way of doing it and this is how other industries and mature industries operate you know across the board where you're and and good labs want that to be done like send the blind sample in i treat them all the same and if i'm off because something drifted and i didn't know it or some analyst was you know not following the procedures you know there's unfortunately still humans involved so there's going to be potential for error how can i know that it happened make sure it didn't happen set up systems to check that it's not happening or just getting verification that it's not happening to me and i think washington is still struggling with how do i accurately regulate these labs how do i you know if i go in and look that they have all this paperwork okay i see they have all the paperwork but is their method valid like is it actually robust and accurate is it giving me the right results i mean they're repeatedly doing the same thing and i think the other misconception is iso 17025 you know accreditation means that you're accurate no it means that you push all the paperwork and you repeatedly do something does that mean it's the right thing not necessarily it just means that you're repeatedly doing perhaps even the wrong analysis so that's one part to say you've got good quality management but we don't have the piece that says this is a robust method this is one that 10 labs have said always gives them the same results no matter what happens or comes through and do something like that you can do that method you know a published aoac or usp method or you can have your own method that's faster and better as long as it gets the same results as that method so you can cross-validate against that and that piece unfortunately is still missing it's taking you know some time i think the nist group and aoac are working on robust methodologies for testing of cannabinoids um usp has kind of thrown their hat on the game saying we've got some ideas about how to do this so it's it's coming but you know it just takes time to kind of demonstrate it and work through all that and we're not not quite there yet and the scary part is we're just still working on flour so we're trying to get an accurate potency number or other number on flour you know not all the concentrates not all the other forms not all the derivative products and not everything that you see in a dispensary shelf we're still working on you know 25 to 30 of what you see in some of the shelves that's it the other ones all have those same problems if not bigger problems because finding pesticides in those matrices is much more difficult than some others um and i think that's what really leads to you know it's going to be a while till we get to where we really want to go yeah no i totally agree and one thing that i noticed when i split out of the commercial cannabis testing world and got into primarily quality management consulting and going to some of these labs and trying to help them implement quality systems and validate methods um i was shocked at the lack of formal validation of methods uh in most places that i did yeah um a lot of them didn't really even understand uh what a full method validation looks like and um it like sort of nauseated me because it really makes you realize that a lot of the data floating around i mean you just it's like interesting but you don't know what you can really do with it you can't compare data between labs you know all these issues and then like you pointed out let's just say with like edibles where you have hundreds of different matrices all grouped under one product category essentially yeah and uh yeah uh there are some labs trying to do good work um publishing data as they're trying to validate some of these matrices there's a paper that came out recently about chocolate that was interesting um but for the most part um when it comes to edibles accuracy is all over the place and there's really not a good way to even verify it and so it comes down to like a lot of working with the producer and trying to understand like well what are your controls and what did you do what were the inputs and let me look at my data and what i can control and what i can measure and you know does it seem to be painting a consistent picture you know or you know what's going on and i think a lot of consumers um are still kind of in the dark in that on that side of testing uh yeah i don't know if there's a full appreciation for the complexity so i think in the beginning we were often given what i said the top down problem here's my brownie what do i have in it like well i'm finding you know 38 milligrams what'd you put in there they're like i don't know i'm like okay cool 38 we're just gonna run out there and tell everybody it's 50. i'm like wait a minute um you know i think working from the bottom up saying what was your you know manufacturing process what concentrate did you start with how much do you think you put in per unit can i test a broad number of units to see if i'm getting the same number from each of those to know if you're you know homogeneously mixing them or not and then i can say you know what i got 10 brownies and all 10 of them showed me that you had 47.6 milligrams on average you know within reasonable variability in here were you aiming for 50 i was all right fantastic you're finally getting there rather than i don't know i got this 45 out of the one was that what you shot for i think working closely with the lab you know helps make sure that you're going to get that label accurate in the end and regulations have helped make sure that you have to do that but every edible is its own problem right so i can have different types of chocolate with different fats causing different problems different brownie matrices some have you know walnuts or stuff in there that make it harder to check for its uniformity by weight um and gummies are another great example because gummies can be made in a lot of different ways but they really like to hold on to those cannabinoids so if you don't have a good methodology for testing that you very well may be missing a good significant part of what's actually in there so every type of edible kind of needs its own validated method if you will um i think we're lucky enough to have been around for so long that we've had a lot of time to work on each of these and even in the early days like i was like any type of food product you can imagine someone's tried to throw cannabis in it so we probably got experience with it one way shape form or another from the disgusting looking tiara masseu all the way to the brownies and cookies you're like sure god that shouldn't be here um but it helped us kind of understand which methodologies of sample prep and then further analysis would actually be the best ones to go after but if you're a brand new lab and you just found some scientist and they might not even be the right one you know to go run your lab and your you know business professional and said i think the lab game is going to be a good one because it's required by rules that everybody has to work with them you know you might make bad choices in which equipment you might not know your scientist you know isn't the best person running the the game and they have to develop all their own methods because no one said here's exactly the roadmap today so there's there's an immense amount of challenges let alone product complexities that go with that absolutely and this this really neatly segues into the other sort of the other grand discussion i wanted to get into you get into with you which is um process validation and product standardization and i was interested to know whether your decision to start to really focus on product standardization and those issues did that stem from the inconsistencies you were seeing when you were doing cannabis testing um and that sort of thing or did it just kind of come about simultaneously you know were you always sort of thinking about that no there's a little of both i mean you see wild you know inconsistencies and you know it's a problem but you're also saying if i want to provide um medical products and things that i can understand are driving these physiological you know effects i have to know that it's the same thing every single time so i want a standardized product so i can assess that this is delivering those predominant physiological utilities i also want to see this standardized because i see right now it's a complete mess and people aren't really doing that very well unfortunately today we still don't have a lot of great standardization you know there's not standardization in cultivar names and anybody can call it whatever they want there's no formalized assessment of you know what is actually blue dream or not there's also um you know the unfortunate pieces that different extraction methods cause different chemical changes and transformations so now i've got someone calling blue dream flower and blue dream you know fill in the blank type of concentrate whether it be rosin sauce live resin you know butter batter you name it um or even water hash and then i have you know blue dream vape cards and they're all derivatized in different ways so now i've called everything blue dream but none of the chemicals match up to say these compositions are looking like one another or even the same so i can produce any one of those in any fashion i want as long as i'm doing the exact same thing and analyzing the product at the end to say i am creating a consistent profile right when i look at these you know tens of molecules i can tell you that they are within these you know reasonable variabilities of lab accuracies if you will and a reasonable plus minus for agricultural variability perhaps to say i've got a fairly consistent product and one that should deliver a consistent physiological impact which is important for a brand and adult use is as important as it is for medical utility um i don't think we see a lot of that yet today so you need good labs that can demonstrate all these you know component pieces very accurately and reproducibly and then you need good production that says i am doing the same things every single time then we'll have some standardized products that we can start to say okay maybe we're seeing these groups of people consuming in this fashion getting those effects and we can all start to kind of further our body of knowledge uh with what cannabis could do for us in that fashion yeah absolutely and something that seems to be um building in the producer world as people are starting to wrap their minds around uh good manufacturing processes um and not necessarily just as a buzzword but actually going to the you know the federal the cfrs and and looking at what's actually required for gmp compliance and that starts to lead down a road towards um particularly if you're trying to operate your product manufacturing company um in a way where you're concerned about medical kind of quality and you're kind of aiming for something between dietary supplement and pharmaceutical kind of uh quality standards then that starts to lead into this world of okay we have to actually like a cannabis testing lab would validate their analytical methods as producers we have to validate our equipment we have to validate our processes we have to actually come up with ways to measure these things and define them um so that we can be consistent and so that's been encouraging although it's a very slow adoption process yeah well i mean dietary supplement world's been working on it for a long time right deche passed in the 90s and i'd say they're still you know bad actors and no you know some aren't perfect in that world there are excellent companies though you know there are some that definitely hit the bar and have raised it on everyone else um but it is a long evolving process and as states kind of take their own picture on each of those pieces as you know different operators you know come about in different ways and different products take hold in the marketplace there's this current time period which will persist for quite some time i believe of you know figuring it out if you will but it will eventually become much much better and i think you know our children and our children's children are definitely going to benefit from all the struggles that we're going through now fortunately but it's not it shouldn't be understood now that we've got it all figured out because we still have a lot to do in many ways yeah so so many things to do and like you said i mean these problems are not necessarily unique to the cannabis industry the natural products world in general is um you know there are all sorts of issues related to how do you uh verify that component ingredients you're bringing in for your products are actually what someone says they are because fraud in the natural products industry is very rampant um and so it's yeah it's an ongoing process that we've been trying to figure out across the board and now cannabis is just getting thrown into the mix oh yeah i mean it was this actually echinacea that you put in there you know right they actually have you know the good things or the wrong things out of this you know someone had said well they don't make an echinacea shatter so i don't even know how to deal with that type of product here you know cannabis has its own product forms and uses and end products that are derived from it so it's got its own extra layers of complexity and i think we know we're not looking at only one active ingredient they're the more we look at the better so that adds other multipliers of complexity and i think the natural products world does recognize the power of plants and saying these plants when provided in standardized extracts or as you know whole plant products have offered these benefits because of the same type of entourage idea that we're utilizing with cannabis but it's you know cannabis kind of takes it to that next level of complexity saying other forms and all these other molecules that we want to watch and if it's difficult to standardize you know one or two components in the natural products world and be sure you know i got the right lavender in this product or i got my echinacea from the right source that i was getting it's going to be that much harder across the cannabis panacea if you will yes and i think there's power and diversity right we're going to find more of the answers that we want and we're going to get more people the benefits that they need if we're not all driving towards one specific cultivar but it is you know gonna take that much longer to kind of figure out how to wrestle with all of it in a regulation and you know proper sense of saying this product is standardized and consistent and good for you type of consumer um because it will take that much longer to figure it out it's just that much more complex unfortunately yeah absolutely and and something that you touched on that i want to make sure we talk about specifically is related to extraction and refinement and how you can um get into this messy world of um sometimes non-target compounds that arise depending on the extraction method and one thing that i've noticed from talking to a lot of my friends that are still um actively doing commercial cannabis testing um particularly in the hemp space is around delta eight eight thc excuse me and um the fact that there seemed to be a lot of um a lot of the labs i talked to have sort of speculations on what they think these compounds are but there are definitely side reactions and things happening and a lot of the uh methods being used to manufacture these delta 8 thc products that are becoming really really popular although that's uh maybe changing now that the dea has finally like said you know hey we're looking at this and other countries are complaining about delta 8 products leaving the u.s and showing up in their countries is that something you have any experience with particularly the the delta 8 thc issue most definitely it's an interesting very interesting compound and one that we've worked on for a number of years we actually have a white paper on delta 8 thc available via our website so you can go to the resource section there and download some information and in there we have a comparable chromatogram like one from you know here was a very well done clean conversion from we took delta 9 thc to delta 8 thc and you can see the chromatographic profile and here's what somebody else called delta 8 with a bunch of unknowns in the cannabinoid region what are they you know are they good for you bad for you are they even a cannabinoid um i think there's a lack of understanding on how difficult it is to fully characterize a new compound a new unknown it's a tremendous amount of work and it needs lots of different analytical equipment to really get it right um and sometimes you know you could see like academic literature change you know 15 years later say whoops we had one of these chiral centers wrong this is actually the compound this way it can be immense amounts of years of work of graduate students to try and find this is this new compound we do see a lot of you know unknowns or mystery peaks right mystery material that shows up and while yes you might have some delta eight in here what are the other ones and you know should we be concerned about that the fda exists for reasons because when they make these compounds that are highly active you get certain impurity profiles but if it goes above certain things we know that there are toxicity limits and your manufacturing methods went wrong they make you identify and understand and study are the any of these impurities going to be potentially toxic so that we know where to set the limits on these things none of that is happening within cannabis so while cannabis you know originally presented on the flower is fine and we haven't seen you know any radical deaths or problems from those things are we going to end up getting to derivative forms or other you know synthesized um isomers or other products that are coming from those processes that may not even look like a big deal on the chromatogram but end up being highly potent or highly toxic in some ways and you could envision you know do i end up with a spice type compound from one of these where their activities are hundreds of times greater than the molecules already presented that we are comfortable with and i didn't know it was in here and all of a sudden this person you know their endocannabinoid system locked up and i've got mass depression i've got suicidal tendencies i could have other types of problems that come from that um because it wasn't what we were you know originally dealing with or aiming for it could be a big problem i think we're really lucky the toxicity profile that you have with cannabis like the effective range of doses to where it's actually problematic toxicity wise is tremendous so you don't have to worry too much about that um but the you know at in i'd say the accidental case of oops i made something this way because i came up with a new method that was going to be better you know when might that happen i hope it never happens but we probably should put some sort of controls and protections in place about when these things are okay to push to market um you know we may see you're gonna have to do some sort of basic talk studies on new things that are not already understood or grandfathered in i don't think you know like delta eight there's been a lot of understanding of that molecule before um and a lot of delta eight analogs were made in the pharmaceutical world to kind of go after looking at the endocannabinoid system in that respects so there's a good level of comfort about some molecules but how far do you go until you're not comfortable with that anymore and i you know i just hope we don't find out the hard way unfortunately yeah i agree and and the purity issue is is so big it's something that um you know the fda has been so hands off of uh particularly the hemp industry um you know they've issued statements and things but they really haven't done much of enforcement and i think part of that is them trying to wrap their heads around what that's going to look like but something that's been on my mind is i really don't think a lot of people are prepared for stepping into that world of you know if you're making any product and it and it's not pure and it's not something that is recognized as safe there is a lot of work that goes into well what are those impurities and yeah are they toxic in all these studies that go into getting like you know you can get a grass status on a particular product or a particular line of products even if the fda hasn't issued um grass status to that chemical or that product specifically but i mean you're talking something usually like millions of dollars to get through you know those studies many number of months right like it's not a rush to market type thing no and it's usually something where you want to find an independent you know scientific advisory board you know to lend some credibility to um the study designs you know all these different aspects of it um and i i just really feel like there's you know sort of a a reckoning coming um even if things play out smoothly with the hemp industry and you know maybe congress adjusts some of the language of the farm bill and uh cbd and all of these other compounds in hemp are are treated you know like dietary supplements or things but even if they're treated like dietary supplements that doesn't mean you can just go and i mean people do this um but they usually don't last long as companies but you can't just rush to market with your new cannabinoid formulation and just expect it to be accepted and tolerated by regulatory officials without demonstrating some of those things now things like hemp tinctures and basic extracts that haven't been heavily refined or fortified and that sort of thing that you know may fall into a different category um but talking about things like delta eight production or even um you know cannabinoid isolates in general um because it's just with chemical synthesis as i'm sure you know like impurities are so easy to make um yeah yeah yes they are and i mean and highly purified compounds are usually more expensive to go after right the purification efforts loss of material and just as those methods require time and effort too so if i can get away with something that's 80 pure instead of making it 95 plus well i would economically be driven to do so so okay well i'll go ahead and do that until someone tells me i can't um which unfortunately some of what we're seeing today yeah absolutely and um getting a little uh beyond some of the stuff we've talked about so far with testing and and product standard does standardization and everything um going uh sort of a much higher level what are some things currently that are really um peaking your interest research-wise um as far as cannabis and cannabinoid science goes um i think there is continuing innovation in scaling the process methodologies so which ways are going to work you know most efficiently especially as you see all the hemp farming come on board um you know are we going to make high purity compounds and new molecules that would blend towards better standardized formulations and really getting each of those specific molecules in hand so that we can make more advanced formulations so it's encouraging to see you know not everybody's gonna plant more cbd again right they're gonna start to breed for different plant components um i think the biotechnology approach of enzymatically producing some things via fermentation is pretty interesting um it's legally very interesting too whether that's you know actually allowed or not um but i think it does enable you to say hey these are high purity compounds and they're made in relatively efficient fashion as well so again i can make much more sophisticated and standardized formulations i think getting to that broad-based really sophisticated standardized formula is still a lot of our focus and a lot of energy is going into there because it requires both analytical and manufacturing perspectives to actually get there and there's still a bunch of work to be had in that regard now i don't know you know if the next new rare cannabinoid i mean certainly of interest to see what it's doing you know in the petri dish and in the mice or whatever but how fast can we translate that into the field and into getting into the hands of everybody was it some minor rare artifact that was actually produced and really the plant doesn't even make it it just happened that you know it came together on this one rare cultivar that no one has anymore um you know which ways might we utilize the plant to make these ingredients and the second piece is what else are we going to do with the plant in terms of fuels textiles feed you know food and other pieces you know everyone rushed to do cbd but there's a whole lot more to be had with hemp and i think you know the farmers are wise enough to start saying well i'm going to start to look towards making textiles with that and i think you know watching that evolve over the next few years is going to be a lot of fun and quite fascinating too yeah i agree i'm very excited to see the hemp industry evolve be uh well beyond cbd and i know there's like market forces at play because it's sometimes well some of it is just straight up lies by investors and things being told but you know a lot of farmers you know are told by some consultant that comes in that hey your five five-acre field is going to be worth you know hundreds of thousands of dollars or millions of dollars because of the cbd we're going to pull out of there or whatever and then that never happens the market commoditizes and slides in the three months after you planted before you've harvested and you're like i'm getting a tent of what this guy told me now yeah yeah but but hopefully as the market matures um it will be more uh it'll make more sense for farmers to think uh more creatively and an opportunity to interview morris beagle from uh we're for better alternatives um about this because that's one of his sort of main uh you know his main focus is trying to figure out like what are these other things we can do with the plant um and certainly the medical applications are fascinating and immense but there's this whole other side that is still very underappreciated um and the government has opened the door to it and so at least we got the door open right now finally let's run through it and go ahead and explore all that we can and hold the door open yeah yeah put a wedge in there yeah exactly would be nice yeah i'm sure coming soon um well i want to be respectful of your time i know we're getting uh close on an hour here um but i really appreciate you being willing to take the time and and chat about all of these things that i definitely think a lot about and it's always great to connect with fellow scientists that have been doing testing and quality management work and all of that um we're sort of a a small little uh culture of people um in the industry so it's it's great to to connect on that end and as we wrap up i kind of want to just hand the platform over to you for a few minutes and if you want to let people know um anything that the workshop has going on or at least let people know about your website and how to learn more about the work you're doing and and really anything that you want to share in the last few minutes we have here oh thank you and thank you for the opportunity it is always fun talking with other fellow scientists in the field i think we've got a uniquely informed perspective from a molecular standpoint and to kind of compare notes and share experiences is always fun so i appreciate the opportunity and for those that would like to learn more about us they can find us on our website theworkshop.com we're also on instagram facebook and other social media pieces we're aiming to have a little bit of some giveaways on our social media platforms via instagram later throughout the end of the year um i won't tell you exactly what they are but um there's some some new things that we've done and you can find on our website we just released one of them a biosynthetic pathway poster where we could analyze you know here's how the plan starts from carbon dioxide and makes some of these really interesting and fun molecules um it's a neat picture for sure to kind of see what's the plant's machinery kind of look like and how does it function and i think for us we're just going to keep continuing to drive uh all sorts of product standardization efforts helping out a number of brands across the country from the east coast to the west coast um and really trying to drive those most sophisticated formulations that give you that desired physiological experience time and time again yeah absolutely and just to clarify if anyone's listening and not familiar the workshop is werc workshop um just in case someone listening has trouble hunting that down um t-h-e-w-e-r-c-s-h-o-p dot com yep thanks for that yeah i know totally um well yeah that's really exciting i look forward to seeing the work that you guys continue to do certainly what you're focusing on now is i mean as we've said is so needed so it's it's really uh comforting to know that folks like you are are out there um you know really trying to educate and really level up um um the industry in general and to ultimately um help consumers get consistent products and know what they're getting and that sort of thing but also the producers and really helping everybody um everybody's perspective on all of this kind of mature a little bit so thanks so much for that work and everyone that's tuned in thanks so much for uh listening to us chat today and if you want to

major online book retailers [Music] [Music] you", "vY2V4LX9QyU": "[Music] you [Music]", "LCasL-iLUOQ": "i like that we have some questions here from our viewers whoever you want to start here is it true that in general covet 19 death rates have actually gone down okay so it depends what window of time you look at and where at the overall curve you are looking right now according to the department of hhs we're actually seeing those numbers go up but if you compare it to let's say february march april yes we have made incredible progress the learning curve for the critical care of patients with severe and critical cova 19 has been very rapid on the part of intensivists critical care specialists all of the nurse anesthetists etc so we are learning how to treat these patients better but right now our death rate is climbing all right and our final question i've heard rumors cannabis may help treat covid19 complications is there any truth to that so i am a big believer in the therapeutic modality of cannabis i think we're just at its infancy right now in terms of studying it and understanding its benefits as well as its risks the short answer is based on existing data there's potential help but there's also potential harm overall cannabis users can be at increased risk of covid but there is a drug that actually was approved by the fda to go into phase one clinical trials by the end of this year it's a synthetic cannabinoid and it is being targeted to be studied in patients with that so-called cytokine storm to reduce the inflammation so not yet ready for prime time but i do believe there may be some future in this but it is an area of intense research all right doug thank you so much and thank you all for your questions you can keep submitting those to dr jen on instagram at dr j ashton well hey there gma fans robin roberts here thanks for checking out our youtube channel lots of great stuff here so go on click the subscribe button right over right

plant it's extracted from the hemp plant and the difference between that and marijuana is that marijuana has THC in it like a lot of THC a good amount of THC enough to get you that psychedelic feeling of what getting high and that's what teached she does for you when we process the CBD to extract it from the plant we actually use a co2 distillation process and we use that process to remove most of the THC so our product actually contains a 0.00% THC there are other CBD s out there that have up to 0.3 percent THC in them and so you may get a little bit of that THC feeling if you take one of the products that has a little bit higher THC content but you will not get that feeling from our product you", "7jTt35Eu8cE": "[Music] [Music] what's up guys simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title it is another Ursa cartridge you know I'm very very happy although I did spend a little bit more than expected because I went to fee knows and it's not authentic and authentic when they had it it was $40 but at vinos it's 55 but I really wanted a cartridge so I was like [ __ ] it I'll pay $15 extra and you see if I'm not lying right here I mean the tax is killing me it was the one it's $41 without the tax but then it was like 54 with it so yeah definitely one of the the pricier cartridges I'm actually at a park right now I'm actually gonna hit a few in the car just because you know it's easier that way and then I'm gonna walk around and hit the cartridge - just to prove that I'm in a [ __ ] park okay guys [ __ ] Park [ __ ] park brother so let's just open this thing like I mean you guys already know the deal bros like I've opened this not this one but okay okay [Music] I didn't want to [ __ ] pull out the cap you know accidentally Laureus yes dope or battery I do have my dad's mate and do not have the magnetic piece on it so I'm just gonna use the side where it's cruising cheers boys who that wasn't even a blinker right this is a blueberry muffin in oh my god that show taste a pretty [ __ ] [Music] god damn holy moly cracker mode damn [Music] this is probably the the smoothest cartridge I've hit in a while if not the best or the smoothest the taste is there everything is there like I liked when I tried the first person car it was from the homie Chiron and he had ice cream cake which is a strain I didn't really enjoy as much this one has a sweeter taste of more blueberry taste obviously it's blueberry muffins and it's actually quite pleasant what [ __ ] it was just like [ __ ] the stats let's just read this [ __ ] right here so we got THC we're coming in at seventy two point one two percent it was packaged and manufactured on the channel on January 30th 2020 Best Buy same date but 2021 one gram all that good stuff not gonna lie it [ __ ] this [ __ ] hits so what I am going to do now pocket this water you can see right here guys very nice Park it's very nice outside I was actually getting pretty [ __ ] hot in that car I'm not gonna lie I want to go over there and smoke you see that boys that little stairway [ __ ] let's go there no one there and we can take some hits on the way to boys that's the thing about cartridges you could bring that [ __ ] anywhere and take a fat hit and especially with a cart like this that hits like a [ __ ] dab rig like it's a game-changer it really is you know like I honestly can't stress that enough you know cartridges are getting better just like technology with the mores I believe it's Moore's law where technology gets better every six months and technology is in everything when it comes to vapes computer it's anything you know I'm saying like the hits aren't that fat right now what you just take off let me see if I can take you about that the camera turned off let me see if I can take a little a little fatter hit damn well yeah I wanted to do I wanted to get my own orsa you know after Chiron showed me his I was just like damn there's just no way I cannot just try this muhfuckas and not buy my own it did take some a long time I would say about a month or something but it's only because Ursa hasn't been that much available in my area and it's probably something I won't buy that much often you know because $55 for a gram cartridge I know it's a it's average in LA but in Modesto that's not average that's a above average so you know I do enjoy it though I really really do enjoy it very very tasty you get the whole terpene profile of the of the strain which is good you know I wanna take one more hit for you guys I'm probably gonna call it a video hopefully you guys enjoyed it you and also in the car you could actually see the smoke thickened out here it's very spread out it's not a really good visual representation of actually how much I'm hitting but these are fat hits don't get me wrong but other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed this video I really enjoyed hitting this to be honest and making this video it's a nice [ __ ] day outside and hopefully you're having a good day so far peace out expecting company but that's ok cos don't try to prove", "Ovhzu_HMJ1w": "everyone my name is dame santoro i'm a physician assistant to work with dr marco gresti and i'm going to be reading chapter 24 of his book tales from the couch so chapter 24 let's have a marijuana talk weed pot grass dope mary jane reefer ganja ash herb chronic there are dozens of names for marijuana for our purposes i'll call it pop of all the drugs that i have prescribed in 30 years of practice the drug i probably know the most about is marijuana why because so many people are on it they smoke it in blunts pipes bangers and bongs they make smoothies and drink it they take and they bake brownies and eat it it is everywhere so we are going to have a marijuana talk it is a political issue it is a cultural issue and it has survived being demonized in the media more so than any other drug and now it's the opposite marijuana is now the cure for everything right in florida i have the requisite medical marijuana license which allows me to write prescriptions for marijuana uh for specific diagnoses cancer epilepsy glaucoma human immunodeficiency virus post-traumatic stress disorder crohn's disease parkinson's disease multiple sclerosis and chronic pain at this point in late 2018 many states have legalized medical marijuana and some have legalized recreational marijuana as well do i think that there's a role for marijuana in the medical community yes i do would i rather prescribe marijuana to someone than give them a strong opiate like fentanyl oxycodone hydrocodone demerol morphone or methadone of course i absolutely would why no one's dying by overdose of marijuana there can be psychological changes and dependency but there are no dangerous physical side effects of marijuana pretty much no matter how much you smoke once you stop the worst issue i've heard of is difficulty sleeping for about 10 days after stopping you might feel a little restless you may be slightly irritable for those 10 days but that's pretty much it it's over to my knowledge i don't think there has ever been a report of overdose of marijuana contrast that with the current opiate epidemic where more than 115 americans are dying of opiate overdose each day the marijuana is much much safer it is useful in treating several medical issues and side effects in cancer patient it stops nausea and increases appetite it eases agitation calms rage in cases of post traumatic stress and it's a good pain reliever in cases of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis most of the people i prescribe it to are in their 70s or 80s with south florida's early population most of the people going into dispensaries are doing so on walkers and in wheelchairs there are definitive medicinal benefits with medical marijuana but there are some issues associated with it as well sometimes i call it the nothing drug here's why if you give marijuana to a young developing mind someone who is let's say age 14 that person's life is um course is altered um i go through this because i treat mostly young people i always tell them from the day you start smoking marijuana nothing happens your motivation drops off you think a lot of good thoughts about what you can do or what you'd like to do but you do nothing so nothing gets done that alters your life course dreams are great but the key is to act on them what would have happened if neil armstrong was a pot smoker since he was 14. i can tell you that he probably wouldn't have made that one step for man or giant leap for mankind another thing about smoking pot that comes straight from my patients who do when you use it you just want to keep using it because it makes feel good and there are qualities to marijuana that make people prone to isolation where they don't communicate with people as much think about it when uh when was the last time you went to a wild noisy raging party with people smoking pot no other drugs butt pot you may hear some woo-hoos but they'll be coming from the direction of the couch in my experience people who smoke pot waste a lot of time doing so it's the kind of drug that can be used constantly for hours and days on end because there's no concern of overdose there's a lot of time wasted no pun intended on thoughts not thought through and things left incomplete when i warn patients about isolation i often hear back that they do spend time with people that in fact they get high with people i tell them that they may think they're getting high with their buddies but that most of the time they're just getting high and playing video games or listening to music there's no real interaction in this way it's a very solitary pursuit a mental masturbation marathon another issue that uh pot is uh another issue with pot is that once you start it it's such a safe drug that it's never going to come to the attention of anyone that you may be in trouble this is because you will never be a problem you really don't fight with anyone you rarely drive fast and even more rarely cause accidents if you make it off the couch at all you tend to drive more slowly because you actually move more slowly you rarely excel at anything except maybe well smoking pot you definitely leave sports uh you don't want exercise and you spend more time indoors playing video games listening to music or just surfing the web that's why i call it nothing drug nothing really happens you don't really form relationships with girlfriends or boyfriends you don't really get involved in sports you don't do poorly in school but you don't do really well either you don't become very ambitious and you don't really follow through with things nothing happens when you ask a heavy pot smoking 17 year old what they've been up to they say nothing when you ask what they did in high school that week they say nothing when you ask them what they did over the weekend they say nothing when you ask them what happens at the football game they say nothing when you ask them what they do when they get high they say nothing now you get the picture bot is mostly about being alone being high and being out of touch you cause no problems as a matter of fact the last thing you want is conflict it would harsh the mellow so you avoid confrontation like the plague i had one patient named richard but everyone called him rip he was married 47 year old with two kids in college out of state he worked for monroe county in the keys as a maintenance supervisor every night he would come home pull into his garage and settle into his man cave uh conveniently located in his garage one day when he was when he just happened upon his bedroom he saw a note from his wife there it just said i am leaving you that's it he was shocked he immediately called her after a few rings she finally picked up with a curt what he said to her janice i just got your note what's going on if i you just got my note said yeah on what's going on she said rip i left three days ago screw you and with that she hung up rip had become so detached and that he didn't even notice that she left him three days ago i have another patient named ernest who is 68 years old he's on disability for chronic pain as i knew i would be writing this i asked him to come in today because he's been smoking pop for so many years and i wanted his perspective so this morning we got to talking i asked him ernest how long have you been smoking marijuana he said 50 years i've been smoking weed for 50 years i asked him uh well what has it done for you if anything he said i don't know if it's age or weed but i don't have the best memory anymore i have some trouble concentrating that's probably from the weed but then he surprised me he said that after 50 years he had decided to try quitting and that it had been 11 days since he touched it i was amazed and i congratulated him and asked him why he'd quit he said well the wife's been after me for years and i'm noticing that i'm not getting much done on my honey-do list and i just had enough and he continued you know i wasted my whole life i was a no show for my entire life when he looked out the window i saw it to leave his eye as he said i got a wife i raised two kids and as you know i've got this disability for damn near 30 years he said i got to thinking i don't know that i'm really disabled i think i just smoked so much weed that disabled me i couldn't get anything done i was a four to five joint a day guy i just spent my time burning in my garage maybe nobody dies from weed but i think it took my life fair to say that i lost my life to weed i have so many patients in my practice that smoke pot it seems like everything everyone does it's not a problem for any of them well it may not pose a physical threat as far as overdose goes i do see some issues when people use a lot of pod i have a patient named colt he's a 17 year old senior in high school when i confront him about smoking by tells me it's not a problem i always get good grades i replied even if you are getting a's and b's how much time do you spend getting high you study and you think school and friends is all all there is to life on weekends you go to the park and sit on the swing set and spend all weekend getting high what kind of life is that but colt wasn't bugging he maintained that it wasn't an issue so then he goes away to college over break he comes to me in a panic he told me that he failed out of college because when he got there his parents weren't around so he could get high all the time so of course he did and he wound up doing nothing blowing off classes and not studying when i asked what he thought of pot now he said he thought that maybe it was time to quit it smartest thing i ever heard colts say i've seen people who smoke pot for years and then stop and only after about two months off of it they developed the insight to realize that it was impairing them when you are smoking pot you lose that insight to see that it's like a vice on the brain that is nearly impossible to do anything of self initiative if a teacher or boss has learned that do this that can work but what's loss is the ability to initiate activities without being told without direction but also blunts again no pun intended the desire to have fun the desire to interact it numbs the emotions the feel good from pot replaces the feel good from life for chronic users it takes six to eight weeks to get it out of your system it can be detected for that long which is why so many people wind up getting tested positive for it even when they are told they are going to get tested um it is one of the most difficult drugs that i have um that i have in the practice i yearn test people who are getting controlled prescriptions in the practice and i would say roughly 30 to 40 of people smoke pot in the practice and nobody thinks it's a problem i try to educate people uh you don't think it's a problem because you cannot conceptualize that it's a problem until you are off of it for at least two months when you use you lack initiative drive and creativity your ability to determine time and how fast it's going is impaired your cognitive ability is impaired your judgment is impaired as to what's good for you and what's not and i'm not just talking about basic things like what shirt to wear i'm talking about major life decisions like would it be better to for me to go to law school or would it be better for me to do uh to go work as a bartender pot and big decisions just don't go well together they don't play nicely what the what else does marijuana do some people it causes depression for others it helps depression i have had some people that get anxiety from it and some people get less anxiety i've had some people who get a little paranoid from it and some people who don't there are more and more studies going on using marijuana the findings are a mixed bag excuse me good and bad some studies say that marijuana stunts brain development weakens the immune system and slows reaction time i read one study that found that it can decrease tumor growth which i found fascinating and of course if you're smoking pot you're breathing in particulates and smoke which can cause bronchitis and partic uh in lung cancer the hardest thing i have found is to convince people that marijuana has an effect on personality i really find that it does it makes people irritable when you ask them to do anything they have a general lack of interest they're emotionally stunted in terms of a fun standpoint their fun bone is fractured i think as society evolves marijuana can will continue to be more accepted but in general in population from 12 to 60 i don't think it's good for them because they get this a motivational syndrome their life course can be altered and they are prone to the personality changes described here i think maybe it's okay later in life when you were retired in severe pain if you have some chronic medical conditions that would call for its use but this definitely carries risk as a recreational drug if it's used quite frequently it can truly undermine someone's success in life in terms of learning in terms of career and in terms of relationship i'm sure that in the not too distant future marijuana will be legal for recreational use everywhere its acceptance rate is on the rise i've had many police officers tell me that now they have a fair amount of discretion when it comes to arresting people who are riding dirty with pot in their purse or car whereas 10 years ago they'd have gone straight to jail now they may just get a ticket if it's only a small amount found it's just confiscated and destroyed what a difference a decade makes i look forward to more studies on the medical medicinal side of marijuana i would i will continue to educate my patients on marijuana's use and abuse and i'm pleased that i can prescribe medical marijuana i really have seen it's been", "tjyPHmETqvE": "hey I'm Christian from her exceeding today W walking through how to use one of my vape pens to set it up it comes in a box just like

for joining me for another episode of cannabis edible reviews I'm really excited to review this product today as it's the first packaged beverage on market in Canada infused with cannabis it happens to be this wonderful houndstooth soda from tweed now the information that I could find out about houndstooth was that in is a sativa dominant hybrid and it's mercy and dominant that's about all they give away for you on the internet about houndstooth and this is houndstooth and soda so what they did it is just soda soda water and then the houndstooth distillate they took the distillate and they nano emulsified it into the beverage so basically through a process of sonication you nano emulsify these particles make them very small so they so that the oil can go into the water and you can have a good emulsified beverage oh is a problem if you've ever tried making canvas elbows at home is getting everything to fuse together especially when using dis lid again because it's not the easiest thing to do to mix oil and water so how to use them soda water sativa canvas abused carbonated beverage per serving we only have two milligrams so a very small amount you'll see on the top it does have a childproof seal which is very interesting that there's this childproof seal and how much you'll have to do to actually get into that we'll go through that later and then Duty seal so a lot more than what would be on a can of beer with two milligrams very very little amount of cannabis actually in here I did read some reports of the Nano emulsification does help it work through your body and it be processed but again two milligrams very very little if you're from used to having edibles in a traditional market this is barely anything if you were to buy a 15 percent THC cannabis one gram of that cannabis will contain 150 milligrams so really very very small amount so 355 milk an and actually the most interesting thing I found when I was looking at this was the fact that the equivalency rating of this one can with two milligrams of cannabis in it is actually equivalent to 5.1 grams of Candice so you're only allowed to purchase 30 grams of cannabis so this would actually you can't even purchase a six-pack because it's five point one not just five so you can only buy five of these sodas which is the ten milligram limit to even have you know what one edible would be so if you're used to buying a tincture or a capsule from the dispensary that contain ten milligrams plus per dose this is very very minimal and I think that's again very very weird that you could that it's the equivalent of 5.1 grams of dried canvas if you've watched some of the other edible review videos I've been very confused on how that equivalency rating adds up and I think they're actually taking the weight of the product that contains the infusion and making that equivalent one interesting thing there is absolutely zero fat zero sugars there's only three calories in a can so that's pretty awesome I guess if you're on a diet is just soda water this lot one nine zero zero zero two three five four eight and it was packaged on December 20 19 December 11 2019 so this is they just got to market in Alberta I got Nirvana canvassed to set one aside show it to Nirvana cannabis in Calgary Alberta thanks so much but this was packaged you know four and a half months ago it's April 3rd today so on that it just got to market yet it's been ready waiting in a warehouse for four months so let's try and dig into a childproof can and see what we can do there I think it'll push it in and then pop it out rub Lee yep there we go and that's our can and let's crack it open next always love that sound reminiscent of the cannabis sommelier so what I thought I should do is actually taste this out of the can and out of a standard wine tasting glass just to let you know what I think of the beverage so on first impression there's a little bit of chalk cinnamon actually coming out of the can very light a rope floral aroma on the palate it has it does have a taste of canvas which is very interesting for only having two milligrams in it for it to have that bit a taste of cannabis is interesting but on the front it has like a banana banana peel a white floral characteristic that's you know relative to a dried carnation there's this chalked cinnamon on my palate and then a slight hint of cannabis fresh like a cannabis garden so it is a more complex beverage than I thought it was going to be just being houndstooth and soda I thought it was gonna be really innocent and not have much going on there's carbonated water distilled cannabis terpene blend ah there it is there it is so this has terpenes in it mmm and so that one resonating on my palate is definitely better off lean beta-carotene how have you said it tastes exactly like the smell of my true terpenes examples if you need some great terpenes to study from true terpenes is a great source but yeah I could definitely taste the added botanical terpenes and they're still sitting on my palate if you've ever cocktailed with terpenes before um a little go is a very very long way vegetable glycerin monoglyceride soy lecithin sucrose cannabis distillate cannabis terpenes calcium disowned mine EDTA potassium citrate natural flavour contains soy so they did crank it up a little bit with lawless terpenes but again pretty you know pleasantly surprised to be very honest so that's our glass there oh yeah and when you put it into this glass it's a lot of banana banana peel banana Rhine tomato leave tomato stem blackberry leaf no not blackberry leaf but blackberry stem you can even get some like almost tropical coconut suntan lotion out of it on the palate of the glass obviously just a little bit more of that banana flavor banana peel banana rime very little white flower bigger off lean it's not not enjoyable um it's actually way better than I expected it to be I thought it was gonna taste like really bland soda water and not have much going on and it's it's refreshing and enjoyable um definitely a wonderful cocktail ingredient because it does have these nice botanical flavors to it has those herbal notes that banana esque things that I would imagine with this are maybe like you know you can obviously do any kind of gin and soda that you'd like you could turn this into a vodka cranberry soda but I think this would actually be really really refreshing with either some looks are no bitter Bianco or just some Campari a nice bitter aperitif Oh an ounce and a half and there would really crank this up I don't know if 2 milligrams is gonna do anything for me for those of you that are watching the channel and that haven't watched any of my other reviews I never comment on the effect because my tolerance is very different I don't find it that it's my position to comment on effect for you but just to arm you with as much product knowledge on the quality of the product that I can't before you purchase and you can be your own judge on how two milligrams will affect you I'm so final final thoughts the smell you know if you smelt it for long enough I could see it being off-putting eventually if this was a wine it has some nice aromas but it's not a wine it's a soda do I think something like the tweeds how tooth and soda could ever replace beer not a chance but it's definitely a great cocktail mixer I'm sure Health Canada wouldn't like me saying that but I think it is a good cocktail mixer especially if you're not a good cocktail artists and you haven't figured out at a cocktail with cannabis if you'd like to learn you can check out the card here and check out that playlist um yeah not gonna replace it beer easy drinking beverage I would definitely get tired of smelling it but if I was drinking out of a can you know you could you could crush it you could keep up you could be in the same social atmosphere if you're going for that California sober life and you're not drinking it all but you're looking at cannabis as an alternative and toxicant this is a great place to start especially if you're a beginner with the two milligrams I look forward to having more potent sodas on the market as far as the rating for this goes you know it's a simple soda there's very low milligrams I should mention that it was four dollars and fifty cents um so my final thoughts hmm clear smells pretty nice flavor I like how they played the terpenes I'm gonna give the beverage 7.5 out of 10 it was quite good I like the nano multiplication I'd like more cannabis in it I'd like less of the kind of weird cannabis taste I like the finish I liked most of what was going on improvements would be for me if I could have alcohol in the camp that would be great other improvements for me would be a higher milligram dosage but the reality is this is the very first package carbonated you know single serve canvas infused beverage on market in Canada so a great place to start and I'm really happy that I got to review it like this and tell you all of my thoughts so I hope you make sure to LIKE comment share and subscribe if you've tried the houndstooth soda comment below let me know what you thought let me know if my tasting notes were on point with which you thought it tasted like and let's have a conversation thank you so much for watching again I hope you make sure to

"O3rsFUjs2X8": "i'm ashley brennan founder of sabine holistic health sabina holistic health is a non-profit that helps medical marijuana patients afford marijuana a safe effective medicine never covered by insurance today i'm discussing medical marijuana and depression overall people are finding relief of depression with cannabis and there is scientific evidence and patient surveys to support this i'll look at the science behind why marijuana is effective for depression and some unique studies so let's look at medical marijuana and depression the basic science behind why marijuana is effective for depression is because it interacts with the endocannabinoid system the most important regulatory system of the body endocannabinoid signaling is involved in depression pre-clinical studies show that thc and cbd consistently produce the same signaling and results as commonly used antidepressants activating cb1 receptors in the brain produces antidepressant like effects and enhances mood thc and cbd can activate these cannabinoid receptors cannabinoid receptors in the endocannabinoid system are activated by cannabinoids in medical cannabis or the body's own endocannabinoids which are actually very similar when the body is under producing endocannabinoids naturally the cannabinoids in cannabis step in to help by activating receptors depressed patients exhibit lower levels of endocannabinoids this could contribute to depression and provides a therapeutic target for medical marijuana it also gives us an explanation as to why medical marijuana relieves depression some of the first human evidence that medical marijuana could relieve depression came from failed clinical trials meant to produce weight loss activating cb1 receptors increases appetite as seen with thc so it was thought that blocking cb1 receptors might decrease appetite and aid in weight loss however patients taking a synthetic cannabinoid that blocked cb1 receptors were likely to discontinue the medicine due to depressed mood and suicidal thoughts this failed trial to decrease appetite proved that cb1 receptors play a role in depression and activating them with cannabinoids such as thc would produce an antidepressant effect studies that set out to show marijuana use cause depression either suggested that people were self-medicating or lacked a correlation when other socioeconomic environmental or mental health factors were considered there have been significant drops in suicide rates in states that have implemented medical marijuana programs a study analyzing suicide data from 1990 through 2007 showed legalization produced a 10 average reduction in suicides especially in men although depression on its own is not usually an approved condition for medical marijuana treatment or a medical marijuana card patients are often using it to treat depression a survey of 1429 medical marijuana patients in washington reported that 50.3 percent were using the medicine to treat depression and felt it improved symptoms of depression even though it was not the reason they obtained a medical marijuana card or their primary condition other patient surveys and studies yielded similar results in one survey of 4 400 adults those who consumed marijuana once per week or daily showed decreased scores on depression scales when compared to non-users when analyzing this data between medical and recreational marijuana users medical users reported an increased depressed mood and medical complaints related to the body when compared to recreational users this indicates that medical conditions contribute to the development or intensity of depression clinical trials specific to medical marijuana and depression have yet to be conducted however there are clinical studies that show medical marijuana can decrease depression that occurs with other conditions a survey of 131 patients with als lou gehrig's disease showed medical marijuana decreased depression among other symptoms a study of 367 patients with fibromyalgia showed 80.8 percent reduced depression among other symptoms in the largest scale study of 775 patients with hiv aids patients rated medical marijuana more effective than pharmaceuticals for depression these are just a few examples medical marijuana has also shown to improve depression in chronic pain when compared to patients who use opioid medications for chronic pain in one study of chronic pain patients using either medical marijuana only opioids only or a combination of medical marijuana and opioids anxiety and depression scores were much higher in those using only opioid pain medications when compared to those only using medical marijuana the group that used medical marijuana only rated much higher in overall health and well-being in the group using a combination of medical marijuana and opioids patients were more prone to depression but not anxiety than the medical marijuana only group medical marijuana is safer than opioids for pain and doesn't carry the risk of overdose or addiction it can also relieve anxiety and depression reported in many people with chronic pain while this data supports that medical marijuana improves moods and depression with other conditions very few studies have considered depression on its own in a recent study published in the yale journal of biology and medicine cannabis users overwhelmingly reported immediate relief of depression after using marijuana the study observed 1819 people from june 2016 through july 2019 they completed a visual analog scale of depression and reported the strains including indica sativa or hybrid and products and methods used flower concentrates pills tinctures topicals or edibles as well as how they used it such as a joint pipe vape etc the goal of the study was to determine real-time depression relief before and after using medical marijuana patients were asked to report depression symptom levels before and after using the medicine using the relief app in this truly unique study 95.8 percent of users had immediate symptom relief after using marijuana where 2.1 percent had worse symptoms and 2.1 percent reported no change the average reduction was 3.76 points on the 0 through 10 visual analog scale the depression symptom relief was not different based on the strain type or product used thc levels were the greatest predictor of symptom relief while cbd may have antidepressant effects cbd levels were unrelated to immediate symptom relief of depression some negative side effects of depression such as feeling unmotivated were observed in 20 of the patients where 64 experienced positive side effects of depression such as feeling happy optimistic relaxed and peaceful the results indicated that medical marijuana produces a positive antidepressant effect in most patients while both thc and cbd can be beneficial to depression high doses of thc may be sedative or cause a lack of motivation which is a symptom of depression negative side effects like these can be completely avoided with the appropriate choice of strain other cannabinoids and terpenes have been shown to have anti-depressant effects especially limonene limonene allowed 75 of clinically depressed patients to discontinue antidepressants in a clinical trial in japan it is important to consider all cannabinoids and terpenes in a strain to best treat your symptoms the terpenes linal and limonene may increase antidepressant effects when used with thc and cbd when relieving depression thc and cbd ratios are important marijuana is a versatile medicine that can be used without intoxication an equal or higher ratio of cbd will reduce or eliminate the high of thc that can be unmotivating or cause unwanted symptoms of depression when choosing a strain for anxiety or depression a higher amount of cbd that reduces the intoxicating effects of thc may be an appropriate choice thc can aggravate depression or anxiety in some patients when choosing a medical strain patients with depression should be knowledgeable about thc and cbd ratios the medical uses of cannabinoids and terpenes strain

to try to connect with you guys uh a lot more than i than i have been and i hope this live stream is actually working i normally have a totally different hardware setup um for how i would do anything for youtube but it looks like my mic's coming through i'm just gonna hope and pray that it is working um so hey everybody i just wanted to get on here and just do a couple of um updates about what we're doing at curious about cannabis and yeah just share a little bit about kind of where things are headed and to let you know that in general i'm going to try to start doing live streams um beyond you may have seen previous live streams that i've done where i just play old uh podcast videos and so i'd gotten some requests to um you know sort of set up a 24-hour stream of of podcast episodes and i've done that a couple of times but um i don't have dedicated hardware to run that all the time but beyond that i'm going to try to start doing live streams where i'm just connecting with you talking to you directly as i'm able to so we'll see how it goes so first of all i want to say that um you know those of you that follow us on youtube if you don't already follow us on instagram i really recommend you connect with us on there because i do make um live streams and posts on stories and stuff a little more frequently there and i honestly share most of my news on instagram because that's where a lot of the kind of cannabis industry is is hanging out but i'm going to try to change that um to let you know a little bit of what's been going on and why there haven't been some posts in a while um i've been teaching quite a lot so our um our curious about cannabis workshop series launched just a couple of weeks ago for this year and i used to teach these workshops locally in person here in oregon for years since at least since 2015 and then of course 2020 hit and had to kind of reevaluate everything in life as so many people have and so we made a really big pivot towards virtual education events and i was very very skeptical and cynical at first but it seems like it's going well so now i'm really really excited about it because it's enabled me to connect with people all over the united states and in canada mexico all sorts of other places and to really have the chance to dive into all sorts of details that i can't get into in podcast episodes or you know kind of casual conversation and um yeah so our first cohort um is underway with that workshop series and we just had a really great um guest lecture from dr anna schwabe it did her phd uh dissertation work looking at genetic chemical and organoleptic variation among uh cannabis flower super super super interesting stuff and she was gracious enough to stay a little extra and talk with my students and myself and answer questions just really really great experience next week we've got kyle boyer coming in to talk about lab testing murphy murray is going to be coming in to give us lab tours and talk about extraction we've also got dr arno hazakamp who's um you know basically one of the first researchers to present this idea of chemovar or chemical variety he's just published tons of research on cannabis since he started studying it professionally in 2001 i believe a major name in cannabis science research but he's going to be guest lecturing in a few weeks and then we also have dr linda clumpers who's a clinical pharmacologist that'll also be coming in towards the end of the workshop and guest teaching so just tons of great guests that have been really really gracious and giving me their time and energy to help make the workshop awesome so that's all been going great if you are interested and you didn't get in on this first cohort i will be opening up the next session uh the next session's registration window is going to open next week so if you go to cacpodcast.com learn you can find information about those workshops and some of our other educational events that we have going on i think they're extremely unique compared to other stuff that's out there and i've had students tell me that you know ones that have taken a lot of the available cannabis education stuff that's currently out there they tell me that there's nothing like what i'm doing out there and that the content that we're going into goes far more in depth and one student told me today it just gets in the nitty-gritty of all of the science of all this sort of stuff and kind of shatters some maybe some preconceived notions you may have even learned in other um cannabis education uh courses and stuff like that a student told me today that he's just got uh more and more questions and i was like well that's a great sign that you're learning um so yeah those workshops have been really really fun and so they are intensive they're six weeks long each um but if you're looking for like the really intense cannabis science you know course um uh check it out curious about cannabis workshop series there's two parts it's 12 weeks series total and each workshop is six weeks we also have a beginner's workshop that is launching in april um the session first session starts on april 9th and if you or someone you know is totally new to cannabis i mean starting out at ground zero basically this workshop is made for them it runs a month long and it covers all the general basics that you could expect you know uh addressing you know just what is cannabis what are all these cannabis products what are these terms that are being used and dispensaries and stuff and how do we think about those terms how does it connect to science or doesn't connect to science in a lot of cases um and how does cannabis and other sorts of cannabis products in general how do they affect the body and are they safe those are some of the basic questions that we go through um it's only a hundred bucks like i said it runs a month um in general the way i see it is if it can save somebody from buying products that aren't actually in line with what they're looking for then they will probably save quite a bit of money that would pay for the the beginner's workshop many times over um so yeah if you know anybody or if you run a dispensary or anything like that um check this workshop out and and please send people there i'm hoping to get the cohort um built out um by the first week of april and we'll be off to the races um some other things i wanted to talk about that we have going on that i am excited about um so if you're into the crypto world then you've probably heard of nfts if you're not in the crypto world you've probably heard of nfts because people are starting to write articles about them quite a bit um nfts non-funchable tokens you know are basically digital assets um the best example to describe them would be like in a video game if you're buying uh um some sort of item in a video game uh that's essentially an nft um although up until now they haven't really been on blockchain and if you're not familiar with what blockchain is it's essentially just a really nice ledger that keeps track of the flow of information and digital goods so cryptocurrency got really really popular and operates on blockchain but uh blockchain is a lot more than cryptocurrency and nfts are really highlighting that and so some common examples of nfts there are like virtual trading cards like mlb and nba have both started producing digital trading cards um as nfts um additionally there are kind of these virtual worlds that you can join where you can buy land in these virtual worlds and develop uh virtual structures and things like people build digital art galleries for instance to showcase their art people build um uh arcades even casinos all sorts of stuff uh decentraland is the most um probably most popular example of of these kind of like metaverse systems but they utilize nfts in all sorts of ways like i mentioned they have art galleries and people post their their digital art as nfts in those systems but also nfts can be applied to things like contracts and intellectual property and i'll be really excited when people start to understand the value in that because nfts are huge for content creators and artists but they're also going to be really huge for all business i mean the the audit trail aspect of blockchain is unparalleled i mean it's just something that if you read enough about it it'll click why blockchain is not going away and how more and more we're going to see more things get on the blockchain and likely we'll see a future of the internet where you have the on-chain internet and you have an off-chain internet and the off-chain internet is sort of uh this more murky side of the internet that's doesn't have this kind of level of audit trail and everything uh more what we're used to right now and then you'll have the on-chain internet where everything is tracked and there's no way to really uh fudge things which might freak people out um regarding like anonymity but the great thing about blockchain and cryptocurrency and everything is that uh even though these audit trails exist um there's still plenty of ways to stay anonymous in using things on blockchain so when people see transaction histories they don't see your name they see this long string of random characters that represent your wallet um and the other wallets you know that things have been moved to so it can be used for anonymous you know internet uh transactions and that sort of thing um or not and so anyway if you're seeing all this hype about nfts that's kind of what it's about is it's you know showing that blockchain is way more than cryptocurrency and digital assets in general are are starting this move over uh to nfts and it's huge for content creators like myself because it gives us a little more power uh to do very interesting things with our art and um also provide a way for our fans to potentially make money um off of supporting the things they like so with all of that rambling out of the way curious about cannabis has launched our curious about cannabis canna card nfts we have well over 100 of them right now waiting to be released and as far as i'm aware we are the very first um you know company that's producing educational cannabis content in the form of nfts and we're one of the first groups that's making cannabis content all at all as nfts at least in some like systematic formalized way there are people that have made spinoff you know little nfts out of photographs and stuff here and there but you know we're putting together a pretty uh substantial system on how to use our cards and these these can of card nfts they basically look like um pokemon or magic the gathering uh trading cards in a way that's kind of how they're modeled um but they're digital some feature photographs or artwork some feature videos um so some of these cards it's almost like uh you know like in harry potter uh the trading cards that they have um you know the the wizards start talking to them and stuff well these some of these cards you know are kind of video format and kind of have that that feel to them uh where i might be explaining some concept about cannabis or whatever and then the cards themselves have educational information about whatever topic's being represented by the card on there and so these cards are you know they're collectibles uh some of these cards are only minted once so they're literally one of a kind others are minted in groups of like 25 or 50 so that's how you get your commons and your uncommons and your rares but beyond the fact that they're fun little cards that have educational information and they're collectible they're going to have very direct tangible value because we'll also be using these nfts as discounts for merchandise discounts for events and tickets to exclusive events so up until now we've had our patreon and we have a nice little community on there people that have been supporting the podcast and all of the work that we do um and we always you know give out discount codes and stuff to patrons to give them free stuff for discount stuff for instance all of our patrons got into the first uh cohort of the curious about cannabis workshop for free not everybody actually took advantage of the opportunity to take it for free only a couple people did but they had the the opportunity to do that which was an 850 value some of these can of cards uh will have values that um range anywhere from a couple of bucks to two thousand dollars or more um so if you like what curious about cannabis does what we've been doing and how we've grown and you can kind of see how we're evolving then these cards could potentially bring quite a bit of value to you if you're wanting to take a lot of our workshops we also have a ton of self-paced courses that are going to be launching next month that are you know in general is trying to give people as many ways to learn about cannabis as possible but if you're interested in gauging and engaging all of those things um then you may want to consider trying to get one of these nfts um especially some of the rare ones and you won't necessarily have to buy them um we will have opportunities like uh giveaways um plus there's a kind of a whole game associated with these can of cards that i'm i'm not going to go into completely yet because we're still rolling it all out and everything in due time but essentially there will be um challenges that you can complete some are free some not the challenges that you can complete that will give you the rights to claim uh certain nfts with higher values you know so for instance if you're wanting to take a workshop you don't have 850 bucks to spend on getting into the you know the month and a half workshop well another approach you could take is trying to complete one of these challenges that may give you access to one of the rare can of cards that you can use to get into a workshop for free that kind of thing and so you know you may spend however much uh to get through the challenge like for instance one of the challenges will be you know taking a self-paced course on the learning platform which in general would be like 15 bucks or something you know you go do that but you also get access to one of these nfts which then gives you access to other stuff so in general it's not going to be for everyone but for those that are kind of into crypto and do like what curious about cannabis is doing and you want to see more of what we're capable of next we're kind of taking things in baby steps as we kind of organically grow here but if you're you know really really interested in in these workshops and everything um keep an eye out for announcements about the nfts and and what we're going to be doing with those if you want to learn more and kind of see some of these nfts you can go to openc.io so that's o p e n s e a dot io and that's the marketplace uh that where we'll initially be launching these and if you search for can of cards are curious about cannabis can of cards because there's a couple people have tried to do some spin-off kind of can of card stuff but as far as i'm aware we're the first and we certainly have the most uh nfts that are called can of cards but you may come across one or two others that use that name but if you search for curious about cannabis you'll find us and you can see uh some of the uh cards that we've put together um and and kind of get a feel for those you should see the one with the video embedded in it there's also a couple of signed cards um i have my signature on them um all sorts of stuff on there and we're going to be collaborating with artists and photographers and stuff in the canvas space to highlight um other people's work and in general um you know going through this process we've learned a lot so we're also gonna be helping cannabis companies get their own nfts made so if that's something you're interested in if you're an artist in the space or if you are if this is all interesting to you and you want to dabble in it um you know that's something that uh you can reach out to us about and um you know depending on the situation i might be able to to give you a little assistance there or we can collaborate and get your art on a can of card and the goal with that is that we'd be uh splitting any revenue that that comes from the cards so it's not like you'll be giving me my giving me your art and then just being thrown to the wayside uh anyone that we collaborate with on these projects um you know we plan on trying to split things pretty much right down the middle uh in most cases um so if you're not wanting to take on the infrastructure of nfts and you've got cannabis related art and that sort of thing that that might be useful reach out and we'll see you know what makes sense to do um yeah with that um another thing i wanted to announce is that it you know like i said at the beginning in general i'm gonna try to do more live streams um they'll be very casual kind of like this you know i don't even have my green screen uh my chroma key stuff running so you just see my green screen behind me you know these live streams will probably take place usually right after i'm done teaching and so i usually have a lot on my mind then but um yeah so be on the lookout for these live streams one thing i would like to talk about right now is delta eight thc a big subject um that is really really getting hyped especially after i think a new york times article came out not too long ago about it but i was recently interviewed on a podcast called brave new weed and um on that episode i think it's their most recent episode you can go look it up and listen if you like um but uh and we talked all about how delta 8 thc is generally made um how i'm getting a little thing here telling me my mic's too loud sorry if i've been yelling at you didn't mean to um you know basically how delta h thc is made how what we see in labs when we're testing these products um what sort of safety issues might be involved and what consumers need to know before they consume them and some of the main takeaways so once again go look up brave new weed and listen to the whole conversation i was also stoked that um apparently raphael machula heard the episode um and and sent an email out um you know um saying that he liked it and everything i was super super excited about that um one thing i need to do in one of these live streams is i um i had a back and forth with dr mushullum last year and just asked him some questions through email and stuff i would like to interview him on the podcast at some point but he's not always in great health and so it's that can be challenging but at some point i need to read his responses on my questions i think that might be fun but in that episode some of the takeaways and i'll just take a couple of minutes here and then i'm going to jump off but delta 8 thc molecularly exactly the same as delta nine thc except that a double bond is located in a slightly different place within one of the rings of the molecule and that is exactly the same same chemical formula um same 2d structure just like i said there's a double bond in a different place and for the chemists out there if you're familiar with the carbon numbering of the thc molecule i don't even have to explain this to you but the double bond in delta 9 thc is at the nine location uh the double bond and delta eight thcs in the eight location um and this is stuff you can see very clearly in the curious about cannabis book um i don't market myself enough so those of you that may not know uh there is a curious about cannabis book yeah you can find it on amazon barnes noble cacpodcast.combook but we actually talk about in that book how uh you know how chemicals are numbered where the delta nine comes from how delta nine compares to delta eight etcetera etcetera um but delta eight is basically the same as delta nine with the exception of that location of a double bond in the molecule but that small change results in fairly big differences in how the chemicals affect the body delta 8 seems to have similar receptor targets as delta 9 with weaker affinity which um kind of fits what people commonly talk about with delta eight that it's uh not as potent as delta nine in terms of intoxication potential and that sort of thing um and there's been a fair amount of research on how delta 8 could be used um therapeutically because it was looked at for a while as being this possible alternative to delta 9 um that wouldn't get people as high but you know they could still get a lot of the potential therapeutic benefit like anti-nausea effects um possibly even anxiety relieving effects a lot of the same stuff that has been known about thc so that sounds great right you've got a molecule where you're getting a lot of the benefit of delta 9 thc you know if you're not getting as high and it's available in the hemp market so um what's not to love well the problem there are multiple problems one there's a legal issue and we'll get to that in a second um but there's also a safety issue a lot of people assume that delta eight thc is extracted from cannabis for the most part no that's that's not the case now that's not to say that people are not extracting delta athc they certainly are but let's put this into context most of the delta 8 thc products that are on the market are in the hemp market generally you know i've tested i don't know how many samples of cannabis i've tested in the lab thousands upon thousands um delta thc even in thc rich cannabis cultivars shows up in extremely trace concentrations fractions of weight percents when you start talking about cbd dominant cannabis it's orders of magnitude lower um and delta 8 thc in general is kind of an artifact of delta 9 thc because it's it's not enzymatically produced by the plant it's uh the plant produces thca that decarboxylates to thc and then um over time that double bond moves around in the molecule and you've got a little bit of delta 8 thc in there so in general if you wanted to extract if you wanted to make a delta 8 thc product just from extraction and refinement you're talking about having to process absurd amounts of biomass of hip biomass that would just cost probably millions of dollars in between the the extraction process and the refinement process and everything to get um to where you've got some nice bulk delta 8 thc and clearly based on the pricing of delta 8 thc products people are not spending that much money to make it excuse me so what's going on well the way that most delta athc is produced is uh primarily from cbd cbd is isolated out of out of hemp that cbd is put into acidic conditions um usually with acetic acid or sulfuric acid and it's kind of left in a sort of broth like that for a while and cbd will change into delta nine thc and then eventually the delta nine thc will change into delta eight thc and you know you generally um through testing and other things you you know kind of follow that trajectory and um pull the you know stop the process once you've got quite a lot of delta eight thc in there and then often that product then gets um you know solvent purged out they'll then distill it and refine it into these delta eight thc distillates and it's that term distillate i think really confuses people because when you call something at distillate it hides its origin um because you could distill uh raw cannabis extracts you could distill a synthetically derived cannabis product in this cannabinoid product in this case and it's all called distillate and i think that's kind of what's delayed people cluing in on the fact that most delta athc on the market is synthetically derived um if you want to don't want to call it synthetic it's at least semi-synthetic i mean they're taking one chemical and making another chemical and the problem with that is that you get um well the chemical synthesis process is not perfect and so you get unintended by-products and if you listen to the curious about cannabis podcast i made a really silly uh kind of promotional thing for one of the episodes uh that was kind of like a game show and it kind of poked fun at this problem that people were trying to pass off delta 8 thc is an extract and then when they go and look under the hood they see all of these weird uh peaks representing um on the on sort of the analytical graph that would be called a chromatogram they see all these mystery quote unquote mystery peaks that represent these chemical byproducts thc isomers that we don't know what they are xothc delta 10 thc whatever thc most of these things we don't have reference standards for it's very hard to solidly identify so not only is most delta 8 thc on the market being synthetically produced but depending on the producer it can be very impure and depending on the analytical lab testing it um this may not be always obvious labs vary in quality quite a lot depending on where you are and what regulations there are and stuff and so i remember back in the day when i was doing cannabis testing in oregon before there were any regulations whatsoever there were labs we were competing against that were lumping together delta 9 delta 8 cbn anything that was related to thc they'd lump it all together just call it thc same sort of thing happens with delta eight thc depending on the lab sometimes uh they'll take all of these mystery peaks and just add them all up and say yeah that's pretty much delta atc um so unless you're actually looking at the raw chromatogram that the lab produces sometimes even the producer may not know how impure their products are um so just to summarize delta a thc mostly synthetic um there's a chemical byproduct problem we don't know what these chemicals are exactly that are kind of hitching a ride and those uh byproducts can range from two or three to five percent of the final product to as much as 10 15 20 30 i've seen delta 8 uh distillates that were really only about 30 percent pure with huge isomer peaks i didn't know what they were um and you also have the fact that some producers are manipulating test results i mean if you have a pdf editor you can go through and change what a pdf says and in the hip market that you know where the uh the testing world is in some places kind of still the wild wild west um that can be more or less easier to do so there's several major problems um some of which are specific to delta eight and some of which aren't um so you have all that then you have the legal issue that i mentioned so is delta athc legal uh synthetic delta athc is as far as we can tell not legal um and this is not legal advice i'm not an attorney i don't have legal training blah blah blah disclaimers um but the dea has clarified that synthetically derived tetrahydrocannabinol meaning delta 9 thc and all of its isomers the thc class of compounds of which there are at least 30 or more that we know of all of those are controlled thus illegal in a very big way um the pushback from the hemp industry is folks say well but delta hthc is naturally occurring in hemp it is it is a natural phytocannabinoid and yes that is true but these products are not hemp derived they're derived from cbd which is derived from hemp but that is not the same and there's a big difference between producing a an herbal extract and producing a synthetic chemical regardless of whether that chemical occurs in nature or not if you have synthesized it it is a synthetic chemical and there are certain safety purity issues that come along with that that i've already highlighted so that's why this is kind of a no-brainer from the fed's perspective in the united states of course it's illegal is there much enforcement on this no are people taking advantage of this kind of lag of enforcement hell yes they are to the degree that there are companies that are spraying delta 8 thc on hemp flour to produce smokable flour that will get people high this is such a short-term vision i don't understand i do understand because human nature they're always going to be those people out there that are going to do stupid things um what all i will say sort of my mantra lately on some of this because i do a lot of consulting around cannabis quality and compliance and what i will say is that a lack of enforcement is not evidence of a lack of violation so just because the dea hasn't come after you just because the fda hasn't come after you um it doesn't mean that you're not doing something wrong and it also doesn't mean that they're not going to come after you later and possibly even retroactively apply um laws later so you may think you got away with it five years from now and they can still come down on you because a lot of these delta 8 thc products are very public a lot of these companies are very public about what they're doing and trying to rely on the gray area for safety i think that's incredibly stupid to do i'm sorry if that offends you um but just coming out of i i don't like the laws around cannabis and cannabinoids as they are i would love to see cannabis descheduled completely um and just totally take care of this issue but we're stuck with things the way they are for now and right now the way the controlled substances act is set up this is the way it is this is the feds have been pretty clear on how they read the law there's not really room for interpretation here uh even though a lot of people may argue that there is i really don't think there is uh in general you've always got to read laws as conservatively as possible because that's how they're going to be applied and interpreted not as liberally as possible that's just wishful thinking um so are delta athc products legal technically on a federal level no they're not not in terms of the controlled substances act um will people continue to get away with uh selling delta eight thc products for a while probably um i don't see indication that the dea is going to take action uh immediately but who knows um and i kind of expect that they will take a couple of bold moves at some point to make a statement that will kind of help balance the market a little bit likewise with the fda our cbd products legal that's a real gray area because the food drugs and cosmetics act says you can't put drugs in food or supplements cbd is technically a drug the fda has said in some of their warning letters to companies that they you know that's how they interpret the rules and even though they are continuing to take comments and and try to figure out how they're going to regulate the cbd industry technically according to the way the law is right now um cbd products sold as supplements and foods pet food cosmetics those are all technically they technically contain drugs once again i don't like that i don't like that that's the way the law is i think that lawmakers when they were writing the latest version of the farm bill and all that they should have been a lot more careful with their language so that we didn't have to deal with this problem and now congress is kind of trying to fix it by trying to get new legislation passed that would make exceptions for cbd uh to get it recognized as a dietary supplement and a signed uh grass status generally regarded as safe but right now that's not the case um it's just there's this lack of enforcement issue but like i said lack of enforcement is not indicative of a lack of violation and the fda is very careful about indicating in every warning letter that they send that just because they don't bring up a certain issue in a warning letter doesn't mean that that company has not violated other things they haven't mentioned this is all to say you know to those of you out there wanting to get into the cannabis industry want to get into to hemp and everything just really got to be careful and recognize that things are changing a lot and there's always hype around new laws there's so much hype around the farm bill and what it's going to do for the cbd industry that was just unfounded um and you know like i said you've really got to read laws conservatively because that's how they're going to be interpreted and applied most of the time a great example of this related to the farm bill is the issue over total thc is the reference to point three percent thc is that uh delta nine thc like the farm bill you know defines it or is it total thc that it incorporates thca the way that i read the farm bill it seems unambiguously that it is certainly total thc because the law as written states that that thc value has to be reported um as a post decarboxylation value which means total thc now does it explicitly say total thc no it doesn't have to though post decarboxylation that is a scientific term meaning after the carboxylic acid functional group has been removed from the molecule okay well um how do you calculate that like if you're doing liquid chromatography where you're actually seeing thca and thc separately the way you do it it's scientific mathematical thing divide the molecular mass of thca and thc you end up with a correction uh factor you find out you know thc is uh 87.7 percent the weight of thca the difference between those molecules the only difference between them is thc does not have the carboxylic acid functional group like uh thca does so you're just accounting for the loss of weight from basically that co2 molecule popping off of thca i don't see this as controversial i don't see this open to interpretation and i think when this gets challenged in courts um that's the way it's going to be read i think it's pretty clear that if you take the literal word of the farm bill and um you know as it stands right now title vii and the language of the controlled substances act which was amended when the farm bill passed to provide allowances for him it always brings you back to this post-decarboxylation requirement which means that it doesn't matter if um your product you know uh would would pass scrutiny under 0.3 delta 9 thc you've always got to assume the thca is going to be decarboxylated and and then add those values together so the actual formula just to make it clear for anyone that's watching or listening you just take thc your thc value and then you add it to uh you know put in parentheses your thca value times 0.877 which represents that 87.7 percent molecular difference and so you correct your thca for decarboxylation then you add it to thc um there's no other way to do it i mean that's that's all it is now one uh aspect to this that um folks may argue as well what about the fact that decarboxylation is never perfect so does doesn't the correction factor of 0.877 um exaggerate the decarboxylation potential i don't know i mean sure decarboxylation rates will vary for sure is it possible to totally decarboxylate thca it depends it depends on what you're doing with it and as i just pointed out with um like the delta eight thc issue i mean people are making are getting into synthetic semi-synthetic chemistry and everything and when you're getting into that world you kind of do have to make assumptions that people are going to completely decarboxylate and take that into account and i'll also point out the usda final rules clarified this issue and even put the formula in there so it's clear that the feds are reading this the same way that i'm reading it uh at least from my perspective that's that's the way it seems to me they haven't indicated in any way that i'm off as far as you know how i'm reading those words and i'm so you i'm very accustomed to reading legislation like i said i've just worked in quality management compliance for so long uh you just get used to understanding um you know how words are being used in laws and what they mean and how you know the writer that was writing the law you know what they were uh you know trying to get across and so it makes this kind of quick and easy if you're used to it but i can understand those that like don't read laws very very commonly they may not know certain things to look for nuances to to check and everything but you know uh the reading of of the farm bill and the control substances act makes it pretty clear that 0.3 percent uh value refers to um total what we often call an industry total thc or post decarboxylated thc um it is what it is uh i do think that when the farm bill is um revised i think that the definition of thc will be changed to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols all thcs all isomers it'll close the delta eight loophole um i'm not saying i want this to happen i'm saying this is the practical outcome that i expect based on my experience and based on my scientific knowledge and and other you know industry knowledge about all this stuff i don't really see it going a different direction but we'll see but i i expect that will change the definition of thc to represent all tetrahydrocannabinols and i think they will also bump up the 0.3 limit as a compromise with the industry they'll probably say okay you want us to bump up the 0.3 limit fine we'll do it however now more things count as thc and so it's it's gonna be kind of a double-edged sword uh sort of thing but um it's really not gonna affect things too much because these compounds are in such trace quantities uh concentrations like like delta thc for instance um uh and it's possible they could even change it to cannabinols which would also include cbn but i don't i kind of don't think they're going to do that i think they'll define it just as tetrahydrocannabinols they'll raise the 0.3 limit maybe to 0.5 or maybe to 1. i kind of don't think they'll go as high as 1. i think they'll they may go to 0.5 or 0.6 i think has been advocated for um but then a lot of these regulatory gray areas will be gone i also think that the next her revision of the farm bill if legislation doesn't pass beforehand uh there'll be something in there that clarifies for the fda how to think about these compounds whether we're going to give them treat them as generally regarded as safe uh how do we interpret these things in context of the food drugs and cosmetics act and when all of that happens which will happen in the next two years i think if i have my timing right how i'm thinking about this all of this ambiguity goes away and then i think we will see a new era of enforcement uh by the dea and the fda throughout um the hemp industry and all all cannabis um markets to some degree depending on how each state's laws are set up to protect themselves um yeah i don't know i could be totally totally wrong and that would be cool if i was but um i kind of don't think i will be um so um i did a recent podcast episode on the curious about cannabis podcast with david heldruth jr which i haven't gotten on youtube yet i need to catch up it takes longer to get things processed for youtube so that's just the way it is but we talk all about these issues and kind of how to prepare for the future of cannabinoid markets in the united states particularly and some of his companies have been working with the dea and the fda for quite a while um to understand how they're interpreting things and that conversation just told me that everything that i've been deciphering from all this seems to be on point based on the messaging he's hearing from the dea and the fda um so i don't know that ramble is just basically to say hey be careful out there and don't assume that just because you're getting away with something now that you will forever and it's generally not a good idea to build a business model with such short-term thinking in mind and for consumers out there be careful about new products in general um something we talked about in the workshop uh our live classroom session today in our workshop it's about contaminants and how uh as time has gone on you know cannabis flowers killing it in regulated markets as far as um you know being very clean and everything but when you get into extracts and concentrates and products made from extracts and concentrates you just enter a different world and the safety issue is just all over the place because when you think about safety of cannabis products you're not just talking about cannabinoids and terpenes you're talking about chemical byproducts you're talking about additives diluents excipients all sorts of different issues packaging hardware are metals leaching into your extract out of your vape pen i mean there's just a lot that goes in there so i don't know this is a live stream ramble so i just hope this has been helpful um stay safe out there don't assume that just because something is cannabis derived that it's safe it might be um but we got to be careful and hold each other accountable and take care of each other and that's you know as a scientist and an educator that's what i feel my role is here i've spent the better part of this decade the past decade of my life studying canada's products in the lab and getting experience in all sorts of areas of the industry and you know sort of view it as my role now to try to pass on some of these insights things i've learned things you know that i kind of see coming and um hopefully hopefully it's helpful to some of you and hopefully it leads to better outcomes with cannabis or whatever so with all of that said um i hope you enjoyed this live stream um if you haven't already check out our website cacpodcast.com that's curiousaboutcannabispodcast.com
