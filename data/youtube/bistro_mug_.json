{"cjJFsTOIORI": "everybody today I'm going to review talk about the bottom Bistro mug and this one is the 15 ounce err they have a whole line of Bistro type cops and this is this one the 15 ounce er now the reason I got it is one because of the cool factor I think it's really nice how they were able to blow up this cup and do a double wall and it's just to me it's just amazing it also looks nice it also is functionally purposeful meaning that it makes the cup lighter it also insulates so that means that you can hold the sides and you won't burn yourself and you know you can see through so it's not like a mug like this where you can't see the liquid that you have in it so I usually use it for when I make lattes or cappuccinos but I also use it for tea and in fact it's nighttime I'm going to make some tea with it now I wanted to show you the box because the box is pretty nice so it is a nice gift idea but I also wanted to show you how much it weighs compared to a similar cup this one I believe is actually in capacity a little less I think it's either 12 ounces or 13 ounces so the cup itself is 262 grams and a similar cup that's made of ceramic is 405 grams much much heavier now another plus that this cup has our mug is that because it doesn't have all this material in it when you pour in your hot liquid or whatever it doesn't suck away holder eat from that liquid now on the bottom they have this silicone I don't know if you can tell it's got hard tell but this is what buttom calls it says that it's the double-wall glasses that breathe now supposedly it regulates the pressure inside the vessel so it doesn't crack there are other brands that don't have it to be honest I don't think it's needed I wish it didn't have it because this means that some when this wears out probably some condensation could go in now they claim that this is dishwasher safe and oven and microwave safe to 350 degrees Fahrenheit 180 degrees Celsius I have never put this in the dishwasher and I'll never will in the future just because I do think that a dishwasher would perhaps introduce minor scratches on it and how hard it is to actually hand wash these things I'd sound like I'm in a restaurant so uh I just realized that it does have a defect I never noticed that before but right there it's a defect that I've not noticed I've been using it for a while and that is for about three months or so so look up in the description or actually the first pin comment I will post in as I go if there's any changes in my review I think it's a nice product I think it's a nice gift I think it's functional purposeful and also nice looking so design wise it's nice to have around it's also a nice size perhaps a bit too big for a latte but I usually fill it to this point anyway one more thing that I wanted to mention is that this is made in China so don't think that because you're getting a bug dome it's made in the US or some other country it is made in China and also in the back say dishwasher microwave and freezer safe again when put in the dishwasher if I was if it was mine alright so if you enjoyed this video please please thumb up subscribe and I'll catch you in the next video till next time bye you", "bNnOTWYN_SU": "back everyone to another episode of mumbles today we're doing a primer and today I'm reviewing this this is the botom Bistro this is a 10 fluid ounce cup that you can put pretty much anything in hot coffee a cold beverage hot cocoa whatever you want and it's just a great little glass now what makes this glass so great first up I don't know if the camera can pick this up or not I will provide better pictures I promise but it is double wall double glass so by this I mean basically whatever when you put your beverage in here it floats inside of it so it doesn't touch the outer wall now this has the added benefit of you know when when you're touching something and it's hot it doesn't burn your hands and it actually insulates your drink to keep it hot longer and I personally think things taste better out of it and it's just a nice experience now to keep steam and stuff from accumulating in between two glass panes where you can't clean it they did provide this little vent right here it's a plastic bag and basically it just makes sure that you don't get any of that steam or anything stuck in there so that your glass gets all yucky or whatever and it's just a nice experience this cup as I said it's ten to down TSA's it is made of glass so be aware of that if you have children this might not be for you but if you love coffee you got to get big glasses a chance they're really really good I really love mine my set came with a set of two so you know you can have one for you and one for your significant other one for you one for your mom one for you one for you dad whatever whoever comes over you can get that second cup whatever and you're good to go so I want to point out one other thing this class is dishwasher safe it is freezer safe and it is microwave safe so you don't have to worry about anything like that if you need to heat something up or cool something down you can do that with this cup and it shouldn't have any problem so no that's up to ask is what is this cup can get in our mumbles of you without a doubt the Bowden Bistro this hand-blown cup gets a 5 out of 5 our mom's review I love it I think things taste better out of it which is my personal opinion and I just it's it's cool-looking the coffee stays hot and hotter longer this cold stuff stays colder longer and it's just a nice cup guys it's a nice fancy job anyways guys another episode mumbles I wanna thank you so much for joining me please smack that subscribe button smack that like button smash all those buttons now see you guys all in

glasses of what a purpose of drinking coffee because you can see you know the different layer of your cappuccino and it looks very beautiful okay and let's see where these are registered by PI design AG Switzerland so these glasses are made in Switzerland ok as you can see me in Switzerland so these are good quality glasses is not the one making China okay so definitely good quality you get what you pay for it that's why Bodom has a reputation of deliver good products as you all know Bodum has a really good french press and they made different glassware they are very very good quality that's why the price is you know on the high end but like I said you get what you pay for it so yep so I can't wait to you see sky systeme some cappuccino and latte stasis before I start making a cappuccino using this bottom double wall glass I want to mention about the feature of this glass as you can see that it's a little round thing under the bottom of this glass because this glass Kim breathe okay all right what does that mean the feature of this double wall thermal glass glass is made of heat-resistant mouth-blown bor\u00e5s rose borosilicate glass the double walls create a highly creative layer of insulation that keeps hot drinks hot without burning your fingers and coaching's cut with a messy condensation this double wall cast is the perfect frame for espresso cappucino beer and ice drinks the dish this glass is dishwasher safe and is durable enough to withstand years of dishwashing without clouding a vase of bowden thermal glass is the temperature safe and can be used for hot and cold beverages okay so let's put this glass to test and make some cappuccino I'm ready to brew some coffee but I mentioned earlier I wanted me some cappuccino but I thought since this is a 5 ounce glass I want to try to see if I can I want to make the espresso just to see the level come out when I use this glass and as you can see this is a deliah nespresso lattissima plus machine I have right over here so I'm going to I put I just put in a capsule and I'm going to test this one with the spread espresso ok so I'm going to press this button right here ok so let's go okay so as you can see it

for some botom double-walled latte glasses which I ordered a little while ago and I am very happy that I got these they're a little bit expensive this set right here was how it was like 30 or 40 bucks or something like that so these are not cheap certainly I mean this is something that you buy if you spend a great deal of time get that out of the back light if you spend a great deal of time making drinks at home and you know you want something that looks really cool look at that just looks great I was a little bit concerned about getting these because lots of complaints online about people saying that they're really really fragile they're always breaking and let's see now I got them over here stick keeping warm on top of my espresso machine and now that I have them and I'm actually you know like I'm able to hold this in my hand it is um uh it's a lot sturdier it's a lot firmer than I actually thought it was going to be it feels substantial I mean it is not I mean they say that the glass is very light and you really can't see in this video all that well but the glass is relatively thin but at the same time it feels hefty you know it's not it's not a very very light piece of glass I do have some concerns about the handle just because it just doesn't look like it's really attached by much I'm assuming that it is I'm assuming that it is actually decently sturdy but I still find myself holding it like this most of the time which is the biggest advantage these cups you can hold even the hottest friggin drink like this and it doesn't burn your hand you don't feel anything it feels really great um the other nice thing about it is that drinks like layer drinks like lattes or cappuccinos look wonderful in these things they really you know they come out looking really tasty they come out looking they come out looking like you know presentable like this is something that you would want to like show your neighbors and have some fun with so I am happy with my glasses they fit decently well on top of my espresso machine right there I've got no set of espresso cups right there and a little guy back here for maybe some late night drinks that I don't want put a whole shitload of espresso on but I have two of them they fit there these are 16-ounce he's I think I got seem to say on Donna no it doesn't um what were the the hell are these um they're there somewhere oh here we are they are 15 point two ounces okay so my 16-ounce was pretty good guess they're about 16 ounces which is a little bit bigger than I usually make my lattes my lattes are usually in the neighborhood of 10 to 12 ounces so it fits them pretty well um and yeah I I have to admit I would not have I I laid out the cash for these just because as you can tell by my no big setup right here I am I'm relatively big coffee nerd so I I figured that well what the hell I've got you know pretty much everything else out here including a banana plant I've got pretty much everything else out here I might as well lay out the cash for these and while I mean in comparison to other cups out there these things are you know like 15 to 20 bucks each and that is pretty expensive I it's it's obvious that a great deal of design and engineering they say their mouths blown I don't I guess that's cool they've got a little silicone like a butt plug on the back right here and apparently this is a valve of some sort and can't really you can kind of see it in this video they got that little dot right in the middle of the silicone which is apparently a small valve which allows air to either go in or go out which results in a constantly even pressure on the inside of the cup so a good deal of design went into this and a very good engineering it's an attractive cup but for 20 bucks each it is I don't think this is necessarily something that absolutely everyone should kind of like jump on board with I am happy with the purchase certainly I like it they look great up here yeah once again there are a little bit bulky so even on a relatively big espresso machine I could probably only fit you know maybe wedge three of them up there so if you're doing a lot of parties I would not recommend something like this I'd recommend something smaller you know like a little I was about a little Mikasa a porcelain or what is this uh just strong some kind of strong fine china this and the things that I was using beforehand actually I have one right here which is a this is I believe a twelve ounce just stoneware Bowl it's actually a bowl but you want a bowl shape for lattes I got this bowl shape at Target I think these things work they were something insanely cheap they were like a dollar fifty each so you could get you you could buy enough of these to give an entire party hot coffee drinks for the price of just one of those guys over there but like I said uh you know if you have everything else for your coffee set up and you want something that's going to look really good with drinks presented in it and it stops your hands from burning and you know just in general I mean it is a you know a good you know a good looking cup stupid autofocus come on you can do it there we go it got it you know good-looking cup I like it it's it feels a lot more solid than a lot of the reviews online we're complaining about I don't think it doesn't feel like it's going to break anytime soon it feels nice and solid the handle might be a little bit dodgy but other than that I don't really use it all that often but even then I think that if I held it by the handle all the time you would be safe the box says that it's safe and everything you can put in the microwave and put it in the freezer you can put it in the dishwasher over and over again so yeah goodbye I think not necessarily not necessary certainly way too expensive for it to be necessary but if you decide to drop the same change that I did on these I think that you'll also be as happy as I am", "E5FrQlH63ys": "well hello there amazon.com it's me bow Sheva sue coming today with a giant cup of coffee now my first impressions of this double walled mug was this is a big mug I thought this was going to be a puny little mug and I love my coffee in case you can't tell this is a full 16-ounce iced americano here at Starbucks yet the evil capitalistic giant of the world but it looks awesome doesn't it now I have actually used double walled glasses before in the past and what makes this superior to those is the following note the little handle it's big enough for not two not three but all four of my fingers to sit in like that with other glasses that I've tested out there and mugs I could only fit like three fingers sometimes even two fingers and this is just awkward when you're sipping a cup of coffee all morning you want to grab it with all four so whoever makes this well done to you for actually making this big enough for all four of my fingers to fit in it is dishwasher safe if you hand a cup of coffee to someone in this mug and instantly they're saying wow that's a cool cup of coffee it's completely sealed so water can't get inside um when it's hot liquids in there I can actually grab it and it doesn't burn me it's completely insulated these are by far my favorite cups favourite mugs out there by far I would highly recommend you pick up some of these if you are a coffee or a tea drinker

James Martin to make his second pitch to the Sharks on right now contracts of over 15 to 20 million dollars on private label projects with 711 with target with some of the biggest wine companies in

hundred million from their investors in 2015 including Richard Branson and Qualcomm Ventures doorbot has rebranded into the sleeker ring and as of February 2018 has been purchased by Amazon for more

company through Amazon it's been shown that online realtor's are dominant in the consumer market by getting rid of the middle person aka the real orders and distributors the product becomes far cheaper taking advantage of this opportunity john chavis developed the books company and pitched his online floral arrangement delivery service to the sharks in season 5 at the time the idea of delivering flowers was unheard of and it didn't seem very practical considering shipping would take a minimum of six days well at the time but what's most confusing about the pitch was Armas judgment over the name I'm pretty sure a nine year old could spell bucks Barbara anyways once the segment within two months time John received a 23 million from a small group of investors within two years that number grew to 44 million with one investor being Robert Herjavec after realizing the values books offered the customers hi sharks I'm Brooks I'm Tanner number 11 proof eyewear appearing in season

with proofs I were sales records as well as their unique product and while kevin O'Leary and Robert Herjavec made separate offers neither for what the brothers were looking for instead the Dayne brothers proudly forged ahead without shark funding pun intended by the way thanks to the group's 15 minutes of fame it allowed proof to earn more than two point five million in revenue the same year they've since opened a flagship store in BOS idaho and there are over 1,000 stores across north america and have reached their way into markets overseas those accomplishments are even more impressive

an opportunity the 20-something entrepreneur walked his way into shark tank in 2012 to pitch his ticket free coat check system which was surprisingly brave considering he had zero sales under his belt at the time despite this bump in the road however Derrick still received an offer from Mark Cuban for $200,000 but declined as he was only willing to offer 10% equity since his appearance on the show though Derrick's managed to pick up several loyal investors to help further the fund for coach acts as he has managed to maintain an impressive list of contracts with popular venues in New York City

that's a real product and apparently it tastes fantastic when chef Shawn Davis appeared in season two and proposes unique take on the shrimp burger the Sharks ate it up literally however as we form from watching shark tank a bad valuation can easily cost someone a deal in the end the shark scored content with the numbers so Davis left empty-handed it's not to say his head wasn't held high or praise over his product and even the Sharks were hopeful for Shawn success not long after a local group of investors watch Davis pitch and made him a better offer in less than a year chef big shake

so why not have some type of insurance for it coming in with a solution David are two so and Mike Kane pitched her idea for a tougher phone case which might still break but it comes with a guaranteed repair and replacement warranty and that's the beauty of cell helmet unfortunately the Sharks viewed it as a flawed system just waiting for fraudsters and the idea could be easily done by other much larger companies so their dreams much like our phone screens were shattered after the episode aired however our two so and Kane found their inboxes filled with offers from investors pounced on the

six Echo Valley meats a meat connoisseur in his own right David Alwyn has always had a knack for making good food and it's a skill that he displays strongly during his time on the show in season four the product was fantastic and the Sharks literally ate it up but in the end Allan's biggest problem proved to be his lack of skill as a presenter and entrepreneur sure he came in with a modest 190,000 in sales however he has no clear understanding of a business plan and barely knew his customer base unlike some entrepreneurs though David Allen took the Sharks feedback and turned it into an opportunity Echo Valley gained a massive market exposure after their appearance on Shark Tank racking up close to 1.4 million in sales the following year Alwyn took this as a chance to redeem himself did some major turnarounds by putting more focus into mail order and returned his shark tanks in season six to strike a deal with Mark Cuban don't you just love a happy ending hello my name is Jeff

valuable seconds from the time it takes to connect the hose to a fire hydrant potentially saving Wow Kuban expressed his own vision for the company though I made an offer to buy out Stroupe for 1.25 million alongside a three-year $300,000 employment contract and 7.5 percent royalties it goes without saying that he would have been well off for a long time and in the heat of the moment agreed to

there extensively colored line of lipsticks despite the questionable list of shades available the products all natural high-quality takes on things impress the sharks though due to the duo's lack of past and future projected sales along with a downright confusing marketing strategy the Sharks did a bunch don't waste them trying to sell lipstick on the other hand the girls pitch attracted the

recipe and the short tanks are no exception pitching their recipe for lynnae's gourmet pickles in season five while Laneige seller and a leek Houlihan got through to their stomachs it was lynnae's inability to differentiate themselves from other pickle brands that got them thrown out without a deal two years later in 2015 the company made huge efforts in rebranding into what is now miss pickles gourmet allowing Linnea to secede from presidency and allow ali kullin to take over majority as of now not much growth has occurred however miss pickles are available online through Amazon for 10

customizing the space from here to here is about two inches it does not leave you a lot of room now you could put something in this space here I think you have about 2 and 3/4 by about 2 and 3/4 in this space here and then on the back side of course the embossed or raised Yeti lettering I wouldn't laser etch a logo over that but I think right here is a good possibility if you're not too particular about which face the logo is on this mug is heavy it's 13 ounces that's the first thing I noticed when I picked it up is wow this this thing is substantial now I've been carrying around a 30 ounce forever and it's 16 ounces and I like the feel of something solid the coffee mug that I prefer in the house when I'm not using a Yeti is a ceramic coffee mug so I have been excited about these coming out and looking forward to having a Yeti style mug that's substantial and this one is it meets that need it's 14 ounces you're gonna have plenty of drink in here you're not gonna have to get up and run to the coffee maker every five minutes I love this handle it's they call it the full loop triple grip handle for whatever reason I guess because you can get your three fingers through here some people probably do too but you can hold it like a standard mug or you can just run your hand sir like this again because the outside of the mug doesn't really get hot that's also a comfortable position let's compare the the mug to the thirty ounce so again the lids are identical and if you look they're darn near the exact same shape from the top down and then where it starts to cut off that's that's where the mug ends so they just essentially took the 30 ounce and just sliced it off right here and added a handle to it another thing that I noticed is there is no seam if you look on this Yeti here there's a seam where the cap is on the bottom same thing on this one there is a cap this is the only Yeti that I'm aware of that does not have a seam they must have somehow figured out how to seal it somewhere else it is not apparent where they did that maybe they did it at the handle I have no idea I couldn't tell you if you have a Mac slider lid from a 30 ounce already you can always transfer it to this cup you don't have to go out and buy a new lid the lids are exactly the same size I will say this is not gonna fit into a cup holder for some people that's a big deal for some others it's not for me I'm gonna use the 20 ounce going back and forth to work I feel like that's a better option it doesn't have a handle on it but that's fine with me it's a it's a skinny enough cup it's a little bit taller it insulates well and it holds plenty of coffee this is my choice for muting this is gonna be like what they recommend for around the campfire I think cold mornings here at home it's going to be nice to have I also will have one at work I just like a standard old-style coffee mug this in the feel is going to meet that need but it's also going to retain the heat that is lost in a traditional ceramic style mug so lots to be excited about a few things to take note of but overall I think that yetee came out with a really nice mug design I have several other companies that make mugs that I've picked up over time and they're all 10 ounces twelve ounces they have very thin walls they don't they don't seem to be nearly as heavy-duty anywhere near as nice as these are I think that's all I have to say about it today thanks for watching and I hope you're having a great day [Music] you", "bEKceijw0l4": "[Music] [Music] [Music] you [Music]",

air by Java gear when I did this review of my favorite arrow press accessory the Java jug the fine people at Java gear also sent me a prototype of the javi air mug so full disclosure this mug was given to me free to test and to review but they didn't muzzle me and I could say what I want but Dave why should I trust you great question long before the javi air mug ever existed I've been a huge fan of drinking from these double-walled borosilicate glass mugs case in point I've got a fleet of 14 of these Bodum Covina glass mugs I've likely broken more glass mugs like this than most people own so above being a caffeine addict and drinking a lot of coffee I know the Javy airs competition really well so Dave why do you choose to drink from a glass mug there's like this Washington Post article that we have a link to below that says that drinking from a white mug makes your coffee stronger or they don't taste more bitter at least well that's true but that same article in The Washington Post also says that drinking from a clear mug makes your coffee taste sweeter and for this guy's sweet tooth that is probably why I was drawn to drinking from glass Java gear wasn't first to introduce this type of mug to the market and probably the most popular one is made by Bodom we have a huge lineup of borosilicate double walled glass mugs let's take a look at how the javi Eyre compares to the bottom Covina's that I know and love so well both of them are made out of not just any kind of glass is borosilicate glass and that's the same glass that we use in laboratory glassware and why is this so good one it can withstand thermal shock and that means you could have like a super hot liquid on one side of the glass and we could have like ice-cold liquid on the other side of the glass and it won't shatter on us the second thing is that is pretty good for chemical resistance it's easy to clean and they make it microwave and top rack dishwasher safe second point these are just any borosilicate glass mugs but they're double walled or glass mugs and that means there's insulation in there to keep your beverage hotter or colder depending what temperatures started at being insulated also means it doesn't sweat there's not going to be condensation running down and ruining your tabletop the java air and the modems also have just a wonderful workmanship they're smooth on all edges and you've got this great lip feel because of the folded edge of the insulated glass as well ok so they're last enough about the similarities how are these differ and what makes the javee air so special there's two things that sets the Jabby air above and beyond the competition the first thing is that it's got a much wider base at the bottom the teardrop shape of the Pahlavi nough is beautiful but it also makes it a little bit tippy especially when you're looking at the larger glasses like this 15 ounce I've literally cracked the glass when it tipped over and it just literally just cracked the lip and I was so sad well the wider base of the javee air makes it much more stable and extra bonus especially for people who love the Aeropress this makes it the perfect cup to press a single cup of coffee into love that the second thing that sets it apart and is pretty obvious is the handle and this matters a lot more than you would think it would matter because a lot of the ways that have broken these favino glasses is not when I'm actually drinking it but it's when I'm washing them in the sink and even though they do say they're dishwasher safe on the top rack I hand wash all of my glass but when you put soap on this it becomes extremely slick with the Jabby air it's got this handle which gives you great stability and super tip even when you're washing it in the sink I would recommend holding it by the handle so that you don't break more glass like I have now what are the cons well one thing is that it only comes in this 11 ounce size now the Pahlavi nough comes in a whole range of sizes from little tiny shot glasses that we own to this 12 inch which is a good standard size to like you know giant 15 ounce cups but it's a good compromise for size but I do wish that they will make a bigger one for my tea addiction that I've started as well the second con really isn't the fault of the jayveer but it's just glass breaks it's fragile but we knew that going in so real the easy solution by multiple cups like me I'm not really kidding so that's the Jabby air by java gear it's elegant it's functional and it's a great quality build links are in the show notes

happy drinking god bless", "gK5E--Sk-Mg": "hi guys and welcome back to my channel thanks so much for tuning in and once again if you haven't subscribed please do subscribe I'm still trying to get to my magical 1,000 subscriber target I'm actually over 800 now which I'm really really happy about as of this Saturday B I believe it's the 29th of September so I'm very happy about that you may have realized that I've been away for some time life is just going in the way I've been very busy at work very busy home my mom just moved house I've been helping her trying to sort some things out there with her house and just generally life just you know not being able to just sit down and film and more importantly to be able to edit the video now the last video I hadn't mentioned I also went on my wedding anniversary in Barcelona which was beautiful and yeah it's just been since then I've just been so busy but I want to try and sit down and film some videos today this one is slightly different as you can see we're in a different location we're in the kitchen and what I wanted to do is because all the stuff I'm going to show you obviously this is a the crews a haul from TK Maxx so I don't want to take crockery upstairs to my other you know where you normally see me film I thought it's better for me to stay in the kitchen so as soon as I've done this video I can put these things in the dishwasher and then get them in the cupboard so yeah you're actually in my kitchen or make now now this is not what I usually do it's not home fragrance it's not candles it's not luxury this is home when I believe I just did of home where hold from Zara home in Barcelona so we have been managing I'd say with our crockery at home with what we had you know donations from mum from our both our parents you know I've had stuff I had before but I just wanted to put my own stamp on things so I knew that after some time I'll be looking for for some the cruise a and some other things I've got then B as well crockery which are just really high-quality brands that will last for years I'm also going to change pots and pans because again I've got mom's old pans we should have really served their purpose over the years but I think it's time for me to get my own set of pots so you know there comes a time in every woman's life and man's life and you just need your own set of pots and pans and also the thing is what this stuff I have is kind of a lot of the older stuff there's a lot of technology advancements now in cookery where so you can get better nonstick stuff you can get the cast iron stuff I love the crews I have always loved it from when they only had volcanic orange you could only get in orange when I was a kid but now they have a plethora of colors so the color I've chosen for my kitchen as you can see in the back there it's kind of a aqua blue a color like a teal and that's generally the theme in the house it's the theme of some of my other stuff that I have and it was actually my wedding bridesmaids things in the wedding colors tiffany blue so I like that type of color the crew they do two types of blue like they do a kind of Caribbean blue we talked about one item I for one item Caribbean blue and a teal color so I was down at my local TK Maxx I think was last weekend I went in for what did I go into for maybe a throw or something I just I went to have a look because I had an excuse my way to happen because I had been in TK Maxx for some time and then came out buying lots of stuff and I also made an online order and that's my invoice so if you are familiar with the brand in the cruise a it's a French cookery book where a brand they do crockery they do cookware and they're just really great quality it is on the pricier side so when I saw it in TK Maxx which as you know TK Maxx or TJ Maxx as you have in the States it's a kind of a discount store I was kind of am but I was like look I'm gonna just buy this because it's an investment and all of these items these are crockery so these are stuff full necessarily putting on this on the stove it's for kind of oven and you know keeping things warm I thought I'm just gonna splash out because I'm not going to regret this so what I ended up getting is lots of stuff for the oven lots of stuff around the house and I will be buying some more and marks could they have crockery as well so the first thing I'm going to show you so it's a combination of what I bought in my local TK Maxx and online so you can actually go on the website and they will have some of these stuff they have other color they have red they have I believe great but one gray item you put black they've got white so my kitchen theme is kind of the teal bluey greeny colour gray and white those are the colour so that's why so I'll buy and so most of this type or other in that color scheme so the first thing I'm going to show you is what's in front of me and I've taken the label off this pretty teapot it's la Cruz a you can see it's filled with the label on and they have their emblem they're just a teapot quite a big one and then it has that at the bottom so [Music] $12.99 for this 12 pounds 99 is around $15 and the original price for these I'm sure they're upwards of like 30 pounds 38 pounds so that's a real saving there so that's the teapot you're gonna have to shuffle around I'm gonna show you the month so this is the match markings label still on that one as you can see the recommended price is 15 pounds and I got mine for $7.99 that's the mark same color same really strong really heavy earthenware so again I've got lots of months that I'm mismatched all over the place and they're all old mugs they're kind of what I brought from my single like what my husband's brought from his single life and we just need to get rid of those get those to the goodwill or charity shop and get our own so that's that one and I also got one in the gray as well so that's you know when I'm fed like the blue eyes you to the grey and these are things that will last for years again they've still got the label one thing I don't like about TK Maxx is their labels are so difficult to take off so I'm gonna have to scrub that to get that off the residue but yeah this is the Marg and you get a little book you get a booklet for all of their items that's you can tell this really good quality so they give you a little booklet care book clip and I'm gonna go on the website and buy more of these so I'll have about six and maybe four of these and I'm gonna show you one more thing I'll show you a similar like I said I have Denby and this mug is from the den be set so these are all as you can see in a similar color family just different shades of teal and blue so yeah I'd get more of these as well these are really nice Denby is in a really good crockery brand and I've actually should have done a haul when I bought all that stuff I actually bought lots of it um from discount websites so all of this crockery you can actually find on discount websites they're quite expensive if you go to the usual stores like John Lewis and you know Selfridges reveries or online to buy start from the manufacturer but if you do buy them in discount stores you get a lot more of and I'm just gonna fight about washing machines again right the next thing I got with these I got six of these ramekins and ramekins are always good they're good for like dips they're good for making little desserts in and then you gonna cruise a again and these are flappable so I've got six of these my money show me two and these were there's one no price okay these are really good these were these were $5.99 the ramekins can see right there and if you did buy them from the store it would be twenty pounds so that's a really significant saving and you can just stack them in your cupboard so at the moment I'm gonna glass ramekins from my mom and they're very small but these ones are really good and if you want to just have you know maybe a small portion of rice you want to see how much you're having can use that and kind of measure your food as well and I think there's so many uses for this and I'm glad I've got these the next thing I'll show you guys is this oil jug look at this oil jug so this is a la Cruz a little jug that's the back of it it is $9.99 again and it was 28 the recommended price is 28 so if you had to go on the new cruise a website this will be 28 pounds and I have checked it and I'll put links to these as well right from the really cruise a site and and yeah again it's got a little booklet on how to use it so this is also what I'm going to do with this is use this as a decorative oil jug I'll put my olive oil in it and I'll just leave it by the cooker because we use olive oil a lot or we can take it to the table drizzle it doesn't look out of place it just looks really cute nice oil jug and again $9.99 and I got these salt and pepper shakers this is what it is regular salt and pepper they've got the top so I think this one is pepper this is salt yeah so we the other way around but yeah we'll figure it out but they're really nice as well I look for is they they've got I like the branding that they have at the bottom and it's very easy to use dysplastic there to to get the product in so you need a funnel and that's it that's what you do so I need to wash all of these that was salt and pepper shakers were let's have a look I'm just checking my seeds $9.99 so there's a $9.99 perfect they're very useful and I'm also going to buy and I might have to spend more money on this though the salt and pepper grinders that they have is also they do in the same color so with Lu Cruiser you can buy everything in the same color family and it matches I just like the fact that it all matches now I'm gonna go onto the know one more one more small one I've got this really cute this is what made me fall in love with the whole range really cute hot oven dish so everything is made with love so love they really like this so I wish I could find another one so I'm going to look for one more in another TK Maxx because it's not on your website but it's so cute isn't it the little car remember Kim it's adorable and that one was $6.99 from 20 pounds so you can really see how many save how much savings you can get by buying a max amazing job so this mug isn't going because you can see it's in the color family let me get to the heavy stuff so this is the other thing that I said is look crews a but it's not in this thing blue this is Caribbean blue and this one is the teal blue so this is slightly lights I did when I ordered it I thought it was the same color as those bikes not so this one how much I think this was $12.99 give me yeah this is ten pounds this mixing job and it's about believe 30 and again it's got its little care card over here it says mixing jugs it holds two liters in here so you could either use it for drinks on the table or you could use it to mix you know cake mix you could use it for mixing whipped cream whatever it is it's a lovely mixing bar and it's got a handle so very handy again it's got the stamped underneath and inside it's cream so this is a really substantial piece of crockery I'll put that over there the next thing I'll show you is what I really want to get more of these and casserole pots so this is for the oven this is an amazing casserole pot and again it's got a little cruise a this is the 22 centimeter pot and see nice lid that's inside so you can make some lovely casseroles and it's got the stamp you can see there it cost me $24.99 however the recommended retail price it's about 48 pounds 49 pounds so if you go on their website 49 pounds and yeah so this is Aden where you can use this to make your you know your suits your stews your casseroles if you need is slow cooked in the oven you can use and this is wearing autumn and it's this is casserole see we'll be making a nice comfort food with you know lots of chunky vegetables in there and and sweet potato and you know meats just stuff to make you feel warm and cozy yeah so I'll be using that next things I'm going to show you are more oven where so I've got a couple of sizes of these I've got this oven dish so this is gray I'm gonna to be making a shepherd's pie tomorrow which I'll try and put on my Instagram and if you watch my Instagram you'll see that I do cook sometimes this one is $12.99 and the retail price is 35 so it's a really good saving so that's kind of a square one I would call this kind of the lasagne bow this was 1699 and the retail price is $49.99 so you really make lots of savings nice sturdy handles and you can use that in your oven again in the cruisin on the bottom stoneware I've got one I've got two of this thing I think I got two of the same yeah equip this as well this is the same thing as the other square one so I got two square ones and you can just stack them in the cupboard as well that's the end of the la cruz a stuff I did also get some little bit some other items which will match the kitchen theme I got this round baking tray and it's again it's an oven where this was $7.99 you guys very very cheap I'm really happy about this price it's really sturdy you know it's oven to table ware so the great stuff about other two tableware is that you can cook whatever you want to cook in here and rather than have to dish it into another Bowl or like serving plates you can just take it to the table and the food will also stay warm as well so it's really handy to have these and I've also got I bought this one is by classic ceramics similar duck egg blue color that support this $4.99 and the retail price is 10 where you save 50% on this one never heard of them before by just really liked it I saw it on their website me tonight say just some utensils I got myself a whisk that was $2.99 and I thought I don't have a whisk let me get a whisk whisk cream and what's the last thing I got that I want to show you guys I got this bodom reusable cup and this is just because I I saw a lady take this on a plane when I traveled I think a few months ago and what she said makes sense if you take this with you and you go on a plane rather than get your coffee or your tea in one of their paper cups and you know waste paper cups or plastic cups just give them this and just keep rinsing it out and you can just use it and that's more environmentally friendly I want to cut down and using single-use plastics I've said that to my husband he uses a lot of plastic bottles and I'm trying to get in on to using glass bottles I actually what I actually did I'll show you guys this is a really easy way what I did is I bought these I call him two of these Voss water bottles because the thing is he likes sparkling water on I like spill so he always buys the fizzy sparkling water I can't drink that so I have still water bottles in the fridge this or I always have cold water in glass bottles so I wanted to encourage him to use glass so we've got these Voss water bottles so he's got this sighs I'm gonna gain their biggest size but all he has to do is just refill them you know there's no need for me to do anything just refill the bottle it's glass it's reusable and I think this costs about two pounds so for two pounds you can have a bottle that you can use and using use and you could buy the large you know the supermarket's label you can get supermarket label things like fizzy water and you can buy that for like 49 people like two liters and then just fill up your bottles so that's what I'm doing to try and do my bit for the environment and minimize I want to say stop one bringing my the use of single-use plastics so yes that was why the crews a halt thanks so much for watching let me know what you think and let me know what you guys buy for your kitchen what else should I be looking for next on my list will be the the crews a cast iron cookware that I can use on the stove and in the oven they're very heavy and they're very expensive so I will be checking out gun wolf keys in Portsmouth which has in the crews a outlet so I can get those a little bit cheap I'm not trying to pay 300 pounds for one pot which is how you cruise a rolls so yeah watch out for that you guys and I'll tell you what kind of savings I go I'll try and leave any links below that I can from my haul if there's anything left always check your local TK Maxx they always have deals they always have bargains and this video is not sponsored I just go there this is somewhere that I go and I like to go to buy my good quality kitchenware also check out their pots and pans they're actually really good and things like mortar and pestle I sort of marble mortar and pestle last time I went there but I didn't buy it because it was just be too heavy it's had a lot as you can imagine so yeah that's all I want to share with you guys give me a thumbs up let me know eat into this video and I'll see you in the next one bye guys", "1vbKRcs7v2Y": "[Music] one of the most misunderstood things about coffee is how important the ratios are and by using the wrong cups you're almost guaranteed to throw off these ratios leaving you with a different kind of coffee than the one you were trying to prepare that's why i've made this video to help you get the perfect flavor out of your coffee with something so simple as just choosing the right kind of coffee cup i used to use this kinto cup for most of my coffees until i realized that the volume that this cup can hold is different from every kind of coffee i was trying to make and i see this problem in cafes all around tokyo as well where using the wrong cups can lead you to get a radically different kind of coffee than the one that you ordered i went to a cafe here in tokyo recently where i ordered a cappuccino and my friend ordered a latte and when they arrived they both had the same cup so they had to tell us which one was the latte this doesn't make any sense as there were different kinds of drinks which means that for certain one of those drinks was wrong the same thing happens all the time with macchiatos and flat whites because of the definitions of these drinks and how cafes choose to make them you may have seen some charts or images online of how to do different kinds of drinks but they usually don't give you enough information to make these drinks correctly so let me show you all of the cups that i use at home to make each of the types of drinks and how those cups help me get the perfect ratio every time [Music] let's start off with the most popular one which is a cafe latte this is a 300 milliliter drink with a 40 to 50 milliliter shot of espresso and 250 mils of lightly aerated steamed milk so if you're using a cup that's too small you'll end up with a slightly stronger drink which changes the flavor of a latte much worse than this is when you use a much bigger cup and you end up having the espresso flavor completely drowned out in a sea of milk this completely ruins the flavor of a cafe latte and if i wanted just some hot milk i'd ask for a baby chino now i have two cups that i use for this i have my lavaramix egg and the not neutral lino both of these cups are really beautiful and they have a really nice quality and thickness to them it also really helps that both of these cups are designed with latte art in mind so it's much easier to pour really beautiful designs on the wide brim and also the curve is just right for the milk to go underneath the surface when you don't want to start doing your design yet this isn't the biggest deal when you're a beginner at latte art because really you can pour latte in just about any cup but when you're working on a specific design and you want to do something special it really helps to have this very wide brim so that you have a big canvas to work on the first cups i bought for doing lattes were actually these vargan cups from ikea and they're actually the same ones that my sister uses in her cafe the courtyard in papworth near cambridge in the uk they are really nice cups and they hold the correct weight for a latte but i've mostly been using my professional cups like the not neutral and the lavaramics cup since i got them the next one is a cappuccino which is also a misunderstood drink often i find in chain coffee shops that when i order a cappuccino i tend to get a latte with just a lot more foam however when i was in italy last year i really enjoyed having cappuccinos every morning and enjoying that drink because the italians really know how to make a good cappuccino when i make cappuccinos at home i use these cups that i got as a gift from a friend and they're just the right size about 200 milliliters a 200 milliliter cup is perfect for a cappuccino which is about a one to two ratio espresso to foamed milk now the difference between the foam for a latte and for a cappuccino is something that a lot of people get wrong with the latte you want to foam 10 to 20 increased volume from the starting milk but with the cappuccino it should be about 40 or 50 increased volume when you've steamed it for this reason i often use a smaller jug when steaming milk for a cappuccino because it should only be 80 to 100 milliliters of milk and the actual foaming will increase the size so it fits the cup if you want to measure your milk using the right cup will help you gauge whether you've got the right amount of steamed milk for the cappuccino [Music] whenever i order a flat white anywhere in the world i usually end up with a latte now there's a reason for this and it's probably because many cafes want to offer you the difference between a small a medium and a large drink which you can't really do well with a flat white a flat white should be served in a cup that's slightly smaller than a cappuccino one and i found that this one from acme is perfect about 150 milliliters your flat white should also be lighter foam even than a latte and so i find that if i do the milk right i can get really interesting fine designs with my latte art or should i call it flat white art [Music] this makes a flat white a stronger drink than a latte but without the bubbly foaminess of a cappuccino and it's actually become one of my favorite ways to have coffee it's stronger than a latte and it's super smooth and you don't end up going through a lot of milk like you would with lattes i actually had never heard of a cortado until it was mentioned by a character on one of my favorite shows billions i would love a cortado it's like a macchiato but with more foam microfoam silkier one of my favorite cafes to work out here in tokyo actually does a really good cortado so i've been ordering it from there and i've been trying it myself at home at first i didn't have the right size cup for a corotato and it always looked a little bit strange to me pouring this into a cappuccino cup and leaving a lot of space at the top but recently i got this beautiful cup from not neutral called the vero this is the vero glass and it's the perfect size for a cortado which should be a one to one ratio of espresso to steamed milk look at how thick the bottom of that is since i started making cortilos i always make them whenever i have really fancy expensive or delicious coffee beans because you really get to taste the espresso with the nice smoothness of the milk a macchiato is one of the most misunderstood coffee drinks because of the misuse of this word by certain coffee chains it's a very small drink and i find that if i order it here in cafes in tokyo that they will show me a cup and they'll say are you sure you want this it's kind of funny but i can understand if people order a macchiato thinking they might get a bigger drink and then being really surprised when they get a kind of espresso with just a light amount of foam from steamed milk for a macchiato i usually go with a two to one ratio of espresso to foamed milk so it's a strong espresso flavor with just a little bit of milk on the top this fits with the italian meaning of the word macchiato which means marked so it's essentially an espresso that is marked with a little bit of milk some coffee places will actually just get a teaspoon and put a little bit of foamed milk on top but actually i usually prefer to use lightly steamed milk for a long time i've been using these really nice cups that i got from a friend as a gift from vietnam but recently since i got them i've been using these ones from acme that look really really pretty and have a

should i take it off do i look like i'm on the hallmark channel helen's hallmark holiday gift guide grab yourself a cup of tea cozy on up it's going to be a wild ride hello and welcome back to my channel it is full-blown christmas mode in our house it was christmas mode starting mid-november today i wanted to make a video that will just be hopefully a very helpful gift guide as we near the holidays hopefully it will help you make some shopping decisions and score you and your loved ones some great gifts so let's get into it the first item that i wanted to add on my gift guide list is this mug this iconic mug was gifted to me last year from zack it's a jonathan adler mug i think it's just called the face mug but i get so many questions about it and i looked it up and it's still available so i'm going to link everything in the description box for you because it's just such a unique looking mug i'm drinking some tea right now cheers so if you're looking for a really good mug i highly recommend you look on anthropology's website because their mug game is strong 90 of our mugs are from anthropology we just like to collect them throughout the year these monogrammed ones we got the special black ones they are still available in white and then this monogrammed one is also still available it has like gold detailing and this is where i store my tea so this is a little matching canister another quick thing i want to throw in there it's a gift that i've got for my dad two christmases in a row now it's the ember self-heating mug i don't know if that's the exact title but it's by ember and it's a mug that is temperature regulated so you can set the temperature that you want your drink to be at and it will stay there it's actually kind of insane how well it works he loves it because my dad has to have his coffee really hot so if you know any coffee drinkers that are very particular about the temperature of their coffee this is the perfect gift next thing i think would make a really great gift is wine glasses like proper fancy adulthood wine glasses i got these for us because we just had like mismatched random wine glasses up until this point it's such a lovely thing to have as a really really quality wine glass we got these ones they're like the extra extra large from creighton barrel you would think they'd be super delicate but they're actually like indestructible because they haven't broken yet which is kind of insane switching up the tea what time is it it's one wine o'clock it's nine o'clock somewhere i love smart home things this is an automatic soap dispenser from simplehuman it's a stainless steel gold color so beautiful and it works so well the lower you put your hand the more soap dispenses and just makes life way better so i'm gonna go wash this off now this is like a really solid gift guide but there's one gift on this list that is far superior to the rest and it is my sweat set collab with feet i designed this sweat set and it just launched if i were to receive a sweat set that was this soft my whole year would be made the only thing is if you want to get this in time for christmas hurry up in order don't leave it to the last second because we are working fast to get orders out but there are delays with everything going on in the world this is the best gift on this whole list okay next item on the list of course my skincare set capsule with sonia de carr which you've probably heard me yabber on about before but it would make such a great gift for anyone who is looking for a new skincare regimen anyone who's battling with any skin issues right now and i wanted to include it not just because it's mine but also just because i believe so much in these products okay next few items on my list are affordable and awesome gifts for anyone in my opinion they can all be found on amazon this is like the iconic insulated cup that has i think like eighteen thousand five star reviews on amazon for good reason this thing is huge keeps your water cold for hours and hours and it's just a beautiful cup next this water bottle changed my hydration levels for good a lot of my friends too we all drink out of this water bottle it's a half gallon i think this would make a great gift especially if you know anyone who is just not hydrated enough my friend katie she like would never drink water ever it was like a running joke that she's just constantly dehydrated because she hated water and then she got one of these during quarantine and now she's hydrated thanks to this water bottle so this water bottle changes lives for anyone who's looking for an idea for a gift that is really thoughtful but maybe not as expensive or as flashy you could get someone a polaroid camera but it's just such a special way to capture moments together we have like a whole polaroid wall in our kitchen and it's just a great way to collect memories so i thought it would be so cute to get somebody a polaroid camera with some film oh this one has okay i have one photo left so i'm gonna take a selfie boom cute inexpensive thoughtful gift idea we use like these little gold magnets to display our polaroids because we have a metal backsplash on our kitchen that can be another cute idea so my next gift idea inexpensive and thoughtful is a letter board we have this one that i display in our kitchen and i love to change out the quote on it this one is actually from a uk site and it's still available so i'll link it but i'm also going to link some other versions that are within the us next gift idea for anyone who likes to make cocktails at home cocktail mixers pre-made with all the quality ingredients that you need to make like a really yummy drink these the ingredients in this are delicious and really good quality so there's so many different cocktails that you can make these are just a few of their flavors that they have [Music] a live plant would make such a cool gift for somebody who's trying to get more life and greenery in their house so there's some sites where you can order just a live plant and a few of them are the sill loomscape and then house plant shop house plant shop has more affordable plants but they don't come with like cute aesthetic pots all of our plants most of them are actually from house plant shop i'll link some options also bloomscape you can pick like a beautiful already grown plant and it'll come in like a aesthetic pot which is great so you don't really have to do any work my next gift idea is very 20 20. this is a gold mask chain this is from a brand called discover night they did a collaboration with billy simone i think i'm saying that right and this is just a really easy way to keep your mask on you while you're out and about it's very chic this mask is like a 100 silk mask that is also made by discover night another solid and quick and easy gift idea is just to get somebody a really nice body care set this one is from way with their body butter body wash and scrub these ones from necessary are my favorites as you know just really good quality and something maybe that someone wouldn't splurge on themselves because it is a little bit of a more luxurious item i don't know what that was next gift idea this is a little bit of a nicer bigger ticket item and this is also what i'm going to be getting my brother so hopefully he doesn't watch my youtube channel youtube videos this is called a theragun it's basically a muscle recovery massager and it's really really great these days when you don't have access to a massage it does an amazing job at just recovering your body from a workout anyone who works out a lot who lifts weights or who's active would really appreciate the skin here's a gift that you can't go wrong with boy or girl young or old really good slippers these are zacks so i'm just going to show them and then put them far away from me wow i'm just assuming they stink anyway these are from ugg ugg makes incredible slippers shocker we all know that so men slippers from ugg that's an idea and then these are my beautiful slippers these ones are my favorite everyday slippers these are from emu australia they have them in all different colors i thought that the white would get more dirty and it actually hasn't so if you're looking into white slippers and worried that they'll get dirty these ones actually don't get too dirty these ones are from ray the label they're actually like slides slide slippers and they're so soft and they're kind of platform so beware they're a little more like work to wear these ones are comfy these ones are fashion so this next gift is something that you only really appreciate as an adult or at least i do um more and more as i get older it is quality pjs i got these beautiful pjs from lunaia or lanya i'm gonna probably just butcher their name but they make beautiful silk pajamas so i got this oversized tea and these cute little shorts such good quality pjs next gift idea i'm mentioning this because i just noticed that this anthropology blanket which i've had for years it's so beautiful it's really unique looking with all these different pom-poms and patterns i noticed that anthropology just listed this blanket in some different colors which are more neutral which i actually think i prefer and this is just a really really good blanket we've had it for years it's held up so nicely so a cute blanket makes a really good gift the next gift this is more of a big ticket item it's one of my favorite additions to our office it is my acrylic dry erase calendar i found this calendar on etsy and to be honest i think i paid way too much for it because i just looked up what it's going for now and i think it's going for like 160 dollars for the big one and i think i paid like 400 so they must have lowered their prices but i get so many questions about this board i have the big one that shows the whole month but i noticed that target has some smaller ones that are even cheaper so i'm going to link the target ones and i'm going to link the one that i have and you can kind of shop around but for anyone who wants to give someone a gift of organization and just a really beautiful piece to add to an office space i think an acrylic calendar would be a beautiful gift my next gift idea is apl shoes i have gifted apl to several family members and these shoes are great they're so comfortable and so lightweight they're a little bit more expensive it's more of a splurge item to purchase for yourself they also make really cute shearling slides mine are already dirty so maybe get a darker color than this one these are apl shoes zach has a pails too so great for girls or guys next on my gift list somebody who's made quite a few appearances on my youtube thus far no real big surprise here i wanted to include my haram juicer i think a juicer while a very expensive gift would still make such a great gift especially for anyone who you know is going to be spending a lot of time at home in the new year wanting to get on some new healthy habits juicing is one of my favorite healthy habits i will also link some more inexpensive ones because there's a whole array of different juicer categories and different juicer prices the next item on my gift list is an electric bike from blue jay bikes i absolutely adore this bike zach and i both have these it's an e-bike it was created by a girl in san francisco who wanted a bike that would be able to go up a hill with no trouble e-bikes existed but none of them were cute enough so she created a cute ebike and i love it because i can just cruise around on it with it on the highest mode and i put in like no effort but zach also likes to do it on low mode to get a good workout in it's just so beautiful honestly it's such a good bike we've had it for a year now we actually got it last christmas it really is just such a solid solid bike and i know we're all looking for outdoor activities these days just wanted to shout out blue jay bikes they're awesome they just came out with a white color which i think is so cute so go check them out bye i just got new sheets from this brand the citizenry this is like me having a total adulthood moment but i think sheets would make such a beautiful gift like really really nice sheets so the ones that i got are their stone washed french linen so linen is typically a little more structured and less comfortable but this linen you can kind of see how beautiful it is i got this beautiful adobe color for you know winter fall and winter i maybe i'm the only one who thinks that sheets are cool but i think it would make a good gift so okay last item on the gift list not sure if this is just super obvious or not but air pods not just air pods but air pod covers because i think that it's such a cute way to personalize your air pods this is like a little leather sticker cover that i got for zach and i you can get them personalized mine has an h sax has a z this is from a brand called chaos so i will link if they still have it and then i just added this chain to it so it's easy to grab this is my last item on this gift guide i will link everything in the description like i said one more thing that i'm so excited to announce zach and i are going to be releasing our version of presets we are going to be teaching about how we edit our photos and actually giving you the tools to do so in our specific style which is very unique and has taken us so long and by us i mean it's taken zach it's honestly been such a work in progress so we're having a hard time just being okay with putting them out there because we want them to be perfect but i'm not sure if they will be ready by the time this video is live but i'm going to add a link in the description where you can give us your email if you want to be notified when they are available because they're going to be coming very soon and i don't know exactly

just in case i didn't know when she posted now i do so see ya gotta go bye [Music] you", "_pfMbY_16aY": "[Music] hi guys uh just a quick video for you today i know you all wanted the artillery review but uh this one needed doing two and these glasses the boredom pavina espresso glasses that i mentioned i got a bit sucker punch with when i ordered them off amazon i'll leave the links to where they are on amazon in the description and but i ordered them and they came from china so they've only just showed up today and you've we've obviously had an unboxing and a review of these three but now this one's arrived i just thought i'd show you them on the machines a couple of people did ask me can you put them in the machines to see if they fit because some of the measurements are quite tight as to whether they will actually fit in your machine so i thought it would be good to show you that today and just so you know for sure if you're going to buy them i've got four different sizes these are the pavina ones but obviously you can check the measurements of those on the bottom side and if they match up to other glasses that they do then you'll know they'll fit and so let's just try them out i've got the um this is 0.08 liter size that's espresso then we've got the 0.25 liter size the 0.35 liter size and the 0.45 liter size now i was wondering whether they'd fit an auto um from a virtual machine because they're quite big on it possibly maybe i should give that a try just to find out what we'll get out of the day if you want to do that for today we're just going to show you if they fit the machines or not let's see so we'll start with obviously the espresso oil cup is going to let's just move these out the way a second the espresso cup is going to fit all of them so it just goes in like that nicely you move the shelf on the virtual plus or on your virtual whatever virtual machine you've got fits in nicely and onto the pixie over to the satisfaction it's obvious this wouldn't it um on the shelf though that's interesting i mean it's going to fit on there as we linked it on the shelf but yeah it fits nicely in those and it'll be the same with the pro and but the ones you're probably worried more about if i move that another way now are these bigger ones so this is the 0.25 liter size obviously we can move the shelf again and they don't fit nicely under there then on the virtual that's a virtual plus the sensor mini you do slide nice in 0.25 remember liter size pixel going nicely ct's on here on your ground on grand latissimo we have a bit of a problem it's not a major problem but you do have to tilt it a bit because it's just catching on that frother there and it doesn't really go any higher i don't know if you can see that it just just catches a little bit but you can easily tilt it and get it out let's try it on this one so it just goes under the creative plus there let's try it on the pro yeah same again just goes into the pro so that's the 0.25 liter size now we'll move on to the 0.35 liter i'm guessing we're gonna have to move this shelf again will it go in there yeah so it goes nicely again into the virtual plus the essentia mini obviously it's not going to fit with that on we take that away fits nicely under there i'll leave that off because we're only getting bigger aren't we the pixie it goes under there and they're not too light that it's not you know the shelf isn't going to collapse down but it doesn't with a travel mug so it's not going to do with these boarding glasses either is it but yeah definitely not there same with this of t's we're getting too big for this now um let's see what it does in here so it's nice fit for that isn't it nice fit for the lattissima move this over use that in a second shelf back in [Music] so it does go nicely onto the virtual and the creatista plus remember all these names creative plus i'm just gonna circle around here actually um but you see this is the where we mentioned about the different sizes of the machines the creative process the plus the creators to pro the difference in what you can fit on and how easily they fit on together but they are quite tight aren't they but it does fit if we just pop the shelf back in on here you'll see it's there so you can easily fit both on without having to cram them together but they do fit in now the bigger this is probably the one you're worried about the most if you've come to this video i would imagine it's probably because you're wondering whether these big glasses will fit uh so let's move the shelf one more time get rid of these shells for a second so it goes nicely look into the virtual plus you've no chance with the sensor mini however i haven't commented suggest that you can just lift it you can put a book underneath if you want to does it lift up quite easily just stick a book underneath and then it would go off but it's whether you want to be doing that it won't go into the pixie but it will adjust if you tilt it look but it will you've got to tilt it a bit to get it in and out nice into the cities and this is why i like the cities because you'd never have to really do anything you never have to do any tilting it fits all all cups really and same again here we've got this probably just the farther it doesn't go any higher and so just if we just tilt it a little bit then it will go in um but yeah you're only gonna you're only gonna tilt it a little bit so hopefully drink won't go everywhere sweet easter plus same again just got to tilt it that little bit look and then the creates the pro oh we're good so they created that bit that would have been a bit bigger the machine you've got no problems fitting that really tall bottom glass 0.45 so we've looked at espresso size 0.25.35.45 i was asked to do this video and i think it will be helpful for people because it's difficult to know sometimes especially when you're there with a tape measure and you're looking at it thinking oh it's millimeters will it will it not do i want to order them well now you know hopefully you can order with confidence the veiner glasses boredom link in the description to amazon and also

the good morning sunshine with the avocados this is 11 ounce which is actually a size that I really end up loving I used to think I would only want the 15 ounce because it's the big one but here's the size differential it's actually they're both really nice for different needs you want to only pour your whole pot of coffee but in this one wanna go or half putting this one so this is the creative biz hashtag mug and I just love the way this came out I just want to show you the close-up and I'm not gonna have time to show you the other mugs right now but I will in the future okay so talk to you soon", "B_1Qf-5rPBo": "- [Barbie] Are you ready? Open them up, ta-da! (suspensful music) What a curious combo. (upbeat techno music) A Barbie production. We have Malia and Sophia,\nstarring in today's challenge. Introduce yourselves. - Hi, I'm Sophia,\nI'm 12 years old, and I've been\ncooking for 8 years. - My name is Malia. I'm 11 years old and I've\nbeen cooking for 6 years. - As usual, because\nyou should always cook with the help of an adult, our Executive Chef,\nKim, is here too. So, you may have noticed\nmy brand new Bistro cart. I take it all over Malibu\nto serve up yummy treats. I want you to help me come\nup with some new items I can feature on my\nBistro cart menu. Are you ready? - [Cooks] Yeah! - Cool beans. (crowd laughs) Here's the deal. The Bistro cart is all\nabout meals on the go, so no forks, knives, or spoons. Malia, are you up\nfor the challenge? - Yes. - Sophia, how do you think\nyou'll do on this challenge? - Great. - Let's roll in\nthose mystery boxes, and see what we've got\ninside, open them up. (suspenseful orchestra music) Ta-da! We've got a jar of roasted\nred peppers, ground turkey, and some cheddar\nflavored crackers. What a curious combo. What do you think Malia? - Wow, I don't know what to\ndo with the cheese crackers. This is gonna be hard. - Sophia, is there an\ningredient that you think is gonna be a challenge? - I'm not quite sure what to do with the roasted\nred peppers yet. - Well, I believe\nin both of you. You will have 30 minutes to\ncreate some fabulous food fast. Ready, set, roll, I am so\npumped to see what Sophia, and Malia create\nfor my Bistro cart. Malibu better be ready for\nsome exciting new flavors. Talk to me Sophia, what do\nyou plan on whipping up? - I'm going to make\nturkey sliders. Malia, what do you have\nplanned with your dish? - I'm making turkey fajitas. - Nice. - Hey, Sophia, what are you\ndoing with those crackers? - I'm going to crush them up\nand put them into my meat. I'm also going to do that\nwith the roasted red peppers, so I think the crunch will\ngive it a really nice texture. - These girls are\nowning this kitchen. And my bestie, Nikki, owns\nthe science of cooking. Tell us what's really going\non with these burgers. - Check out how the color\nof the turkey changes from pink to brown. This is called the\nMaillard reaction. You see, meat is\nmade up of proteins. When the proteins are\nheated up, they create a chemical reaction with\ncertain sugars inside the food. The protein and sugar\nmolecules bond together, which is what gives\nit the brown color, as well as a\ndelicious new flavor. Awesome, Right? - Absolutely, and\nremember to be careful around hot surfaces. You should always have an\nadult present to help you. Nikki, why don't you\ntell folks why Malia is using such thin\nonions slices. - That's a pro move. Malia knows that small pieces\ncook quicker than big ones. That's gonna give her\nan edge in getting through this challenge fast. - About as fast as I plan\non eating that fajita. (upbeat music) So, if you had your\nvery own Bistro cart, what would it be called? - One of my favorite things\nto make and eat is burgers, so I would probably call\nit Sophia's Sliders. - What about you Malia? - I would name it\nMalia's Pacific Rim, because I love cooking\nPacific style foods with fresh ingredients. - I would so eat at both\nof those Bistro carts. Malia really knows her\nway around kitchen tools. Check out how she uses\ntongs to make sure those hot tortillas\ndon't burn her fingers. Those dishes are\nsmelling awesome. I think Malibu is\nin for a real treat. One more minute you two. Come on you've got this. (suspensful music) Ten, nine, eight,\nseven, six, five, four, three, two, one, stop.\n(bell rings) Let me see those hands. Those dishes look delicious. Time for a giant hand to\nbring me some tiny food. It's tasting time. Malia, tell me about your dish. - I made for you today,\nMalia's Fabulous Fajitas. It has ground turkey,\nwith some cheese, roasted bell peppers,\ncaramelized onions, and homemade guacamole. - [Barbie] Time\nfor you to try it. - It's so good, try it.\n- Thank you. - Good job.\n- Thank you. - Okay, Sophia,\nnow it's your turn. What do you call your dish? - Mine is called a\nFlying Fish Slider. It is ground turkey mixed\nwith cheddar crackers, and red peppers topped\nwith lettuce, tomato, mayo, and ketchup, and with\ncucumbers as a garnish. - Wow, it's really good. - Thanks. - Both of you crushed it today. Malia, I had never had\na turkey fajita before, but that was awesome. So today, I'm giving you\nthe most creative award. - Thank you, Barbie. - Sophia, your sliders\nwere super tasty. They were nice and\nbrown on the outside, but still juicy on the inside. So, today, I'm giving you\nthe best technique award. - Thank you Barbie. - Great job you two. What would you make with\ntoday's ingredients? Today we learned you\ndon't need a lot of time to make a delicious and\nhealthy meal on the go. And remember, you\ncan be anything. - [Cooks] Thank you, Barbie. - Good bye.

it's regan from prima coffee and today we're going to talk about the carter everywhere mug from fellow these mugs were designed specifically for the mornings that you don't have time to leisurely drink your coffee and you need to race out the door they do a phenomenal job of keeping your beverage at a consistent temperature while having a very cool chic design that is seen in so many of fellows products they come in a 12 and 16 ounce option and in a variety of colors each mug is 85 millimeters in diameter and has a 65.9 millimeter mouth these make them compatible with most pour over drippers and the aeropress the wide mouth thin lip design was created to promote an ideal coffee drinking experience so rather than drinking out of a tiny hole where the smell of the coffee is trapped behind plastic you get the full aroma of the coffee in every single sip which just leads to a more pleasant drinking experience in general the thin lip design i didn't really notice much of a difference it did feel comfortable against my mouth and i didn't spill it on myself another great feature is the leak-proof lid i have carried this around with me for a week i have thrown it in my purse in the passenger seat of my car and my backpack before going on a hike and i've had zero spills zero leakage and no condensation that made the contents of my bagger seat wet what really sets these apart is the dual wall vacuum insulated stainless steel that is the feature that keeps your beverage at the desired temperature we ran some tests and we saw that it will keep coffee at a desirable temperature of 140 degrees and above for up to six hours and i've carried this around with me all week with ice water filling it up in the morning and by the time i got home i still had ice cubes floating around it's also lined with a ceramic coating that keeps a metallic taste from infusing your drink so it lets the stainless steel do what it needs to do without hindering the taste of the coffee or water a few notes about the carter everywhere mugs is that they do not fit in cup holders i've tried several and it's just a no-go also the white color is susceptible of getting scratched and scuffed and we didn't see that so much with the black fellow recommends that you hand wash these and avoid using anything abrasive because it can damage the ceramic coating on the inside and if you are going to put them in the dishwasher you need to put them on the top rack and just be on the lookout for any damage on the outer coating one more note is do not put these in the microwave because stainless steel and microwaves just don't go well together but if you're on the lookout for a new insulated travel mug this is a solid choice it does a great job of keeping your hot drinks hot your cold drinks cold it looks great and you can throw it in your bag and get going you can find them online at primacoffee.com and thanks for watching thanks again for watching if you like

welcome back to today's video i am so excited for today's video because i've been saving all of these items for what feels like forever now this year i do have so many items to show you guys i am gonna have to split this video up into two parts so i hope you guys don't mind that all of the links to everything that i can find will be down below in the description of this video please don't forget to subscribe follow me on instagram my school supplies giveaway is still going on until august 15th let's go on and get started with this video [Music] for the first item i can't actually pick this item up and show you guys so i'm just going to go ahead and insert some clips somewhere on the screen this is my first ever bar cart i'm so happy that i'm finally like owning a bar card i've been wanting a bar card ever since i turned 21 this bar cart is from target i love the gold detailing that it has and then it kind of has some glass in the top and then the bottom is just kind of like a wooden layer which i still think it's so cute and it goes so well with like the gold framing on the sides to kind of go along with my whole bar cart theme that i got going on i actually have a cocktail shaker this is my first cocktail shaker and i'm so happy i've been wanting one of these for a while now i definitely want to start making my own drinks and things like that which is why i've been trying to look for some cocktail glasses but i still can't find them so i just basically got this cocktail shaker from world market and honestly i need to start going to world market more because they actually have so many other cute things so that's where i got this from i could already see myself like shaking stuff i'm just seriously gonna become my own bartender by the end of this year so yeah this next item is actually from amazon and i did order this like about a month ago so these are just four little wooden placemats to put on top of a table i have literally been wanting these for years they're just so aesthetic i'm actually planning on buying like a dinner table as well so this would look so good on like a plain white aesthetic dinner table and that's just kind of the theme that i'm gonna be going for just like a white table with these on top i was a little bit worried when i ordered these just because some of the comments were like a little iffy about it but they turned out to be so aesthetic and cute i don't have anything bad to say about them this next item we have clearly started to use already so i'm just gonna remove this this is basically a marble paper towel holder so this is basically what the marble looks like i think it's actually so cute this one is actually pretty heavy but i think that's good because then when you rip off a towel like it won't move around the bottom just kind of has this foam as well so it won't like scratch any of your tables or furniture also when you first buy it it does come in two pieces so you just twist this top part and then that's how you like put it on or take it off i'm so happy that i ordered this one from amazon just because we really needed one our paper towels were literally just sitting in the middle of the table with no cute like decor piece yeah it just sits in the middle of the dining table this next item i have started to use that's why it's not in the packaging anymore i basically got this diffuser from the opal house brand at target i love this thing so much i actually ordered it from target's online website i don't think i've seen this one in stores but i could be wrong back in my college house one of my roommates had a diffuser and i stayed filling up that thing all the time i finally decided that i needed one so that's when i ordered this one this will literally last me from the morning to like when i'm about to sleep which is such a long time because it's basically on the whole day and what i love about this one is that it also has a setting for you to like change the colors you could either have it on one solid color or you could have it where it like alternates colors which i usually have it on that one all the time and it's just so aesthetic and it's so cute especially during the night time i'm seriously obsessed with this thing it's so much like i can't even describe it definitely recommend you guys to order a diffuser because it does help your room smell better and then on top of that the essential oils just really help for different things like lavenders for sleeping and the orange is like to wake you up just different things like that to kind of go along with my diffuser i also got some essential oils if you guys watched my first apartment shopping vlog then i bought these recently during that vlog i actually haven't started using this set just because i am waiting for the fall the fragrances that it does have are autumn skies harvest moon and golden leaves these all sound like they would be such good fall scent so i'm so excited to actually start using this in like a month or two and i also ordered another pack of more essential oils from amazon these are actually the laguna moon premium essential oils and this one has lemongrass peppermint orange eucalyptus tea tree and lavender there are six of them for ten dollars the whole pack so i feel like that's not that bad your diffuser really only needs like three to five drops of these i have started using these and i really like them i feel like they do actually smell like what they say that they smell like these next two items are also from amazon i'm so excited about these you guys these are actually just two clear bowls and i am so excited about these clear bowls that sounds so weird these are plastic but they're like non-bpa and all those different things i'm actually planning on using these for things like big salads i have tried my popcorn in here one time that i was about to watch a movie and honestly they come in so handy because they are so big these are just so aesthetic just because the whole clear thing really makes it go with like pretty much any vibe i'm just so excited about these and the pack did come with two together i definitely will make sure to have both of these linked down below for you guys this next item i also got this when i went apartment shopping recently in one of my vlogs this is basically just a set of two towels but these are so aesthetic and cute they have these super cute little tassels towards the bottom and then the actual towel has like these little like diamond shapes we really just needed a good pair of towels to have in the kitchen just to kind of tie in the whole kitchen the day that i found these was at tj maxx i really had no idea that i was gonna find these and i'm just so happy that i did this next item is actually from home goods and i have had this for a little while now these are basically just some clear double wall glass mugs you guys could kind of tell from the photo that they have like this gap in between where the drink ends and the actual bottom of the mug i think the original ones of these are actually from crate barrel but i ended up finding them at home goods for like a lot cheaper this is basically what they look like basically like a normal regular mug it still has the handle and everything's the same but the only difference is like the bottom this is just so aesthetic i love this one so much i have already used it to make like coffee and tea and things like that the box comes with two of them i think one of them i left like in the kitchen but it does come with two in total because i got these from home goods i don't think i could find them online but i'll definitely make sure to go ahead and link the ones from crate barrel because those were the original ones that i really wanted this is just my aesthetic i love these so much this next item i actually got this when i was shopping in my apartment shopping blog number two this is basically a bamboo tub caddy i have been wanting one of these for ever literally i constantly see these on pinterest again with like so many like aesthetic things on top of it i don't bathe a lot but when i do i'm definitely planning on like using this just because you could either bring your book or a laptop or something to drink like i just think this would be perfect for a little like self-care day and if you guys have been following me for a while now then you know how much i love my self-care days i'm honestly just so excited to actually start using this and in case you guys were wondering this one is only 13 so i feel like that's really not that bad just because i feel like these could be a little bit pricey sometimes this next item i have showed this to you guys in my what's in my backpack video but i'm gonna show it again because i did get it for my apartment haul this is just basically a snack capsule i actually got this from tj maxx and it was so unexpected when i did find it i honestly love tj maxx just because sometimes you find these random things that you would actually benefit so much out of having and this one was one of those items i'm definitely planning on taking this with me next semester i want to take like either apple slices and almond butter peanut butter or like yogurt and then like blueberries or strawberries on the top this would just be perfect for a little like healthy snack and it also does come with a little fork attached you don't even have to worry about like bringing another fork or anything like that just because like it's all in this little thing this was only four dollars from tj maxx in case you're interested go buy one i just feel like this is really going to come in handy the very last thing in this haul is actually this frother that i got from amazon in case you guys don't know you can actually use these to make matcha that's honestly the main reason why i got mine i have used this a few times but now that i actually filmed this video i'm definitely going to start using it a lot more i definitely want to get better when it comes to like learning how to make matcha and all those types of drinks this is what it looks like and it comes with a little stand so you could put this like on your counter if you want you just basically click this button and then it starts to like rotate like that batteries are not included by the way i had to find that out the hard way so definitely make sure you have some batteries if you do buy it thank you guys so much for watching this video especially if you made it all the way to the end make sure that you are subscribed because there will be a part two to this video because i literally have so many other things to show you guys [Music] [Applause] [Music]", "eHR84I74zOM": "oh these is Marseille so that's not how they don't say like me oh my French friends are like oh oh don't say anything in French okay hi welcome to the house of Valentina I'm Valentina and I am so excited that you're here today thank you so much for stopping by for a visit for those of you that are just tuning in how's the Valentino we talk a lot about real estate design we decorate we renovate we do all kinds of fun projects today's video is a little bit self-indulgent I realized actually in a little bit of a panic actually it's almost Mother's Day here in the US and I haven't even thought about it I think it's okay to treat ourselves to just a little something which is why I've made everything under $50 yeah most of these items are actually under $20 so I wanted to give your fun list I had a lot of fun making it I hope you'll enjoy it so let's just jump straight in you know we couldn't talk about a video without these syrups being involved now what I love about these syrups is that they have been made for hundreds of years in France and they are incredible and they are made with all natural ingredients and they're they're incredible I needed the best that are out there and and I have definitely tried quite a few of them but the moanin ones are our absolute favorite I especially love when they come in the glass jar I think that's so beautiful sitting out on the counter and if you are not a lavender fan they sell all kinds of different flavors we've got the we have the French vanilla the vanilla we have the I think they have like a hazelnut one trying to think it was on the counter weight much and there's a ton of choices so if you are not a fan a lavender don't let that deter you these are gonna be great okay confession time I've already started making iced lavender lattes and iced lavender teas so my kids all love them they just it's like going to Starbucks to them so it's really fun treat we don't do it every day but you know we have to see her up here for when we do so these are amazing they taste really good and it's a fun little treat my second item is the French press it's super easy to make really really good French style coffee in the French press because you guys know I love - press oh machine it's insane but it's also a big ticket item if you're looking for really good coffee grab the French press I'm about to butcher a French name it's called cuddly coddle a I don't know but they're beauty items are quintessential French I mean it's just you can't like oh I have several brands of French beauty products that PI absolutely love the face mist is just insane and it feels so good on your skin but it just makes your skin feel fresh and just I don't know like it's like alive like you feel like you're sparkling but you're not like sparkle yes I have been eyeing the monogram mug for quite some time they came out pretty recently and they look their little Bistro looking sets with the tiles I'm obsessed with cafes anybody that knows me anybody that visits my Pinterest or my Instagram knows I am certifiably obsessed with the French cafe and you're gonna see that more in this list this is just one of several items that have to do with the French cafe and this little cup set it's so cute I know that my mom would love this coffee mug with her initial on it and it's so cute it's like visiting a French cafe every single day that you use it our next one is vintage French interiors book and this is on my personal list because it's come highly recommended to me from several of my friends and I love when my friends are like oh my gosh if you love French anything you need to own this book so I'm really excited I'm hoping that my husband has worded for me but I think my mom would also love this I what woman wouldn't love to have French vintage inspired inspiration and put into their lab so we couldn't have the cup without the plate at least that was my thinking if we're gonna have this beautiful Bistro cup why not have the plate to go with it this set is so cute and it's only $40 for a set of four and I've got to be honest with you the entire collection is so cute there's little canisters and little cute trays and you really just can't go wrong I own the next one on our list and I think that there is this huge misconception about what French interiors are really like I know that I grew up with an idea of what a French person's home look like and then I went to France and I visited a whole bunch of friends stayed in a bunch of Airbnb s and really have this whole different vibe but this book I think is one of the best books that I've seen in a really long time it really shows you what real French interiors really look like first it made me so uncomfortable because there's like this high level imperfection in French interiors the real ones the real live people and I mean I can unearth people a little bit but I think there's also something to be learned from it it's gonna be on display because it's so pretty oh my gosh just the inside of the cover it's all watercolors it's gorgeous it's gorgeous I don't know about you but I am a huge fan of hats my mom has always worn hats she's really really big and has I think like she wears them pretty much all summer and so I grew up with the idea of always having a hat so I love buying a summer hat especially with this French country feel now I can't go to the French country right now but I can put on a hat and feel like I'm there and some of these items that are about to you kind of complete the entire look and so I think that if you can't go you can live it right where you are whether you're gonna have a garden party with just your family in the backyard or you're going for a stroll and it's just good to have a hat keep the Sun off of your face and this one is so beautiful I think it would be perfect for summer's even by the pool I just love it there is just something about a beautiful white summer dress it's just quintessential summer to me and yeah I may just be wearing in the backyard but I don't care because it just feels good it just I don't know you just feel so pampered and it's delightful to wear a beautiful white summer dress and you can in fact I actually did a video in mind recently I had on my little blue cardigan I loved that dress the minute it comes out it's like okay it's summer okay it's summer so if you've watched our recent laundry room makeover you will have seen that I have this sort of thing for these wicker baskets with the leather handles I absolutely love them I don't like you don't even see my full collection I have a bunch of these most of mine came from Morocco from when we lived there and I take that to the farmers market with me I use another one for going to the pool and I have another one that I use when I'm actually throwing open houses and I throw all my stuff inside and I take my basket in with me because then when I set it down in the kitchen and somebody comes to view the house I've got this gorgeous basket there and it's pretty and it's practical I couldn't recommend these enough they're amazing and I absolutely love them so I'm hoping that my husband grabbed me one more because I don't have one with that long of a strap on it and I really want one I am a huge fan of the French girl beauty line and most of it says the skin stuff that I've tried from it but these scrubs are insanely insanely luxurious they're not super expensive but I love to take baths and I think there's just something so wonderful about pampering yourself with just a nice scrub especially with summer coming we're gonna be baring our legs again and you know they've been covered up for a while and our feet too and since the salons have been closed and all the nail salons I think having a scrub like this is a great idea for anybody I could give this to my husband and he would be thrilled it just feels so good I will literally scrub my my feet and all the way up my legs and then just lotion afterwards so this actually goes with the next one I'll show you that one too this is a really fun idea that you could put together but this is such a pampering moment and I don't know of any person alive who wouldn't appreciate this gift it smells good it feels good just do it just totally do it you won't regret it I am obsessed with this candle I obsessed it's sea salt and lavender it's literally like going to a field a lavender by the sea it smells so good and for $15 it is a steal honestly I'm really picky about my candles but this one it is like the scent of summer and I've gone through three of them so for her I'm truly obsessed with it one of my absolute favorite experiences of all time of going to Paris is going to law DeRay and having the macarons and I will stand in the longest line and the last time we were there my kids were a lot younger my little one was quite rambunctious and I happily stood in that line didn't mind a bit and bought I think we bought almost one of every flavor and I bought a keychain so if you if you're ever with me you'll see I carry around my keys and there's a little macaron a little keychain on it from la Rey I I'm obsessed I'm obsessed and I didn't realize that you can actually make these cookies pretty easily the petit macaron is only $14 I think it's a great price and it will look so pretty sitting on my shelf I can't wait to add it to my collection I'm hoping that my husband got it for me if not then I'll have to buy it for my mom and then borrow it from her this lavender lotion is literally made in France so it truly is just again just a quintessentially French thing lavender lotion you find it everywhere it's it's so commonplace I think that a lot of times French people don't even think about it like it's just everywhere and I absolutely love having a lavender lotion it's only 13 dollars and it's a great price for a great bottle of lavender lotion where you're just gonna put it on and you're just like ah French lavender fields take me right there I'm not sure if I want to point you over to the recent haircutting video that I do with my husband because he's certifiably crazy and yes we did laugh a lot but oh my gosh I'm like oh we shouldn't put this out in the public oh but I don't know if you could tell in the photo the in the film but when we were by the tub I always have a really pretty dish with a soap in it and I do use like a bubble bath that I'll put bubble bath into the tub but I really like having a French so to just i use French so I think it's so pretty in the dish it's just romantic I think something's it's just the way that they feel when you use them that make you feel really happy and this is one of those things it's got like a really nice like exfoliating feel to it and it smells really good and they're only $7 so I just love these and I do when you hop on Amazon you'll see that there's also other brands that sell them wrapped in like beautiful paper I think those are a really great gift idea - I've gone in so many French homes and they have them sitting by the sink to wash their hands with I actually prefer to have a liquid soap for my hands somewhere in my mind it's more an antibacterial it's I'm sure it's not true but that's just where my mind is and so I actually prefer these marseilles I'll say tell me actually say mom these is Marseilles stoves that's not how they don't say like me oh my French friends are like Oh Shh oh don't say anything in French okay but my husband and I have actually been to Marseille a couple times in business incredible seaside village it was actually filmed the Count of Monte Cristo was actually filmed there and it's just literally like a hung on this clip and it's really beautiful and these soaps are sold there like when I was there I totally took it for granted because they were everywhere this Marseille soap it's like a thing in Marseille and so if you really want something that's truly French grab one of these the orange blossom smells like heaven the French lavender amazing there isn't a single scent that we haven't liked and I think that the bottles look absolutely gorgeous sitting by the sink I have had this black where on my list for mmm almost a year my daughter's getting ready to go to college I'm like oh sit you guys all right up there landed are you all right almost done I promise um so we're was like okay so this spot where now that my daughter is going to college I'm like oh I can give her some of the other stuff that we have and I'm buying these sets I'm obsessed with French cafes and that flatware is so important to the whole vibe the way it feels in your hand and the whole thing I can say with absolute 100% certainty I have never been to a restaurant before and turned to the fork over to try to figure out where they got it from that's how much I love these Forks tell my husband over the weekend I said I want to go to a French cafe I'm dying I just want to go to a French cafe so badly I just want the whole experience and so we were like oh they always use those white cups and we looked through our stuff and we're like we don't own of those white cups so I've added some lists because I'm hoping maybe he'll take a good hint among all of these other items getting quite long but I mean that these make an incredible gift I know this next item will not surprise a single one of you who knows me like at all because one of the things that everybody associates with me is the bust particularly the one with plants growing out of its head it's like any time people see that out and about they send me a picture of it they're like I thought of you it's a bust with plants growing out of its head so this is a really cute one that's only about $30 and so it's such a great idea I was thinking that something like this with lavender in it would be a beautiful gift idea and I think that this is probably the one I'm going to get my mom we are wrapping up with two of my tried-and-true absolute favorite items on Ave these are on repeat at my house like seriously a this T the my gosh I think it's how they save it like me they are literally from 1854 the case of teas are heaven I mean oh I just I actually have some brewing right now we're making iced teas with these yours the French breakfast tea smells so good you guys it smells so good so even if you aren't a hot tea drinker you can take these brew them and then add a little bit of the Syrah you could do a vanilla that's my kids really like they really like this cuz it's got a fruity flavor so adding that with the vanilla Mon and syrup and a bunch of ice in there they're flipping out over it they keep begging for more more I'm like well we don't need to drink that much in the day like this hold off but it's delicious it's heavenly I love these so much and I bought them in France and I can attest to this place just being pure magic the last item on the list I literally just grabbed this from my refrigerator so I love these jams technically they're Austrian but since marie antoinette she you know connected austria to france we're just gonna call it a game you know this account's right just gonna count this sour cherry jam is so good now if you're not sure about the cherries i seriously try it I've yet to meet a single person who had this and didn't love it it's amazing on a cheese platter if you're gonna have cheeses and little crackers and a little bit of jam my husband loves to eat it like that since I'm allergic to milk and I can't have cheese my favorite way I'm having it is on a baguette and we do that over the weekends I have a vegan butter that I use and I spread this on and it's like oh my gosh it makes me so happy I literally have this on auto-replenish from Amazon because I love it that much where you are actually getting ready to launch our French week I'm so excited about this when we did our last live event for the end of art week we mentioned that

Thanks as always for joining me here\nin my virtual coffee shop brought to you by\nAromacup.com I've got a review for you today of the Bodum Electric\nFrench Press Coffeemaker. This is coming from the e-Bodum line. Sort of a new line of products\nfrom Bodum. We've talked about a lot of\ntheir stuff here on Aromacup.com. I really like everything they make\nand this is no exception. I really enjoy this unit, so we're\ngoing to dive in and talk about it and make some coffee\nand show you what's in the box. Let's dive in and talk about the Bodum\nElectric French Press Coffee Maker. Let's start what's in the box.\nVery, very simple. You've got the main brewing unit\nitself, which is pretty compact. It fit on my countertop really easy. You have your plunger and filter\nwhich I like to keep kind of parked right up here, which I do believe is\nwhere it's supposed to go because it's just about the same\nsize as the plunger you have your water tank which is\nattached to the unit but you can remove that if you need\nto clean it, and then you have your carafe, which slides and\nlocks in and has this small lid. and then of course you get your\ninstructions with the unit. You get a little manual about\nthe e-Bodum line itself and you have your operating manual\nwhich is really thick, but that's because it covers a lot\nof different languages The operation of this unit is really\nsimple, and let's talk about that right now. The Bodum Electric French Press\nfeatures the ability to brew up to 17 ounces of coffee,\nwhich works out to about 4 cups. You're going to notice on the\nwater tank that you have these small hash marks and they tell\nhow many cups of coffee you're making. And that goes from 1 cup\nup to the max fill line. So if you don't need to make a lot\nof coffee you can brew really quickly using the built-in water tank\nif you need to brew for yourself and maybe two other people in\nthe house, something like that. Fill it to the max\nand start brewing from there. The carafe is, of course, it's made of\nglass. It's not plastic, which is great. The outer is plastic. The\nhandle and everything like that. But it deals with heat really well. I've never seen it melt\nor anything like that. Now the biggest feature of this unit\nwhen you come right down to it is that it handles the brewing of the\ncoffee and the boiling of the water all in one step for you. We've talked about French press\na lot here on Aromacup.com. It's really one of, if not I think the\nbest way to get the best cup of coffee in your own at-home coffee shop. But it usually requires that\nyou boil water separately pour it into your carafe and wait. So the whole purpose here is to\nspeed up the process of getting French press coffee, and in order to\ngive you that great French press taste, but without having to do all\nthe whole rigmarole that comes with making French press coffee. So let's talk about the operation\nof the machine. It's really simple. And that's something I really like\nabout it, because one of the things that often kept me from making French press\ncoffee was that I had to boil water and put coffee grounds in the carafe\nand all these kinds of things, but that's all been\nstreamlined now by Bodum Real easy to use. This lid is what you're going to use\nas you're brewing your coffee and your first step is going to be\nto add water to the machine. Now that's done using this\nflip-up door on the top of it. You can also take\nthe tank out and fill it But I wouldn't really suggest that\nbecause you have to push the tank down onto the machine and that might\nbe hard if it's full of water. Take some water, cold water.\nDon't start with hot. You want to use cold water.\nBodum is very specific about that. And then fill this up to your\ndesired amount of coffee. I'm gonna go for about 3 cups. Now of course you can go\nhigher than that or lower, just depending on what it is that\nyou want in your cup of coffee. So now that you've added your water,\nyou can close that lid, and then you're going to make use\nof some coarse ground coffee. We say this a lot here on Aromacup.com. You want to use coarse ground coffee\nfor your French press, and the reason for that is you don't want coffee grounds\nin your final beverage. So, use some coarse ground coffee and\nusually the suggestion is about a tablespoon per cup of coffee\nthat you're going to make. We're using a Bodum coffee scoop right\nnow actually that is about 7 grams. And so we're going to go\nfor about 3 of these. That might actually be a little strong,\nbut again you can adjust this based on how strong you like your coffee to be. Now, this lid has two slots\non either end, and they match up with the slots on top of the pitcher. The larger one is going to go\ntowards the front of the pitcher. So you just need to sort of press this\non and then take this and slide it in. Now all you have to do is press this\nbutton right here in the center between your water tank\nand your carafe. Now it's going to glow blue and that means that it's going\nto start boiling your water. Now it moves very quickly. Usually we say that you need\nabout 4 minutes to brew your coffee if you're making French press. And that means that that's\nafter you've boiled your water. What I found is that amount of time is\ncertainly cut down with this machine because it's going to boil the water,\ntransfer it up and down here on top of your coffee grounds. And steam is going to come out of\nhere and you're going to really hear this thing going when it gets going. I've noticed I can hear it kind\nof across my house, but I just know that it's doing its job at that point. You can see it's already getting going\nand it's getting that water hot. So you don't usually have to wait as\nlong for a cup of French press coffee I found when you're making use of this\nunit because you can just let it brew and pull that carafe out\nand you're ready to go. So we'll let this finish its job\nand we'll pull out the carafe and show you what the\nfinal product looks like. Alright, the Bistro Electronic\nFrench Press is done doing its job. It's boiled all of our water\nand therefore brewed our coffee. It took about 4 minutes. We just timed it,\nabout 4 minutes for 3 cups of coffee. So that's about what we usually\nrecommend you leave your coffee sitting with the hot water\nover your grounds in order to get a good cup of coffee\nout of a French press. So we figure shaving off about 3 or so\nminutes because you don't have to boil that water,\nit's all done in one step. So when it's done you can\ntake that carafe out, and be real careful because\nit does get really hot, and speaking of hot, we're going to\nsee how hot the water is coming out of this machine right now. So let's use our trusty thermometer\nand find out where we're at. 172, give or take. That's definitely more than hot enough\nto give you a nice hot cup of coffee. And of course if you use this machine\nmultiple times in a row that'll probably be a little hotter, but I think\nthat's about all you need. Speaking of the flavor of the coffee,\ndepending on if you want to be able to get a stronger cup of coffee you can\nstir the coffee that you get out of this Now that's going to depend. I found that I really didn't have\nto stir my coffee grounds at all after I had brewed using the Bistro\nmachine, but if you want to get a little bit stronger brew,\njust grab a wooden spoon, preferably wooden because metal\nwill scratch the glass. Give that a little bit of a stir, just to get those grounds\nstirred up and moving around. Now you're going to take your filter\nplunger, place it on top of the carafe, just kind of slide it down. It clicks into place so it's not\ngoing to fall off, which is great. And then just press that plunger down. So that stops the brewing. It keeps all those coffee grounds\nfrom getting into your coffee. Now you can just simply pour by using,\nthere's a small lever right here and this will keep the coffee from\ncoming out until you press on that. And there's your cup of coffee. The operation is very easy, and again\ndepending on the strength of the coffee that you want, you may want to stir\nyour grounds and you may want to just add that plunger, push it down\nand then pour your coffee right out. I really do have to say that the\nquality of the coffee has been great. That's all going to depend as well,\nof course, on the type of grounds that you happen to be using. But the speed of this machine is\ndefinitely pretty impressive. The ease is really nice. I found that I like to fill up the\ncarafe with coffee grounds and fill the water tank the night\nbefore I went to sleep and then I would wake up and I could\njust simply press the Power button, walk away for about 4 minutes, give\nor take, come back and I had a carafe of coffee ready to go. So that I really love. I love the\nquick and easy way of being able to make French press coffee\nusing the Bistro machine because I don't have\nto boil water separately. Let's talk about the cost on the Bodum Bistro Electric\nFrench Press Coffee Maker. You're looking at about $60, which\nI think is pretty great because, again, French press gives you some of the best\npossible coffee, if not the best possible beverage that you can get\nout of a coffee machine. So about $60. If you want to find out where you\ncan get this machine, click the link in the description here on our video. We'll tell you more about how you can\nadd this to your own at-home coffee shop Quick bottom line on this machine,\nreally quick very simple and easy to use It lets you brew your coffee\nvery quickly and get that flavor of a French press. Another cool thing is you could do tea. You could add loose tea,\nor I suppose even bagged tea, but loose tea is really going to give\nyou the best flavor to your carafe. And then boil that water into it\nand get that quick and easy way of making French press coffee or tea and not have to be used two separate\nmachines to boil water and then make your French press\nand so on and so forth. So, very easy to use, quick, simple. And for about $60, not too bad to\nadd to your own at-home coffee shop. So there you go guys.

corks are stools forks are coatracks chairs are supposedly made of champagne caps that's amazing I want this at home and the tables they are representing the lids from metal cans like for instance this one is from pepper and what do we have here this looks like cafe so I think it's coffee coffee beans so unfortunately Shannon me is one of the more expensive restaurants here in New Zealand baracy now why is that so well you are in the middle of voltage two studios and it's a very unique restaurant as well so that is why price also a little bit more expensive however it's an experience in itself it's so much fun to eat here the only have selected menus they don't sell separate dishes like for example at Jack's restaurant you can also order some dishes just one by one but here you have to order a menu the menu is divided into a section for children and for adults for both there is a cheaper menu and a more expensive option for the adults it's also possible to order a wine menu the little chef menu is for children and cost 1899 for starter main course and a dessert the menu consists of some easy dishes such as pasta or fries that hopefully any kids will like the little groom a menu is also for children but it's a lot more expensive with $34.99 the food is a lot more luxurious and offers a choice of smoked salmon beef or roasted cod fish for the adults the menu starts with Remy or Emil prices vary and that's because the Emil menu includes starter main and dessert while Remini as a starter and main course to starter of mixed vegetables or the seasonal soup as a main course you can choose between grilled steak with ratatouille and fries roasted caught fish crushed potatoes with olive oil and beurre blanc sauce a vegetable and tofu never in or the dish of the day well here you can see the dish of the day american-style grilled cockerel with Diavolo sauce and french fries it's the dish of the day so what tomorrow brings we will never know to dessert consists of a cheese dessert or a choice of all kinds of sweet desserts all of which sounds delicious and then there is an even more expensive menu the linguini menu or the gusto menu the linguini menu is 48 99 and the gusto menu will cost you 60 $1.99 again the price difference is in the choice of whether you add dessert or not as a starter the choice is between a guinea fowl terrine or the seasonal soup with in main course there is a choice between grilled beef with ratatouille and carrots and potatoes with brie or you can opt for a sea bass fillet with ratatouille and crushed potatoes all of all porcini mushrooms and star anis beurre blanc sauce the other choice is ravioli with sun-dried tomatoes with fresh sage and ratatouille again the dessert offers a choice of cheese or a sweet dessert there is less choice but both desserts are a treat if you are real foodie our first dish is being served Alysse how does it look let's do it Batum of concerns those camps fine [Music] pumpkin soup very good the soup yeah like I said it's a bit watery but it has got it's got a lot of taste to it it's not thick enough I'm used to when it comes to a potato or kind of soup so I'm not sure it's not bad but it's like but normally when we make pumpkin soup it's a lot thicker and that's what we like a nice chunky savory hearty winter soup we do have to admit that it's quite a big portion so yeah oh yeah but it's not bad although we had the same starter spent and I chose a different menu swen has chosen the Emil menu which also has a dessert and I chose the linguini menu this makes me lose a dessert but we will almost pay the same for our meal which is fair right so I've ordered the court with the ratatouille and the mashed potatoes dig in [Music] okay that's a good flavor to the mashed potato and the fish yeah it's it's an improvement over yours so we've been here four years ago and both of the times that we have eaten your rep same dish both thought it was a bit bland we heard that the menu has been tastier fish is better yeah it's good maybe not still worth all the money but then we can get the ambience but it's a good meal it's a good meal I remember the last time I had to talk to you here they were just pieces over got the two year so little cubes then this time yeah actually they're made and a kind of an artwork from it look in size there are still the same kind of cubes as it was first time that we ate here but it's beautifully prepared so no complaints here let's see if it's any good though would you like to try it at the TV yes please [Music] that's actually pretty good now the ravioli but a piece of tomato [Music] very simple ravioli there's probably cheese inside as well I think it's spinach with cheese however don't particularly face the DG's a lot but it's actually it's good I like it better than what I had last time the fish and the ogre tofu oh yeah and it's already really like the tofu dish I like this so much better yep so let's see what I'm gonna have for desserts thinking I'm going forward tiramisu see me soon I never choose two tiramisu I choose two tiramisu because I love you Oh goose those desserts what's that what's Gusteau's dessert I think we're gonna go for that one you know what it is no we're gonna have a surprise well as a desserts I chose the tiramisu that looks nice nice coupe to me is different than what you expect from a normal tmesis yeah a plate with a slice of tiramisu but this is a whole that's what I expected I think it looks very good and I cannot wait to try it actually be of us yes Maya you start ladies first it's a big portion it's enough to share [Music] it's very creamy a lot of discreet body has got that typical tiramisu taste of coffee would not occur it's very good I really like it yeah my turn [Music] yeah very good very very good bestow share me the final verdict yes we just ate here and we think that we have a good idea about what the food is like in 2020 because like we said we ate here five years ago and we had a good idea then what the food was like but yes well we're happy to tell you that it has improved like I told you guys I wasn't blown away by it and to be really honest if that soup wasn't on the menu I couldn't care less I was not impressed by it at all however the main course I absolutely loved it with each bite I actually loved the main course more there was also sage in the dish that I really liked with it avi Olli it was a perfect combination I really liked it and of course the dessert was amazing and I am a little bit bummed that I didn't had one myself to share but I really liked it the fish the coke Phil it was a nice portion well could ya was perfectly cooked not too not too dry and fish can fish can tend to be a little bit dry especially in restaurants whereas a big turnover in volume they nailed it spot-on yeah yeah and now in the mashed potatoes yes the combination was great I had a bite of strands dish and I really liked it as well and it also surprised me because I had this dish five years ago and I didn't like it at all the fish was dry then it really it was dry but now it was actually very good yep also guys a we had dinner here at 3 o'clock in the afternoon so a quite early dinner and a late lunch yeah and we can highly recommend because it was quieter than normal and it was easy to get a reservation yeah so it was pretty good idea and now it's a five o'clock and there's still time left to going to rise here in oldc studios or even to see the fireworks show because of the Star Wars season that is currently running yes and everybody's trying to look for a place to eat so when we left the restaurant is filling up and yes protip anyway guys if you're done eating you might want to start shopping so you can do this at Chez Miriam and they have some awesome merchandise that can be found in a restaurant where you just ate so we're gonna show you what you can buy over there remember in the restaurant there were these giant plates as a separation between the tables now if you are at home and you would like to experience we still share than me at your own table you can buy the same plates that they had there in the restaurant I absolutely loved and they sell this over here and well it says you be slow sharing me with bismillah Ferris on it the designs a little bit different but still it's a great

coffee mug they say it's an espresso mug but really it really is just too big for an espresso shot or even double shot or even a triple shot I think it's too big because a double shot is at about sixty milliliter this one is a hundred sixty milliliter this is I'll have a really really great for a flat white coffee which means a double shot of espresso and then frothing milk on top you know what let me let me make one right after this video and I'll show you how it looks like the pluses of having one of these is obviously retaining the heat of the whatever liquid you're putting inside because it's double walled so there's a gap of hair between the two walls and obviously it's a light cup because there's not a much of material and thus it also doesn't suck all the heat out of the coffee that you're pouring into it this pack comes in - I paid for it I wanted one of these sizes and I think it's perfect perfect for a flat white coffee so I've only added for a short while I will post in the description or in the first pin comment as I go along and as it ages and I'll tell you how it olds up now I actually never check to see if this is dishwasher safe but I will check and I will put it in the description thought you know if it's dishwasher safe just to give you an idea of different sizes this is the 15 ounce size mug from bottom and this is the one next to it this is a double shot espresso and this is another double wall cup that could actually fit all the way inside this one this one is about 70-something milliliter and this one is 160 all right so if you like this

thank you all for watching um today is saturday and we haven't actually done much brett popped over to halfords to get a new wiper for my car and he got his car cleaned yeah so brett's just been puttering around and um i just got washed and dressed walked into waitrose and got some bits to make pizzas for dinner um we have made them previously in one of my vlogs so if you haven't seen that i'll pop the link to that vlog in the description box below um but they're just like made from tortilla wraps so they're a bit healthier than like your body standard pizza so we're gonna do that when we get in um but that's it really oh i curled my hair with my dyson coral straightness um which i actually filmed so you would have already seen that and they are really really really good i love the fact that they're cordless um just makes it a lot easier when you're straightening or curling your hair so yeah i might actually do like a review or something them soon that would probably be a good idea um but yes i really like them it's about 47 degrees it is so hot in here why is it so hot oh that's hilarious oh my god we have got every single red light on the way home every single red light i feel like that happens sometimes though sometimes you're really lucky and get every green light but today we haven't been as fortunate um but yeah we're just gonna head home make the pizzas i might show you us making them or maybe i'll just show you the finished result and that's it really we have loads of homework pieces that we've picked up over the last like couple of months that we need to go through and sort we're gonna do that this evening um but yes i will check in with you all in a bit um we're just going through lots of the homeware bits that we've picked up over the last couple of months in preparation for our house and i just want to show you a couple of bits i'm not going to show you everything because there is literally loads just going through it now but i am going to show you a couple of really sweet things from anthropology we went into the store we ordered them yeah but we went into an actual um oh in richmond and they had this i don't know what you it's it's the whole collection is called the name but i can't remember the name i think it might be like bistro or something yes bistro um you picked up some mugs and then we looked online and brett ordered these really cute salt and pepper shakers obviously the s for the salt and pea for the pepper and then they come on this really cute little tray that says bon appetit so they would sit on here i don't want to drop them like so they're just really really really cute they are quite small so we are going to get some like bigger salt and pepper grinders probably um but these are just really cute to sit on the side or on our table and they were 16 pounds and then brett is rustling around in the background it's fine and to go with the same collection the bistro collection brett also ordered the butter dish which is really nice and i absolutely love this pattern it's so so so nice um and it just says hello inside i just think it's really cute i love this collection and this was 20 pounds i'm not too sure if they still have this collection actually i know they still have the mugs online if they do i will link a link in the description box below if you want to have a look could you just break something no i just put my finger through that um so yeah this was 20 pounds butter dish and the salt and pepper popped on the little tray 16. and then what else did we get from anthropology of some of that's from oh some of this is from zara home oh my goodness the thing is when you're buying homeware all the time you forget what you thought oh my gosh i just wanted to show you the mugs that are from the same um range in anthropology they were wrapped up really nicely so yeah the master got in the store but then we ordered the salty pepper and butter dish online so we've got two of these mugs i won't um i won't unbox both of them because there's no need and but just one with an l and one with a b that they obviously match they all um are the same pattern and from the same collection i think it's bistro i've got bistro in my head but um yeah this one has an l and then brett has one that says b and these were 10 pound each and i love love love them can't wait to have like a nice cup of tea out of this um from zara home in chelsea we saw this glass like trio there's three of them and they stand together on this tray which i think is really really really nice and one for like olive oil one for like balsamic and like chili oil or something so we got this this was a few months ago now actually this was in the summer when all of the shops had reopened but we saw it i think it was the last one at the time but this would just look really nice on the kitchen side or on the dining room table or something and this was 30 pounds um yeah i'm not too sure if they still have it online and like i said we actually got ours in the store in chelsea but if they do still have it i will link it below for you but it's just really nice um i'm not gonna unbox all of them but you get three of these with the like funnel um bit on the top and they sit nicely together in this from next and then this was actually a christmas present but we're saving it for when we get out obviously brett's mom actually got it for us and it's just it's really cute what is this like slate yeah slate heart and it says brett and lucy this will look nice in like our kitchen i think so yeah that was really nice my mum got us this really nice cafeteria um it looks huge when you show on the camera it is quite big to be fair yeah it's more like a mustardy color in person but it's just really nice and it will look so nice on our dining room table and that's what you've got to see and then also two little coffee cups that are the same color to match so these will be really nice on like a sunday morning or something i'm gonna try and um it a lot better [Music] times times", "kt-XUR3WA5g": "hi guys welcome back we're just going to add a few more things to my camping trip we bought a excellent bango

thank you bye i can subscribe i can subscribe", "fOa6d52UyzY": "- [Narrator] Hi guys and\nwelcome to The Family Fudge. Today, I'm sharing four\ndelicious mug recipes and these are all breakfast\nideas so stay tuned. Before we get started, make sure to hit that red subscribe button if you haven't already and go ahead and give\nthis video a big thumbs up if you like it. Now if you've spent anytime on Pinterest, you've probably seen a lot\nof recipes for mug cakes. It's an excellent way to\nmake a single-serve dessert and they are so tasty and easy too. But today I'm not making\ndessert, I'm making breakfast. This is perfect for the mom-on-the-go or anyone who wants a quick\nbreakfast in the morning. Now I'm kicking things off\nwith a delicious French toast. Now this French toast looks\nlike a lot like bread pudding, but it tastes exactly like French toast. It is so good. I'm using a ciabatta roll. You can use any bread that you want and you wanna make sure\nthat you're using a mug that is microwave safe and that's true for all of these recipes. So I'm gonna go ahead\nand cube up my bread. You could use regular bread,\nbut I really like the ciabatta. It's really nice and chewy. I'm going to start by adding\nabout a teaspoon of butter to the bottom of my mug. I'm gonna stick it in my\nmicrowave for about 10 seconds or until it's melted. Next, I'm going to add\nin all of my bread cubes and you want a good amount of bread cubes, a little bit more than your cup will hold. But don't worry, it will\ntotally squish down later. So once I have all of my bread in there, I'm gonna set that aside\nand prepare my egg mixture. For this, I'm adding one\nwhole egg to a mixing cup. I'm also adding three tablespoons of milk, followed by a few shakes of cinnamon. I love cinnamon in my French toast. It is so good. And then I'm gonna add\njust one drop of vanilla. I'm gonna go ahead and\nwhisk this all together. And then I'm gonna very slowly\npour all over the bread, trying to get some on every single piece. The next part gets a little bit messy. You're gonna wanna go ahead\nand squish the bread down into the egg mixture just to\nmake sure it's all absorbed. Now I'm going to stick this in\nthe microwave for 60 seconds and then I'm going to check it. So I definitely wanna make sure that this is all the way done so I'd like to take my\nspoon and check the sides so I'm looking for any raw\negg and I'm not seeing any, but I am gonna go ahead and\nstick this in the microwave for 15 more seconds just to be sure. And there you have it. It is smelling so good. All of the egg is absorbed\nand it's fully cooked. Now you could totally eat\nthis right out of the mug or turn it onto a plate. It's up to you. And you can garnish this however you like. I like to add a little bit of maple syrup and maybe a few more shakes of cinnamon. This is really yummy French toast. It's nice and chewy and just a little bit sweet, not too much. My next breakfast is inspired\nby (mumbles) churros, although these are not authentic\nat all, but that's okay. It's still gonna taste good. I'm gonna add one egg and two\negg yolks to my mixing bowl and then I'm gonna add\nthree tablespoons of milk. And anytime you're microwaving\neggs, if you add milk, it's gonna make sure that\nthe eggs are light and fluffy and not weird and rubbery. To this, I'm gonna add about three shakes of Cholula Hot Sauce. That's what I like. But if you don't like hot sauce, you don't have to put it in there at all. You could substitute for\nsalsa though if you'd like. Now I'm gonna go ahead\nand whisk this all up. Now for this mug dish,\nI'm cheating a little bit because I'm actually going\nto be cooking it in a bowl and you'll see why later. But before I stick it in the bowl, I'm gonna add a little bit of cheese. This is Pepper Jack cheese. But again, you could\ntotally use Monterey Jack or even mozzarella if you'd like. So I'm actually gonna be\nusing a bowl instead of a mug for this one because\nit's a little bit larger. And you wanna make sure\nif you're using a bowl that it's microwave safe. So I'm gonna go ahead and\ntake one corn tortilla and stick it down inside my bowl. Next, I'm gonna add my egg mixture, followed by some salt and pepper, and one more sprinkling\nof Pepper Jack cheese. And then this one's gonna\ntake a little bit longer in the microwave. For me, it took about 2-1/2 minutes. You definitely wanna check it\nthrough the cooking process. So here's what it'll look like\nwhen it's not fully cooked. It's still liquid-y in the center. So I stuck it in for 30 more\nseconds and then it's perfect. I'm gonna top this with some more cheese and some more hot sauce. If I had cilantro that would\nbe good or green onions, but I'm just gonna go with this today. Hmm, this is so good you guys. I love the corn tortilla in there. It definitely gets a little\nbit chewy in the microwave, but it's delicious. Coming up next, I'm gonna\nbe making a blueberry muffin in my mug. I'm going to start by adding about one teaspoon of coconut\noil to the bottom of my mug. If you don't wanna use coconut\noil, you could use butter. Next, I'm going to add about\nhalf a cup of pancake mix and this is the kind where\nyou just have to add water so it's gonna be really simple. So I'm gonna go ahead\nand scoop that into there and then I'm just gonna add enough water until I get the right consistency. You don't want it to be lumpy, but you also don't want it to be runny. And I just like to add a\nlittle bit of water at a time. That way, I don't end up with too much. And that is a good\nconsistency right there. Now this pancake mix doesn't\nhave any sweetener in there so I'm gonna add just a\nlittle bit of maple syrup and now it's time for the blueberries. I'm literally just going to\ndrop them right into the mug and you don't even have to mix them up. Now I'm gonna go ahead and\nstick this in my microwave for 60 seconds. Now after 60 seconds, you can tell that it's still wet on top. I'm gonna go ahead and stick\nit back in my microwave for another 30 seconds\nand then it is done. You can see the blueberries\nhave exploded in there. This smells exactly like\na blueberry muffin, yum. I hope you guys love it. And last but not least, I have an omlet to share with you guys, but not just any omlet,\nI'm making a pizza omlet. I love pizza and I love it in this dish. So I'm gonna start by adding\none teaspoon of butter to the bottom of my mug and then I'm gonna chop up my veggies. I'm gonna add half a mushroom\nand just a tiny bit of pepper. You don't want too much in here. I'm gonna stick my butter in the microwave for about 10 seconds\nor until it has melted. Next, I'm gonna go ahead\nand add my mushrooms and my peppers to my mug. I'm gonna add some salt and\npepper and mix it around. I'm gonna go ahead and\nstick this in the microwave for 30 seconds so that\nthese can become softened. In a separate container, I'm gonna add two eggs,\nthree tablespoons of milk, a shake or two of Italian seasoning, a little bit of mozzarella cheese, this is a pizza after all, and I'm gonna go ahead and whisk this up. And just like that, our mushrooms and our\npeppers are nice and tender. So I'm gonna go ahead and\nadd the egg mixture to them and mix them all up. And then I'm gonna\nthrow in some pepperoni. I really like to use\nturkey pepperoni for this because it's not as greasy\nas the regular stuff. I am gonna go ahead and slice these up a little bit smaller though. I'm gonna add these to my mug. Now it's time to whisk it, followed by a little bit of cheese and stick it in the microwave. I'm gonna start it at 60 seconds. But you know, some\nmicrowaves are different so you might have to cook\nyours a little bit longer or not as long depending\non what kind you have. But believe me, you're\ngonna be able to tell if it's not cooked all\nthe way and if it is, just put it in for a little bit longer. It's no big deal. And would you look at\nall that cheese in there with the veggies, it does\nsmell just like pizza. And all these mugs are very\ntasty but I'd have to say, this is probably my favorite. Let me know in the comments down below if you've ever tried making any recipes in a mug in a microwave and\nlet me know how it went. Thanks for watching and\nI'll see you next time.

learned a lot since then i've actually come to mug cafe and bistro it's a delightful place hopefully they've forgotten who i am because i feel embarrassed now cop my car cafe teeny ally okay got my cab wow hopefully they've forgotten me uh i've ordered a uh a dark bean espresso the espresso here is 50 baht reasonable price uh the ambiance when you come into the door into the place it's slightly um slightly sort of tired at the moment but it's it's all right it looks nice and when you come here it's very very nice a bit of road noise in the background but that's not to worry it's a very nice place it's nice rice barns and that sort of thing behind and it's nicely decorated here in the garden some lovely flowers and that you know plants that you can look at it's a place to have a casual meeting and come and have a chat with friends anyway to the coffee [Applause] now that is very nice as the gentleman said who served me here he said it came from tepsidep and that is up beyond may on uh the tapster depp is a mountain area where they sell sorry grow and sell beans to many people here in chiang mai and you know afar this coffee is delicious now just let let me show you this this is called a creamer and for anybody that uh doesn't drink uh the coffee or let alone espresso you've probably wondered what all the fuss is about with a creamer well the creamer is in actual fact the result of the the gases in the coffee being released during the extraction process and it forms a head on the top uh i'm going to really impress you now james hoffman said it was actually named by an italian guy and uh he was the guy that uh you know invented the gaggia gadget that's the brand of coffee machine anyway i diverse the the blue the big foot i put in well the big mistake i made when i came here a couple years ago was i think i've told you this before i used to try to drink latte and i got fed up with having a moustache and also fed up with the amount of foam on the top and very little coffee and i said okay let's try what an australian person had um introduced me to and that was a flat white well i then tried to convert chiang mai to changing lattes to flat whites whenever they served me and that was really hard work so i was asking for uh a latte rawn maya nom throng which is the non the milk and the frog the foam uh my non throng on the top and of course i always got non-throng because their recipe was always the same and they didn't like to differ from their recipe i ended up with scooping that off on a regular basis just to see how much coffee there was below three quarters of a cup of coffee and like anyway i had fun i i gave up then drinking lattes because i wanted to stop drinking milk because i i felt my i'm very i'm always very weight conscious and i felt that the milk was adding to uh the little bit of weight i was putting on so i went to americano because after all you can't mess up americano can you yeah you can americano is literally a a shot of espresso with a lot of hot water and you know you've got a little bit of coffee in the bottom and then the most of the cup is hot water sometimes it's so full so little coffee so full of water that there's no taste of coffee at all and that then drove me to find espresso which was a decent taste of coffee so my my route from latte to americano and you know i was asking for anglitano and they they didn't understand what i meant but i was asking for a black coffee and i just wasn't getting the taste so i ended up with espresso now this was one of the first places i came to and they served me an espresso natural fat i think it must be the first place i came to and asked for an espresso i sat down and looked at this creamer on the top and i thought what the hell is that and i scooped it off with a spoon just as i'd been doing my lattes and the froth on the top because i thought once again i've got lots of froth and no coffee you know you know you can see the idiot in me can't you well all this froth that came off the top i scooped it into the saucer after a while i thought this is ridiculous i went up to the guy at the counter i said excuse me i said i asked for an espresso and you've given me a short black coffee with a load of froth i can fall about laughing now as i hope you can but unfortunately i i made a right idiot of myself as i realized immediately after leaving here and investigating what espressos are really all about and i've come to enjoy and love now this espresso with the froth on the top this creamer this creamer on the top is delicious and i just wished i'd never come here before to make an idiot of myself and scoop that crema off it's delicious it's very nice oh actually i actually think they give me a double shot they've given me quite a full cup here it's very tasty so the double shot that comes out what happens in a in an espresso machine you sometimes get the little things like this well they put a big basket in and they fill it up with 18 20 grams of coffee and then they put two glasses two glasses underneath each spout a glass underneath each spout and therefore some coffee shops actually throw away one of those glasses and only give you a single because the next next customer is going to get the second glass well in this case i think i've got both glasses and i'm very very happy it's a long it's not a longo which is uh almost like a lungo which is almost like an americano no this this is a a double shot that i have here a single shot is smaller yeah and i'm talking like an expert here i'm like and here's the same place i made all right i asked myself anyway the welcome you get here is very very nice uh they're very friendly people um thankfully and uh yeah i'd recommend coming here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] behind me is a fabulous rice barn it's on stilts and it has a beautiful wooden construction that actually turned into a little seating area here very very attractive very very nice indeed well here we have some old photos of chiang mai the the old wall i'm sure many of you have seen before i actually belong to a facebook group called siam memories and if you get a chance check it out i'll leave a link below um it's a group that publishes uh images and stories of old thailand and you get a lot there about um history throughout history a long ago history not just recent 20 30 years of stuff that is obvious to us today the wonderful photographs that uh we see on this facebook page are brought to us sometimes by family members who have got you know great great great grandfather's uh interest in the photograph it's wonderful because when i started doing my videos about history uh that i was lifting the corner of the carpet just a little bit of the corner of the carpet it feels uh i was finding that there was so much to be found here uh after you had dug down dug down dug down that life that i was daunted by the passion that many people have and i hope that if you were to go there and look at that facebook page uh you too can appreciate their passion too so as i say i'll leave a link below to to that uh facebook page there's a bit of another bit of a funny here let me look yeah the sign behind actually is spelt correctly these are these orange signs here have been uh cut out like a template so the dark writing on it is actually see-through well they've gone to a lot of trouble it's not just a poster you know you can't just reprint it but they've gone to a lot of trouble to cut these and they cut a load and they put them out the front and along the road and so on and somebody made a spelling mistake and they actually had a mug cafe and bisto well the coffee doesn't taste like gravy i can assure you of that the coffee is absolutely delicious so i'm glad i've come here thank you so much for joining me on this rather wordy video i hope you've enjoyed it see you in the next one take care bye [Music] foreign", "t5tWT2AKxJ4": "Hi,

this is a lifestyle youtube page about living your best life being bougie on a budget being lit every season i'm talking about winter spring summer fall if this is the lifestyle that fits you go ahead and subscribe click that like button leave a comment we're going to stay lit so today we are talking about coffee bars [Music] this could be a touchy subject because i'm not one of those like need the coffee bar sign and need all this little frilly stuff so it is a really upscale kind of luxury little coffee board area in your home since i am the only one that drinks coffee this is like a drink station so tea coffee getting out of the house whatever to it so again i'm the only one that drinks coffee so this is my little coffee station what i'm gonna do first is kind of show you what i have and again this channel is about being bougie on a budget so we did not spend a lot of money on most items sometimes we splurge you know when we want it we get it we throw it in the bag but for the most part we gonna be bougie on a budget so let's jump right into it coffee bar area the drink bar area whatever you want to call it here just a little section of my kitchen so these are my travel tumblers i take these when i am on the go i love the luxurious kind of upscale look that it has it is a glass tumbler and it does have a silicone sleeve and also kind of the wooden top so i do love that the drinks hold well they do not spill which is awesome and this is a plastic straw i am trying to go green as much as possible so i'll show you some options that i have for this as well but this is a straw that it came with but again i love this cup so these are also some travel mugs um this is an 8 ounce this is a 16 ounce the 8 ounce actually fits perfectly under my keurig and i take these with hot drinks or you can use them actually with cold drinks this is a silicone top this is a silicone handle that if you have hot drinks they will not burn your hand this is also a glass and i love these this eight ounce fits perfectly under here without the top on of course and just take these to go this is a silicone top i was kind of leery a little bit about whether it was spill up under the bottom but i have not had any spillage so i recommend again this one is an 8 ounce and this one is a 16 ounce a little bit bigger i like to take my iced coffee in these as well and again it says i'll have all the links below all right so if i didn't mention i got these at amazon as well okay the next one is where the magic happens i use these all the time when i'm at home drinking my coffee on meetings things like that um because they're just cute right these are double walled glass mugs i got these at creighton barrel they were a bit expensive those this these were like 13 bucks a cup um but they do keep your coffee a little warmer a little longer than most cups i don't know if they are microwavable safe i have not tried it i don't want to risk it on a 13 cup so i have not tried it but these are so perfect i actually show you a picture with my coffee that i did all fancy at home so yeah i love these and i just have two of these again i am the only one that drinks coffee so or tea so yeah this is just my little station here my personal coffee bar let's get into the magic this is a frother a milk father i bought this on amazon it actually came with a few other items i'm going to show you so it is battery operated it does froth your milk for those fancy coffee so if you have still been quarantining i know a lot of us are now getting out but if you've still been quarantining and want a fancy cup of coffee there you go um it doesn't do well with almond milk though so let me just say that because i do use almond milk quite a bit but i have used regular milk just to get the feel i don't use a whole cup or anything but just to get that feel i do use regular milk this also came with the package this is a shaker for cinnamon over your coffee and i'll have to show you the stencils this is the branches and i did get this off amazon as well let's put that back there all right sis so these are the stencils that came with the frother and the cinnamon or powdered sugar or whatever you want to call it this is a heart smiley face i love you i use this one a lot and the coffee mug so just in case you want to turn into a barista for a day there you go so again this right here the cinnamon and the frother the tin for the cinnamon was all i think around 20 bucks but again i will put the link down in the comment section all right so so these are all of my straws you could tell i went kind of crazy i purchased some of these on amazon so i'm at home good some at t.j.maxx just wherever i found them i purchased them there so this is the glass straw here you can hear that yeah got those at amazon i think for a pack of four like again i'm guesstimating all these prices because i really honestly don't remember um but those are the glass straws these are my smoothie straws when i make smoothies i use these straws they're thicker these are metal again in my attempt to go green for most things i'm kind of changing out as i go and then the smaller straws here for just regular drinks and these are my coffee stirrers i really really got irritated and tired of using um tired of using a spoon or a plastic spoon every time with my coffee so i bought some silver stirrers they come in a pack of five again i'll have that link below for you i like to keep the paper towel roll right beside it because i tear off a piece i cut it in half again trying to be user friendly i like to throw away my keurig pods as well as my creamers and sugars i use sweeteners usually stevia or monk fruit and stevia which is whole earth so let me just show you here at the top i'm not going to show you all of my cabinet because yeah it is not clean but this is where i keep all of my packages i don't really like so much stuff on my countertop this is already enough so these are my um [Music] tees i have a lot of those there if you can see i just kind of separate them by package i bought this at container store i'll have that link this is where i keep the creamers and sugars container store as well i'll link that and this is where i keep the coffee it has a double stack yeah you see i'm already out all right sis well i hope you enjoyed the coffee bar area i hope that it gave you some great ideas again all the links will be below i hope you enjoy your espresso your cappuccino your coffee whatever it is but um yeah peep this little cute coffee i made in my

[Music] yay three two one all right you should be able to hear me now because i see green and everything yeah i kind of figured the sounds off um normally i have a different headset and for whatever reason i can't find it still no sound is it still no sound okay no my mic isn't it let's do this right here oh there you are okay cool all right all right cool hello everybody how are you doing this evening this time i knew the onion but i can't find my um headset that goes with myself because i've been like all over the place today today's been a very busy day um and i have gotten some awesome stuff in for you guys today that i'm super excited to show you um we have die trans i'm sure you guys have heard me talk to or talk about diet trans many times in the past so tonight will be about sublimation and what got me into uh deciding to do the show about sublimation tonight is because of all of the height all of the hype that is surrounding this mug press right so i'm sure you guys have all seen this mug press and uh by cricket and how cricket is taking over the world with this mcpress and if you're not familiar with what we're talking about i'm gonna just pull it up real quick right here on amazon so that you can see what we're talking about so i thought about getting the mug press okay i thought about getting the look fresh and i'm going to tell you why i decided not to go with the mug press like by these wonderful people right here although i will admit it's awfully sleek looking really fancy and there's a lot of positives about it we'll go over that as well um but there's a lot of positives in regard to this specific mug press uh i am very appreciative of them coming out with this i mean that this was kind of one of those things where in my opinion the industry uh surrounding doing mugs was starting to you know wane it wasn't as hot and popular anymore uh so i'm glad they came out with the mug press so that we could you know jazz the mug industry back up all right so i will admit for myself i am a sucker for a good coffee mug i love a good coffee mug um it's one of my favorite things to get a nice ceramic mug and put the coffee in it and just chill out like even on the court swing have a a good drink and for those who like tea um you know a nice warm cup of tea as well and old-fashioned ceramic mug well within the last i would say two years then a year and a half the tumblers like took over the scene right so everywhere you turn folks are doing tumblers they want tumblers yada yada but the mugs kind of like faded into the background and nobody was doing mugs anymore um so for them to come out with this and revitalize the coffee mugs and get them jazzed back up and folks excited about it i am thoroughly and definitely grateful for that because as i mentioned i love the book um so we'll get into all of this here in a moment but first i want to introduce myself from eve with baby's booty if it's your first time here drop us a comment

of our show and so what i'm going to do is take a moment and go ahead and show you some of the things that diet trans has sent us to celebrate but before actually now that i think about it oh the 70 16 good because i was like i want to read the bill for her before we get into it okay cool congratulations on yours to me [Music] congratulations lauren cause you for the supernatural girl holler that's what's up so let's get back into this qriket mug press first let's talk about that and the reason why i want to talk about that first before we get into the sublimation blanks is because the press is going to be a fundamental part of increasing your business uh for whichever if you do decide to go into doing mugs okay so one of the questions that somebody just asked in here was can you do larger mugs with this smoke press right so let's pull that information back up so that you can see what it says so here is the um this is on amazon so amazon is selling the cricket mug press and if you look at the information about it let's scroll down not this description and stuff because you know they're gonna fluff right here but let's go down to the nitty gritty uh product description and as you see here it says for use with infusible incompatible mugs however if you come down a little bit further it says for use with compatible sublimation mug blanks polymer coated so as long as it has that poly coating you can use it in this smoke press the other cool thing about this month price is it says it's from 11 to 16 ounce straight wall only mugs okay now that's important because most of the mugs that you see out in the market today are your basic looks all right so here is a basic drinking look and it's 11 10 to 11 ounces all right so here is a sublimation mode and there's no it's not super big but let me show you what a 15 ounce mug looks like and so usually when you get customers a lot of times this is the mug they're talking about this is the most economical mug all right but here is the 15 ounce mug so as you see it's a good bit bigger so the cool thing about the cricut mug press is it does 11 ounce and it does the 15 ounce which is a really good thing so let me show you what i have over here on the side let me make sure it pulls up yes so over here i have my mug press oh i'm gonna have an echo hopefully not because i can hear myself let me turn this down let me know if it's double sound um and if it is we'll uh cut the sound on the uh microphone let's see okay so this is my industrial notice i'm using air quotes industrial mug press so this mug press fits the 11 ounce mug and it also fits the 15 ounce mode okay so this is you can get mug presses just like this off of amazon as well so this one is more this is not this is more commercial that's the right word that i want to say all right instead of saying industrial that's a more commercial based smoke press it's heavy duty it has it's um sound is still awesome here no echo okay cool thank you for letting me know that um it's heavy duty and it's made to get these mugs pounded out back to back to back to back whereas cricket equipment can be used and it can be abused because one thing i will say i absolutely love my my um cutting machine um and i use it in business as well and it hasn't usually i don't have any issues out of it so the book press i think would be you know last long and have some longevity not sure about the plastic lever that's on it so let's go uh back to show you what i mean on um that so with this mug press it has the lever as you see right here this lever is what you lift up on in order to open this little green door and then shut it back to seal in your mugs okay so hopefully this won't go out hopefully they have that you know a really nice little get up to keep it from wearing out so to speak but their mug press is supposedly designed to work with their infusible ink and whatnot which is it's fine that's understandable that's really cool and as i mentioned it's a great idea i absolutely love sublimating looks because as you see it can go in the dishwasher you don't have to worry about this stuff coming off whatsoever sublimation is there for the long haul all right so now we see this is the cricut mug press let's check one thing i wanted to show you so the cricut mug press is here and the price on amazon is 199.99 now amazon is usually pre comparable to the market out there very rarely with qriket stuff is amazon way more expensive so you're looking at two hundred dollars for a mug heat press all right so let's take this same setting the same thing will keep press and we're gonna go up here and put it into amazon and let's take a look and see what else is out there all right so here's the qriket book press for 199. here is a 12 by 15 professional swing away heat press which i have that as well with the additional attachments and mug press is one of them for 169.99 all right so not only do you get the detached mug press you also get a hat press you get a plate press you know the whole kit and caboodle right here now nine times out of ten this mug press though will be uh 11 ounces only the smaller mug press most of these heat presses come with the smaller uh mug press cuff with the exception of like this one which is 194.89 and right here let's click on it because i want to show you what they offer with theirs notice their mug press here they have one two three more cup uh cuffs to go with this mug press okay so they have the cone shape two of the couple of shapes a large one small and then they have what looks like the smaller cup um mug and it looks like the larger cup as well because there's four uh screws here usually this one well that has four screws too so not sure we'll have to read into the uh description of it to see if it will do um the mug press let's see we have had mug press six ounce mug 11 ounce mug cone comb so this one only does the 11 ounces all right and then the smaller bugs so if you take the time to look through amazon they do have which this one looks exactly like the one that i have sitting over here and it's a two in one mug heat transfer sublimation heat press machine with two mug attachments so they have the cone and they have the uh regular mug and then here's another better sub and theirs is looks just like mine as well uh let's click this one and it says 11 ounce and 12 ounce so this one doesn't do the 15 ounce mother doesn't look right so certain things like that is what you will need to read into let's click on this better sub because this one says 11 ounces as well this one says 11 ounce so some from time to time you'll come across the mug presses that will go larger than the uh 11 ounce and some instances also you can purchase the larger cup to go with the machine that you have so there's options out there you just have to look and see um what is oh that's fancy and really you just have to take the time to scroll through them and look they even have double presses check this one out this one is 230 so you're talking about an extra 30 even though right now i'm a little leery because it has 14 stars so i'll have to read into it a little bit more but this is a double mug press so that you can do two mugs at one time if you wanted to for an extra thirty dollars right and then you also have other cuff sizes that would go with this one including what looks like the cone shape and when we're talking about the cone shaped mug cuff what the cone shaped mug cuff would do is the mugs like this where it has this taper to it so in this instance the flat regular mug press wouldn't work you would have to have that comb cuff to wrap around this particular type of mug and this is a sublimation mug as well um everything that i'm going to show you guys is found at ditrans.com i'll put a link in the description below for ditrans they have thousands of sublimation blanks thousands of them okay um one of the other things that i meant to look this up that folks have been as i've heard through the grapevine i haven't seen it for myself have been fighting over the mugs at michaels like some people go in they buy them up press and they clear out the shells of all the mugs or buy tons and tons of the bugs and i think even joanne's had something like i'm gonna get one free or something they had some kind of insane sale on those mugs and it made it very affordable for the looks let's take a look at um what these modes generally run on amazon moves let's see so if we switch over to here let's take a look at um the price so here you have a set of six 12 ounce mugs for 30 which i'm not too sure about that price the price is a little high we have a case of 36 blank 11 ounce sublimation modes these are the smaller bugs your standard mugs 36 of them for 66 dollars so y'all know how i am with math um i had to pull out a calculator and tell you what the breakdown is of that one let's see if we can pull up the calculator where are you you got um 36 mugs divided by 66 i think hold on my thing is uh oh did my sound go out again am i talking to myself again hold on hold on can y'all hear me sound is still awesome here okay can you hear me let me know if you can hear me you seem like y'all would have hollered at me by now um but that could have been an earlier message that i was looking at but at any rate so here we have um mugs you got 36 of them for 66.99 i think if i click on this it'll break it down for me but this is you know your standard pricing but you also have shipping added to it because this is weight all right it's heavy so you can't just get your bugs and they not um add to the charges because of the weight of them tons and tons of sodamatable mugs available here on amazon they even have the color changeable bugs here as well now keep in mind on ditrans ditrans have the sublimation books as well that change color here's a blank color changing look let's see how much this one is if you get um your wholesale pricing on these are 375 um per mug okay well the color changing mug and if you get your classic basic mug let's see if this one is the basic modes blank ceramic mug you're looking at 325 for that one here's a 15 ounces 538 for that one 11 ounce right here blank ceramic mug is 505 for that one um and here's a sublimation blank submarine mug 11 ounce this one is 134 per mug here um and this mug here is the soup mug is six dollars and seventy cents per mug and then here's another 11 ounce the gator this is a new brand for them the gator mugs and their dollar fourteen cents per month now of course with die trainers you'll have shipping um but this is uh kande and they have way more blanks available to you so you can throw in some other stuff in addition to mugs but i definitely wanted to um show you guys that mugs are out there they're available you don't have to have just the cricket mugs there's no need to fight coconuts it really isn't the price is good though there's no need to fight over it so hopefully folks will calm down some and understand that there's more than enough bugs out here for everyone but the cool thing is because mugs can be a good source of income all right they're customizable you put whatever you want on it um and it just makes a really great gift especially for your tea and coffee drinkers which most people are one or the other most people okay so let's get into some of the awesome blanks that they sent to us um i've already shown you just your basic 11 ounce mug and we're going to sublimate these tonight so we're going to celebrate this mug um oh and before i forget we also have haiku these guys were awesome to send us sublimation inc and they asked that we let you guys know they're offering a deal for us and i'll put the deal in the description below if you want to check out haiku on amazon and get your ink lickety split um and we also have a 15 ounce mug will sublimate this one as well with the black handle and the black rim die trans awesome sauce we appreciate that they were also really cool as i pointed out with the soup mug but we won't be sublimating this one so they sent us the soup bug but the soup mug is too big for my mug press now i can sublimate it in the oven the oven is over there it is set up but we'll have to get the mug wrap and or either shrink wrap either one and that's gonna take some time so we'll see if we have enough time we'll throw uh the soup mug in the oven but if we don't have enough time then we'll have to skip that they also were awesome and sent us this super cute little treat jar is like totally adorable then of course you can use it for more than just a treat jar like this could be a pencil jar um it could be for anything little trinkets whatever you want it to be but they sent it as a treat jar so this is really cool this can go in the mud press because it's round it's straight sided so we can actually supplement this as well and the reason why they sent us a treat jar which was really cool they also sent us some doggy shirts oh my god the coolest thing ever so we have small size we have medium size and we have large size so i think this will fit my lily puff so i'm not sure we'll sublimate um i don't know that we'll have time to sort of make this if we do we'll throw it on me so uh heat press but if we don't keep in mind they also have diamond shirts be [Music] ever so we also as i mentioned we have this um this isn't ceramic this is uh stainless steel or the steel tumbler uh with the poly side so that this could be sublimated but i don't have my i do have a comb press but i don't have it in here so we won't be doing this one but the reason why i'm pointing this out earlier like this you couldn't do in the cricket monk press um like i also have little shot glasses you can't do this type stuff in the cricket monk press this would have to go with a sublimation oven um now what you might be able to do is tumblr it depends on how big this is when you put it in your mug press all right this looks like this is going to be entirely too big um to go into my mug press i'm not sure because you look at the this is close all right i don't know if you can see that me putting that in there and the cool thing about this mug press and the cricut mug press um this mug press i can just twist the knob to make it larger or smaller to adapt to fit you know different size media that we're going to put in there um and the cricut mug press looks like you know the little handle kind of like self adjusts it to the size difference between the 11 ounce and the 16 ounce i don't know i don't have one so we haven't tried it and i really was considering getting one just to show you guys the mug press and how it works but i have this in mug prep so it's like do you really want to buy something else and have it sitting there and um have it here in the stairs like man let's not do that so we also have tumblr is this the right one let me make sure what i'm telling you so we also have what's called a tugger so this is a stainless steel tugger all right and it's 11 ounces this is a silver one so it's a super cute little mug right so you can use it as its own drink you know drink cup that's by itself or you can add this additional ring to it and use it as a can koozie so it can be either or which is really neat you know because that's one of the things i saw the can koozie or can holders and i was like okay that's cool but the only thing it does is hold the can unless i take the ring off and just drink with it there but they were forward thinking diatrans.com as well and you can add the optional drink lid and use it as that and then switch out so that's really cool so they sent us a silver one and they also sent us a white one as well so these you will be able to celebrate in the mug press all right because in most instances in most instances with these mugs these tuggers or uh even if you have a tumbler around about the same size usually we sublimate just this top part because if you're trying to supplement all the way down this angle here even with shrink wrap it your your shrink wrap is gonna what's the word it's gonna wrinkle and it's it may not turn out you can try i'm not going to tell you not to try but you could try it but i know this lip is going to give you a little bit of a problem you could celebrate just this part down here so you could press this in your mug press first and then adjust the mud press to press just this and put just this in the look press and do something separate that's an option as well if you wanted to but yes this can go in the mud press and it should even fit in the cricut most first alright so we have several things that we're going to play with today oh and i almost forgot um because they were down um below the most press box they also sent us some totally adorable ornaments right totally adorable so with the little hanger to go with it we have a square we have an oval and we also have this oval shape as well without the scallop on the edge so this is cool for which if you stop and look at it it's really neat how it goes together so you have the ornaments you have the treat jar and you have the pet shirts so this could make a really nice gift set to a pet mother or pet father and you could do you know fido's name on the pet jar and then make a shirt that matches and then do a little tournament with the dog's name and give this to the family so it's a really cool set the way they put it together i'm really excited to get sublimating on this stuff and i think we're gonna have an awesome time awesome time so let's see what we've got going on one of the things uh let me double check with the chat and make sure i'm not missing any questions hey scooby-doo how are you welcome y'all that's what's up um let's see let's see let's see let's see pat saying says is the press worth it so in that instance um whether or not the press is worth purchasing is going to be a personal decision all right so yes the price point is pretty high it's 199 but i mean it's cricket you're gonna get the name you gotta pay for that name um and the fancy sleek little uh case that it's in and the way it looks it does look actually gorgeous i would love to have it just because of the way it looks but it's not practical y'all gotta look pretty so you can do the industrial looking route or you can go the super fancy looking route but you're gonna pay for the fancy looking route it's just that's how that cookie is gonna crumble so you're paying for the name you're paying for the sleek look but you're also paying for the fact that you can easily adapt between 11 ounces and 16 ounces in my opinion that's actually phenomenal okay because it's not really super easy if you're on amazon and trying to get that lower price point it's not super easy to get that lower price point uh where you can adapt between the smaller and larger this is not so if you think you'll be doing enough mugs or tumblers or tuggers or treat jars where it's going to generate some income i'm pretty sure that that mug press will make its money back up to you fairly quickly now of course you have to take into account the cost of your blanks you know i'm saying how many of these street jars do you have to do to sublimate in order to make money to pay off that two hundred dollars for the credit price those are the type questions that you really would have to ask yourself and then in that instance you would actually have to sell them so if you make a bunch of these and they don't sell then but i think this would actually sell i really do number one especially the treaty okay so on my own personal tangent on this coffee mugs yes there are serious coffee drinkers out there they would love to have their coffee mugs we get that but folks love their pets okay pets are like end all be all you don't talk junk about my dog you don't get beat down type situation folks love their pets okay so a little treat jar with the little fido's name or the doggy's picture on it um and a little shirt to go with it you almost can't not sell pet stuff you know it's got to be difficult to not sell your pet things so look into the pet jars and like i said even if you start you get some and they don't work out like pet jars then these are easily marketable as something entirely different it could be a pencil jar or something to hold a baby pasties or something anything anything i just threw that out there i know that sounds crazy but there are options out there so yes i think it's worth it i do think it's worth it um i really do but it is a it is an investment and with some of y'all folks getting stimulated this week it may not be a bad purchase to me all right so alice ruby hello welcome dana dana sorry from florida welcome thanks for joining us dana pendarvis welcome scooby-doo welcome simone langley says she got hers today and played with it so that means we gotta ring the bell for mr moan congratulations on your muffins i'm trying to tell y'all i know several of y'all don't come in here like i got it too i'm like hey we gotta ring the bell again um gail says is that a standalone system if you're talking about my heat prep my mug press yes it's by itself um this one i don't have to hook to or take apart my five in one i have a five in one as well that has a look press attachment but this particular model that i showed earlier um which i can switch back over to it but it is its own mug press okay so that is standalone i don't have to have the heat press this is a mug press it's nothing else that's another person so yes that is um its own unit so it was it was i think an excellent investment and at the time i had an order for i want to say it was 500 mugs it was a ton of mugs y'all i was dreaming about mugs four days after that order but i needed to crank out mugs you know i'm saying and when i was trying to use the silicone wraps and put them in the oven it didn't work y'all i burned up or not burned up but it uh didn't print properly several mugs it wasted a lot of money i was so upset so once i went and got that mug pressed it was done i didn't have to i had a bug press that little press going and the one that came with the 501 going and with the two of them cranking out books back to back i was able to get through that order pretty quickly so yes that is a standalone unit um let us see that let's see going back to make sure i don't have any questions inspiration creations cricket is upsetting a lot of people right now for their announcement that their design space is only going to let us upload 20 designs a month unless we buy a membership um so yes that is a hot topic um not really that's a hot topic um and i will say i have two different opinions on that for two different reasons i definitely first and foremost totally understand where they're coming from and why they are doing that um what i'm going to say is i'm going to put a pin in that and we'll come back to that conversation with our after hours part of the show uh closer to 11 so that we can get back on to the sublimation but that is a pretty hot topic if you remind me i'll let you know my thoughts on it but for right now we're going to switch back to sublimation because if i get on that phone box it's going to take some time um let's see i like i need more distractions from working tonight sorry honey marge campbell hello how are you welcome thank you for joining us give the hobby a hug for us simone langley will it do the water bottles too again with the mug press what you know what that's something i need to look at on uh the cricket because i didn't notice that and i meant to look at it um it says this see it's only giving us diameter it's not giving us height and that's something i would like to know i don't know if someone has their mug press if you could take a moment and measure from their ship if i'm looking at this press correctly there's a little plate a little round raised section at the very bottom i'd be interested too to know if that's heated because if that's the case you could also possibly supplement the bottom of the book but there's a little round plate in the bottom if you'll measure from the bottom from that plate to the top of the rim not the white rim but the green inner rim that wraps around the mud we can tell just how tall of a uh tumbler or water bottle you could actually do because the diameter is important yes like for instance um let's go back up to the diameters it says um 82 to 86 millimeter diameter mugs okay so 82 to 86 millimeter diameter modes now this is a like i said this is the little tumbler and here's our millimeter uh ruler thing so we're gonna go that doesn't look right 82 to 86 millimeters i'm not trusting that eighty-two babies or nine times out of ten i'm not looking at my cheek correctly because this is centimeters 82 to 816 awfully small because this is 200 no 260 216 centimeters no milliliters my husband is my mad person with measurements but i know this is way bigger than what they're saying i need to check out my videos y'all know i'm not a mad person so we don't you don't put a pen in that too but i do want to know the height because that's going to be a major question that most people are asking they don't have the height listed here and no one has asked that question on amazon so i don't like have an answer for that as far as is this too tall which it shouldn't be because this is a much taller mug you see what i'm saying so is this going to be able to sublimate from the lip all the way down to the base or is it going to cut it off say right around in here and only this height that much so those are questions that you would have to have them across in order to answer um and there's so many of y'all in here who had it that could answer that question so let's see if someone put that in there no one has been to make it so we'll see four and three quarter four and three quarter four inches and three quarters so let's take a look at this one am i understanding you write simone that sounds right that sounds right because here we go leave this mug from all the way from the bottom of that black line on the lip of this mug all the way down to this bottom rim this is four and a quarter okay so the mug press will press this height of a mug okay but this tumbler if it went this wide this tumbler you're looking at this is four inches just for this part this wide part right here so if it could go this wide open up that body it definitely could supplement this height you see what i'm saying so there are hurts to it being self-adjusting again here we have this smaller tugger and this one is three and a quarter down to from the lip down to this first ridge so you could sublimate this and then sublimate the bottom separately so yeah you could do a taller um here we go you can do a taller cup or whatever but here's a water bottle now i can't remember if this one is i don't think this one is a sublimation this one i was going to do with rhinestones so this is not sublimation but if you wanted to do this one i don't know that it would go this skinny in the cricket press in case it could let's show you the difference in height here so this one here is four what did you say four and three quarters this is four and three quarters here from the top down so you're missing two inches that you would be able to sublimate if you were to put this in the cricut press so setting it down in the cricut press you will only be able to sublimate up to here on this water bottle so this is all you would be able to associate so in that instance you might would have to press twice and the way you would be able possibly to do that is to of course take the lid off because it's plastic milk and put it in upside down and sublimate this half separately possible all right so there's several ways to skin cats although we we like our cats to have her but there are several ways to accomplish things if you're pretty darn determined uh the thing is you would have to play with it and try it out and y'all know i'll try out some anything all right so guys turn the tumbler upside down the verti the drawback from the vertical mud press is that you're limited to that height the horizontal bug press will allow you to do more and the industrial one like the one that i showed you guys on amazon it was the double price it actually had a much longer cup that you could adapt to put in it can't you remember i showed you it came with other cups with that particular press and one of them was a much longer cup it that you could put in with it sorry just joining but the mug press is only able to use straight side books right that is correct i own the most press and use it several times she's so crappy um showed a heck with it kids will eve know you cannot celebrate tall or wide in the cricket prince no watching others demonstrating it thank you to andrea and thank you kimber uh so these taller ones she said four and three quarters four and three quarters is just basically your your 15 ounce book and for the most part that's about your limit with that one all right um you do you guys talk about what type of paper to use for sublimation monica says i generally use a sub that's on amazon um i haven't had any issues at asup yet no issues from asap yet and a sub um has come through for me on all types of substrates mugs tumblers shirts glass cutting boards i have yet to have an

have to have a cricket cutter to use the qriket mug press good question i don't think you should that's crazy if that if you can't use it as a standalone so is there a um for those who have the cricket mug press can you use it by itself does anyone know if you can use something you print out with sublimation yes you can and can you mix cosmos ink in haiku ink i have mixed inks without any issues that's my experience but a lot of folks are saying drain your ink or i try to use up as much as i possibly can before adding more ink but i have mixed things without any issues i saw someone do mugs in the oven yes she used three sheets of plain paper on the outside and masking tape she pulled it tight and take it no problems you can do that you can do that um you can sublimate with plain paper but i have found the best results come from using sublimation paper i've shown that a couple of times here on on the show where i have two keychains where i did one with plain paper and one with sublimation and the print quality is quite considerably different but you can see the plain paper printful it is there um preston polish you help me fix my brother sc400 the new bombing case fix my issue yes girl yes that's what i'm trying to tell you a lot of times that's a really simple fix and a lot of people don't realize a lot of people don't realize that bobbing case is super important too

sounds cool yeah sublimation is awesome i love sublimation let's show you just how awesome submission is uh no you have to register it through design space in order to use it you don't okay simone i appreciate that i didn't think you had to cut anything um with a cricket press so you don't have to have a cricket print uh cricket cutting machine you do have to have a design space and register it according to kimber york thank you kimber i appreciate that that's the moment um so let's get into what we have here and what i'm going to do is pull this over here first and foremost actually let's move this to the side and then move this over and i'm going to pull up my um first of all i'm going to show y'all something did i print it out yes it printed out okay so where are you y'all know how i

on the creative fabrica i did today and look at the bumblebees they're super cute um i did today and i scrolled until i found something that stuck out to me i'll see if i come across it hopefully i will if i don't i'll just click on it in my downloads i absolutely love this one that would be adorable in a nursery um that's pretty too i love that watercolor um horns on the elk y'all if you get on creative fabric somebody came back and sent me oh that would be cute on the book too somebody came back and sent me a message and was like i was on there for hours and it's your fault and i'm like i'm sorry i mean i'm just telling you i know stuff is hurting on there and it's awesome and it's easy and you can get it you it will get away from you because you'll be like oh it's cute when you download it and even like oh that's cute and then you download it like oh that's your next thing you know your whole computer is filled up with images and it's just like oh my god i didn't organize this and until you get back in order it's just crazy it's crazy so i love these summer landscapes too those are super cute those would be cute on the mug all right so i don't see the one because i scrolled for a while before i got to it oh that's pretty see it's a boy that would be cute on a mug for a new lover okay i don't see the oh here it is okay cheerful flowers this one i was like oh my god that's adorable so here are you can get these individual flowers with it it all comes with with these individual flowers it comes with the um wreaths it comes with these two bouquets and it comes with the long bouquet all right and here's an example of it on a shirt so what i did was i took it and put it on a bug um let's see if this works that didn't work either let's go to some and do it the easy way there we go so this is what i made today embroidery shows calm in my soul i just say hair came up with that i don't know if that sounds awesome because like i said i am not a designer in at least a little bit but i thought this was really pretty and this can go on one side of the mug and then this on the side and it's on the opposite side so i figure what we'll do is print us the first mode just a really simple bug and i did print it out already and i'm gonna go ahead and put my super loud heat press mug press on and there is my print out and of course when you're doing sublimation you have to mirror and there's a lot of waste on here because i printed it and didn't uh utilize like do more than one on this sheet but that's what i came up with and as soon as i find some scissors we're going to um cut this out better all right so all i did all i did in order to create this um for my mug okay is i took the individual designs as you see there's the long flowers i duplicated the long flowers there's the one set of flowers and then there's the wreath and then i put my letter e in the middle um and i put this on in photoshop i use adobe only because i use adobe for video editing so i'm used to the plat so the interface um so that's what i use um and i did the type tool which is over here in the left hand uh pane and then type this out in my client choice and that's that was just that simple um the square around here if you purchase the mugs from dietrich.com they will send you the links to templates where you can download templates to use in your editing software to know how to set up the layout on your mugs on your treat jar on your soup jar on your uh tugger that they sent so all of that is uh available for you if you purchase from nitrands all right so what i'm doing now is because i don't have any scissors right here before i get up and go get them i'm just going to tear this um down some and then it makes it easier for me to cut it so now i have it cut out now i'm going to trim away this black line here the border because i don't want that line on the mug um and if you don't have the template if you just bought some mugs off of amazon they're not gonna send you a template usually so in order to determine what you need to uh make and do your it's beeping because it's hot and ready and it's gonna keep doing that and get on my nerves so let's do that real quick um you can get your tape measure and you can measure and lay out a rectangle just like you saw and the rectangle would need to be the height of where you want to imprint which this would be four and a quarter maximum and then you can go from the edge of the handle all the way around with your tape measure so the other handle the other side and this one comes out to whoops i couldn't see i should have did it the other way take it all the way around the mug like you're measuring your waist line and you will come out with nine and roughly nine i'd say nine and three quarters right so your rectangle needs to be nine to three quarters by whatever the person was that i've already forgotten because i'm gonna drop the tape nine and three quarters by four and a quarter okay so you can set up your own templates in a lot of instances and figure out where you want to put your stuff but i think the template from doctrines which we'll pull it up has even showing you where the center is and the different panels on either side of the boat so that you can line up your designs that way as well all right so let's get you switched over up let's see you know that wasn't a question for me eve what i meant by paper on the outside after printing your design regular sub paper wrapped that design in three sheets of regular paper oh sweet to control the bleeding and security okay cool yes you really should put blow out paper that's what that's called in sublimation uh world blowout paper it will help make sure that once we wrap this we wrap this around the mug what's going to happen is your mug your heat press is going to heat this paper and sublimate the ink onto the mug right well as it heats this ink the ink is is turning into a gas to be absorbed by the poly coating so not only is it going to go towards the book but it's also coming back to the back side of the paper so you'll notice like right now you can barely see the imprint on the other side once we take it out of the bug press you'll be able to see that a lot better because it's going to bleed back through well what will happen if you don't put blowout paper around this or another sheet of paper or two over the top of this in the bulk press what will happen is it will imprint onto the cup of the bug press onto the cuff rather and you won't be able to get that out and it could imprint on the next thing that you put into your roof so you definitely want to make sure that you're putting blowout paper on your projects when you um do your sublimation all right so i'm going to i like the way that it's lined up on this side don't necessarily like the way to find it from that time but who cares you also will need to invest in a heat tape and that's what this is this is heat tape and you definitely want to have some because this tank um is what's gonna hold your thing to your mode your paper to your mug now some heat tapes you got to be careful some el cheapo heat tapes will leave yellow on your mug and that's pretty tragic if you see it um so try to make sure that you make sure it's good and smooth to the mug but make sure that you pay attention to do one on a cheapo plaster on the cheapo mug first to see if it transfers and if it does because if it does then you won't use this anymore that thing i tell y'all you know what i can't remember it's been so long since i've used it i can't remember how to shift it up so i'm just gonna put another sheet of sublimation paper on here only because it's right here and i forgot to take the um i forgot to cut the rectangle off so we're going to put more tape you know what i'm going to fight the heat all right so i got this and let's switch over our camera and then y'all can see me shut this thing up oh push hey you still ain't hushing it's been forever since i used this so there we go so we're going to i think this is not tight enough so i just turn this and it pulls it out some and then we set it in and now we close it up all right is it countdown no it's not y'all i'm gonna fight a heat press i forget how to use this thing my uh learn how to use it and she told me but for right now it's in there we gonna set a different timer so with the mugs generally mugs are like three to five minutes it depends on the bug so what i'm going to do is go on to the direct die trans website and look at the timing it suggests because they do tell you that much four minutes and 30 seconds so we're going to do four minutes on this thing because it's already been in there for 30 seconds so let's set a google timer all right so beats will get annoying yes i gotta figure out how to uh that place is like a kid to keep saying mom mom yeah i can't do it y'all i don't have patience like that anymore so we're gonna let that work i have the countdown on um on whatever the name of my website is let's get you switched back over to mom and then what we're going to do is um get a design set up for our treat jar because the treats are super cool i'm really excited about that and i need to make sure of the diameter before we get back home oh and our tall one i already have a design in mind for that one um so let's see i'm going to pull that one up because this one is on um creative fabric as well this one i love this this is super cute i am a uh star wars buff and this is on creative fabrica so i'm making this for myself um and this is what i'm going to put on my mug with the black handle super excited about that you know this thing is over here counting down and i didn't even go but it's all right i got my own countdown going on right here we got two minutes and 17 seconds left but here is another design that i have and i'm going to put that on as i mentioned my 15 ounce mug so we're going to do that and let's go back to graphics because they also have this graphics tab where you can do backgrounds coloring pages graphic templates i had clicked on illustrations earlier patterns is really cool um because with patterns you can just get uh have papers made or have your own fabric made or as you see this is patterns that can go on a tumbler or mug this is totally adorable as you see it on a mug that's super cute so they have patterns as well but the um just your regular graphics it pulls up like the illustrations too but it also has um sayings and stuff like family the farmhouse bundle uh so i also want to show you what they have on sale because i want to put this on a mug too if you go to they have a um sales section where is it here it is popular crafts design this one family house kids grateful blessing even though my kids are grown and gone but this would be cute to go on the mug i choose you and still choose you over and over this love you to the moon and back and the family one and some see a weed some see a wish these three i know for a fact are like 60-something cents they're on sale they're on sale on their website so if you don't have a creative fabrica membership they do often offer specials designs on specials and i thought this one was really cute that would go on a mug as well so we're going to do that one um also so let's get you um to where we can do another design where is my timer my timer is 13 seconds y'all so let's switch it back over to the bug press cam and i don't have glitters on me so let me go grab gloves if this timer finishes up and i have gloves from dollar tree and this thing is going to beep here in a minute and get on our nerves i'm warning you ahead of time because i said this is at 16 seconds these came from dollar tree you got to be careful with them because they'll leave a black mark on the porcelain of the mug the ceramic so i knew it shut up okay so here's our mug we're gonna let it cool just a smidge before i start because you know this is a little bit brown let me peel this off actually see look how that this was plain sublimation paper and you see how it bled through to this layer as well so that's why you need blowout paper that's why you need blowout paper because that will transfer to the inside of your press and you don't want that okay now here's our mug and i can go ahead and peel this off so as you can see and that's why i didn't want that purple line but it doesn't look too bad the purple line that i use to determine where to lay my graphics but as you see it sublimates beautifully just absolutely beautiful and like i mentioned these are at diatrans.com and you should be able to use these in your qriket press okay so no need to go to michael's and fight the other women's at the michaels over the press please don't do that all right so i'm going to set this down on my ceramic floor on the tile so that it will cool off and we're going to put this in the trash and as you see my heat press i don't know how well you can see that that's okay it's counting down so it can beep at us again y'all i'll tell you it it's difficult being dealing with different pieces of equipment and having to memorize how to use them all right so that was one so easy peasy right the uh cricket press should be just as simple so let's go back to um let's do the jedi actually so i'm gonna switch you over to here to this one and i've already done this which it turned out absolutely beautiful so we're going to delete that layer we're going to delete this layer and we're going to delete that layer onto the soul embroidery so yeah delete that delete that and delete that but i'm keeping this rectangle and the reason why i'm keeping the rectangle is because i can resize this for my larger mode all right so we said that the larger mode was four and a quarter if i'm not mistaken four and a quarter tall so i'm going to make this this right now three and three quarters so i'm going to change this to 4.25 so it's now taller and all the way around it was nine and a quarter from remembering correctly so let's go all the way around and it was we can actually go to 10 inches but i'm doing nine and three quarters so right now it's eight and three quarters so let's just put it on make life simple so here is my space uh for the jedi saying and i'm going to probably go unconventional um usually people put a design um on just the front side of the cup and the back side i don't know we might do that i don't have to see how it fits when i start to put it in but i'm going to go to file and i'm going to place embedded because that's where i want to put my um design and where's my jet body right here and i want the png i'm going to click place and it's going to come in super colossal and that's entirely too big so we'll resize it now and i'm gonna shut this up give ourselves another 240 seconds all right so here is you know what i could put it on both sides only because that's what i love but yes here is my design that i want let's see what it looks like if i stretch this out ew don't like that but that's okay all right and what you can do here is we can um go to edit and copy and then click off of it and edit and paste and we can put two so that it's on both sides or i could go out and find some really cool lightsaber images or a jedi image or one of my favorite jedi folks a picture ooh the hair no vader's not a job dress if i was a sith i need to have one that says this so i can put here um but i'm gonna do just one side for right now so we're going to print this out and here's my box that's there again i have the box so that i'll know where to cut and trim this paper so this time when i print it out i'm not going to unwrap some scissors while i put the paper on the machine so that i can cut it out properly this time yes i know it's a bit of a waste of this 17 by 11 paper but to keep from swapping stuff over on the machine that's what i am doing so we're gonna print that out i grab my scissors this time and we're going to that should print actually really quickly and i'm going to go back to the chat while they print which it won't take long at all echo tanks yes echo tanks is um an awesome printer to use so thank you guys for answering those questions the sewing brat i am using uh adobe photoshop i have um i do the monthly subscription for adobe photoshop because i used the premiere pro for editing it just made sense to keep using that line of stuff i may switch to corel soon i don't know because i'm going to be using corel with a different program soon so we'll see how it goes do you apply sublimation coating to the dollar tree book um i did not do a dollar tree mode this mug came from ditrans.com ditrans.com everything that we're doing tonight is from die trans so their stuff is already coded for sublimation you don't have to do anything at all to it dollar tree if you get a mug from dollar tree you will have to coat it with something in order to sublimate the mug and it just depends on um it depends on what mug you get and what you sublimated with there's uh like poly coating that you can buy but i haven't heard of many people having success with that it's just it really is easier and less headache less stress just i mean the bugs aren't super expensive now i mean at one point mugs were kind of costly but they're not that expensive anymore it's just better to go ahead and buy the right thing and do it the right way honestly all right [Applause] okay so i have some lines in my i don't know if you can see that let's see if that comes through it's printed out with lines so that's telling me my print heads really need to be um cleaned and there's some over bleeding on that i don't like oh now that i'm looking at it closer so first of all there you go you can see the lines now first of all those lines are unacceptable i'm not going to put that on my mug and then second of all i doubt you'll be able to see it but around the lettering bring it out a little bit somewhere around that lettering there's bleeding like a faint um overspray almost that's what i'm use the word i'm using but that's not what that is what that is is um the print because the background is not clear the background is white if i'm looking let me look at this and make sure i'm not telling y'all wrong incorrectly rather yes the background is white so let me show you how i can tell i'll switch you over to photoshop so here is my design and the background of my page is white so i'm going to change this background by hiding it and make the background transparent and as you see the inside of this design is still white so essentially what my printer was trying to do was it's like this is a picture of some sort whoever created this um it's like this is a picture and that's not good quality so this background really needs to be removed and see if that cleans it up some so they have an eraser tool um let's do the magic eraser tool and it's going to be rasterized and let's block that block that and now it's um clear transparent background so make sure zeros all zeroes r so all i'm doing is going in and clearing out all these white spaces in my letters so that hopefully i can squash that over print or over spray so to speak um and get it where it will not look like that and i'm gonna try and print this again to see if that clears it up so now the printer won't be trying to print uh black in the background and we'll see if that fixes that problem oh y'all it's 10 30. we end up talking and i don't get to sublimate everything like i want to but at least you get to see this stuff that's one of my favorite things you get to see the blanks that are available to you so let's hit print this line and that's what i want on my black mug i'm probably going to put it on the front and the back so i don't know we'll see if i can find some really cool um sabers or something to go on the other side and then for the treat jar because i do really want to do the treat here so i'm gonna see if i can find that exactly oh my paper was full definitely i got something and then i'll switch you guys over i absolutely love um how you can go into your google photos and type in what you're looking for and it's so smart it pulls up right so i typed in the dog and now he's pulling up all the pictures of dogs that i have on in my photo history what is a specific picture look at it i have three dogs and i was going to put a picture of my dog on one dog in particular on the tree dark blitz i don't think that would be cool so i can't figure that out all right so for the time being let's look at the jedi because it finished printing and see if it looks better the jedi does not look better but the bleeding around the letters looks a little bit better so that kind of tells me if you do a printout and the printout doesn't look the best it's a good possibility that it's that the image isn't a so this looks like something that i would want to recreate so to speak um try and find just this word in here online somewhere in a better quality and then type all of this out myself and make it in photoshop that's probably what i'm going to end up doing because i'm not doing that at all at all all right so going back to what time is it 3 38 let's go back to these books let's see if we can't find something cute really quick to use oh there it is cool you guys are awesome sauce thank you all right so how's kids family together a little grateful love you too earlier that i absolutely loved and we're gonna find it okay so this is the main page let's go to because i am a sucker for giraffes i saw that one but it was another oh hold on what's this mega sublimation bundle two so firefighter oh i like the piggy on the beach that's cute i'm nicer than my face look that's tragic i always carry a little crazy with me that's cute a cow firefighter this light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome it that's cute because she's defined joy and something that is this is cute this is a nice bundle not all who wonder are lost some are moms hiding from their children being one of his grandchildren all right i don't always tell people where i fish when i do it's a lie that's oh honey i am that mom so there are 24 designs in a bundle so i like this that's cute but i would have to go through all of that so for the time being i'm going to add it to my favorites like 541 other people have done and i'll come back to that later because i want that giraffe i got to find him again um because i saw him somewhere he was super cute oh this is cute you could put your name across there so am i in conventional y'all we need more time two hours it's not enough when you're using creative fabric it just isn't it's not enough time because i promise you i can be all nice and oh that's cute oh that's cute that's cute that's kind of cute it's kind of cute but my style okay there's the inheritance i thought it was pretty because i like red clothes and i like giraffes too okay so with this bundle you get all of those flowers you get all of these rafts and animals and lava i think the llama llama looks like a llama to get all of these pictures this is the one i really want just that one there and then all these party flowers with some purple y'all know that's my color more frames more pictures more colors more frames super cute love the frames that's adorable those are beautiful so you can create your own you see what i'm saying you can actually make your own style your own that's why i love this man like these could be car coasters these could be drink coasters these could be stickers like you see look they printed that on the mug in the pattern so you have options with this type of bundle i absolutely love it but that is super cute i love that i'm definitely going to add that to my favorites and i was going to put that on something because i wanted jet out on my book i don't want that on the treat jar let's put him on this um stainless steel tumbler because y'all haven't seen the same steel yet so you can see what that looks like because stainless steel um because stainless steel ends up sublimating different and it looks different from the white so it looks different from the white so let's sublimate the pretty giraffe on this as soon as it's done it's a pretty decent sized file it's taking it a minute to download and as soon as it's done we'll put it in um let's go ahead and get our measurements though so the design up top is going to be three roughly three inches i'm gonna stick with three inches and a round so we'll do three by three by ten okay three by ten and we'll put us something together to go on here now the downside to doing tumblers without the handle right so in the mug press it should be cool by now yes it is so in the bug press the thing about the mud press even with the cricut it doesn't envelop the entire mug because it makes takes into account the handle so it just goes up to the handle but with these tumblers and these tuggers there's no handle so you kind of want a full wrap usually to have a full coverage around this so to compensate for that with what we're doing today i'm just going to do the designs around it but you know kind of space it so it doesn't look bad when it comes to the section where it's open for the um handle to the uh the space on the left press so i'm going to take this off like i said it's 10 by 3 so let's change our um photoshop stuff here's our images it downloaded and here's everything within super cute um i like the one with the flowers as opposed to the one without the flowers and then we'll try and put something else on the backside oh they already did the repeated pattern for you that was totally awesome um i like that that's pretty i don't know which one i want down oh decisions okay so let's go into uh photoshop and we're going to bring the background back up because i want to be able to see this box better and i'm going to hide the jedi for right now i'll come back to that later i'm going to actually have to redo that we've got less than 15 minutes so let's see if we can't get this going so we said that our rectangle needed to be three inches high by 10 okay so here is the space that we have to work with so i'm going to m uh place an embedded picture go back to our desktop and here is our watercolor animals and i'm going to pick the floral giraffe and i'm going to place it and it's going to come in huge look at that that's adorable oh my god i love it okay so i'm going to make it small to fit my three inches and i'm actually going to put it uh less than three inches a little bit less than three inches not quite okay it's super cute totally adorbs all right so now i'm going to place embedded and i'm going to go back to my folder and i think oh god decisions decisions um i'm going to go with this one and i'm going to put this one and as you see this one has a clear background and you can tell because as you see the it lays over the top of the giraffe and stuff and you can see the giraffe behind it so you want a transparent background for designs that you put on your stuff okay so we're going to bring that over here now 10 inches was the size all the way around and we're not going to be able to go all the way around so i'm not gonna put anything that close to the edge okay and then i want my name to fit in here so let's spread this out some and i'm actually going to put whoops my nickname so let's put our text box and i'm going to put my nickname there and i don't want that font so i'm going to highlight it i do like the purple so i'm gonna actually let's change this purple real quick so this purple there's the dropper so i'm gonna pick the purple of the berries i think literally there we go let's go nope that's not dark enough so we'll just leave it where it's at we'll leave it that purple it should look okay so let's go to france because i needed to zoom in really and um to find the color and i'm going to scroll through and find a font now they have tons and tons and tons of font on stitch topia a stitch topia that's where i'm brewing they have tons and tons of fonts on creative fabrica that you can use but i don't have um i don't remember what all of them are because i have so blame many of them so i'm just going to grab this font oops i can pick it this way and that way and let's move it kind of works right there it's not centered either let's see if it's more centered it looks more centered uh i would like to have more here so but i'm going to go with what i have because i'm going to limit the time all right so we have that we have that and round in here all in here let's add just a few more elements um just to add a little bit of flair before we run out of time um they didn't have a draft like by itself they had two wraps and i'm not feeling that so let's put this here because that looks like a magnolia which is one of my favorite flowers we'll say yachts to that one let's place what else that we have we have these cute little iron thingy my bodies we'll put one of these in here stretch this down that's not what i was trying to do but you know that goes with it all right so and then we'll find another flower and we'll go with this little column right here as you can tell what my favorite color is so if you ever find something super cute in this color you're more than welcome to send it to me there's that and we need to balance that so let's see what else we got let's place one more thing that looks like a magnolia too little bitty dots here berries like berries very perfect for us all right we're gonna go with that all right so that's super cute let's print this and then we're going to press this to our uh mug first i'm going to put paper in the printer our mug is about to collar again so let's do that and reset that press [Music] print this out really quick and then once i print this out we'll talk about the issue with design space because we're at the end of our day of our show and i'm all right we're going over just a little bit so that we can um get this mug pressed all right but i want to show you what i'm going to do to test and make sure that this fits so let's switch over to the mug press and here i want to be sure that this is going to work in here so i'm going to test it and see if it grabs it and it it's grabbing it too loose in my opinion i want it a little bit tighter so i'm just going to tighten it up some so you can test it ahead of time so that you're not because you don't want to put it in with your sublimation paper put it in press it briefly like that pull it back out put it in because that will cause ghosting you don't want that meaning it will put images in a couple of places on your mug and you don't want that okay so let's get this i want it to be super snug oh it's cute oh my god okay calm down all right let's put this in there yes all right i want that to cushion in really good let's grab this off the printer super cute look at that oh i'm so excited okay so while that cools off i'm gonna send you back over and let that mug cool down some because of pressing it like that it did heat it up not all the way but it didn't heat it up a little bit and i don't want to cause any ghosting no i don't want to activate the sublimation ink ahead of time so i'm just going to let that cool off three kicks meanwhile i'm to cut this out and then that way it'll be ready to put on the book and then we can put it on the press here in a moment um but while i cut this out i'm going to go ahead and speak on the um issue with design space and the limitations that they're putting in and the reason why i'm and i also have an announcement so for those of you who are here i have a pretty pretty big announcement something that i had said i wouldn't do but i'm going to do it at any rate um when you are who is still high when you are a business owner okay so imagine you have a business and you're making these books you're gonna do tumblers and you're gonna sell tumblers right so how do you make your money off of selling tumblers you buy a tumbler these are five dollars each i don't know how much they are i need to look up or it's listed but i'm get i'm going to assume five dollars for the purpose of this illustration so say these are five dollars each and you have your subscription to creative fabrica that you pay for each month then you take the time and you put stuff together like this put the person's name in it you're doing the design and you have the designs and such and you're going through all that work to make these tumblers for your customers right and you buy your tumblers they come in you pay for shipping you paid you you got everything stored paying for the racks and all this the ink the printer the whole time in order to make money five dollars for the tumbler we're gonna just guess and say we can add an extra 10 bucks just for the heck of it for supplies for ink for paper for electricity for printer for labor the whole nine then to ship back to the customer to ship back to the customer uh you're gonna be shipping so let's say 25 bucks for a sublimated mode just like this all you're doing is getting the graphics putting the graphics on the mode putting the name on the mode doing a little bit of graphic design not a whole lot because you've got creative fabric a girl and it's hooking you up and that's what you're doing to make money so 25 bucks off of five book tumblr and your other supplies so let's say 15 bucks 25 books your profit is 10 well if you constantly have customers coming to you saying well you're spending on shipping and on these tumblr so i'm gonna go buy the tumblers because they found some ltpo tumblers off of amazon for three dollars each and they're bringing them to you saying you're charging 25 i think you should come down on your price and you should print my tumblers and not charge me 25 you should be able to do this in a way for free because i bought the tumbler and i'll just pay you for the ink and your time and whatnot so what i'm doing here is i'm putting my my design on this and all i'm going to do is tape it down it's cooled off a lot so we're going to go ahead and do that and i'm going to put it out so back to the story you're telling so you're telling me that you just because you're buying the tumbler you shouldn't have to pay as much as a person who is buying a tumbler from me and putting it on and making money off of it you're trying to keep me out of my money or you're taking advantage of my kindness and making me custom for you and you're not appreciating the value of what i'm giving you okay so looking at it from that standpoint i kind of can't understand where cricket is coming from because cricket is offering a service yes it comes with their cutter yes um you did pay for the cutter you paid for the cutting machine um yes you are still going and using their software but you're not paying to use their software on a monthly basis whereas you could be paying them monthly just to use their software there's a lot of companies that do that no silhouette doesn't so it does not the silhouette is significantly more you paying even though you're paying one time but it's more it's about 100 bucks for the designer edition um but you're paying for their software yeah there's other options out there but you got to look at it from a business standpoint they know that there are hundreds of thousands of cricket machines out there that people are using in a business capacity so in a business capacity you have to understand from a business perspective that they want to earn a profit they're about to go public they're about to sell stock um so in order for their stock members for their investors to see uh a good investment for what they're buying into their stocks they need to see okay you're making money to help us make money the best way that you can so in order to do that hey i have a hundred hundreds of thousands of folks out here with this machine and they're using your software for free to make money yeah they bought the machine but they're constantly making and earning a ton of revenue off of shirts off of not mugs at the time but shirts mostly um some crafts and stuff but they're going to etsy or other places like that buying designs that we don't have on our design space and bringing them back into the design space to edit and do them up for free and cut them out for free and making tons of money off of it all we're asking is just subscribe to design space then you can do what you want you can buy whatever you want you can bring in whatever you want with no limits just i mean out of saying thank you for using our software right so that's pretty much where that's coming from and why they're doing that and from a business standpoint i totally get i really do and they're even being generous they're like look we'll give you 20 22 designs per month you can upload for free don't worry about it you can do the 22 that's your only limit is the 22 okay so if you're not doing this as a business if you're doing this as a hobby and it's just you making a couple craps here and there that's that won't be an issue that will not be an issue for you it won't bother you but if you're doing this as a business and you're hustling and making money off of this 22 is not enough because we upload crafts all the time and cut stuff out so creepy is just like look bro we get it we want you to make money but we also need to make money too so i understand where they're coming from do i agree with it at this point it don't matter because it's their choice and it's their software so for me to be mad you know yeah you know i mean i'm still going to use freaking confidence and i've paid for qriket design space uh as it is anyway only because i like to have access to all of their fonts and so you know yes i can go out and get other fonts but i like having access to their software without restriction so i have the subscription anyway but for those who don't and prefer to use it for free try or some other type editing software to see if you can get what you're looking for for editing without any restrictions or whatever but then again actually you can't use it because you can't upload it to design space but 22 designs for both so yes i can understand how that would be frustrating but you got to understand from a business perspective these folks are here to make money which is why they're also charging 200 for their heat press only for their mug prices you know they're out here to make money you have to understand that and you may not agree with it but if you don't agree with it there is silhouette out there but you better believe at some point in time some of it is going to pull away me complaining at some point so it's just all business it's not personal and folks are really taking this personally and i i can understand why they would but it's it's i mean if you're out here making money you've got to understand you know even buying blanks from dietrich.com versus amazon you know what i'm saying at least if you go to die trans and buy their blanks you're getting good quality blanks you don't have to worry about whether it's going to sew up properly or not they're going to stand behind their stuff if it doesn't sub they're going to walk you through it they're going to send a replacement they're going to do what they have to do to make sure that their customer is happy whereas amazon is just going to be like i mean it shouldn't you did something wrong you know so you kind of get what you pay for but i wanted to point out i do definitely understand where they're coming from with it and you know it doesn't it doesn't upset me that they're charging for design space because at the end of the day that's pretty much what they want anyway right so here is our stainless steel tumbler i have as you see the white up here i wrapped the design and then i wrapped another piece of sublimation paper and i'm just going to put this thing in here and i'm going to go ahead you know what i should have been hold on see this is what i told you not to do earlier but i did it anyway there's the gap i need to make sure that gap is up and i didn't so hopefully this didn't go hopefully i didn't mess it up lord i hope i didn't mess it up okay all right so there is our stainless steel tumbler i am going to go into um chat but first i want to look and see make sure that i'm putting this in at the right time medium time it doesn't have a timer oh my gosh no no okay so we're let's look at a different one let's look at this one let's see what the time is on this one one to two and a half minutes okay so 60 cc's 120 i think we'll be okay with the time that i have it on there now i'll stop it a little bit early so let me go to the chat while that counts down my problem is the software doesn't work but half time i have no issue paying for software that works fricking it's not my backup i will use my silhouette and yeah i can understand the um y'all make this moving towards 60 year old friend take notes away from the information and check yeah i love the chat chat is awesome um i have no issue paying for software that works so i haven't had an issue with your software not working recently um especially since i have the desktop version um i use the desktop version primarily no that was the wrong time i don't want it to overcook now i think about the 1660 is 120 plus 30 is 150 so i don't want that to overcook and we had it on what 240 so we'll stop it when it gets to 100. all right so cricket designed to be so often worth 10 bucks a month and it's 10 bucks a month it's not like 25 30. if y'all knew what i had to pay for adobe a month you would cringe adobe is expensive um and yes you'll finally get to do offset fonts i mean i don't have an issue with it breaking down for me i i i hear about that a lot and i hate that there was a point in time where it was glitching a lot for me but it doesn't anymore so you know and definitely when you start working in cricket and doing your designs and such please say first please they before you um stop and and don't before you keep going save your projects periodically as you go and they kind of really need to implement that all right let me go ahead and take this thing out before it burns and look at here smoking already like i said you gotta take it out before it burns this is hot um i want to take the outer paper off first it turned brown a little bit i don't like that but at least the heat looked like it got to it pretty good so i'm hoping right here on the edge that it imprinted properly so let's see little crap trying to get this off hold my on aren't helping me and i promise i don't want to take these darn gloves off okay because i don't want to burn myself there we go oh my god that is gorgeous i am so happy look y'all oh that is so pretty let me switch it over to the other camera so you can see better even though this thing is hot it's fire switch my switch because it's after 11 and i'm gonna get you guys out of here as well there we go there we go look oh my god the flowers turned out so pretty hopefully i can twist this you know with my arm because i can't switch hands okay so this is the one that's called a tugger so the tugger i can um use for a can koozie or a drink tumbler which is really pretty stinking cool and this one as you see is stainless steel so you can um you can as you see you can supplement on stainless steel with the silver but because it's not white you can't sublimate white so if you're looking for a design that needs to have white the this is gonna be silver because that's what color the background is so this really turned out super super cute i'm really excited about that that's going to be a fun cook to drink out of so i'm going to set it down on the uh ceramic tile floor and yes it did turn out super super cute i am so excited about that y'all that's a highlight of my night all right so at some point y'all we need to do like a extra um show or something and sublimate more stuff with no talking so we'll have to set that up and the captains will have to have a sublimation show as well but as i mentioned i wanted to do a quick announcement what we're going to start setting up within the next week but not setting up this i'm going to have a schedule set up uh because so many people are asking for one-on-one tutorials okay so we will be putting an option for that up on our website now i'm still ironing out the platform that we'll use for the one-on-ones um but that is something that is in the works and the final information on it will be put in the facebook page um but we'll do a test run of only maybe five people just to see how it goes because i i i prefer the the environment here on live and going back and forth but some folks really want their voice heard and their concerns addressed and they want that one-on-one attention and i understand that um so we're trying to set aside a day out of my schedule to get that allocated for one-on-ones okay so the schedule's gonna be very very limited and the availability is gonna be very very limited so you know if you're interested in that please keep your ear to the ground on facebook because we're gonna there's only gonna be a limited space available for that uh because i have so much going on at all times and i want to make sure that it's fair for y'all and fair for me and fear for my husband and just fearful life in general so we can get everybody uh in so that's something that's going to come up and i just wanted to let that be known so that for those of you who want that one-on-one um please keep again keep your eye on facebook this week i'm thinking about wednesday we should have it ironed out but for the sake of apartment let's say friday we'll say friday we should have some information up for you um and how to sign up and where to sign up and how much it's going to be all right so thank you very very much for joining me this evening um yeah that was cool looking the silver yes it's totally awesome let me make sure i'm not missing any questions so is regular stainless steel sublimatable or just that particular one from guy tran um no it has to be a sublimated it has to be coated so you can't just get a supplement of a stainless steel from any store instead of available it does have to have a polycobia but they are available on diatrans so yes you can um use that and cricket is going public teamwork yes i don't know when but they are um and who uh joanne's is going public as well i'm super excited about joanne's so joann's going public soon as well when you say blowout paper are you talking about freezer paper i'm talking about butcher paper uh plain copy paper uh with plain copy paper you may need about two sheets possibly it depends on how pigment heavy how much ink is on the paper if it's a lot of ink like a really big dent design then you want to put another two sheets on there or put two sheets instead of just one um i wouldn't use freezer paper because i think freezer paper has a wax coating and you don't want the wax the wax will come off so make sure if you do freezer paper make sure it doesn't have a coating on it um and then you should be able to use it i think cricket calling that many were using other design software to have more options and less buggy but then uploading in the design space to store there for free and cut out on the cricut which is a possibility and again it still factors back into the fact that folks are using the platform to make money this is they're only targeting the folks that that's utilizing their free services to earn a profit that's it and so the folks that are out there that's trying to make a profit out of it for free usually are the ones that's griping the loudest and are complaining the loudest and talking about protesting and ticket lines and stuff or whatever y'all if you're out here making business you have to pay to have a business it's not free you know just like i mentioned that's why we really appreciate the support that you guys give here on the channel with the youtube memberships because it helps pay for this ridiculously expensive adobe um subscription each month it helps pay for the qriket subscription each month it helps pay for the creative fabrico subscription each month so that i can come on here and show you all this cool stuff show you the qriket tutorials how to cut out your rhinestone stuff with cricket show you how to use all of this stuff but i have to have access to it in order to show it to you so that helps offset a lot of that especially over y'all it's crazy and then about to uh delve into carell as well for a whole another arena that we're not going to talk about just yet but for real i mean all of these things cost money and you have to understand that so if you're trying to make a business or earn uh income as a business owner you're going to have to invest back into your business and ten dollars of money for the cricket subscription access is not a lot of money 120 bucks a year i mean it go online and look at how much adobe photoshop is adobe premiere pro go online and look at how much um corel draw is and and they're sweet this stuff ain't cheap this stuff is not cheap and you get what you pay for so when i'm out here spending hundreds of dollars on video editing software so that i can make sure that your videos don't come out looking crazy and just choppy and stuff you want the best quality i want y'all to have the best quality so i have to invest in stuff like that so as a business owner for cricket to come and say look we know you're making money off of it we know you are look we get it we want you to make money look just invest back into us and invest back into us and help us make money too you know because you out here doing doing our stuff for free i get it i can't even be mad because i know what i pay for the things that i do so it only makes sense to me what they're doing they're just trying to keep a successful company look at how many look at how many companies shut down in the last year the last 12 months y'all look at how many companies are gone now it's like used to be in you like darn what happened look i mean businesses are boarded up and closed up all over the place because they couldn't survive the shutdown they couldn't survive the the lack of funding and folks not being out spending money and whatever cricket was able to rise above that and then zone because everybody went home and started making money and started making their own businesses or they're working from home and doing crafting on top of that extra income you know what i'm saying so just you know it's a small thing that they're asking for to 10 bucks a month and you know if you're not happy with that then they're okay with you going somewhere else they really don't you know i mean they care but at the end of the day it's business and you can't make everybody happy so if you look at it from that aspect it doesn't offend you it's bad you know i'm saying people are taking stuff way too personal and like this is just oh my god it's the end of the world and all that jazz so yeah um oh no michael's gonna be part of it that's crazy oh your adobe stuff is 40 a month that's good because that's what i want but it also depends on all the other things that you're adding to it so the cloud itself whatever programs and stuff you add in factors into that price so have a good idea more so at any rate you guys have an excellent night i really appreciate you joining me it was a lot of fun we went over 20 minutes um okay scooby doo i will um we went over 20 minutes i apologize but i definitely wanted y'all to see um at least something being supplemented so we did get the super cute mug as you see purple all over the place and we did let's see if the stainless steel tumbler is cool enough for me to touch let's see yes boy i tell y'all that ceramic towel ain't no joke and so now we have our uh stainless steel tumbler it's tilted back a little bit so you can see it better and it turned out super cute oh my gosh yo i got some i mean all these drink potatoes i'm gonna have to start making stuff with little people that is super cute i absolutely love that that's adorbs so sublimation is a lot of fun and it's not difficult to do you just have to have the right tools and the right equipment to get it done can the cricket press live up to that height i think it can so just keep that in mind when you go out and purchase your stuff um you know don't fight over the mugs there's more than one place to purchase sublimation mugs from and uh you guys enjoy your crafting journey we're here for you if you have any questions shoot off in the facebook page or in the hoop group group you can put questions there and we're here to help you as soon as i get my jedi mug printed i'll show you guys what that looks like um don't know that i'm gonna do that tonight because i'm pretty tired i was out helping get a car towed first thing this morning so i'm exhausted but um you guys thanks for joining us and i look forward to seeing you all next week and if more of you get the mug press follow me in the facebook group raise the bell and ring the bell for you again next week if i missed bringing the bell for you tonight because we were so committing and i wasn't looking at the chat i apologize but please bring it to my attention next week so that we can definitely hit the bell one for you okay you guys have a great night and i'm gonna go fight the wordpress see you later bye i gotta figure out how to quiet that thing y'all have a good night oh my gosh that's tragic oh my daddy it's up sometimes good night", "yLc3htnfjQU": "hi I'm Morgan from whole a tale of calm and today I'm going to show you how to make a recipe that is perfect for these cold winter months it's called the snow cap here's what you'll need 8 ounces of freshly brewed drip coffee 1 ounce of vodka 3/4 of an ounce of moanin hazelnut syrup and we're gonna garnish the drink with some whipped cream and granulated sugar so this is a really easy drink to put together we're gonna start with our coffee and I'm using Lavazza gran aroma which is a medium roast and I brewed that on the Bonavita exceptional brew which happens to be an SCA a certified Brewer so we love using this whenever we do recipe videos for our coffee alright so do about 8 ounces of the coffee into your mug and I'm using a Bowden Bistro double wall insulated mug which is a little large but I just love these mugs because they keep your drink warm for a really long time and these are available on our website alright next add the vodka and then we'll add in the moanin hazelnut syrup this recipe did call for Frangelico but I prefer the hazelnut syrup it cuts down on the alcohol and actually has a better flavor for me ok give it a little stir and then we'll just finish it off with some whipped cream and I know fresh is best with whipped cream but we don't have any so I'm just gonna use the canned stuff and then lastly sprinkle some granulated sugar right on top of that whipped cream which is gonna glisten like freshly fallen snow and once that whipped cream and sugar melts into your mug it gives it a really nice sweetness mmm really warms you up this is a great drink to share with friends on a cold winter night or maybe even after a long day of skiing this is the snow cap and I'm Morgan from whole lotta love thanks for watching the number one

game and today new ventures get launched everyday thanks to the significant capital raised through these crowdfunding platforms when you fund a project on IndieGoGo you're getting what we call a perk so for example if someone's raising five or ten thousand dollars to open up a new restaurant they can actually offer a meal or the opportunity to go to the opening night party when the restaurant opens well what if instead of free DVDs and tongue scrapers for your pet dog bad breath is one of the major concerns of dog owners new companies could offer their funders an equity stake in the business itself hi I'm Simon Griffiths co-founder of crickets and crafted so if that bug killing salt on land its manufacturer in the fortune 500 or that environmentally sound toilet paper starts flying off the shelves those who backed it would see some money I'm sitting down for what I believe in and I'm not getting up until I've got some toilet paper security regulations dating back to the 1930s have made it difficult for companies to trade equity for cash it's illegal for you to go online and fund your cousin's restaurant in exchange for equity but two years ago President Obama signed

says it's all about allowing regular people to make investments based on their direct knowledge of specific industries there's a whole world of people that know what they know and they don't have the

crowdfunding is going to give Main Street investors the same opportunities that Wall Street has had for ever but will Washington actually allow this new approach to work it took a full year and a half after the passage of the US jobs act for the Securities and Exchange Commission to release a 585 page document laying out how will regulate equity crowdfunding among other things companies that want to raise money on platforms like IndieGoGo will have to produce financial statements provide a narrative discussion of financial results and file annual reports with the SEC compliance costs could chase away lots of promising ventures and the world of open information why do we need the SEC getting in the way in the first place a finance will fundamentally be different going forward because the Internet is making things transparent I think if the SEC can just stay open and allow the platform's to experiment I think we'll get there Oh", "t8cItAQWLSo": "today I'm going to review the Lily's home double-wall 30 nouns I would call it a cappuccino cup or or a latte cup I bought this because my bottom one that I had the 15 ounce err I accidentally dropped it on the floor and it broke and while I had another one because they're sold as sets I have the other one at work and I did always think that it was a little too big in capacity so I decided to look for something a little smaller and this 13 ounce er is perfect for my use I like making lattes and the ratio of coffee and milk is spot-on on this now when I got this there are solace to and the second one that I bought just had a crooked handle and it was it just did not feel right and I contacted the mat of the seller and no question asked they sent me two new mugs like didn't even ask me to return the old ones so if you do get a defective item these are hand-blown so there could be defects just contact the seller and they will send you new ones new ones I guess but I really like this cup it sits nicely on the counter if I could knock anything I would knock that the base is just a little narrow so it could be a little tippy but other than that I really really like it now what are the advantages of a double wall mug the advantage is two folds one it doesn't have a lot of material so when the hot liquid goes into the mug there's not a lot of Tyrael to suck hold all the heat from it the second thing is is because it's double wall it's insulated so it keeps the liquid inside warm or cold depending on whatever you use it for that's that's it I recommend this for the price it's almost half priced in the bottom so that's the reason I didn't buy a bottom brand because they're just they're up there in the price but I've had this one for a while and it's been holding really nice I don't put it in the dishwasher there's no mention in the product description about if it's dishwasher safe or not some reviews on Amazon say say that they've been using it for a while and putting it in the dishwasher I really don't recommend putting these in the dishwasher I always wash these by hand just add the rattling inside the dishwasher could potentially damage the cup alright so what I'm gonna do for you today I'm going to make a latte and hopefully I'll get a nice design on this so let me set everything up and we'll continue from there [Music] okay let's see it always doesn't go well when you do it on camera but okay no I don't know not the best let me see if I could get a better viewing angle here yeah so Matt I've done better I've done better I swear alright so if you liked this video or if you have any

welcome to another lunchtime review today i'm going to try this bremer bistro this is a grilled cheese tomato soup it's tomato soup topped with croutons and cheddar cheese this is a frozen meal and it is microwavable one soup um is it's i'm sorry it's 18 ounces or 510 grams so there's two soups in the box now we bought these at aldi they were 3.99 since that bremer is a an aldi brand so one soup container is um one soup is 270 calories if you eat the whole box both loops it's 540 and there's just the calories for one i'm sorry per serving in the per container so it's still got both right there so let's see how you fix these so you can do this in the oven if you want to there's the other direction um it says keep ready keep frozen ready to serve remove all packaging ensure product reaches the max minimum internal temperature of 165 degrees there's the oven directions if you want uh there's a quicker oven method where you microwave a little bit and um and do the oven and then we're gonna do only the oven so when heated in microwave oven the cheese will become uh mixed in the soup so just know that it won't be sitting on top place one soup cheese on top in a microwave safe bowl um heat on high for three minutes stir and heat for another minute i guess on the oven you're gonna place one super choosing an individual i've improved ball so you'd have to have your own balls i'm wondering what these kind of look like i don't have no clue ah it's literally a little puck let me get a ball i wasn't expecting it to need a hole um do i need to open this or is it going to give me a pull tab there we go yeah it's like a little frozen disc of soup tomato soup with the cheese so in an oven if you put this in some kind of oven bowl of some kind i guess the it'll it's just basically gonna cook just like it is there it is so in the in the microwave it's going to melt and then you're going to stir up the cheese inside of it and let it go again so um basically you get two of those little hockey pucks inside here so we're going to do it um three minutes and then stirring it doesn't say anything about covering it or anything like that so um yeah cheese on top yeah so three in one so i'll be back when it comes out of the microwave okay so here it is out of the microwave i haven't given that final stir yet you can see the cheese hunks um just to let you know save yourself some cleanup time put a paper towel over top of it when you first stick it in the oven i don't care if it's got a big hockey puck of tomato soup or not put a paper towel over it because it will splatter everywhere inside your microwave top sides bottom everywhere so i had to spend about three minutes just wiping out all the soup before i could put it in for the last minute of the cooking time so cover with paper towel um some of the cheese that's on top as it's getting melted may stick to your paper towel that way but um unless you just want to clean up little specks of tomato soup everywhere in your microwave cover it up so i'll put plastic wrap or something over top of it so i'll be back in just a second to try this out hey gave it a minute to cool off um i forgot there the firm pieces in here are croutons um of course they're not gonna be crispy they're gonna be mushy but um and they are they're kind of soft but here we go yeah those croutons are like soggy bread it's okay no it's not really okay hold on i gotta bite without the bruton i don't know what kind of cheese that is the tomato soup itself is just a very bland very very plain tomato soup it doesn't have any seasonings it's not it's not very flavorful at all the cheese is a little funky and then the croutons are really mushy and they also have a seasoning on there that i'm not sure what it is and i don't necessarily like it um at least the writing is big enough for what i can read is this cheddar cheese um that doesn't taste like cheddar cheese the croutons have um it doesn't really say any seeds there's there's a seasoning in there i don't know what it is that tastes a little funky it doesn't mention anything weird it just says no um there's a couple things they could have done differently one they could have given you a package of a little bit package of five or six little croutons for each one that would have at least had a crispness to it it would have added some crispy crispiness to this the soup it's not as it is it's all mushy and liquidy um even the croutons are very mushy wet bread like filling stuff um so that part's not good the texture is not good at all so they could have given you croutons separately the tomato soup itself is not seasoned well and what seasonings are there just they're kind of weird tasting they're not good seasonings i would have rather just had pure good strong tomato soup and not have the funky seasonings that they use this one for me is a two i would not get this again i'm not gonna finish this bowl matter of fact i might dump it but yeah i wouldn't get this one again the the tomato soup is just not good and there's i don't know this if you're like a really bland tomato soup with some a little bit of cheese and a like a funky cheese um you could try it out but i i wouldn't i wouldn't save your money and buy something else because all it has so many other things that are better so skip this one buy something else hope you enjoy this video thanks for watching you", "UnDvrlaviu8": "- [Narrator] Hi guys and\nwelcome to the Family Fudge. Today, I'm sharing four\ndifferent snack boxes. These snack boxes are inspired\nby the ones at Starbucks, otherwise known as bistro boxes. Now if it's your first time here, welcome. If you enjoy this video, I encourage you to subscribe and go ahead and give it a big thumbs up. Now if you've never tried a\nbistro box from Starbucks, it's basically like a great solution for when you're on the go and you want something\na little bit healthier. So it's kinda like a light lunch, kinda like a snack, somewhere in between. They're usually low calorie and they typically include\nvegetables, fruits, and proteins like nuts and cheeses. For our first bistro box, I'm going to start by adding a little bit of low-fat cottage cheese, followed by lots of fruit, a combination of\nstrawberries and blueberries. Whoops, that blueberry\ntried to jump right out. Next in a separate container, I'm going to add one hard boiled egg. Now I have to admit I overcooked\nthese hard boiled eggs just a bit, but that's gonna be fine. To go along with that, I'm also gonna add a little tangerine and then a handful of mixed nuts. Now this snack box would\neven work for my husband because it's completely gluten-free. For our snack box number two, I'm gonna add lots of grapes. And in this little container, I'm going to add my hard boiled egg. This one's cooked a little\nbit better this time. I'm gonna add a little\nbit of salt on there. Then I'm gonna add a\nfew different containers to keep things separate. This one's gonna have some celery and then in this one I'm\nadding a light Babybel cheese. To go along with the celery, I'm also gonna add a little\nbit of natural peanut butter. In snack box number three, I'm starting with lots of cucumbers. I love cucumbers. They are so yummy and\ncrunchy and refreshing. I'm also gonna add some\nwhole wheat crackers. And then over here I have a\nlittle meat and cheese stick. I just have some Colby-Jack\ncheese and some deli ham. I rolled it up and stuck it on a pick. For our fruit, I'm just\ngonna add in a banana. And now for snack box number four, I'm gonna start by adding\na meat and pepperoni stick. This is turkey pepperoni\nwith Pepper Jack cheese. It's nice and spicy. In this corner, I'm gonna add some fruit. It's gonna be a mixture\nof strawberries and kiwis. Kiwis have so much vitamin\nC and so do strawberries. In this little container,\nI'm going to put some hummus. This is just regular garlic hummus and then I'm gonna put\nlots of things to dip in like some mini bell peppers,\nsome more cucumbers, and some little pieces of pita bread. Okay guys, I hope that\ngives you some great ideas on some DIY bistro boxes\nthat you can make yourself. These are really easy to make and none of these things\nhave to be reheated so they're perfect for on the go. Thanks for watching and\nI'll see you next time. (\"I Need Only You\" by Love Beans)", "7unYlQoGpIw": "hi guys and welcome to my youtube channel if you're new here hello my name is Caitlin and if you're not new welcome back I'm gonna take you guys along with me for the next few days I wasn't planning on picking up the camera today because I started my internship this morning but it didn't end up going as long as we thought again I want to say really quickly thank you so much to everyone who subscribed to me so far seriously every single subscription helps me so much so I really appreciate all of you it is 3 o'clock right now and I haven't eaten lunch yet so I thought this is a perfect time to pick up my camera and bring you guys along with me we're in the kitchen obviously I know that I say this about every single meal but this is also one of my favorites [Music] I like to put a lot of spinach and then we're just gonna put the mixture of pesto and shrimp on top of there and then also the bell peppers are just warmed up at the bottom just now sitting down to eat I decided to add some of these siete grain-free tortilla chips in it it makes the salad so much better let's try it that's just what I'm gonna do right now and then I'll pick the camera back up and a little bit right now it's a little past five I'm gonna change into a comfy outfit you guys always say you want to see at my treat meals or my less nutritious meal so I'm giving the people what they want I don't know if we'll have frozen pizza frozen burritos I don't know just have some nice comfort food honestly the last thing I want to do right now is cook so I'm not gonna force myself to let's see what I come up with and I will show you guys what I end up having don't judge me but I'm eating my frozen burritos in bed and yes I'm wearing jeans in bed because I'm too lazy to change I'm too hungry I just filmed it to talk of me eating this dinner so if you already saw that you're a real one for falling I know that today isn't a what I eat in a day but a lot of you guys like to see the meals and I'm eating throughout the week so today is really simple I just did roasted sweet potato broccoli half of an avocado and then some pesto this is the pesto that I used it's from Trader Joe's it's my favorite pesto it is vegan which I really like and yeah so I'm just gonna have this I wasn't too hungry for lunch today because I just ate oatmeal a little bit ago for breakfast around like 10:30 or 11:00 so I just thought I would make it a super quick lunch I'm scared that this is gonna fall because you guys know it happened Oh like a week ago this is what I'm currently using as a tripod this is the face wash that I've been using it's one of Newt Regina's new face washes out ultra gentle daily cleanser and not that into skin care so I'm not sure how good it is for your skin but it's super gentle which is why I like it at nighttime I really don't do much skincare I heard you're only supposed to wash your face once a day so I just do this at nighttime and then in the morning is what I do like moisturizer sunscreen and toner I'm just going to sit here on my computer also I have a little bit of herbal tea that I made and it's kind of cold now okay for dinner I'm gonna use this brown rice pasta from Trader Joe's and I also have this Trader Joe's marinara or this one is the Trader Joe's tomato basil sauce it's actually not my favorite one that they have but it will do this happen to anyone else when you walk away for literally two seconds I definitely have it too high but anyway like I was saying this is the baby spinach I'm gonna put into the pasta sauce to just give it a little bit more nutrients I actually just bought this from Trader Joe's and then ended up freezing it before it went bad I don't know if you can see then I ended up putting a bunch of spinach and they're just gonna let it cook don't hate me for eating pasta on a white bed I will be very careful but I'm just gonna sit here and it go on my computer for a little bit you guys know that a self-care night cannot happen without Pinterest and YouTube and Netflix so let me know what you guys binge when you're having a self-care night I was going to say it looks so good but it also tastes so good I've already obviously eaten some but I'm just gonna sit here for a little bit and do that hi guys good morning it is 7:30 right now I have my jacket on because I got hot in it I put in this coconut milk into my coffee if you followed me for a while you know that this one is my favorite as I said at the beginning of the video I started my internship so this week has just been very tiring I'm happy that it's Friday oh look I love when you guys tag me in your stories it makes my day ever since everything has happened in the world we obviously can't go on like regular dates or go hang out with our friends or something so what we have been loving is going on little drives and seeing the sunset so we tried to do that every ferny I just wanted to check in with you guys a high and better longer since I haven't been so I haven't made breakfast yet like I said it's about 7:30 I have to go log on really quick and then probably just after my first meeting or something I'll make breakfast see you guys in a little bit okay guys it's 1 o'clock right now and Hunter and I are both eating some lunch and let me set you guys up okay something that hunter and I like to do is have like a midday coffee break together so this one's Hunter's this one's mine I put the same coconut milk in mine from this morning I just wanted a hot one I don't know why and then Hunter it just as an iced one with a little bit of milk so I just wanted to show you guys that this is what were your having Hunter doesn't like these classes car windows are super dirty so it's like putting little thanks but like I said we are we are gonna go look at the sunset you think you're driving and I think we're actually going to make it tonight so that is exciting I just showed you guys me making breakfast I just did a little montage cuz I feel like I've showed this a million times and I don't want to bore you really quickly I want to mention that you guys need to get this from Amazon it's like my favorite purchase I've ever made your phone just goes on it like that and I've been using it to either film tick-tocks my workouts or just using it for FaceTime right now it's 10:45 and it's Saturday showed you guys that I did a workout that was this morning at 7 but I'm just gonna sit here and have breakfast and I'm gonna take you guys with me for the rest of the day guys is it just me or can you literally not get through the day anymore without an iced or just a coffee in the middle of the day I used to never drink two coffees a day because I felt like it made me anxious and now I'm literally addicted and I can't stop it I really want to try and watch up surprisingly I've only tried it once before from Starbucks I absolutely hated it so I definitely want to try out a good homemade one so let me know down below your favorites you get on like Amazon or something but yeah I'm just sitting here on Pinterest what's new happy Saturday back in my normal Muir spot I just got finished filming a video which I've said in like every single blog I just didn't like the health / fitness weight loss video that I already filmed and edited I just feel like I didn't get my point across enough in it and I didn't answer a lot of questions that you guys obviously have for me I talked to you guys on Instagram yesterday and asked you if you cared if I uploaded a vlog before I uploaded my health and fitness journey video and a bunch of you guys said that you did not care but I just finished and I'm happy with it so it will be the next one up case you're wondering where my outfit is from I already told you in a few videos ago but these jeans are my favorite they're from Zara and they're called the high-rise straight-leg Jean I actually said in that video that I got a size four but these are a 2 I have the 4 in the light blue and I've noticed that these are jeans do stretch as you wear them so these are size 2 and the white ones just fit me so much better so maybe size down and those if you're going to get them then my top is from brandy melville I just cut it because it wasn't short enough in my opinion which I feel about a lot of my shirts which is why I cut a lot of my crop tops but I got a few packages and so I thought I would do a little unboxing on camera ok I am I sitting on the floor first up my hair ok we have cratenbarrel you guys know hunter and I are moving to our new apartment in a few days so obviously I had to get guys I know that a lot of people have these but I'm literally obsessed with them so so I don't care definitely gonna put these in the dishwasher today and then I also got four of these ones like tumblr ones that we can do like warm lemon water or you know I don't know we just wanted those ones too then I got this one's random but I got this little bikini top from urban I'll link it down below obviously it's called they don't put the names on it okay this next one might not seem big to you but I've been waiting for this for two and a half months it was on back order and this is the exact blender that I wanted because I already had this one and I loved it but it broke at the beginning of quarantine and if you me I always am drinking smoothies and I haven't been able to show you guys any smoothie our smoothie bowls because I didn't have a blender but now we have my blender so definitely most excited about that actually now I'm I am most excited about the blender but these shoes I've also been waiting for forever these shoes have been out of stock everywhere for so long but these look really big like they didn't send me the right size guys you ordered me boy shoes you ordered me boy ones their men's sure my foot is gonna fit those can fit you on a woman I wanted them for me what do we do we have to return them in order new ones trailer Lanie wait RVs they look huge so men and women converse the same thing never mind dude they looked he's just this part of the shoot is just really big I hope I like them okay oh my god does this not look cute am I wrong or do these look huge and I even size down half a size because it told us to hunter love shoes so he ordered these for me because he knew that I really wanted them and he noticed that they came back in stock um I think that's it nothing is sponsored I just have a very bad shopping addiction if you can't tell but Crate & Barrel if you want to sponsor me Iman's down below okay now I have to clean all this up and try and get some stuff ordered for our apartment I'm a little hesitant about moving right now I don't know if anyone else can relate to us but we were supposed to move out in the middle of March but everything that happened obviously pushed back the renovation process so pretty much we have just been waiting to hear when we're able to move in now that everything's going on and the numbers are spiking it has us very hesitant about moving right now so let me know if you're going through this as well but I'm just gonna clean all this up and yeah nice oh I just ate one of these little Annie's granola bars whatever but the reason I'm putting the camera on is cuz I hit 10k on Instagram I'm so happy I already posted of course I had to already post a little swipe up link but I'm so excited I love all of you if you follow me on Instagram you're the best for dinner I just sauteed some chicken breast and then I also made this little mixture of black beans and frozen bell peppers we will probably just have this over rice for dinner [Music] okay I just ate dinner and I'm back in bed and Hunter and I are gonna watch the miracles of heaven we watched it like a week ago and guys if you want to cry that sounds weird but honestly sometimes it's fun to watch a movie that you can like actually get into and this movie is ridiculously emotional so if you're not looking for emotional movie do not watch it but it was so good I'm seriously obsessed with that obviously we have nothing else going on tonight other than that and I will try and edit this video so I can get it up tomorrow morning I hope you guys enjoyed this video I know it can be kind of boring watching someone who is in quarantine or social distancing I cannot wait to go back to normal life and to be able to see my friends and go shopping and do all the things that I normally do on a daily basis but obviously at some point my content will change and you guys will get to see that I love each of you who watched till the end of the video if you did let me know I love talking to you guys don't forget to follow me on tik-tok Instagram my food Instagram subscribe to my youtube channel and turn on my notifications you guys know that I stay on the video or an hour after every single time I post all right goodnight guys I

pound of smoked chicken so this chicken is going to be brined first uh here and then what we're going to be doing is we're going to be hot smoking it so it's going to give that nice smoky umami flavor on there and then we have the andouille sausage something that we're making here at the restaurant we're going to be roasting it first along with the chicken so that it's completely cooked so we can take that aspect and element out of the cooking part so we can just really focus on the fun part of it next we have a roux so roux is equal parts fat and equal parts flour uh in this one we're using uh blended oil and flour and you can notice the color of it because what's gonna happen is what we're gonna do is we're gonna start this oil off at a super high temperature we're going to add the flour to it and continue to stir it into that hot pan in the oil and it's going to come to this color when it gets to this color this like milk chocolate color the aroma uh the like the flavors that come out of it this is the secret weapon of gumbo it's because it has uh that i don't want to say charred but that caramelization and then also uh it's just almost like a peanut butter kind of consistency it's a very cool ingredient and then we have the roasted chicken stock this is roasted chicken stock that we're making here at the restaurant we're going to first take the bones we're going to roast them get some nice color on that and then we're going to make a stock out of it once that stock is ready what we're going to be doing is we're going to add the spices to it so everybody's going to be getting the stock with the spices in it spices being like cardamom cinnamon uh mace nutmeg dried herbs like sage and thyme bay leaf skin paprika cayenne so on very flavorful broth and that's another one of the secret weapons of this dish is that the broth itself or gumbo itself is a like a soup base consistency but the broth itself is highly seasoned and that's what makes it so much fun not only to cook but on the palate as you're eating as well so what we'll do is we're going to start with these vegetables and we're going to cook them the holy trinity we're going to start cooking that and getting some color on that kind of just melting in the pan starting with some warm oil so we'll start now so when the next step is cooking what we're going to be doing is we're going to be looking for a pot that is minimum about 4 quarts what's this going to allow us to do is that it's going to have the stew inside of there and it's going to have a side so when you're stirring it or whisking it then it's not going to be going over the side so minimum 4 quarts and kind of high size we're going to start off with about 3 tablespoons of cooking oil not extra virgin just a regular like vegetable oil anything like that it's going to be getting a tan i'm trying to get nice and warm immediately you can see uh this like a nice little smoke point that's coming up so the pan is ready to go so i'm gonna remove the pan off the heat just gently put the vegetables in there i don't want any oil to splash up in my hand or anything like that i'm just going to kind of stir it with a wooden spoon so i'm going to start the pan off at a pretty warm temperature uh but once i put the vegetables in it's been about 80 30 seconds to a minute i'm going to lower the heat now just kind of keep that temperature nice and uh able to caramelize my vegetables uh as this is kind of melting and sauteing i kind of want to talk about the tools that you're going to need for this uh you don't need a wooden spoon something that i like to use wood as i'm stirring just so it's not scraping the bottom of the pan or whatnot it's something that i'm really not looking forward to also a whisk the whisk is going to be coming when uh we're going to be adding the root to it so that as the stock is boiling we're going to be whisking that roux into it and so it can kind of just thicken the sauce also most importantly tasting spoons so i have a mug here of spoons that are clean and then i have a mug here for my spoons that are dirty and what i really recommend is as you're cooking this process that you're tasting as you're going through this it's really important because you can see the dish itself is going to be as you are adding every ingredient is going to be changing in flavor and its complexity in its levels and so it's really important to go through this this is one of my favorite parts about cooking is as i'm cooking as a tasty tasting tasting and you can see things evolve real time and it's fun because i can store that information away and now as i'm cooking this dish next time i can do something different i can adjust it's always evolving and that's the fun part about tasting every set so now you can see that the vegetables are pretty much nice and melted now what we're going to do is we're going to start adding the protein to it we're going to add the sausage the andouille sausage and then what we're going to do is we're going to add the smoked chicken breast so since it's already cooked we're going to be sauteing and caramelizing the vegetables first and then adding the protein section traditionally when i'm uh here at the restaurant what i'll do is i'll start with a raw protein the chicken in the sausage and i'll start cooking those ingredients first and what happens is that when i start with the proteins in a hot pan with oil and i cook it uh it's going to be leaving flavor into there with it and on the bottom of it nice caramelization called bond and fondant is a very important thing is because what happens is that uh yes a nice dark uh caramelization of the protein that's on the bottom of it and when i remove the protein before i add the vegetables i'm going to add a little bit of liquid and kind of scrape all that off it's really important because those are the morsels of flavor that's the foundation of the dish itself and so since we're cooking the proteins for everybody in advance uh we're starting with the vegetables first we're gonna add the uh the cooked protein second that does not mean that there's not gonna be fond on the bottom of this there still will be it's just going to be a different type of lawn uh more from the vegetables and whatnot if you can see here uh here on the bottom of the pan and that's all good stuff that's what we're looking for so we're right on track what we're going to do is we're going to stir this for a few minutes and uh let the natural oils of the protein come out and meld with the vegetables if you notice i'm on a medium heat so there's in this dish you know the color black in the pan is not a good color and in many dishes it's not um and because what happens is that uh the color black it means that it went too far and things start getting bitter and that's not what we're looking for we're looking for that couple steps right before that that dark caramelization because this dish is all about dark combination with round earthy savory colors or flavors that we're looking for so i just want to kind of give you that point as if you know you start seeing anything that's starting to turn black or whatnot it's okay to back off the heat a little bit uh right now uh time is of the essence and this is not a dish that we're gonna be rushing or anything like that um in total this dish will take up maybe about 25 to 30 minutes uh so uh it's not that i'm not that long taking it okay so at this point i'm just going to give my stock here my roasted chicken stock with the spices i'm going to give it a stir so that all the spices are evenly distributed through the liquid i'm kind of just kind of make a hole here in the middle i'm going to push all the vegetables and the protein out and so the middle of it is just going to be the bottom of the pan you can see that nice caramelization here support a little bit of the liquid okay and you can see that it's just coming off the bottom that's another reason why i'm using a wooden spoon is the wooden spoon is not going to be actually scraping against the metal it's going to just be gliding over it but it's enough to get that fond off the bottom this is really important when you're cooking with things is that you just want only the flavor and you don't want to get any of that metal kind of scraping or anything like that in there so you can see it's all nice and clear on the bottom now so at this point what i'm going to do is i'm going to add the liquid to it okay so now that the liquids in there i'm going to go from a medium heat i'm going to go pretty much to like a medium-high heat and what we're trying to do is uh we're going to be standing here and with our spoon we're going to be ready and kind of constantly stirring it until it comes up to a boil right before it comes to a boil right as it comes to a boil we're going to be ready we're going to lower the heat down to like a medium simmer and when that happens that's when we're going to be adding our roux in the meantime it's a great time to have a glass of wine but don't get too far away from the pot because this is when the uh when things can happen the worst so you want to stick around have your spoon and just continue to serve okay so about i'd say about 10 minutes have passed and right when i added the liquid i tasted it and then now what i did is i at high heat i brought it up to a boil right now i've just lowered it and so we're at like this nice pleasant simmer this is really important that it's at this temperature because once we add this room it's going to change the dynamic of this rock and so right now it's a broth it's very fluid but once we add this through it's going to thicken it up and that's when things start sticking into the bottom of the pan and that's what they start burning and that's what we're trying to really avoid so having the whisk available right here and what i'm going to do is i'm just going to kind of stir it and kind of look at it you know and see how thin it is and how thick it's not so that's really good because i want what i want to see is just like tasting in between i also want to look at it and see how far it's come after i add the roux and how you know thick it's got so kind of want to talk about seasoning as we're doing this right now right now there's a few of the ingredients that we use and our spice blend already has salt in it and i want to talk about like not putting enough salt and not using too much salt it's kind of got to be right there in the middle and that's the reason why i have the spoons here uh so that i can continuously taste it and i'm still adjusting as the dish is happening um so it's a good time now kind of tasting it we haven't had any salt yet so tasting it and seeing where the salt is at the recipe that we have here it's pretty good but once we add this amount of fat and flour it's going to really change it this will absorb a lot of the salt that's in there and so it's good to taste now before we add the roux it's good to taste it once the roux is incorporated into it and then it's good to taste it right before you think you're going to serve it and then at that point you can adjust so for me cooking you always have to be involved in what you're doing because these flavors are evolving and you have to evolve with it because if you're doing something else and you're not tasting this stuff at the end result is a big problem or it could be not a good problem at all so tasting is extremely important i cannot stress that enough okay so we're going to give it a little stir just want to look at how how it's looking right now and then we're going to be adding the root to it go ahead and add the whole container of this everything's been measured out to hurry up and kind of get it in there use the side of it and then you just want to stir it gently because you don't have to whisk it vigorously or anything like that you're just stirring it you just don't want it to get you know stuck on the bottom or anything like that don't forget to get into the sides of this as well into the that 90 degree turn of the pot from the side to the flat part it's important then you're just stirring it you can almost see immediately how uh the texture of the liquid has completely changed now it's a little bit thicker now what we're going to do is we're going to kind of keep it at that same uh heat and we're just going to let this cook for a few more minutes okay so now is a good time to be tasting the roux looking at the texture of it yeah looks good you know on the back of the spoon it's nice and coating so this is great we're on a good path here okay kind of looking at it before you're tasting it just be careful it is a little warm great all the flavors are there textures coming along yeah it's great right now the kitchen should be just like your whole house should just be uh extremely extremely uh smelling like gumbo and remind you of the new orleans area because this is just wow it's pretty crazy even in the kitchen you can smell this here at the window all right so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add a small amount of salt here kind of kick it up a little bit stir that in you can see already it's only been about a minute and the texture of the liquid itself is nice and thick okay so this is the fun part about this this dish is because the room completely changes the dynamic of it adds more flavor more complexity to it but also what it does is that it thickens it so that when you do put it into the bowl that it's not just a broth makes it a lot more rich and that's the reason why we're going to be serving it with rice the rice is really kind of a vessel is to get all the liquid and the gumbo so that you can eat it because if not it's just kind of a broth and it's kind of light the rice is just kind of a neutral flavor and it's the conveyor of uh whatever's left in that gumbo so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be serving on the scoop of rice i suggest uh putting the gumbo down first the rice in one section of it so that when you plate it or when you're eating it you can control how much rice and how much gumbo you're taking in on each spoonful that's a fun part because uh with less rice it's full flavor with more it's a little bit muted so it's a fun way to eat it and as you can tell obviously as we're going through this and also eating it there's a lot of ways to adjust and change flavors and whatnot so when this dish is done cooking it's still not over as much rice as you put on that spoon is still going to adjust the flavor that's the part that i like is just always experimenting with these flavors so once we added the room and the stock was thickening what we did is we put it on for about five to six minutes at that low heat it's really important that uh it continues to cook for about five to six minutes after that is because what you want is all those flavors to come together the flour and the broth itself come together and make that nice thick gumbo texture it's really important for that five or six minutes once that's done you've tasted it give it one last final taste just to make sure before we plate it once you've tasted it and it's where it needs to be you can move on with the next uh portion of it you're ready to plate so we have the rice here the rice you can warm up two different ways you can either microwave it you can put it into a sauce pot with a little bit of water maybe like three tablespoons and a lid and just go at the lowest temperature that you can and it should just kind of steam and just get nice and fluffy again i personally like to serve gumbo getting the chicken and the sausage for the first scoop and then the second scoop is more of the broth okay once the gum moves in there what you can do is just put your rice on the side and this is going to allow you to put on as much rice as you'd like or no rice at all a little bit of garnish and that's it i hope that everybody enjoys uh our recipe here of gumbo it's been a fun way to learn about it chris and mary are so generous to send myself out to new orleans and be able to train with some of the folks down there and uh it's definitely a true american cuisine they're doing some wonderful food down there i can't wait to go back i i always long ago taste those flavors again so everybody cheers thank you very much", "Twpj79z-EDg": "[Music] find the best glass coffee mug on Amazon we analyzed

hope Jeff museum", "ObPuaVfQhak": "[Music]", "APRu_gjkIGs": "[Music] hello friends this is BMC a this is my quick review of Boldin's travel mug I've been wanting to do a review with this for a while because it was quite surprised by this aim it is me the plastic it solves a double-walled as you can see it's a little bit grubby because I thought this now for around about 2 months or the surprising thing is because it's made a plastic when a ball - I think I paid five pounds in Tesco for this quarter and if you've seen my recent reviews you might have seen that I do use this quite often laughter when I'm out and about out of the house but as I say it's made of plastic and the surprising thing is that it doesn't sort of transfer any of that sort of plastic taste to your drink which I was expecting and I was expecting it transfer that sort of plasticky taste to my coffee which it hasn't and if I may slid with a sort of seal on it there which clips onto the top clips onto the top there sorry if your drink falls over you're not going to spill it everywhere all over the place and that's another reason I like using this cup because we've got young bin children in the house who looked not things around and a hot drink is one thing you don't want young kids to be knocking over especially if it might spill over them so this cough will hold I would say around 300 milliliters quite comfortably the other surprising thing about this cop is that it will actually keep your drink hot I would say for around about an hour so that is another good thing about it it doesn't transfer the air plastic taste and it keeps your drink warm there quite a while now I just give this a wash and as you can see a bit of the moisture doors handle within the walls of this cop I normally just give it a quick rinse out because we're being plastic and you don't want to clean it with anything too abrasive because it will actually scratch being plastic and it's got a nice and rubbery and part on the outside and makes it easy to grip and then it says Bolden the fresh way to group fresh coffee and tea on the bottom just if we I think it was made in Portugal but there we are it's probably bpa-free yes which is a good thing so as I say if anyone is looking for the good am and also the seal is honest hasta con a cop really steady really gives a really tight seal on their collar - or double rubber ring on the antique and lit there so as I say if anyone is looking for their cheap trouble and cook and this is of course cheap and cheap one that's out there as I say I paid the fiber for this in Tesco and as I say it's done me well now for around two months mother's age getting a bit grubby bought an excellent buy I would say so well recommended look out for them if you see them anywhere especially if you see them around the fire parma salt I've really like to hear from anyone who's purchased this cup and your experiences and with it let me know in the comment section below

that has just gone viral so we had to make the pizza doughnut here in the news 8 studio thank you for being here death why should it be here I can't believe this video I mean it's been viewed how many times almost a million times now almost a half a million almost half a million yeah Wow and it's been aired on all these local news stations throughout the country what do you think it is behind the pizza doughnut that has made it so popular it's cute you know it's clever it's you know it's it's nothing different they could have now that they won't be there tomorrow you're right and it's two things that people love pizza and doughnuts all right so let's get to work how do we make these all right so first we have here we got to get the dough going this is basically a focaccia dough that's been sweetened a little more than usual that's what the donor comes into play I'm just gonna cut it all though out and this is a focaccia dough not like a traditional doughnut dough no this is just to make it save it's kind of a mixture of a pizza and a doughnut dough and how do you make this right I'm not really sure it doesn't matter what good together you are last shape it into like a oval or something first okay best way to do it like that okay and then what do you do treasurer to fire a little bit one hour okay that's it Alec I think they were talking so quietly it's it's like a secret you grabbed the wrong honey okay just kind of go back and forth then we go every was wrong pin before um actually antelope is this was really heavy so don't push dad you are okay so just roll it out throw it out not too flat you sort of really evenly okay um this is focaccia dough and do you make this go the other way too now now go the other way okay yeah uh I think the most miraculous part about the success of the pizza Dona is that it's done by two guys me and my right-hand man Roy halee oh and a broken-down KitchenAid that's how these things that we don't have any proofing boxes we don't have any any technology what's up we have two copyright and get this thing going get it on shark tank so so what do we do next next we make next thing really was gonna stuff is your mixture cheese's I did watch the video but I guess I didn't pay close enough attention um just do what I do okay boys sandwich this is a blend of mutts and what else what's Parmesan Fontanella and a couple of other ones okay so I've got my little cheese thing going here yep and then what you're gonna do is you're gonna take the top part roll it back fold it over kind of crimp it all the way down with your finger like that okay if it's sticky on the flour therefore just don't put too much or it won't stick but just you know at the Olympics yes like that cool all right if you pretend like you know what you're doing absolutely and you kind of do and then what do I do I best my way up to the top of you kidding not yet now we're gonna bring this up like this just as like a fail-safe so we don't get a cheese explosion when we fry them oh cheese explosion though that could be a good thing right if a little pops out then it burns on the outside and it's delicious who doesn't love burnt cheese yeah that's true people put them on top of their salads goclove burnt cheese now well it's got a child behind all this I had a dream about pizza and doughnuts so I woke up and I made it you really just have to do something I dream about food all the time I dream about specials I'm gonna do or some specials I've done that didn't work as well and yeah all I do is cook so all I think about is food all night long which could be annoying I don't even cook and I think about food all night long he's bringing around you got it I don't know comes near the baby but how are you doing know what you're doing wrap it around the ring all right I got my ring going here I mean look perfect but okay no what do we do here we throw it in the oil don't throw it don't throw it okay gently I'm gonna kick the heat up a little okay is it hot enough no no look no how beautiful these doughnuts are pretty hot all right well we can pop a man I mean it doesn't have to be perfect I just want it to sizzle all right ready here we go kind of float him in a little bit okay it says little little there you go um now this is incredible so the cheese is gonna get all yummy and gooey in there and then I kind of see what you're doing here with the sauce and the what are we going to top this bad boy off with all right so we serve it two ways these are meat sprinkles and we're really proud of these so this is super SOT capicola general salami and pepperoni mixed with parmesan crisps and fresh basil and parsley a little bit of extra sprinkle your meat sprinkles it tastes like a pepperoni pizza mixed with like burnt cheese and with the gooey pizza doughnut is the perfect topping here for vegetarians I made something I made a little Sicilian relish so it's got olives and capers hot and sweet peppers more basil more cheese a ton of garlic it's really good all right well we got to try one of these Donuts absolutely core it is what it's all about and you know just pick it up with my fingers please do okay you

"KBBRmtaVJIA": "(children cheering) - Hi guys. Welcome to Barbie's\nmystery box challenge. (upbeat music) A Barbie Production. Today's show is starring\nJordan and Georgia. Why don't you\nintroduce yourselves? - My name is Jordan. I am seven years old\nand I have been cooking for three years. - My name is Georgia\nand I'm seven years old. And I've been cooking\nfor about five years. - As usual, because you should\nalways cook with the help of an adult, our Executive\nChef, Kim, is here too. Do you guys want\nto know a secret? - Yeah.\n- Yeah. - I love cupcakes. Today, you will be making\nextra special cupcakes in a mug. I call them mug cakes. The best part is they can\ncook right in the microwave. Do you think you can do that? - I can do that.\n- Yes, I can. - Okay, time to see what's\nin your mystery boxes. (children cheering) Okay, we have applesauce,\nlemonade and pretzels? Pretty crazy cupcake\ningredients, don't you think? - Yeah, but why would we\nuse pretzels in a cupcake? - Isn't that weird? - That's where your\ncreativity comes in. - I can probably try\nto make up a recipe with these ingredients. - I can do anything. - I can't wait to see what\nyou do with these ingredients. When I say go, you\nwill have 30 minutes to make your best cupcake\nwith these wacky ingredients. Ready? - Yes.\n- Yes. - Set. Go. Georgia and Jordan\nonly have 30 minutes to create their\ndazzling mug cakes. What will they make? I can't wait to find out. Hey Georgia, what kind of\nmug cake are you making? - I'm making a\nstrawberry mug cake with buttercream\nfrosting on top. - Strawberries are my jam. What are you whisking up? - Right now, I'm whisking\ntogether my wet ingredients. And then I'll put\nin strawberries. - How about you, Jordan? Tell me about your mug cake. - I'm making a\nconfetti mug cake. - I always say, \"Whoo-woo, it's\nlike a party in a cupcake.\" So, how are you putting\nthe fun in your mug cake? - I'm putting in the\nwhite chocolate chips. And once I get this stirred,\nI'm gonna put in the sprinkles. - The thing I love about\nmug cakes is you don't have to bake a whole cake if you\njust want a little treat. They bake much faster too. So, Georgia, what's your\nplan for the pretzels? - It was hard to get a\nplace to fit the pretzels in the recipe, so I ... put it with the dry ingredients\nand I crunch them up. - Here comes Jordan\nwith his mug cakes. He's ready to pop\nthem in the microwave. You know, baking is\na lot like science. And here's my friend Nikki\nto tell us all about it. - Thanks Barbie. Let's get into the\nscience of cooking. Inside the microwave,\nis a little transmitter, which makes waves. The microwaves. The waves love water and\nmake the water wiggle. The water wiggles so much\nthat it gets really hot. So hot, it actually\ncooks the food. - [Barbie] And those\nare some powerful ways because these cakes only\ntake about a minute to cook. Remember to use\nmicrowave safe cookware and never use tinfoil or\nanything metal in the microwave. Our wiggle waves hate metal. And if you're not sure\nif something is safe, always ask an adult. - Okay, let's get your\ncupcake out, okay? - [Barbie] Once they\nare done, Chef Kim helps Jordan and Georgia with the\nhot mugs and places them in the freezer while they\nwork on the frosting. Jordan is starting on his. So, what are you mixing\ntogether, Jordan? - I put the butter in. Now I'm putting\nthe powdered sugar. - Oh, so this is where\nyou're using the lemonade? - Yes. - Georgia, looks like you're\nusing a lot of butter. - I put it in the frosting to\nmake it a little more thick. - Georgia is using a hand mixer to do a technique\ncalled whipping. Whipping is what\nmakes icing fluffy. The way this works is by\nputting a bunch of teeny, tiny air bubbles in the butter,\nlike a fluffy pink cloud. - And remember, always\nhave a grown up to help you when using an\nelectric appliance. Jordan, Georgia, you\nhave five minutes left. Time to decorate\nthose mug cakes. I can't wait to\nsee what they do. Those colors look so beautiful. 60 seconds left. Come on, you can do it. 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 Stop, times up.\n(buzzer dings) Hands in the air. Great job.\n(children cheering) And now, it's tasting time. Jordan, what did you\ncall your creation? - My cupcake is called \"The\nDelicious Confetti Mug Cake.\" - Delicious is right. Time for you to try it. - It's really good. - Get a good bite there, Jordan. Is it scrumptious? Now, it's Georgia's turn. What did you call your mug cake? - \"Sugar Shaboom.\" - Georgia, you put\nthe boom in shaboom. Now, you try it. - It's a lot of pink.\n- Mm-hmm. - Looks what someone knew\nwhat my favorite color was. Come on, Georgia, get in there. - Mm.\n(nods in approval) - Both of your\ncupcakes were amazing. Jordan, your cake\nwas like a party. A party in a mug. That's why I'm awarding you\nwith the most creative award. - Thank you, Barbie. - Georgia, your cupcake made\nmy taste buds dance for joy. That's why I'm awarding\nyou with best taste. - Thank you. - Great job, you two. Now, I want to hear from you. What would you make with\ntoday's ingredients? Today we learned, if you\ncould make a cake in a mug, you can make any day\na little sweeter. So remember, you\ncan be anything. - Thank you, Barbie.\n- Thank you, Barbie. - Goodbye.

and today I'm going to introduce you to a new product we are very excited about this is the Bistro be over coffee machine and although it's automatic it's anything but your standard drip coffeemaker instead of a trip through mechanism think of an automated pour over bro method the way this is achieved is by this showerhead water dispenser a standard drip machine filter only drips straight down over extracting coffee grinds in its path and leaving others untouched the showerhead dispenser rains down evenly extracting coffee much the same as a 4-over method which leaves you with a well-balanced flavorful cup of coffee the taste is as good as coffee you would get from French press other unique features about this machine include its glass tubing which is different than other drip machines with plastic tubing that can transfer that plastic taste to your coffee water is heated in a copper boiler at the bottom and is transported by these four silicate glass tubes throughout machine for silicate glass will not interfere or affect the flavor of your coffee beans now it also keeps the temperature of the water between 197 and 204 degrees this is very important as this is the optimum brew temperature for coffee this finally mesh gold filter is dishwasher safe and create less waste because you don't have a paper filter this means that the oils will not get absorbed by a paper filter before it reaches your cup just pure flavor d / will brew you a full pot of coffee in about six minutes first you start with the removable water tank and fill it to the indicated line right over the sink or the water filter once you have your water you can put your freshly ground coffee grinds into the filter I personally prefer to put seven and a half bottom scoops I think this creates the best flavor to match my French press coffee taste if you prefer stronger coffee add another scoop if you prefer week a coffee add a little less one screwed the coffee is held in a 40 ounce double wall stainless steel carafe with plastic exterior that keeps the coffee drinking temperature for up to three hours no heating element is needed and therefore the coffee is good to the last drop no burnt coffee taste towards the bottom of the graph it's also great because after brewing the coffee just bring the craft over and it can sit right at the table with you and your guests you don't have to go back and forth to the kitchen for coffee refill this well-designed coffee made is made of rubber coated plastic that is available on a variety of colors to fit right into your kitchen once you try the coffee this machine creates you'll never go back to your standard drip coffeemaker", "7b1gk8bHjhg": "hello everyone welcome back to five best pro in this video we are going to check out

follow us on instagram you'll probably know that we've just been on a short stay occasion i forgot to take my espresso machine uh big mistake i thought it'd be crazy to take that but actually looking back i'm gonna take me to send a mini next time if i've still got it um anyway i thought we'd come back today and look at just do a simple unboxing and review of these uh boredom double wall glasses now i've been asked over the course of running this channel i've been asked about five or six times i think to do these um a review of these because people just want to see them in real life don't they i've never even sort of heard of double wall glasses until doing these videos so what i do what i thought i'd do is just unbox them give you a look at them give you a look at three different sizes we've got the 25 uh center that what centiliter is it and so 250 milliliter ones uh the 350 milliliter ones which is similar to like a recipe glass size from the espresso i'll put them side by side as well and we've got the 45 centiliter ones which is you know bigger looking more like a travel mug size but you know a bigger size and i can do an espresso specific review in future if you want that you know putting them in the machines and things to make sure they fit but i'll try and give you some info as we go but this is just for everyone really whatever you want whether you want them for coffee whether you're wanting them for anything uh soup even it says you can use it but let's have a get one open let's start we'll get one open though without breaking the box they're available in a lot of different places by the way i've got these on amazon i'll leave a link in the description just to show you where they are in amazon i wasn't expected to be bubble wrapped i don't know what i wasn't what i was expecting this is the 25 centiliter size so that's your first look at them let's just run through a few details about them so they're made of something called borosilicate glass and which is more resistant to like thermal shock which is why they're so good for uh hot drinks and cold drinks even ice cream you could put ice cream in them serve that the double walled which means they've got like two layers of glass they're really light surprised how light they are compared to the nespresso ones but they're double walled so they've got two layers of glass and in between those two layers there's um air like a vacuum of air and basically what that does is access insulation so it's supposed to um keep hot coffee hotter for longer and cold and without burning your hands as well the heat doesn't come through the same way so because the heat doesn't escape it stays in the glass stays hotter for longer apparently and then on the bottom here there's like a little seal silicone thing and the pressure gets released out of there just to ensure that inside the glass the pressure stays correct so it doesn't blow the thing up i'm guessing um so that's the 25 centiliter size is there any yeah i'll give you the um dimensions of those as well so they're 9.2 centimeters high and then the 8.9 deep and wide so like circle 8.9 uh so let's get the other ones out this is the 35 you see it there 35 liter it's 0.35 liters isn't it get inside that's where you need nails isn't it sadly i don't have many nails just growing for these videos all right so let's get these ones on i just thought it'd be interesting to get a few different sizes and for you to see the actual size difference like i said if you need me to i can put them in the machines one day i've got the satis there so i'll put it in that just to show you because i remember my mum when she was buying some glasses i've said this on a video in the past she was trying to death really by him because she didn't know whether they'd fit a machine there wasn't a lot of information on sizing boredom are quite good for that they've given quite a lot of information as to the actual height of them and these are the um where is it what does it say there 0.45 liter size so 445 centiliters i think that is just get those opened up we can see they're massive aren't they they really are tall i did test these these are more like a sort of uh if you're interested in an espresso thing more like a a recipe glass size these ones and let's put that side by side now actually i can do this with other ones if you want but they're slightly smaller and off the top of my head what that tells me is the 0.35 liter size will fit under a sensor mini because that does so pretty much as small as an espresso machine it's going to fit that but these are really tall look so let's look at the dimensions of those so we said this was 6.2 centimeters high um and that's actually three millimeter oh sorry no not 6.2 the espresso size which i don't have and they are 6.2 centimeters high and they're a 0.08 liter and they're actually just a couple of centimeters and a couple of millimeters smaller than the view espresso cups i was intending to do this in one video but it's just sort of coming out this way and so the next one we said that this one the 0.2 that is 9.2 centimeters high and 8.9 wide this one is 11.6 centimeters high and 8.8 wide and then this big one over here the 0.45 liter that's 14.8 centimeters high and 8.8 wide again and so we've explained the double wall we've explained the silicone valve the dishwasher safe the microwave safe and the oven safe up to 176 degrees celsius or 350 fahrenheit i think that's what it said so what do you think of them do you like them um i'll tell you what we'll do we'll pause the video and i'll pour some coffee into one of them i'll decide which in a second but we'll just pause the video for a second though right so what i've actually thought it'd be nice to do is just make a latte macchiato because they're the ones they're the drinks that really show off and the glasses and what you know what it looks like and so i just thought i'd show you the biggest one the 0.45 that does fit in nicely into the cities but it probably that'll give you an idea of whether it'll fit the other machines probably not to be honest with you and a lot of them but we'll make it with this is a similar size to a recipe glass so oh that's what i wanted to point out it says on them that the what does it say again go on remind me mouth blown that's it yeah you just about see it there mouth blown so my wife said that was a good point a good thing to point out doesn't really bother me but your wife said that uh but yeah we'll make a latte macchiato it's just i've set the aocino off already extra froth setting just so you can see what their coffee looks like one thing i will another thing i'll say my wife when she she picked the glasses up then she was shot like i was shocked like i was as to how light they were the really really highlight glasses so let's pour this out well so frothy that is the extra frost setting from the air gino before got a review of this on the channel in case you're interested in that we'll just pop this back on like i said this is a similar size the 0.35 one if not exactly the same size two the recipe glasses with an espresso on there i'm trying to get that into some better light for you know you can see that so they are quite cool looking aren't they quite like that something different they're not i'll be honest with you personally then i i i don't know i'd have to try them next to the vue glasses maybe i should make a few coffees one time if you'd be interested to see that with them side by side with the view glasses and but if there's anything else you want to know anything that i've missed and the questions you have leave them in the comments we'll get back to you if i can answer them i will uh but they are quite smart looking thing can't stop looking at them um but they're a bit too rounded for my personal taste like i think but it's everyone's everyone's different aren't they um but maybe i'll get used to them over time they might be a grower yeah i just thought i'd cut in again here because i finished the video but we picked the glasses up again and with the drinking even they are so so light honestly you won't believe how light they are when you if you get these when you pick them up considering now they i mean they look airy and bubbly but that is just so light so i can't emphasize that enough i just thought it was worth saying it again more firmly right so i was just sat there then thinking you know if i watched a review about these glasses and they've double walled and they were to keep the coffee hot i'd want to know do they keep the coffee hot longer than standard say these are the nespresso glasses so we'll see i'm just going to pour some i boil the kettle i'm going to pour some boiling water in i'll take a temperature measurement now we'll come back in 10 minutes do it again 10 minutes do it again up until half an hour so we'll do three measurements and then we can see how it keeps the water hot or how hot it keeps the water in that time so these are similar size cuts so i'll fill them up to a similar level it's going to be perfect but a similar level i think that looks about right and we'll just take the temperature and see what it is so this one's starting out at 93.2 and this one's at 86.7 now i'm not sure that's whether that's because i poured it into that one second or whether it's already doing its work you know this double walled um glasses these double the boredom ones but we'll come back in 10 minutes and we'll see how they've fared right so it's been 10 minutes so we'll just see what temperature they're at now so the boredom glasses are at 70 roughly 70.1 and then espresso we're at 64.6 so there is a difference we'll come back in 10 minutes time checking one more time so we're now about 20 minutes in roughly and from when we first started so let's just test this one this is the boredom one again so 58.6 and then we'll go for the nespresso one 54.6 so i hope that's giving you a bit of an idea as to whether you know if you're buying these to replace nespresso ones or if you're buying them to replace some of your other cups whether that's going to be enough of a difference there to convince you and or if you you know if you prefer one of another design but they're not double walled or you know hopefully it's giving you some kind of idea as to the temperature and how it keeps hold of the temperature yeah and just to say though i did just have a taste of them um and it does make a difference it's only four degrees but i've got to be honest it really does make a difference to the the heat of the coffee in your mouth um so in that sense it if you're wanting a coffee to last a long time then it could could be worth buying and a note on design they do they are really light as we mentioned um however my wife did say uh and i i thought the same thing really that they they do have that slight test like test tubey feel about them they don't feel like glass in that sense um but they are you know it's all personal taste isn't it but i hope you're glad well we'll be glad to have us about you might not be hopefully you are uh we've got plenty of videos planned i'll tell you what i'll do just before we go i'll just show you what i've got coming on it's just a ride today i've been asked for this a lot as well and i thought i'd best get it there's a review of that coming so stay tuned subscribe to the channel if you want to see that check out our other videos check out our view recipe glasses reviews and the view collection cook reviews let us know if you've got any ideas for videos you want me to do with these before you know we decide what we whether i sell them on or not but thanks for watching and bye for now [Applause] you", "fSD-4ew0oqU": "okay welcome back to the keto Bistro I have my keto helper in the kitchen with me today and we're gonna make chocolate mud cake okay so we're gonna start with our dry ingredients we're going to start with two tablespoons coconut flour and just pour it right into the mug then using two tablespoons of the unsweetened cocoa powder then we're gonna use 1/2 a tablespoon of baking powder a pinch of salt okay and now our last dry ingredient is the monk fruit sweetener so I'm just using the classic white two tablespoons of that she's gonna stir that up she's just gonna mix it in there real well get everything incorporated before we add our wet ingredients now that the dry ingredients are mixed well we're going to take one egg we're going to crack it and put it in a separate Bowl or mug perfect let's check in there she does a great job no shells she does perfect job and then our other helper is going to finish with our wet ingredients so we're going to take two tablespoons of coconut oil perfect two tablespoons of almond milk and our last wet ingredient is our vanilla extract so a half a teaspoon of vanilla extract so all of our wet ingredients are going to be mixed up so she's just gonna use a fork and mix them up real well before we add them to our dry ingredients get them all mixed in good so everything's incorporated so now she's going to spray one of our little baking dishes all over the sides and the bottom to make sure it doesn't stick and we're going to do two little mug cakes out of this so now that the dishes are ready we're going to take the wet ingredients and we're going to pour them into our other mug and you can cook straight from this mug if you would like to make your cake we're going to separate it and make two servings so now she's going to mix this up until it's like dewy gooey chocolate battery on make sure there's no dry ingredients around the edge and on the bottom so she's going to take our mixed mixture and pour it into our two cups so she's gonna happen one that happened the other day so those little cakes are going in the microwave and how long are you gonna bake them in the microwave 50 seconds 50 seconds gonna come out nice and fluffy up like that and now we're in for the taste test all right you did a great job", "ytnEcE03kxE": "IN THIS MORNING'S (JL) IN THIS MORNING'S QUICK

I've been with\nthe mug, actually my husband and I opened the mug September of 2014. My husband\nyou know created all the recipes from scratch. We sourced local produce. A lot\nof different farmers that we use and then our proteins all come from Tyner Pond\nFarms. You know, our farm business Tyner Pond Farm is essentially, we are online\nsellers of meat so we wind up with a lot of surplus of ground products. So it\nseemed natural that we should expand by getting into the restaurant business. As\nfar as POS systems I've gone through three and and I wasn't going to settle. \nThey were missing things you know an online ordering, loyalty programs, you\nknow rewards, gift cards. I found toast and finally it was a POS someone had really thought through this system and put everything we could have wanted it into one POS\nwhich is why it was a no-brainer to switch to Toast. I was impressed. I was\nreally impressed you know. The installation process was fairly\neasy. I had people sitting with me during my go-live process. So any uneasiness\nI felt was put to bed because I had you know a tech with me and it's easy to\nnavigate through so I didn't have any trouble learning and my staff really did\ngreat with it. So it's an easy system to use. I have three servers at all times\nand two of them operate off the handheld system. The handheld system has provided\nus the ability to give a type of service right at our customers cars really\nbringing modern ages to the old fashioned drive-in field. Customers love\nhow convenient it is. A server isn't taking their credit card away from their\ntable. They're able to process that right then and there and they don't even\nhave to leave their cars. This gives you the mobility to walk around take an\norder and better serve our customers you know in the line if there's a line\ncoming out the door I can send out one of my servers to the to someone on the\nline and take their order and it just efficiency. It helps immensely with efficiency. Our turn time is definitely improved because we're able\nto get to our customer. We're able to take that order which makes us more\nefficient and we probably shave down ticket times at least 20 minutes from\nwhat they were previous summer. So we're really happy about that. The back end\nreally the reports what I can pull up so a custom of the data I can collect you\nknow I can literally look up you know what my customer is eating and how many\ntimes are coming if how they tip I mean it's literally just a huge the content I\nget is amazing so the backend you know it's super\nhelpful. The data that really matters to me you know and we really really focus\non on what's selling what are the busy times what what happens when there's a\nforecast of rain. You know knowing what happens when and why helps us become\nbetter marketers. And having the data coming out of Toast, you know it's not\njust a POS system to manage our cash it's also system to manage our marketing.\nOnline ordering has taken our service level up several notches. We no longer have\nto stop and take phone calls during our busy times. We now have a voice mail\nmessage redirecting customers to our website where they are able to place\ntheir orders whereas before they would have to call into the restaurant and sit\non hold until our in-house customers were taken care and a server was able\nto take their order. Now that we haven't integrated online ordering system all we\nhave to do is approve the order. You can be sitting on your in your cell phone\nyou know you can get on your your desktop send over this order drive over\nand your food's waiting on you. So it takes that wait time out with everybody's\nbeing you know busy it just they love that whole concept. I would say at least\n40% of our ordering potentially could be online. It's getting more and more\npopular as we are letting our customers know they can do it. And it's the word\nspreading that they're able to do that. So they're starting to use it more. Having the ability to just approve those the efficiency level has gone up. Our servers\nhave more free time and our customers are able to come in 15 minutes after\nthey place their order the system does everything for us.\nIt's literally hands-free. We don't have to do anything. The way that Toast\noperates... The fact that I can be anywhere and I can pull up the reports on my\nphone ...On my day off I don't have to worry about The Mug I can see where my\nlabor stands and I don't have to leave my seat. It has provided a sense of\ncomfort. I don't have to worry it's very nice.", "f60BfDlbrko": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] hello and welcome to today's video so today we're going to be having a look through my collection of vintage penguin mugs now although they're vintage penguin mugs they're vintage style they're not actually that old it's about um sort of 10 to 15 years since these were actually first released and it does appear as if they're no longer available so it's uh in the realms of the second hand shops now although you might get lucky as i did on a couple of occasions and actually find a little batch of these quite cheap um certainly some of these i got for like three four pounds um in bowl sort of they're five or six different ones so i do count myself lucky however i have had a cursory look on um ebay and most of them do seem to be available but they do vary quite a bit in price but the average sort of price on these is about a pound of pop now as i said these are about 15 years old now and were released around the time of penguin's 70th anniversary in 2005 and the company that released them was called arts meets art meets matters dot com a tony davis arts meets matter design there we are um so i'll just show you what i've got i think the selection of them is actually really really nice uh and when you get a few together they start to really uh really look great and um they're certainly good i mean i i've got a bit too many to put into my collection now but um back in the day when i first started collecting them i would use i would have those and then i'd have the original penguin books either side and these would be almost like book book uh bookends and they look absolutely fantastic so uh well here we are having a look at this this is one of the plays uh penguin plays man and superman but they've got the main series number 563 and then uh obviously there's quite a few crime ones so uh and i guess they try and appeal to uh this is a 05 to collectors who um might be fans of the genre so say if someone's into sherlock holmes or that would be the perfect one for them not so sure about something like bernard shaw for example not sure what the reasoning was behind that i mean the jane eyre here certainly they are mega um you know she's very very very popular even today so uh i can understand why uh that would be the case now on the bottom of this one you know 2005 is penguin's 70th birthday and they do make quite a big big thing of that don't they um there's uh jane eyre now i've got these all out of uh the collection room and uh boy oh boy did they need a bit of a clean um here's a travel one here it's a travel adventure traveler from tokyo john morris nice to get the little series number down there five three zero we've got the big sleep raymond chandler and a great great title that one 6 52. and we've got a pelican which is nice to see virginia woolf the common reader that was a 36 pelican a36 now as we go along i'm gonna i will do a pull out later on and we'll see the whole lot there together let's pull a few more out of my box of them here so absolute classic emily bronte's uh weathering heights great great uh great novel first yellow one here hd baits his country life and that was yeah number 401 so that came out in the uh about 1943 that one thankfully not one of the mega mega rare ones another one of my favorites the invisible man number 151 yeah very much uh enjoy the invisible man quite a thin book that one actually if you've never read it you can sort of do it in one sitting but uh yeah it does come out just recommended now these are quite interesting i've got three of these and these are actually penguin modern classics so uh these were made by the same company and i believe yellow 2005 so around the same time but i believe these are much much harder to find and i don't believe they carried on being made that far into uh you know after their initial release um but the knights all the same so this is a clockwork orange and it's got some text on the back there about the book very very nice these certainly not ones that you see very often it's another classic so of mice and men let's turn back some mice and men and seeing a little bit about the actual story and the last one of these that i've got is uh jean reece's wild wide sargasso sea all dated 2005. cool stuff there i still got a few more to go so we got another fiction one here which is nancy mitford the pursuit of love now different design on the bottom again there and look this one's actually copyright 2002 so maybe this was the very first one then i don't know we all the ones that we've had a look at so far dated 2005. but that was actually 2002 it's even got a different logo there a equals m so maybe that's one of like the first releases possibly it would certainly seem that way wouldn't it um essays and bells letters um virginia wool a room of one zone penguin 481 another very very nice one to have then another travel one this one so it's a sticker on here on the bottom for when it was to be scanned norman douglas together number 502 i've got a couple more here still absolute classic this one isn't in 1984 i mean what a great great uh what a great book that one is isn't it certainly very enjoyable and the last one i've got is uh lady chateley's lover and this one did have that on the front when it was first published 1484 was the penguin series number again 2005. so i mean absolutely fantastic fantastic mugs they really really are so there they all are together um i have to say there was always a few of these that i wanted them to produce back in the day when these were released that they never actually got around to doing one was obviously animal farm but my big big want and i even um mentioned it to some people who worked at penguin and they said they would pass the suggestion on to hearts means marriage but nothing ever happened that was day of the triffids which um amazed they never did a mug for dare the trophies i thought that would definitely have um have wide appeal if they could have done it a bit like the lady chatley with the uh the john wyndham designed driffit on the side i think that would have been really really nice so um i think that was a bit of an opportunity uh that was missed um how about yourself i mean do you collect these are they uh part of your penguin book collection and if so which ones are your favorites also i would love to have a little list of which ones you would like to see put into mug form because you never know maybe this is an idea that might get revived and that we may be able to get some uh some other titles released certainly for me yeah daily trip is my my number one want so there you go i thought that was a be a little bit of fun and have a look at me uh my penguin mugs um i will do these odd penguin memorabilia videos as and when i get the time and i do hope you enjoy them if you have enjoyed today's video do please give it a thumbs up do please consider subscribing to the channel as you know there's lots and lots of vintage penguin book related content already on the channel there's a whole playlist of it and there's certainly lots more to come and i shall look forward to seeing you again very soon bye [Music] [Music] mm-hmm", "rylkkrPMUO0": "yes welcome to the monster of you damage how these artisan bistro this is the grilled steak beef steak burrito the artisan B store makes burritos that I've seen it is contains no non GMO ingredients be raised without antibiotics no artificial colors or flavors 16 grams of protein this theater one is that like I said the grilled beef steak is made with organic cheese tortilla and vegetable we've bought these at Kroger there were 250 apiece for burrito I don't think that's - I mean this one is to 330 hours it's hard to read into this camera do around 30 calories for the whole burrito and there's your anyway you can't do it if you want we don't do that with you microwaves so we're going to the settings on high we're gonna remove the burrito from the package place the Brio I'm a micro safe plate with flat facing up and then we're gonna microwave it for 1 minute and flip the burrito over and microwave for an additional 55 seconds and let it sit for a minute before you actually quite setup for a minute flip it over and then do that down for 55 seconds I'll be back when it comes out all right here it is kind of cool quite cut it small pieces when I'm actually trying it but there's the steak looks like that so yeah if this is sit for a few minutes it's still fairly soft right now which is good didn't get hard on the units which is most these microwave burritos that are frozen and get really really like tough and I mean not like a cracker almost almost at the ends to wear card to counter to eat them this one did not at least not yet so it's just cool off a bit and he'll be back yeah have some time to cool off this about I'm going to take really can't see it but peppers and steak and looks like rice beans yeah does have rice a little warm the flavor is good it's got a little spice to it you know like good Mexican meal should have a little spice to it the steak is good and tinder know what's good in its off the tortilla itself it's pretty good I'm gonna trap another syndrome and then I'll get an npc I'll see if it's any tougher a little harder to cut there's a good view of the inside doesn't kind of fell apart but there's some that steak yeah it's big yeah it's um it's very very tender I hacked the flavors it's your typical burrito flavor I mean it's nothing different than what you get it any other frozen burrito really just it does have some healthier options some organic options and in there there's not a lot chief that I see it says it's made with cheese but I don't see a lot of cheese if there's cheese it's not a ton of and it's probably mixed in with rice but it's not cheese is not the main ingredient it's really more rice corn and a little bit of that steak in it we tried in peace look too bad the excuse me well sort of all the the in pieces usually get hard I mean when you microwave a burrito using the in pieces get like crunchy hard these aren't like that they're a little tougher but they're not hard they're actually edible you can actually eat these I like this I mean I like the octave flavors I like the textures the rice is a little soft but it's okay it's I wouldn't want to crunchy so a little soft but without it that way 2:54 organic ingredients and that no GMO no antibiotics no artificial colors and 16 grams of protein it's pretty good I mean is it the best burrito ever no but it's as good as any other frozen burrito out there trust me so if you're looking for this type of thing where it's got the organic and so this would be a good alternative for you I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it a 4 just to be fair it is a good burrito it's not like said top of the law it's like you went out to eat burrito but it is a good breed out the stuff the fillings are pretty good mostly in the middle the ends are they're not too bad they're a little short but they're not bad so yeah I'm gonna go to form definitely we're trying out if you're looking for these type of things the organic and stuff but if you're looking for just a frozen burrito or just to eat and you don't care about any of that stuff Amy the frozen burritos would be just as good as this is about the same so that helped me enjoy this video and thanks for watching [Music]", "nJhhPd2ke-Q": "are you looking for a gift that will

the French press setting once we've got our coffee and you want to make sure your coffee is properly ground which ours is we're gonna add in this case three tablespoons of coffee and if you're wondering you're looking at seven grams of coffee for every four ounces of water that you're gonna be putting in your French press so that makes it pretty easy to calculate again how much coffee you're gonna need in order to get the proper cup of coffee so a little bit of coffee math for you there after you've done your coffee math or at least just measured properly you're going to go ahead and take your I'm using a goose neck kettle right now and we talked about this one before here on French press coffee calm either way you want to get your water to the proper temperature I've got mine at 200 degrees Fahrenheit and we'll go ahead and pour we're gonna bloom first I'm not gonna fill this up all the way we're just gonna let our grounds bloom a little bit and of course we've got the exclusive French press coffee calm stirring paddle that you can make use of and this comes with every single order at French press coffee calm again we're blooming our grounds so I'm just going to give them a little bit of a stir and again that bloom just lets us get a nice initial kind of beginning to our coffee first so after 30 seconds we're gonna go ahead and just finish pouring our water you don't need to go too slow but you can take your time here to get this right I remember you got to give yourself a little bit of room because you're gonna be pushing your plunger down so make sure to give yourself a little bit of room we'll give this a little stir and then don't forget the magic number you want four minutes total brew time so we had 30 seconds of blooms so we're looking at about three and a half minutes maybe a little less because I was pouring there it doesn't have to be you know super accurate but make sure that you get that time in there so you can get the right cup of coffee and as you're brewing after you've given that kind of final initial stir I like to take my lid and my plunger and just kind of set it resting right ever-so-slightly on top of the grounds that I'm not going to press it down yet I'm going to let it sit there and I'm going to brew for a total time of about four minutes and after we've allowed our brew to happen we're just going to go ahead and press our plunger down so this will finish the brew process and now I would have my hopefully perfect cup of coffee now it sometimes takes a little bit of practice to perfect this even if you're using all the math that I talked about here you've still got different factors that come into play the type of coffee grounds and the type of coffee that you're using and again the temperature of your water etc but spend a little time playing with it because that's how you're gonna get your perfect cup of coffee but once you're done that's your cup of French press coffee this is the classic French press again if you say the words French press someone's gonna see this in their heads probably nine times out of ten so did you like that video so go ahead and give us a like and for more

you guys are doing well today i'm going to do this review on the bottom pour over forever mug i bought this because it's like it's a smaller size i don't want something huge and the price was really good it was only ten dollars because it was on sale and instead of you know using the keurig i wanted to try the pour over so that's why i bought it and bottom is a pretty good brand for coffee drinkers and i got this on amazon if you look here's a 12 ounce okay so i'm just going to go over my experience with this pour over a cup anyways here's the box it's pretty small about the size of my hand i mean it's a little bit smaller and then on this box it's black it's pretty firm this looks like french and then oh that's the french instructions over here uh all right are hearing instructions in english all you gotta do is use medium ground coffee and then pour hot water in and then i'll just come into the cup alright i already already took the items outside now here's what you get if you open this box here's the bags that came in you don't really get any instructions or paperwork all you get are the items which i don't mind because everything's really really straightforward with this product anyways like these are the three items you get [Music] here's the filter this way here's the filter you see the mesh right here it's middle mesh the plastic it's black colored and then here's the the other part the filter this is where you put the filter over also plastic it's clear has the bottom logo and you see this hole right here this is where the coffee drips out right here it's recyclable so that's that's nice if you ever wanted to get rid of it you can recycle this anyways here's the here's the mug it's uh it's pretty thick it's i believe it's double double walled to keep in the heat you got the logo again made in portugal and uh yeah so it's double walled to keep the temperature in anyway so here that oh here's um if you see here like there's some uh protrusions right here so you can put it right over the cup and that it won't move too much it'll just move a little bit but it fits this cup perfectly i imagine you could use your own cup and then if it's wide enough and to put this over a regular cup the benefit of having this cup is that it's see-through so you can see as the coffee is filling up you can see how much space you have remaining and all right so uh so yeah so this is what comes in the box and the instructions are pretty straightforward all right so i'm gonna go over i'm gonna do an example of using this um bottom pour over all right guys i have my uh pour over set up here i got the paper filter the box doesn't say that you need to put it in the filter but i think it's uh it's good to put a paper filter anyways and it makes the cleanup a lot easier i'm using a pike place roast the grounds and i poured some in already i'm gonna pour in a little bit more because i like i like my coffee i really or stronger i like it stronger i need that caffeine i'm gonna press it down a little bit all right and let me just get my electric kettle okey-doke so this is uh boiling now and let me just get this so i'm gonna pour it in all right so the coffee is coming down you see the drips right there so it's coming out right now so i saw online you're supposed to like pour a little bit of the boiling water let it sit for a few a few seconds and then now you can pour again in a circular circular motion just going to pour a little bit and now you uh you can hear that the coffee is really flowing through you see you see that in the bottom it's coming out right there so that's the benefit of this double wall though the see-through cup it's plastic you can see the coffee coming out let me just try to lower lower my tripod so you get a better view of that all right now we'll pour some more in a circular motion yeah i also saw on youtube there's actually like competitions about pour over brewing and which is surprising to me like well i really didn't know you can have that but yeah there's like champions of pour over coffee so that's that's i yeah i guess that's pretty cool i'm i'm no professional myself i'm just starting off actually i i have a keurig coffee machine maker but i wanted to try this all right and from so i've used this already like two or three times i have to say i do like this the quality better than a keurig yeah it just the the flavor is just more vibrant it's stronger and i feel like the flavor is extracted better from the grinds versus a keurig all right you see the coffee is already up to here and just pour some more in a circular motion so the downside to having this poor verse that this takes a little bit more time and a manual effort whereas the keurig you know you could just pop in a k a um k-pod and then it'll brew right away really fast so that that's the difference between these two like this will take more time but you do get in my opinion you get more flavor and the quality is definitely definitely better in my opinion all right so this is pretty much at max almost at max and so that's basically the process for uh brewing this with the pour over this ten dollar contraption all right guys so here is the end result you can see like it's a really nice dark coloring all right yeah that was that was pretty good it was really rich really dark really strong just the way i like it all right so that's that those are the results using this pour over i've used this a handful of times already and i do have to say in conclusion i do prefer this like flavor wise much more vibrant than you know using a machine the only downside is like you you spend more time you gotta clean up you know like it's more manual labor but if you got the time and you love your coffee this is the way to go it's only ten dollars you get high quality stuff and uh definitely uh the taste is there and you know what sometimes that's the most important thing to a lot of people like if the quality and flavor is there like they're willing to spend the extra time and effort to make this coffee anyways this is my review of the bottom pour over mug i hope you like this review i hope it was informative

from Ireland I'd like to cooking since I was a kid in fact I love this and I study TV and film in college and I still work in TV now so I've kind of wanted to do with a crossover tuna things add up and I feel like this channel is a good way to do that so here we are we're gonna make chicken parm today which is unreal and it's not a big thing in Ireland I don't know if it's a thing at all in our lives but it's absolutely delicious and it's not too difficult you can do a lot of things from scratch but you can do what other kind of store-bought things there's not as easy the chicken property yourself you're gonna have a very nice dinner so let's do it I'm making pasta sauce from scratch for this which you don't have to do this could easily be made with some store-bought sauce or sauce from a can or whatever it is but I just did it this way because I wanted to go super homemade for everything so basically you want to get like an onion and chop it off nice and fine and then get some cloves of garlic and chop those up to you and then put some oil in a pot and fry those up and simmer for a while until they are nice and translucent and starting to brown and then what you want to do is open a tin of chopped tomatoes obviously my kind of winter is terrible and it took me ages to open it there so make sure you have a good kind of break wait till your onions are nice and browned and then let them simmer with the tins of tomato in there and then I went to make pasta dough and I used an infrared recipe and messed it up so make sure you know exactly what you do in terms of recipes is in like I used the wrong type of flour for the recipe I was using so that was silly but it's good to make mistakes because it's anyway you learn so while I was making bapto I let the sauce simmer away and then once that was done I blended it and with a hand blender which is super handy but it was still pretty thick probably for a superb gargantuan the onion I used was so I had some chicken stock left in the fridge so I stopped that in there - Tina database and that made us a lot nicer and so I moved on and got in a bad mood and used all-purpose flour in another recipe and I worked there totally fine so make that mix it up putting the furniture like the rest and then I roll the dice and I guess I could show in another video how to make homemade pasta but this is just a general what happened when aiwei's yes and but if you have a pasta maker or you can do passed at home I would recommend it because it's great it really does make a difference I used some chicken breasts they aren't chicken breasts exactly I've got chicken cutlets and they have some fat in them but you can just cut off the bits of fat if they're in the way or straggling away there and then what you want to do is put it to the sides and slice it in half I think it's called butterfly yes just don't cut it all the way through obviously so you want like one just one flask a bit of meat which is good and then you want to get some parchment paper and a rolling pin or anything kind of hard like before I had a rolling pin I used a mug to flatten the meat and the reason you flatten it is because it just it makes so that when you are frying it you get like a really nice crunch with the breadcrumbs and a really good texture so I used seasoned breadcrumbs which have parmesan in them and I was intending on using parmesan in the breadcrumbs as well like adding some but I kind of just forgot so I was lucky there was sand in the breadcrumbs always use it but at this point I would add parmesan if if you have it which I would recommend you do and then I got the three bits ready for when you're going to fry something so you have flour and you want to just roll it in some flour and make sure it's totally coverage every part of it and if you have if you don't have enough flour on the plate just keep sprinkle flour on there and just make sure it's coverage as well as can be once that's done and you just stick it in the bowl of egg wash I would probably use a bigger bowl if I have one I would recommend that but as long as you get it nice and covered in an egg wash it's fine so Larry it onto the thing of bread crumbs and same thing is with the flour if you don't have enough bread crumbs on the plate then just sprinkle on a few more bread crumbs and if you can try and like press them into the meat as well so it sticks better then do that because it helps and yeah so I was doing two different cuts of meat here were like two different chicken pieces so I did one which was great and then I did another ear and but then I had a cheese strength left in the freezer now it's another thing that's a big thing over here is mozzarella sticks so I decided if I you would make a mozzarella stick I would have made more we had more left but it's a good way to use up the rest of what's left if you have flowers egg wash and bread crumbs left it feels like you're making the most of what you got and also mozzarella sticks are unreal and should be a bigger deal in artists as well so same thing is with the meat just relative flour roll and egg wash and roll it in bread crumbs and it's ready to go when that is done you've got your chicken Phyllis and you got your mozzarella sticks so you want to get a pretty deep pan are used to cast iron because that's the biggest and deepest pan we go and some vegetable oil and I think that's just the way to go in terms of kind of deep frying things so we use deep we used vegetable oil and the mistake I can I made what I was doing the first village was not waiting until the oil was hot enough so it took a little bit to get it started but once the oil is hot enough it brand quite quickly which is great but just try and be patient and wait until the oil is hot before you start trying to and then you end up waiting and it's not the best so wait until the top what anyway what you want to achieve this is a nice crunchy outer layer of your engine so anyway I went in with the second filler which honestly it looks better even going into it and then the oil is hot enough so it's got crunchy quicker got branch nice and quickly which is great and then yeah this one look way better and probably cuz it was the second one so that was great that that worked out and then with the oil still hot I did the same thing but with the mozzarella stick really solid and have more mozzarella because this was unreal so I sliced it open and it wasn't fully melted but it was still it was on real and would recommend if you have some type of cheese string or something go on at home then I put the oven up to 375 Fahrenheit but I put them on tin foil and I made sure it was breached first you just don't want this day and then you get yourself whether you make some of yourself or you have some from jar and you stick that on top of you chicken parm which will make a nice kind of a sticky there for the mozzarella so I got nice buffalo mozzarella which is generally what it is you can fry it and it's great because you can use a bit for chicken parm and then you can save some for like a track URI board or something which is what I did so stick that in the oven for about 20 minutes you just want to make sure it's cooked all the way through and this will be a good point to start cooking your pasta so I cooked my homemade pasta which always tastes amazing but the water gets quite starchy so you want to just maybe when you're draining it and pour some water over it from the top and it gets rid of some of us start genius so chicken prime comes out of the oven and it looks unreal absolutely delighted with power came out as then you got a stroke serving it so stick some pasta on a place and I did this a little bit out of order I normally put some sauce on top of the pasta but this time I was really hungry so I wanted to concentrate and I went straight in with the chicken parm after that I added the sauce around the sides I think it was an attempt to make it gourmet look I know something but either way you get some sauce on there and then you put on some parmesan on top and some I would crack some black pepper on there as well and then it's ready to go and it's just a really good meal I should have recorded myself tasting it because I forgot I was really hungry but and what I would say is this is an unreal dinner it's so nice and crunchy the chicken and then the pasta and the sauce is not being soft and you got the cheese oh it's really good and so would absolutely recommend so that's chicken parm I love doing that it's such a treat over dinner and if you make as much as I just did you will have it for two dinners which is unreal or else you know feed your family I hope you enjoyed watching this I really enjoyed making it

espresso cup so stay tuned I purchased these on Amazon they sell for $25 for the set of 400 this was very competitively priced and I wanted to give it a shot so we're gonna run it through a couple tests but first we're going to start with an unboxing the package very well each glass is individually filled in bubble wrap for transit Wow initially what sticks out to me is that they're just incredibly lightweight they almost feel like plastic cups but I don't want to say that they feel cheap because they don't they feel they feel well-balanced they're just very lightweight for glass a party says that these are good for warm or cold beverages and that it removes the need for coasters because of the double walling you don't get as much contact with your surfaces they say that they're made from a special glass that is stronger and more heat resistant than traditional soda lime glass they call it so basically what they do is they substitute boron oxide in place of the soda inline that's typically used in the glass making process they are dishwasher microwave and freezer safe we're gonna put that to the test in a moment but they do say that it's best if you do not use metal utensils on them and I think the best part of these especially for the price is that they do have a lifetime warranty from the company let's talk about something that really annoys me about these glasses and that's the company's logo a plaster to the bottom of each of them and I was hoping maybe it'd be removable I could scratch it off no it's it's on there quite well and I find it a little distracting and a little tacky but for the price it's not a deal the company says that they weigh 2 ounces they're pretty close to correct they are two and a half inches tall and almost two and a half inches across on the top so our first test for this little glass is going to be a heat retention test we're going to go ahead and put one ounce of 200 degree water in this standard shot glass the Aparri double walled espresso glass a little plastic glass in five minutes we're going to come back and check the temperature of the water okay it's time to test the temperature the shot glass is about 115 degrees the plastic cup is about 105 and the Aparri glass is at about one hundred and 1112 but to be fair there's not as much liquid in the Aparri glass it is a two ounce glass compared to this one ounce shot glass if I had put two ounces in this it would probably retain the heat a little bit better let's try that at a hundred and forty degrees not bad at all after five minutes so as we suspected once we filled the glass and more of an equal ratio to what we had the other test vessels filled at it retained the temperature a lot better for our next test we're gonna go ahead and stick this in the microwave for 30 seconds and then another 30 seconds and see how it holds up glass looks like it's in great shape it's not even really hot to the touch it's warm but very safe to hold and as you can probably see on the camera it is steaming hot and even at that it is very cool to the touch and it stayed in one piece in the microwave so I'd say this particular test was a success and for a final test we're gonna go ahead and put a glass a little bit of water in it about an ounce put it in the freezer for an hour and see how it holds up so I kind of forgot that I left this in the freezer and it's been in there for a couple hours now and as you can see solid as a rock but the glass itself is in great condition hasn't chipped or cracked so I'd say this portion of the test is a success we're gonna go ahead and take a look at the visuals when these are filled and for this test I'm going to be using the mini press Oh hand espresso maker you bottom line is that there's a couple cons on the fact that their light weight isn't benefit but it could be a problem since they're very delicate they could fall out of your hands when you're washing them so be careful about that the logo on the bottom again not my favorite thing but there's a lot of pros to this product the fact that they are lightweight does kind of add to very pretty delicacy of the design they're very safe to touch when they're hot and they maintain their temperature well they're microwave dishwasher and freezer safe they have a lifetime warranty and they're very inexpensive compared to alternatives that only five dollars per glass thanks for watching", "IB4JJw28C4Q": "perfidy rolls Toback the agent something that we've all forgotten about how to make the perfect shoe pastry first and foremost before

barista and the customer it's always really genuine maybe a little bit offbeat and quirky always interesting and I think people really like that that it may be difficult to find day to day and people are busy and they just want to feel something real and I think that's what people come to experience and then it's backed up with an amazing coffee as well we love our regulars I would say on any given day between fifty and seventy-five percent of the customers that come in are here every day we know their names you know their drink orders I'm going to know some of the stuff pretty well they know me by name they know my order so when I come in they're very friendly and they'll kind of say like oh are you having a chai latte today and that's really nice because it's a really nice community environment yes so our loyalty program we probably began about a year ago and we've seen huge growth since then we're in like a Tech Center Toronto is a very technology forward City and everyone has been really open to the idea of using the app once people get that we kind of have a little bit so if they're in the neighborhood I think they think about Jimmy's first because they have it on their phone and why not get rewards I would say about 25 percent of our customer base at the moment is using or any of that and it's just increasing every day it's definitely causing people to spend a little bit more I think because it's not physically handing over the money as well as people are more willing to like treat their friends it not only allows us to retain the customers that we already have but it's definitely helped us to bring in new people we see customers getting excited about it asking about it obviously they get excited when they get a reward so I think the way we're measuring is success for our loyalty program is primarily through the touch Bistro analytics being able to go in and check the reports in real time and also just go back and check how things have been going over the past couple of weeks to see if we've been growing or if we stagnated and kind of adjust our approach we see customers returning more through a loyalty through the app through what we're doing every day the numbers bear it out we've seen a lot of positive growth and we don't see an end in sight just continue on that trajectory", "4JCFV3KqRzs": "hey everyone it is time for a doodle-doo

or windows i like to use this to clean the mirrors that i have like in the bathroom and like my vanity mirror it does its job it's a little bit strong i'm not gonna lie but um it does clean the mirrors well and it leaves it very very nice like the next thing that i also have that um pretty much i like to use this in my dorm desk because usually that's where i not only do i do my makeup or homework but i also eat like i spend most of my time in my desk laser wipes because it also kills germs and bacteria and um pretty much my desk is where like i do pretty much everything so i always like to use that for my desk to clean my surface start off with the amazing basket guys this feels so soft as well like when i saw it i fell in love and not only that but i was looking to find like the whole um collection you can say this is like the biggest one that i have and i like to use this for is um for like my shampoos or like my lotions or remedies what medicines that i have or like um any miscellaneous things i got this at ross for 5.99 i don't know if you guys can like see it then one it's the same thing and i got this for 4.99 smallest one which was for um 3.99 and this is the smallest one it's simple but at the same time it gives like aesthetic to my theme that i kind of i'm kind of going for for my dorm this year so um yeah and pretty much something that i use to keep my pantry a little bit more organized and it's like these type of containers this is like the small kind of like small to medium one this little um large medium size and then i also have this large one which um you guys can see i kind of use it for my oatmeal i bought this like organizer for my drawers and um yeah i've noticed that like i've seen like so many videos where like people use this for like the cabinets and stuff and i'm happy that i was able to find this this was just like one piece that i decided to get but they sell plenty of them and by the way before i forget i got this at homegirls for only 7.99 and i just bought these two cabinets that i could use to organize my things in the fridge so i want to drop a lot of space as well so this little basket i got it from homegoods and it was only for 4.99 and i got this at tj maxx for 3.99 i'm gonna be showing you guys like pretty much everything that i have that i kind of got right now for my bathroom yeah i'm just start with um i like to use this for lotion i like to use this for my lotion and it actually does work and i like to keep it in my bathroom this is kind of an idea of how it looks like like the little marble design and then like that little like mirror part well i intend to keep my mini mini fridge like in my bathroom hopefully i have enough space to put it there i got this offer from pj maxx for only 39.99 it's been like really good i really like how it keeps like my skincare stuff really like cold so it's definitely doing its job i'm not even mad at it yeah i'm definitely gonna plan on keeping my mini fridge um in my bathroom and i went ahead of time and bought this so i haven't even like talked about it with my roommate but i bought these shower curtains um i really like how this this is like the front one i have the plastic one like in one of my cabinets as well i pretty much just needed like the front one which is like the cute one so i just bought this plain white one with those cute little designs and um i only got it for 16.99 i hope my roommate doesn't mind if we put this up if she hasn't like bought hers already uh like these shower um honey body parties shower hooks um i kind of like how it has that little flickery thing but i've just realized that right now that i was checking one of my boxes but i already had had one just like a normal one so i will see what i'll do with that but i might also talk about it with my roommate because this is something like we're gonna share share so it's not just gonna be my bathroom so um yeah i'm gonna have to like talk about it with her the next thing that i like that i bought was this little um thingy that you can like stick it in the bathroom like in the shower um so yeah i didn't want to buy like the um you know like those hanging ones the long ones um i'll probably put like a picture here or something but i didn't want to buy those because um it was just gonna be me and my roommate and pretty much the only things that i would put in the shower was just it's just my shampoo and like my body gel and like my loofah i personally like to use this um because it has helping me it's done his job but it's like this um little um towel hair towel thing that you use for your hair when you get out of the shower um yeah and then the next thing that i got was this plain white towels and it seems like this little design i don't know and um yeah um i like i pretty much included this like i guess in my bathroom area you name it i don't know but i like to use this marble one for my makeup and i like to use this calvin klein common clean yeah i like to use this common claim for like my skincare um products or like hair products that i have so into like my laundry items that i have it's not like a lot pretty much for my softener i like to use this downy calm softener it has like a lavender scent so i really love it it's like my favorite like softener at all times really makes my clothes smell really really good like really fresh and like just bomb okay so i definitely like to use this as my softness for my detergent i like to use this oxiclean um odor blaster it's quite big honestly though i'm kind of happy that i was able to find like a big size so i don't have to be constantly buying and buying definitely like that my detergent smells like fresh my um my softener which is downy that it already smells like kind of colony and kind of like a scent you know so i don't want my i don't like that my detergent already has like like those kind of scent when i already have my softener that that kind of does that for me so that's why i like this detergent because it really has like a fresh um laundry smell like if you want your clothes to be signing like laundry clean type of flakes then this is definitely the one pretty much where i like to keep my clothes is in this little basket it's like it kind of gives me like boho vibes you know my detergent was these downy um sheets and um i honestly would use the dryer over there at my dorm so that's why i had to buy like these sheets i didn't want like my clothes to smell like burnt you know when i would like use the dryer so i definitely would use this and it will make my clothes look good so yeah yeah it's like so so hot today like i was gonna do my makeup but like i don't have ac in my house so it gets really hot and moving on i also bought this like marble trash can for my dorm and well for my room in particular and it's like this metal material so i don't have to worry that in my break i got this from home good for like 9.99 so actually had this board but like um last semester me and my roommates use this kind of like to keep track of like what we have to clean weekly but it's just this like calendar board um it has like these gold accents on it around it and then i also like the letters and everything the thing that i bought was these little like cups and these are pretty much like the clear ones it comes in four and i also got this i think oh homegood you can see it i think it was like a six and a half a new like cup of these because last semester i did have some but they were like a little too small so it was kind of annoying for me to kind of constantly like kind of refill my drink that i was drinking yeah let me show you guys so this is how it looks like i feel like it's pretty normal size for me it's not too small or too big so the next thing was i got these clear coffee mugs i am kind of excited that i found these at home goods for only like 7.99 and it comes in four so it's like this clear mug pretty much wanted to keep myself with my mugs and it's just kind of like plain um just because i feel like it looks much like cleaner and like much organized um than how i had it before because i pretty much before i kind of had like different kind of mugs and i'm not gonna lie i got kind of annoyed of that that it wasn't like like all the same so i decided to buy like some clear mugs that were all the same and it made it will make my look aesthetic more um cute and moving on well one of the um this is kind of like a decor type of thing but i also got this from i think tj maxx only like 9.99 and i like how it's like a little ball and it like has like flowers here and like the little pot is like marble so i'm investing more on decor than like actual stuff because i already have more of like my necessity things so um yeah moving on i i personally like like i use makeup and stuff so i feel like it was very convenient to buy like a bigger pack for makeup remover wipes and this is from kirkland that i got we got from costco and um i think it comes in in total of 180 wipes so so or i think six i think becomes more than four i think i don't know but yeah i'm gonna show you guys how the bags look like this is pretty much how in the bag so the next thing that um i got was this like fox fur carpet i really like that this is actually more large than what i've than what i've got like last semester like my bed but i feel like this is gonna cover like both my bed and my desk so i feel i was kind of happy that we were able to get this and it's like very tight and it's definitely gonna like match my ideal theme for my room so the next thing that i'm gonna show you guys is these hangers i bought these hangers off literally like from these three styles from ross and and i like that it's also like long so if you ever want to use this for like your jeans or skirts or like bottoms it will definitely help you i sometimes use this also to hang my crops thing that i've got was these um silk like pillows i well pillowcase i got it in white and then i got it like in this like light blue color i already had like a gray one because i kind of it came with like the um bedding sheets that i bought at target but yeah this is from target and then on these two white ones i got it off from um ross it's very good especially if you're constantly moving in and moving out from your dorm um but it looks something like that and what i like is that you can put storage inside and then um also like here you could put like more storage when you open it you can just take this blue part off and just you're just left with the bin so um as i was saying though like these are like the type of um remedies that i'm going to show you guys and the first thing that i like to um that i'm going to show you guys is this um hydrogen peroxide and like rubbing alcohol that you need to take with you like if you're like moving out whether it's in your dorms or like a new apartment or whatever um because you never know you know you can you can like cut yourself get a rash or whatever and these are always gonna be there to help you um i usually use this whenever i cut myself or like whenever i get a rash or something also um the green alcohol i pretty much like to use this as a remedy as well whenever like i'm sick or whatever um but yeah there's like for the green alcohol i know there's so many ways you can use this as for remedies and stuff like that so i always like to have these three with me and then what i also like to carry with me is some band-aids because so many times like so many times because i'm like clumsy as hell where i always cut like my fingers and stuff when i'm cooking just me being clumsy definitely carry some band-aids if you can find like those kind where they have like the multi-size it's even better because sometimes you might not even have like a bit cut and it's going to be just a waste of band-aid to use like a big one so yeah and then um some actual medicines that i've taken with me was the day that they cook and nyquil um i always like to have this i think it's very important that we need to carry this where like where we are moving into like either department dorm especially with everything that's going on you know with this whole flu and like virus it's always important to have this with you because we never know if we can like get sick or something so it's better to be prepared than and then usually i also like to have like tylenol and advil um like sometimes i get like like headaches and stuff or like just random pains and stuff so i like to use this um for like a pain reliever i will get like cramps i always just like to drink chamomile tea which like most of the time it does take my crime away no matter what i drink like it doesn't go away and it's like very strong so when that's the case i always like to consume my middle i always carry my middle with me um and i think us as a woman we need to have like this whether like you are the same person that like realized kind of like in pills type or like home remedies i think it's very important to always have mido with you because we never know how our cramps can be because you know there's going to be months where it's going to be really strong and other times so yeah definitely carry a miter with you for my girls in particular so just like to carry some house with me um sometimes you know like whenever you have like a sore throat or whatever it's always good to have some hauls that you can like um use but yeah i always like to have this because you know there's times where i've gotten sick and stuff and usually these has helped me so much i forgot to show you guys but i also always have um vaporub um with me well taking the ointment um because this was my best friend when i got sick um i think like last year um and yeah it definitely cured me really really fast especially when you have like a flu it really helps you a lot then um moving on to um i think you can say it's like one of of my kitchen things but i have um i already had this like last year but it's my mini keurig um coffee machine it was very convenient especially especially for me that i am like such a coffee person like whenever i wake up the first thing i consume is my coffee like like coffee was my thing you know so um yeah i definitely took this with me and i like i used it with my roommates as well so um yeah it is well my mom just bought this for me so it's totally still new it's not even like a year old because i just bought it literally like last semester definitely recommend this for like students that have like a smaller space dormitory like if your dorm is going to be quite small i definitely recommend this because as you guys can see in the picture it doesn't really take a lot of space and um you get to have your coffee so you know you don't have to quit get up to the store or whatever and buy coffee when you just make it yourself so yeah one of the things that i also have it's my um racing vacuum so yeah i have like since our dorm had like carpet um pretty much the whole apartment i'm kind of surprised me with this so i was kind of happy to get my back in but yeah this is just my vacuum and so this is gonna be my nightstand um it comes like in three of these like circles thingy and i really like that because i can like i'll put the core like at the bottom and then just use like this top part as like my nightstand so um yeah i really like this because it has like these like this gold scent on it and like the marble so so that pretty much wraps up this whole video um i really hope you guys enjoyed watching this video i know it's quite long but i hope this kind of like helps you if you're like moving back to your dorm or if you're like moving into an apartment so um yeah so remember to like and subscribe to my channel", "1dW5SQ4UNtw": "hi there my name is Ashley I want to introduce you to Bodum's Bistro burger grinder these are definitely

the red dot design award they've got a really nice into slip grip on the bottom of them really nice handle for mixing they come in a variety of sizes as well so they're pretty much you know you can use them from mixing small things big things that yeah easy to use and they're sold separately but there's also a set of five as well talk us through what's included in the file easy the main ones there on the right those all come in the set of five the mixing jug is the taller one that's actually sold separately and what kind of colors do they come in they come in red black green and also white and off-white so once you have your mixing bowls of course you need to start with your mixer this is the bistro stand mixer talk to us more about this yeah so this one is brand new for us we actually just have created new attachments for them to different types of attachments we've got a meat grinder and also a slicer and shredder that attached right here in the front really nice thing about them is that they're completely transparent so you don't have to worry about any meat getting stuff any bread and anything that you're grinding you don't have to worry about it getting stuff it's easy to clean and if we already own the mixer we can buy the attachment separately for how much yes those are sixty dollars each alright we also have this Santos talk to us about that IDC coffee yes there's the tons of coffee here in our booth so this is actually we're celebrating the 55 year anniversary for this this is the Santos vacuum coffeemaker it's extremely simple to use it works under steam pressure and it brews a phenomenal cup of coffee that's for sure so if you would like to do that phenomenal cup of coffee be sure to visit bodom com or check out retailers nationwide the

just work today we're going to review smart coffee scales this review I thought would be easy I was just gonna buy these sets of scales do some basic testing on features and declare a winner that isn't what happened that's not what this review is going to be what we're going to dive into the world of smart scales now briefly I want to tell the story of scales in coffee I think going back to 2012 was when the sort of the the Harry o coffee scales launched right when we started to get really serious about weighing our pour of is our V 60s whatever we were making now I confess I had a little bit of a hand in these the reason that they have varying levels of accuracy but they're they're kind of 0.1 at zero to two hundred grams or 0.5 at 200 to 500 grams that's that's my fault that was my suggestion I own no money from these I was never paid for this advice to Harry oh but but it was my suggestion as a way to let you go all the way up to two kilos but have accuracy where you needed it to make it point one gram accurate all the way up to two kilos would have made it much more expensive than it was so this was the kind of compromise that's by the by this thing was a set of scales that was designed or focused on making coffee and along with your weighing function you had a timer function and that's kind of what sets coffee scales apart from other things but this was the beginning and these work like just about all kitchen scales work you have a base here and then you have a way pan here and connecting the way pan to the base is a piece of metal called a load cell and as that piece of metal bends under weight you can measure the varying current across that piece of metal and you can convert that into a weight that little load cell is probably the same in pretty much all the scales here although cells are very simple things the software what you do with that information that's where things get tricky now no question the game was changed when a kiya kick-started their first set of coffee scales home the Pearl set of coffee scales and they did something kind of interesting they took this little way pan on top of this little base and they just turned it upside down so suddenly your weight pan was your base and your base was on top is where everything was and this means that the scales were kind of spongy because everything you pushed was pushing down on the way pan but it meant that water would run off the edge and down and couldn't get back up inside to mess with the electronics in most sets of scales having it this way around with the way pan on top left the electronics exposed to water and that was bad now here in front of me I have seven sets of scales most of which I've paid for thanks to the support of patreon that people support me each month on patreon giving me a budget to go out and buy these things and therefore have an unbiased opinion about them and that way I'm not relying on manufacturers giving them to me and I'm not spending the money out of pocket because there's about a thousand dollars worth of scales here which is which is a lot here I have the Tim amore black mirror scale it's about 99 euros 100 euros I think I paid for this here which I already owned is the scale this I have because it connects to the decent but it is a smart scale worth talking about this is $99 this is the Brewster smart scale I think this is about a hundred pounds this is the Felicita incline it's about a hundred and fifteen dollars here is the new Akaya pearl Model S which is a hundred and eighty five dollars or about 195 pounds in the UK and on the end is the heroic Jemmy which is about two hundred and seventy pounds or I think like two hundred and eighty-five two hundred and ninety dollars online in the US which is a lot initially we're going to do two tests we're gonna do a boot up test which is how long does it take from pushing go to being ready to weigh and then we're going to do a test to see what the lag is like so I'm just going to dose about 30 grams of coffee onto each scale and see how long it takes to register the correct final weight then we're going to talk about apps but we'll come back to that in a second so let's just dive into those two tests first of all so now we need to talk about apps because apps are the way these things become in theory smart so each of these does have an iOS app or that I have downloaded onto my phone I think most of them support Android but I'm not sure how well I'm not gonna make coffee with each scale because that would be reasonably wasteful and I tried to waste less these days I'll just be pouring water from pouring capital into a brewer to mimic the kind of pouring you would have with a be 60 it should let us see how the apps work and I'll let you see what I see on my screen so let's start with the tim'm or black mirror so that's good news and it's crashed immediately and there we go let's try that one more time and crash right what an auspicious start for a smart scale we finally have an app connected to the phone which is terribly nice only took deleting and reinstalling the app which is perhaps not the ideal user experience now what you can see from the app is that you have some level of pre-loaded recipe in here and if you jump into the settings it'll let you play with your ratio which is very common thing here a lot of them won't do that kind of 1 to 40 1 to 15 thing which I have said I'm not an enormous fan of then what's frustrating to me is that I might want to brew 30 grams to say 500 but because I'm stuck in a ratio slider I can't actually get it to do that the closest I can get us 510 now you can select your bean really quite an odd selection here you've got mandela guatemala a weirdly spelled Yirgacheffe saddam oh but no ethiopia you've got yunnan which is good but also pak'ma'ra which is a variety blue mountain geisha Kona Kenya I don't get it I'm really a little bit confused ok so we're ready to brewing a brood just over here to try and prevent too much sound of brewing coming through on the microphone so let's go let's let's start with a loud beep so what you get here on the screen is a pretty typical kind of blueprint I think that's a hires term for it but a sort of simple chart showing cumulative weight over time so you have like a bloom phase you let it run for a while more and then add more now one thing where the scale is it will tell you off if it thinks you're brewing a bit too aggressively loudly will tell you off I don't really know what triggers it there's not already an obvious setting to control that it obviously just thought I was pouring my water too quickly but it doesn't beep to tell me I've hit my target weight seems odd and it doesn't really care that I've got in there too quickly just if you hit a certain g/s I think on the flow rate then that's that's bad let's save and I get to comment is it excellent is it good average poor bad let's talk about that later there's some flavor descriptors here you could add them you can use theirs there's pretty limited choices I can track which device I used then you get your blueprint down there and I can save that as a record and you can share it but into WeChat which is something that a lot of people outside of mainland China are really using and there you go you've brewed that is the that's the black mirror when it when it works so a little bit buggy I know it's really just kind of just out of beta but certainly a slightly frustrating experience there to start with and I'm not hugely sure that the way is trying to guide me into brewing is particularly intuitive or helpful and now we have this scale app which has I think the ugliest app I think I could think of it looks like someone who's designed this has done like a bad job porting it to iOS from something else the layout is all screwy and messed up they're kind of mixed sort of typography and and everything else it's it's not it's not much fun now you've got a few little things here you've got a timer it's got a it's got a kind of unit function which it might be some sort of brew ratio thing I don't really understand but anyway let's start and all it's doing is is sort of tracking weight and tracking time which is pleasantly simple frankly there's no charting of this data it's just a simple graphical display it's just an ugly one if I'm honest so as much as it might be smart it's not it's not hugely smart there's a start-stop for the time where there's no option to save anything here but that's that that's the app it's not remotely intuitive to me it's not particularly helpful and it's not in any way beautiful yeah it's more good okay next up on our list is the Felicity incline let's open up that app let's open up this scale give a little boot up and something's crashed or hung I don't really know it just is saying Felicity on the scale are you annoyed do you put weight on you so secret here apparently is to to open the scale first and then open the app which seems to me probably like a bug not the first so again a pretty minimal app a little bit more beautiful than the scale app though essentially showing you the same data at the beginning there is the opportunity to build out a rest why this is black type against a dark background I have no idea again we've got a weird selection of origins which come with to protect oh no can we take multiple what's happening here we've got a misspelled Columbia always a win Brazil Pama I don't understand Salvatori I assume is supposed to be at El Salvador Cameroon let's pretend with brains to go from Cameroon we can track their brute tools and our kettle I don't know why I track those things I guess if I was tracking everything I might and then let's add some coffee in here oh goodness me that's an unpleasant way to put it in data now it's quite easy to miss tap the ok' button and then end up moving your ratio out there and again i can't change my water to be what I want it to be I'm stuck with a fixed ratio thing deep breath and let's hit go let's see what happens so a hot water injection that's happening here oh my lord this is hideous and confusing this chart is the least intuitive thing I think I've ever seen so you're getting a blueprint but at the same time this ridiculous sort of very large brew rate I guess pour rate flow rate display that looks like it was designed in the mid 80s let's go with that I mean that orange and blue combo is delightful the pixelated nature and the slow refresh rate it's it's all bad don't I don't feel good it's steaming oh wait we're blooming but it's not blooming its steaming so not smart enough to realize that I poured my entire water weight in here but now it knows that I've paused its pause the timer which is particularly weird because you would usually include your bloom time in your pour time and in a moment eventually when we're done steaming in so many ways we can begin again the coffee is good the coffee is good click Save I presume that's just touch the button when I get a blueprint and I can edit my remarks it was a flowery and nutty no it's either flowery or nutty it's a little bit of a mess I'm not sure why ruff deserves a beam symbol either that's kind of weird and let's save that and there we go I'm now back at a screen where it's telling me to click Save again but we know I'm done if I click Save when I go back to here but it's lost all my data so let's just come out of there I've saved it where does it go red where does it go get your recipe is saved somewhere magically that you can't access anymore did I just lose my mind I'm done I'm done with this particular scale for today this app is also bad so now before we dive into the suite of acai our apps we're going to talk about the Hajime the most expensive scale we have here so let's try turning it on first good let's open I'm Jimmy our friendly app and we're greeted by yet another reasonably an attractive screen you've got espresso mode pour-over mode training mode and display mode I'm not sure where the letter J is is there to represent display mode but but that's essentially just gonna mirror what we see here on the phone which for a scale with the remote detachable thing I don't know why you'd need the whole point of this scale is that you you know you got this thing to put where you want to be and then also have your phone I don't know when I would need to have two displays at any one time let's look at training mode now this will train you to pour at a specific flow rate we're going to train for 30 seconds at 5 grams a second let's start training so how skilled am i at the old flow rate so aggressive there we go six grams well I guess score we can compete and see who is the slow careful pouring champion thing I've got a four out of five score well done me and you get a little brew printer that's quite pretty actually I've got to say this is a nice looking blueprint to style thing I'm not going to try again I think I'm done now we do also have a spresso mode just to Jupiter that quickly now here it's kind of problematic because what your choices are with these three espresso states are the way that the timings on starts as on or stardom that kind of stuff so you know auto tare auto start none of this is useful because none of the starts will correlate to your pump being switched on it'll be correlated to liquid hitting a cup in some way or a cup going down on a scale and only being tare doubt but none of it connects to your actual pump starting which is the correct time to track your espresso from so I don't really understand the why of this here which leaves us with poor of a mode we've got a previous brew in here let's design a recipe we Liberty 30 grams we're gonna brew a ratio of 1 to 17 but I can edit my water which is nice I can brew 30 to 500 so here we've got a suggested to thing where it's gonna give us a two-to-one and then a 20-second bloom and then to pause of to varying speeds let's see what happens so we get a little flow rate thing here again let's go oh it aggressive it says slow down and then I'm an old bean fills up and I know to stop and then it counts down the appropriate time to bloom that's just fast-forward that now it's distracting me to brew at four Mills a second here which I probably didn't notice when I was designing that recipe is actually an incredibly slow brew rate let's go with quicker let's make it cross oh it's red it's angry I ran out of water that's okay we're done we're done and so now we've actually got a sort of tracking of what happened and then you can choose to save it if you want to and the record is now saved there's no tracking of did you like it did it taste fruity or nutty or floral or any of that sort of stuff it's just a track of this is a brood that sort of happened that is broadly speaking the hajime and now onto the Akaya which is gonna be tricky now of the apps in my little coffee apps folder four of them belong to a kya which is an interesting reasonably frustrating choice and they all do different things and some of them are more focused on this scale which is extremely feature-rich and as I said I'm not gonna have a chance to go into all of the things this thing can do but I'll make sure there's links down below so you have obviously an update which is not hugely important right now you've got a nakiya app a brewmaster app and a brew guide app let's begin with just the Akaya app you have a feed of kind of social media stuff that I'm just not going to go into and a very simple tracking type thing so let's hit play and then we can track water going in can we hit play no we can't I don't know why I can't hit play just let's reset everyone here let's tear you out let's go to a different app and here is the problem and this isn't actually a Caius fault this is actually the way iOS works you would think of that my phone and this scale are now connected and so if I open let's say a different app like brewmaster then this this app would be able to access this scale but it can't it can't because that connection is locked up inside the previous app so if I try and add a scale where are we settings slaves and I cut a scale there are no scales and range that's because this scale is no longer visible because it's connected to a different Akaya app there's no way around this you got two choices I could turn the scale off and back on again which would kill the connection or I can kill my previous app or it could kill my Bluetooth on my device all of this is ugly all of this is a hacky unpleasant feeling thing to do in this case I'm gonna turn it off I'll turn it back on again lo and behold it's here inside my my scale choices and I can connect to it I can see it I've got my information about all the stuff there and we're back and we're ready to go with our with our brew so now we can have we can have bring that you're not connected anymore why are you not connected can't connect to scale but you just were you just said I'm connected Slate's on the car scale there are no scales and right how are the no scales range we just went through this we just connected deep soothing breaths deep soothing breaths so now we're ready to brew we're in that the log our brew section so we can hit start and this will produce a hope a nice little graphical portrayal of what's happening here so you have a logged bar chart a flow rate and then you've got a kind of cumulative brew that produces that kind of group print that is I think their term they coined it belongs to them I don't for other apps but it's it's their thing I think and and again very similar to everyone else is you can see a nice little graph and everything is great so there we go that's done so now we can save it we can name it we can do a whole bunch of stuff that's good we can add lots of things a little smiley face temperature brew time all of that camp stuff is there oh here we go there we go I can take a photo there we go and that will be a tremendous photo to have in the future I'll know exactly what that was at that point so there is the app called brew guide so one particular feature of this thing is that you can upload a recipe into the scale itself the scales large display at each stage will prompt you to do the next thing and in theory you can have this kind of prompting in the mornings without having to open an app now of course I can't connect these two because they're still connected with a previous app so let me just kill you there we go we're back again tremendous and now I can go in and I can select my app upload okay and then this this guide gets uploaded and then there is a brewing mode where I would invoke the guide and everything would be great and it would do the prompting for me and that's it it's surprisingly slow to upload I've got to be honest this is ticking along pretty slowly I can't imagine there's actually a ton of data here but there we go we're done we're done so the scale now knows what we're doing and that's good and it talks to me on a subtle display and that's nice but can you feel the lack of enthusiasm emanating from my body well let's let's do a wrap-up in just a second here I do need to talk about the Brewster which claims to be a smart scale but does not connect to your telephone and in doing so I'll begin to wrap up and do a quick talk through each device before telling you which is the one that I think is the best let's talk about the Brewster it is the the simplest of them it doesn't connect via bluetooth it is rechargeable via a nice little microUSB at the back it is a traditional way pan scale so you have a solid base it's real tactile buttons those are good things in a simple way pan the smartness of it revolves around some level of calculation around or ratios every time I use this I have to go back and get the instructions out because it just defeats me with the way that it thinks it drives me a little bit crazy whispers these are these are the instructions that come with it that tell you how to use it and despite the fact that I've tried and failed many times so auto mode so place the brewing scale on the platform after three seconds it should zero out oh it did that took some time that's not an intuitive thing there's no countdown there's no timer this is not particularly obvious so now I can add my coffee let's pretend I've added ooh 33 grams of coffee and now I push the ratio button no yes okay and then that calculates for me my 1 to 16 ratio which is great so the cab like honors here and I can start brewing and the timer should start automatically the timer should start automatically the time we should start timer no I don't know what I've done wrong I don't know how to make anything do what I want to do I just so defeated by these things they're just I'd be just very stupid I can't got the instructions in front of me I'm just not having a good time and and ah look look I must operate right now these are all examples of technology that exists because it can not because it should I don't really understand who they think is using these scales in these apps sure there are some people that want to track every brew but there has to be a better way than fighting a Bluetooth connection before you've had coffee in the morning why we can't just have a scale that connects to Wi-Fi securely and then just has a log button on there you know what I mean like if you want to record it just push record and from that point onward to the scale records what you're doing until you say stop or you take the the brewer off or all that sort of stuff that's easy to detect I don't want to have to find and use my telephone before I've had coffee I don't and I figure most people don't either and I would say most people that have a smart scale don't use the app measure at the time by having these feature-rich scales that have two buttons that have to be used at a bunch of combinations you make people feel stupid I often feel stupid I've often found myself stuck in a place where the display is doing something I don't understand and I don't know how to get back because because there's no guidance on the scale I can't remember the button combination I'm supposed to use it's not natural it's not intuitive to me it's frustrating and that's the case with all of these things so I'm gonna run through them quickly and I'll share my thoughts as a quick summary on each one I'll track you become so the black mirror it has no markings anywhere on it and that frankly is extremely frustrating trying to find the power button to turn on is incredibly annoying it also has the single most irritating beep I I don't want to hear that beep that early in the morning I will be printed to Akaya they do a nice beep this beep it's not a good beep I just wish the beep was less annoying the scale I think is again a little bit confusing the two button shapes aren't particularly helpful it doesn't feel particularly expensive and it's not I think it's the cheapest of all the scales here the app is terrible I the only reason I have this scale is it because it connects to my decent espresso machine and that will be viola reason I keep it for any amount of time though I know that John a decent is working on his own set of scales for the future this is all-in-all difficult to recommend it's ok it's just it's just not very good on paper I quite like the Felicita in clan scales they're simple they can be set up to do two things which is time and weight or just weight if you want to the app is not particularly good but that's okay I can do most of what I need to do with it it's just there for a pretty expensive way to do it I'm kind of using the same features I would have in the original hairier scale at close to twice the price I can't recommend this in good faith though because Felicita frustratingly completely ripped off the shape and design of a Caius lunar scales and that is not OK so these are kind of out of the contention from that perspective the Brewster smart scales I don't think are particularly smart they're not particularly intuitive I appreciate having a base and tactile buttons that we don't particularly like the buttons on this that much it's ok it's just built to do a really specific thing in a way that I don't really get on with if this totally fits your workflow you might have a nice time it's interesting that for the same money as other scales here it's about a hundred pounds it doesn't come with more features that is not necessarily a criticism is just notable that it's the same price without the same kind of feature sweep there's no price of app development or maintenance going on behind the scenes here it's ok it's for poor overs and really nothing more and it's kind of a shame you know like by confining the way it works it reduces its broad usefulness and then we have the Harwich Immy this I think is actually interesting because they took a risk and they did something new and they had a scale where the display disconnects and it's magnet so you can mount it on top your espresso machine if you want to pull shots with it but having it this way having these sort of 5 pin connectors here mean that neither part is waterproof it's a traditional base and way pants of so a style model which again means electronics are exposed so yeah you can brew espresso with this but bear in mind you could damage and destroy an incredibly expensive thing and that is so much money for the money I would expect a better app for the money are expected to be waterproof for the money I would expect a longer battery life and this currently gives a respect that they've tried to do something new the build is great it feels solid it feels reliable it's cool but it's also nearly 300 pounds or dollars that is that is too much money that is just too much money and I can't strongly recommend something that's just that expensive when I'm not sure that you get two to three times the features of other scales and that leaves me with this the Akaya scales and I would say Akaya have set the bar for smart coffee scales they changed the game with their original set that kick started a few years ago and they continue to really lead the pack it's frustrating that they have so many apps in the nature of app connection is is that way it's frustrating they spend a lot of time and dev money on features that I don't think personally are hugely useful if you really want to track your Bruce if you want to chart everything and have that data accessible have that data available to share this is easily the best choice it's probably the only choice I think but I still just feel like they're doing things that don't need to be done that creates a more cluttered confusing frustrating experience as a normal user I would be very hesitant to broadly recommend smart scales to everyone if they fit a really particular need that you have then yes go for it and I would say the Akaya is the best in class right now but if you just want to make coffee in the mornings then I'm not sure you need a smart scale I'm not sure you want a smart scale that's my rant that's my rant on the topic I'd really be interested to know your thoughts too in the comments let me know do you have a set of smart scales already do you use the apps that come with it all the time did you use them a few times and then stopped did you never release them at all do you think that there's something that I've missed about some of these scales do you think there's some features that I didn't talk up enough that I was unfair I'd be really interested to know your thoughts share your comments down below I look forward to reading them and as always thank you so much for watching we had a great day [Music]", "0rGTT0je1xY": "dan Hiro's NHL trunk today we're talking freezer mugs using

in the recliner no matter what size you choose make sure you pop these in the freezer one to two hours before the puck drops and get your mitts on because it can be cold as ice get yours today at NHL Trunk calm", "-Qmhlx3S7qw": "[Music] hey guys it's Mimi man we're back with another video for this week I have noticed a shift in my videos I tried to respond a lot to my analytics and it seems like my lifestyle content has been getting more traction so I thought why not put out of March favorites share some items that I've recently been loving and if you guys seem to enjoy this video I can start creating it for other months but let me know in the comments down below if you liked it or hit the like button because that lets me know what videos are of interest to you versus which videos you really don't need to see but yeah and I'm gonna start off with my very first favorite and I will have links down below I'm trying to use Amazon affiliate links and seeing how that works so we'll see if I actually end up using that and to start off with my first favorite is actually a longtime favorite and that is my icy gel couture nail polishes so I have a couple of go-to shades and I currently have a manicure it's freshly done you can see that I worked really hard on shaping it one of these nails actually are ready he's kind of chipping so and I literally like it hasn't even like fully dried I want saw this Twitter this tweet that said that this person learned that it takes 24 hours to you four nails to fully dry and ever since then she's had trust issues so I definitely still feel that way about this because it is super annoying that it takes so long but it does last a really long time and I'm somebody who does my nails almost every single week are even more than that because it chipped so easily with most nail polishes but regardless I will say like around the edges the SE gel Couture starts to starts to test as I already 2 showed you but otherwise it actually lost and I've tried gel nails I've tried using like the dip polishes and my issue is I hate seeing nail growth and my hair nails I don't know if you guys noticed my hair has come like super long and I haven't seen my eyebrow lady no oil so plate you can't notice that but my hair nails have always grown super fast so when I go for things like that I just literally is not worth my while because it like within a week my nail grows to a point where I don't like how it looks anymore but I do really like doing my nails myself and comment down below if anyone agrees with me but sometimes I feel like unless I'm going to a really nice nail place they don't actually put that much effort into my nails and I'm pretty good at do my own nails so I feel like I can do better myself so having something like the se gel Couture like what I when I've gone before I've even had the nail techs ask me if I have currently had gel polish on because it looks like that so I highly recommend it it is much less expensive than going for a manicure if you practice enough you can get kind of good at it and yeah let me know in the comments if you would like like a nail related video because I feel like being a darker skin shade it's harder for me to find colors that are flattering and I've troubleshoot it and you found a few color that are pretty good so I can create that if it is of interest to you but let's go to our second eye the next item is vitamin D pills and I don't have it in front of me but I do have it right now with the situation where we're in right now and I'm like I'm literally being so big because I heard that like my videos are curly and I monetize but I'm I'm hope I'm like on the road like sixty percent they're literally so I think this video in the future could monetize so I'm not gonna say the word but um during this time we're all indoors we don't have a lot of sunlight especially if you are of a darker skin shade it's really important that you get sunlight and yes you could have like I've been making myself going like these like walking breaks and things like that but I read somewhere that your if you have a darker skin shade it takes you five times the amount of Sun and somebody of a lighter skin shade and yeah you are protected from the sun's rays but you literally need it a lot more and vitamin D is linked to your happiness it is linked to even weight gain so I highly recommend buying vitamin D pills especially this time because you might feel like your mood is not as great because you're not outside as much you need to be and you might actually even like gain more weight on top of the fact that like everyone's eating more because you're at home all the time so I highly recommend vitamin D pills right now next is a Productivity planner and I wasn't sure if I'd like it and I was very hesitant about spending 30 bucks on it and it has been so worth it especially working from home it helps me pace myself and manage the work that I'm doing and it helps me feel super productive which I guess makes sense because it's called activity right next is um it's actually long time favor I'm gonna grab it my coffee do know I have enough cream I tried to have like you know when you feel guilt like within about a cream that you're putting your coffee so but it's like mmm okay well let's go back on topic but can we talk about this mug oh my goodness it was $12 from Anthropologie I got it a couple months ago and everyone in my house has been trying to take it that's so pretty and every day it literally has an end on it and I spent brother with who's names with ASEA Chris the posture taking my mug it's an N mug it quit like there's no one else in my house but you know apparently people don't care cuz it's really cute so I ended up buying another one of these on anthropology and the little they have this cream thing with the same mosaic and being from the city I just love this I'm like sorry I'm like I can't know about my tile prints but it's just really nice especially when you're at home working you're not seeing me boy you're not seeing you know that's our world I am rarely driven by aesthetics and making my space look nice and I say this as I look at my fill up film setting behind this camera which is like completely messy but I do really love making things that's nice and looking at pretty things happy I found super beans but I'm actually type for any uh neighbor and people here know what that is about but I'm a tip for and it legitimately brings me so much joy to see things that are put together nicely and when I look at this mug especially working from home it just makes me feel a little happier so yeah I'm sorry I think literally like it's been I'm like I feel like I have human interaction right now even though you're not responding but I'll respond to comments please comment okay we're gonna move on and hopefully you're still watching and you're not like totally like thrown off by my leg I don't okay let's continue next is another another favor is from intelligent change the company that made the productivity planner little--it productivity planner and it is actually the app five minutes the five minute journal and what I love about it is you start your day by listing things that you're grateful for and then how are you gonna make today great and at the end you just put in like a reflection like what went well and whatever great way to start your day and again especially when everyone is home it's easy to get negative it's easy to not feel appreciative for the fact that yeah I'm working from home I don't see my friends but I'm safe right now it's easy to forget things like that and happiness is linked a lot to gratitude so for me personally is so good to get to the mental habit of saying I'm so grateful that I can work from home last item is and something that I highly recommend highly recommend I even mentioned into writing a video is the house party app and I have loved it the connection and it's not so great along this fan-out I also recommend Jack party games i jack box party games i actually bought some recently just because i'm gonna be having meetings with friends he assumed and it's a little bit more intensive than the house party app but for a house party you can play variations of games like apples to apples heads up pictionary and its really great because you're with your friends but you're playing games so you have that immediate engagement factor and the bakbox party games I haven't done it virtually yet but I have done it with friends on a trip and it literally is just so much fun because he set it up you use your phone to play the games and especially now with the fact that we're all in different places and trying to still connect with our friends that's a great way to still play like a traditional game because you just screen share and from there you guys can all see the same screen and then you use your phone to play these games with your friends and yeah I feel like it's always good to have things like that on hand especially during times like this because yeah I am a big fan of thoughtful conversation and I feel like with the right gear for people I can have so much fun just talking about deep things but sometimes when things are hard it's helpful to just have a break and I know a lot of youtubers have disclaimers the beginning of their video to say like they know what's happening and whatnot but I think sometimes you need those videos like this which is completely irrelevant and just talking about something silly and having those games kind of forces you to talk about silly things rather than the very present reality which is kind of scary that's it I'll see you guys next week and stay safe and comment down below what has what mmm what I've been tonight your favorites for this month what have you been enjoying and what is up with me today yeah [Music]", "xd7wKXjln_c": "hi I'm Jim young I've been a studio Potter for 41 years recently a small pizza company in Rogers Arkansas asked me to design a unique wine cup this grassroots project became the bistro cup my smallest and most popular original design inspired by the natural beauty of Northwest Arkansas each cup is really a tiny landscape notice that almost all of my glazes are earth tones did you know that blue is the largest single earth tone it is see how the natural beauty is mirrored in the glazes it's almost as if by plan the truth of the matter is I I get down in the studio and start playing I look out the windows and see fall happening I see winter happening and these little bistro cups become the result of that interaction I love living in Northwest Arkansas the seasons changed the cups change the combinations of blazes change and it's all together a very organic experience for me very different from some of the neck up jobs I've had in the past I'm glad now to be just making pottery I start the process with a half pound of moist white stoneware clay each individual cup is sculpted informed uniquely you notice that there are no no more moles other than the memory that's in my hands and you can see how responsive the clay is it's hard to believe that this responsive clay will become the hardest clay the hardest pottery that one can make so first I refine the shape add a foot and finally create the pillowy aspect which resembles our Hills here of the rolling hills of Northwest Arkansas that I look at every day after firing once we begin the glazing process we make our own glazes Here I am glazing the middle of cup and now I'm glazing the outside of the cup using an airbrush and glazing up to four or five different glazes all of which in the very high heat will flow together and create the landscapes that are the final product so here we are it's loading day in the kiln it's like putting together a giant jigsaw puzzle and groups of things are usually loaded in the kiln together to save space and after the loading I brick up the count I made this count there's no mortar in it it's all held together by gravity light the burners and then gradually adjust the fire upward until it reaches 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit which will melt the steel will melt steel but also make stoneware and that's what you're looking at now so my life has become sort of seamless as I try to create pottery that mirrors how I feel about living in Northwest Arkansas", "beLqVivWMpU": "the last thing to show you is I know a lot of you like to take tea with you to work in the morning this is a French press for making tea on the go put two teaspoons of tea into this double walled tumblr and then add the water to it and tea has already started to brew and you can watch your tea come back to life then we're going to put the top right on the tumbler and after three or four minutes simply push down the French press and what that does is it pushes all the tea leaves to the bottom stops the brewing process but if it's not strong enough all you have to do is pull this French press back up again and your team will continue to steep as strong as you like it it's double wall construction it will keep your tea hot for a couple hours without burning your hands off to work you go with a proper cup of tea for the morning", "GMIfZB4lv_M": "so who wants swag what i mean is for those of you who've emailed who want the tax

right so check out enq at the link below thanks for listening guys and enjoy this week's program hey guys it's eric and in this week's podcast i actually wanted to address a lot of the comments we're getting about the podcast uh number 91 which is you know darren guillot our deputy commissioner for small business self-employed division uh joined us and talked about enforcement in 2021 what can we expect and he talked about how criminal cases coming over from collection are up 42 already in the first quarter and got into the discussion of artificial intelligence and what they're doing is now that they have all the information from coinbase on virtual currency remember the irs did a john doe summons on coinbase where they got all of the taxpayers that that held uh bitcoin they now have that database they have the foreign asset information from the fatca um treaties and everything that came over over the last say 10 years what they what they're doing is they're taking those databases and with artificial intelligence looking through all of the offers and compromise that have been filed for the last two years all of the 433s where people have argued to be uncollectible and also the bankruptcy schedules from taxpayers who filed for bankruptcy you know listing the irs as a creditor to see if those people failed to disclose virtual currency or foreign assets those are the people who are now being referred over to criminal so what is the impact of this and so a lot of you been emailing me you know can we not do offers of course you can do offers here's the deal the clients that have been lying filing false financials are going to get caught if they have virtual currency um if they have any foreign assets and you know quite frankly the irs also gets the homeowner's policies and we'll see the riders so what is the impact the impact i think is on our practices we need to be much more diligent about getting the information from taxpayers right i had a client who failed to disclose um a very valuable collection all right i won't go into it because you could then you know do a search and you'll find out who it is um but uh pled guilty for that and and here's the thing at one point that taxpayer attempted to blame us i gave you the information and despite knowing better i on a friday night at like 9 00 p.m after hearing that ran back to the office pulled the file and went through it and no he did not disclose it okay it was not in any of the notes it wasn't in the scratch 433 he sent us when we sent it to him and he reviewed it and said it was accurate and signed it he never brought it up all right however we have two issues one is to protect the taxpayer from themselves and two to protect ourselves so what we've done now for those of you who are tax rep members inside tax rep in the checklist and downloads you know all of our forms and our templates are there we have the one that we send out to clients saying here's all the documents we need right for 433 whether we're doing an offer in compromise uncollectible whatever well what we have done now is added to that foreign assets and virtual currency and also under the homeowner you know for the for um you know the uh housing right we have you know and not just under housing the last question is usually do you have any collectibles whatever else we are now asking for a copy of the homeowner's policies with the riders partially this is to protect the client from themselves all right we want to make sure that they're aware that this has got to be disclosed but it's also protect to protect ourselves because just like tax preparers when special agents show up at that client's front door and knock at the front door the the first knee jerk is going to be to blame you so one make sure you have added that to the list of documents you're sending if you're a tax rep member it's already there right we've already done it however what we're also working on at our firm is we're automating this there is going to be a massive wave of work when the irs finally drops the hammer again on taxpayers okay now when is that going to happen i'll get into that in a moment i i'm betting late summer it could be a little bit earlier but more it could be the fall but i'm i'm bam banking around end of july august okay the government is going to start enforcing we are going to get crazy we're already busy we're going to get crazier and again i'll get into why but we're going to now is the time to be automating everything that you can automate it's what we're doing all right we are in our crm which is our you know is a crm is a client relations management system we are automating our templates the point is on those items i'm going to have the client submit everything electronically so they will get it electronically click on the link and they'll answer all of those questions and upload their documents those answers are going to be yes no the client is going to have to affirmatively give us an answer on virtual currency foreign assets and any collections artwork jewelry any of that stuff all right and the reason being is that will be your get out of jail card free if later special agents want to talk to you about your clients 433 all right so but but even beyond that just to manage the the inventory you want to be doing everything you can all right the other thing is you're going to after tax season you're going to want to really ramp up your marketing because the hammer is going to fall and let me explain so before darren came on i i'm texting with him over the weekend you know just confirming the podcast whatever and i said so darren when's the hammer going to fall now when i say that what i mean is the government right now really isn't enforcing revenue officers in the field are doing some but there's going to be a massive wave of final notices and levies that are going to go out to several million taxpayers who owe for 19 and or 20 and are not paying the reason they're not doing it now is the government cannot levy stimulus money so right now we have the second round of stimulus that's sort of wrapping up it certainly looks like um president biden is going to be signing on to a third round of stimulus right they're saying they're going to have the bill on his desk by march 15th so you got to figure end of march you know april may that's going to be going on and let's let's assume that that's all wrapped up by june final notices of intent to levy have to go out that gives the client 30 days normally acs will wait 45 days so now already you're basically through june into the mid to late july that's the soonest i think you're gonna see millions of levies go out and i think there's gonna be a week it might be august it could be september maybe july if they really speed it up where millions of people are going to get their bank accounts levied and their wages garnished they're going to be online freaking out calling one you want to ramp up your marketing right we're putting all kinds of new material inside tax rep on state and local topics now blogging topics and uh new sample newsletters and non-filer topics all right ramp up your marketing through the spring into the summer and figure out a way you're going to manage the inflow of work this this is what's going on right now at our firm at green and scars all right and this is what we're talking about with our tax rep members right now as we're automating we're doing all we're mapping our workflows those are all getting posted up inside tax rep okay so if you're again if you're a tax rate member you can go download that stuff and see at least see what we're doing all right and you can you know you may not like what we're doing you could play with what we're doing change it tweak it do whatever you want if you're not a tax rep member you got to start thinking this stuff through and doing this yourself right but you're going to want to figure out how to do this because what i'm what i'm most fearful of it's not so much the work there's going to be a ton of it it's not getting paid we get our money up front it's in fact 2020 was a good year 2021 is going to be a great year it's already shaping up to be a great year it's the chaos of managing the inventory that has got us worried is how we manage and track all of this what's missing what's not missing what's outstanding all of that powers of attorney did they get facts to cap so we are we're working with our folks and our rit folks and we're automating through our crm as much of this as we can automate right it's been a long time coming we've spoken about it but we're doing it now all right i highly recommend you consider the same right so to summarize we need to be careful i mean if you listen to darren carefully what the message i think is is we need to be careful when we're doing this because collection cases do go criminal most people think of criminal coming out of audit that's not the case offers uncollectible the false 433 that fails to disclose assets goes those cases go criminal okay and in fact they're almost worse criminal cases because they usually come in under evasion of payment and the evasion of payment case you not only have the tax loss but penalty and interest is included in the tax loss right none of the other crimes include penalty and interest except for evasion of payment evasion of payment or evasion of collection includes penalty and interest so the tax loss number is even bigger all right um so one is we got to be leery of that we have to make sure that we ask these questions but on top of that given what i think that the the incoming title wave of work looks like now after after you get past april 15th this spring you're gonna i would suggest you buckle down do your marketing and really focus on automating your practice because i think it's going to be critical to your success managing the inventory and making money doing this all right so listen short podcast this week uh i've got a very cool guest coming on next week uh which i'm very excited about we've been we've been going back and forth we're working on on on on on the questions and and i think you're going to really enjoy it so anything uh anyway enjoy that everyone stay safe and be healthy all right and uh talk to you next week bye", "ISa6iJLjfhA": "hi I'm Jonathan we're at Maryland shining company and today we're gonna talk about how we can decorate China with your artwork so we decorate here with the process we call high fire or kiln fire decoration and what's nice about that is it allows us to decorate just about any of the 2000 items that we have in stock with your artwork or your decoration um so if you don't have one of these catalogs call let us know we'd like to send one to you it has page after page of cups and saucers teapots dinnerware vases you name it and we make it in porcelain it can be decorated and what we do is we then print your artwork on special transfers that get fired in a kiln and that makes it permanent I'll talk about a little that a little bit more in a second but the first step is to select the kind of items that you'd like to have decorated for example you want to do dinner where you have the choice of a rim shaped pattern where traditionally you're decorating along the rim we also have coupe plates this is a more contemporary look right now where you might do a big image that covers the whole center but the the possibilities really are endless we have you know different kind of scrolled or embossed dinnerware patterns as well again over 2000 different items to choose from and depending on the pattern that you choose as far as the blank wear is concerned you have different selections of matching serving accessories such as teapots or platters there's different sized plates available down from say five inch up to 12 inch chargers so if you're looking for dinner where you're going to want to visit the website Maryland China com look through the products because any of those items can be decorated so okay step one you picked your item step two is to pick the artwork that's going on that item so the next step is going to be send us JPEGs of your artwork so we can just see kind of what you're thinking and know that down the line you're gonna want to be sending high-res Photoshop files or vector R in Illustrator format that will allow us the size and appropriately to the item eight and then we get to have the transfers made so let's say we're decorating this plate and we know that this is a nine and a half inch plate we might know that the transfer has to be nine and three-quarter inches but we take all that into account and we take your artwork and we create a decal layout so what does it eeeek a layout look like so this was done for a different customer designer named Megan flesh out of Australia and she's doing some coop plates I'll show you the finished product in a little while but we print these images you see she had four main coop plates and then this other image that we can use on a platter or a caster or something you know larger like that and then some back stamps too so that when you flip the piece over you can see who's designed by it gives it a more finished look if you're gonna end up selling a new high-end retail stores or just to make sure that your customers aware of your brand we'd also print the backs names but what we're doing here is taking the artwork and laying it out for these big printed sheets because when we print decals it's a screen printed process we're gonna gang up all the images together and we're gonna run as many as we can at once to create this inventory of decals or transfers that we're going to use as we own production for you so for instance let's say we printed 300 of those so we're gonna have enough transfers to make 300 plates your initial order might just be for 36 plates of each pattern at once or something like that so we're just gonna make the 36 plates your money really is tied up as far as investing in starting this project is going to be tied up in the inventory of decals because it's a screen printing process you get a lot of cost benefits from running a large number of sheets at once the cost to go from say 100 sheets the 200 sheets is maybe only 40 percent more to go from 100 to 300 sheets where you're getting three times the decals only might cost you an extra fifty percent so we're gonna pray with that screen printer process to create the transfers and then the next step once we have those in hand is the actual application and fire so what we do next is I'm just going to use a different example say you were going to decorate these cups and saucers or mugs like this we call this having our Bistro mug and I'll put together my little makeshift decorations to do this for example is a transfer made for a different customer it's two colors so we printed hundreds of these at once for them I think their initial order was safe for a hundred pieces but that way we had the extra inventory when they went to reorder we've already got these on hand it speeds up the process so let's just put that in there and in general talking about timeline you're looking at about two to three weeks once you've submitted the images and improve the pricing to move forward on the decal printing once we have the decals in hand it takes another two to three weeks for the production and again that's for us to hand apply to the transfers onto the pieces and then fire in our kiln and you might ask what does that entail why are you firing kiln can't make this in an oven what's the process so let's think of each piece of porcelain as a clay body which is then high fired to make it in case of porcelain vitreous or waterproof and then coated in a glaze and think of that as like a very thin glass layer on top of the clay and that's what gives you no porcelain it's fine white look if you're doing a stoneware item that has a color to it that glaze is where you get the different color but in each case it has the silica material on top that's high fired and that gives it that glassy finish when we print the transfers and apply them the print itself that then has that cover coating on top is an inorganic mineral which when it's high fired fuses to the silicon coating think of it on the clay body and that's what makes it permanent so when we hire these pieces that's what makes it microwave safe dishwasher save image isn't going to come off you can eat off of it there's different requirements they're passed prop 65 we print with lead-free materials and Academy and free materials so it all just depends on the look you're going for the intended use but should let us know all those details from the get-go and that's how we manage the printing and production so this transfer which has been dipped in water now for a few seconds means a little bit more time but what I'm going to end up doing is sliding that image on squeegeeing it on with a paper towel and then it's ready for a kiln to show you the other images that Megan Hesse was designing for example that yellow burns away when it's high fired and were left with her intended colors which was a black and this halftone gray that goes around the edge the fact that she had this border here dictated that we needed to print these large circles if you didn't have a border and just say this image in the middle then we could gang a lot more of your prints together and get you a lot more images on the sheet but again because it's a screen printed process if we're printing a lot of sheets that's when you get your transfer costs down so that's just an example what the finished product looks like okay I think we're all ready here so you can see this is moving a little bit this cover coat holds the image together and allows me to place it onto the porcelain and because it's flexible you have the ability to decorate on complex curves such as you know this mug curves down and around whereas other decorating techniques like sublimation which is a decorating method I'll describe in another video it has different limitations where you can't decorate on these complex curves the same way but then what I'm doing is squeezing out all the air bubbles and the wrinkles here and that gets that image on real well and then it's ready for the kiln so I just want to show you how the water release works in production I spend a lot more time getting this piece ready to make sure there's no imperfections and how the image was on there or the alignment so then this is put in a kiln fired it's somewhere between 1,500 and 2,000 degrees in order to get those minerals to fuse with that glaze coating and then you have your finished product so that's a brief overview of how the process works again if you're interested in having us quote any project just contact me my name is Jonathan winter at Maryland China company go to our website Maryland China comm it's got the contact information there as well and you can look through any of the products there will request the catalog and we're happy to help you with your project you know just a matter of submitting artwork and then we go from there but I hope you found this video informative and we'll have some more out soon thank you very

series anyway when I moved here I came up with a list of food places I really really want to hit so let's just hit them one by one together first stop breakfast noodles I don't know what it is those two words this gets me excited if you just tell me let's go have breakfast I'd be like yeah all right but if you told me we're gonna go have breakfast noodles automatically tingle everywhere goosebumps [Music] this is their nine way little mispronounced pork that's one of these that's good they said our noodles are good and they said that this is good so this is like a hop hop thing that they have I'm excited to try this so I got two different types of noodles super paranoid it's got to wipe off all the containers first glance these look like handmade noodles a little bit of chilies some pork cilantro yeah these are definitely and made meals for sure I think this one is the chili sauce [Music] these are the beef and chili noodles wow that looks so good beautiful stretch needles and loads of beef you see now I say that just breakfast alone it's not enough of when you say breakfast noodles gets me every single time it smells so good I'm gonna make a prediction bold prediction I might like this [Music] solid solid at least a nine out of ten these are some beauty pageant quality noodles Wow I would let this represent me in the miss noodle galaxy contest I thought these are these are amazingly good temple noodles at that great shoe and the flavor is amazing it's nummy it's a citron based flavor a lot of you guys from the comment section asking me what numbing means it means like it makes your mouth or your lips like tingle a little bit and that sensation goes perfectly with something spicy so it's spicy it's numbing is very suit on classic citron flavored beef is good Wow aggressively aggressively seasoned cilantro brings a nice bit of fragrance some extra heat is brought by these little chilies as well this place is called chill web which in Chinese means like lingering flavor and that is a hundred percent true I love every single game about these noodles look at this there's fermented bean sauce here too now I think they make this in-house so this is gonna give it an extra depth of flavor some just extra luminous but no matter how you slip it these are gonna make you happy so happy I started my day off with this what's off can't you eat this gonna make you chubby after hearing that the be left kind of try my parking it off now a little bit of peanuts scallions cilantro and I love how read all these butyl sauces are hmm that's really really really good I might like this even more there are not shy with these sauces again loads of meat sauce covers every single strand making it all Purdy also pretty these are the regular Excel wait you know you cannot go wrong with either one of these the beef noodles they're gonna be numb ear is spicier but if you can't handle the spice go ahead and get this it's a little milder slightly milder but the spicy flavor is still ever so present delicious solid nine out of ten I don't even know what's better the springy fresh noodles were that amazingly flavorful B sauce ah so good I wanted to get their hop up but they told me something that's really good to eat at home and not to get outside shop I still want to go visit a few places maybe on my way home you don't start this good I can imagine how far must be amazing that's perfect exactly what I needed I was like 50 60 percent awake until that those should be called alarm needles you eat them your taste buds wake up your tongue wake up your whole body wakes up way better than that whole baby beet stuff right all right breakfast number two here we come and on the way there just a big shout out and thank you to surf shark V p.m. for

whatever reason get your money back and go buy a bubble tea actually probably have a bubble tea cuz bubble teas are expensive man alright we're here at the signals I like this little Plaza let me show you why I come to this Plaza like almost every other day first of all it's got the Asian Family Mart which is where I do most of my shopping there I think that's the biggest Chinese grocery store around Bellevue and I'm gonna go in there today this that's a Indian supermarket I want to go try to find some Indian instant noodles and all around here besides that the Sharon Williams store is all Asian restaurants [Music] Luna Bistro so I walked by this place a few days ago I see like these bamboo steamers and they got all these like meats and and we best up in there let's go you wanna restaurant is pretty empty so I'm screwing you here because when you leave here the server team this crew little bamboo steamer so I did a mix steamer so I have the is my favorite lap Cheong Chinese sausage one of my favorite things in the world and this is the spirit garlic spareribs and this is yeah that's not important perfect [Music] and this is all sitting on a bed of lotus leaves oh this is good hmm everything's good from the soft steamed egg savory sweet Chinese sausage mm-hmm garlic ribs are tremendous my parents washed us so I got to eat some vegetables rice is not sticky rice so typically if you go to dim sum the lotus leaves are wrapped around sticky rice usually with chicken inside this is just jasmine rice but the flavor with the meat in the sauce is so gratifying and with the Chinese sausage it's savory it's a little sweet tons of umami flavor and the fragrance of the lotus leaf there's definitely steeped into this dish all my praises goes to the garlic ribs I mean so garlicky so tender Oh what's he beep him they gave me this this is the husband and wife of lung slices a really popular Chinese dish and each meat and more meat love it [Music] if this was a dating profile you took one look you like that thing checks up a lot of boxes so color flavor aroma texture children are soft but a lap shy is a great shoe to it I would definitely recommend coming and trying this Oh 100% be back I really like this [Music] this is kinda like eating a must seemed a version of a clay pot rice very happy I've never been inside in India supermarket oh my god all the Indian frozen food dumplings - coconut dumplings - and masala change secret on you ever seen these instant noodles before Oh Maggie Qi noodles I hope this is the one that Solon suggests I need to try this - seems to be enjoying it I'm so excited about this I've never tried Indianness two noodles before I'm legit like just giddy on my stomach and it's raining Oh even the rain guards wants to celebrate this special occasion there's something I've been craving I won't be happy until I have it I won't be happy at all [Music] hello thank you i screen tea with cream cheese FOMA 30% sugar less size so you can maximize the economic value this is a pizza truck and well they kind of brick oven until their truck [Music] [Music] hey eating pizza in the rain gotta say I don't think I've ever done this before and this kind of reminds me of a Neapolitan pie see all the little bubble crushed and a little beautiful char marks on the bottom this is really good mmm my only complaint a bit on the saltier in but make no mistake this is good pizza I've had pizza and all death mecca's of Pizza like New York and Rome and Naples this is good pizza if it wasn't so salty it'd be even better but that might just be because I wonder every single meat they had on the menu but the key thing for me is how melting your mouth this crust is does taste almost like a Neapolitan crust which really is supposed to dissolve in your mouth - so go the crust is airy fluffy and once you get through the outside crunch seriously that thing just melts God ingredients are good quality I like that little crispy part of the pepperoni there's a good pizza now come and give these guys a try I wouldn't recommend getting maybe what I got because all these meats that are all salted it is a bit too salty but you know I don't often say this gosh I don't think I've ever said this if you get this with less meat it'll be better just got home showered changed hungry again let's try out those instant noodles [Music] this is a very simplistic bulbous and you know hmm that's definitely quarry so far the flavors okay it's set to add like a cup and a half of water I feel like it's too much water I feel like maybe one cup of water maximum otherwise the flavor gets diluted a lot any overall flavor is good spicy curry flavor I like that but does get that looted a lot by the water so it's not really flavorful enough noodles I feel like it's just a regular instant noodles there's nothing really special about these noodles overall I mean it's okay that's something I really love let's try this seam size into noodles kind of small I added less water this time so this is a citron flavor very spicy very very spicy this one's much better maybe because I put less water here like they tell you to put a cup and a half of water don't do that I say 1 cup of water maximum it's very spicy but it's not a lot of other flavors to it so it's just kind of one-dimensional spicy not bad definitely not one of the best is the noodles I've had but I'm glad I was able to try it this is initially the old adage for sure worthy of a ice cream afterwards because it will hurt your tongue hmm what a fantastic day today every single thing I had today was like a gift from the food costs so amazing the first noodle place showing it all so good that was an amazing bowl of noodles and the steamed rice there is meal so you need never had anything like that before really really tasty in that piece of place until I find something better if they even exist in this area that's my go-to piece of place now I finished it and I already miss it anyway guys that's always all the place I went to listed down below for you if you can definitely go out and support your local small businesses keep them alive keep them afloat and give them as much support as you can during these crazy times as always thank you all so much for watching see you later [Music]", "1IiRkRlwcxE": "you hey guys welcome to the lunch on review today but I wanna be's artisan bistro burrito this is the egg pork sausage and cheese breakfast burrito this contains no GMO ingredients pork rice that antibiotics made with cage-free eggs no artificial colors our flavor 14 grams of protein per serving made with organic eggs cheese in a tortilla these are a Kroger they were 250 and accreditors so good so here's the calories for you 320 hours if you think our burrito which so cooking directions so if you can't do these in the oven if you want to there's the directions for you look I've wasted why but energy heating up it up for a burrito so we're going to the microwave me when doing of it anyway so we're going to remove the burrito from the package a place on a microwave safe plate flat side up these are frozen so we're gonna microwave abri\u00f3 for one minute 10 seconds flip the burrito over on the microwave for an additional 1 minute and 10 seconds and then let it sit for for one minute before heating so 110-foot number 110 I'm gonna use a paper plate I'm actually gonna use a regular plain paper just because just because they tend to stick to a regular place I mean paper fight that so if you had a piece of parchment paper you could put it on that would be fun I'm gonna do it on just a regular plate so it won't stick as bad so I'm gonna get this in the microwave flip it over put it again and I'll be back when it comes out all right here inside the microwave I did cut it inhale let it sit for a minute and then I did cut it in half just so I could pick it up and show you what's inside looks like tons of eggs don't see much of anything else in there it's supposed to have sausage in there too but I don't really I guess there's some small pieces of sausage like right there there's some small pieces so and the tortilla tell is very very soft almost wet so I'm going to turn it over so it won't get too soggy on the bottom yeah because that was getting soggy on the bottom of that you can see the moisture on the plate so I'm going up to sit it dry out a little bit and cool off yeah we're about okay should be cool enough now that to try out so here's like I said there's a closer look at it you can see the potatoes and stuff in there too hmm the biggest taste I get out of there at first the very first flavor is potato then I get the flavor of the sausage and there's some I didn't see a lot right at first but if you look after I took a bite there's a big hunk of sausage right there in the back so there are pieces of sausage in here this is not bad the tortilla itself is is good and soft and it's it's not wet I cooked it over so it dried out so that's good the fan folded over would have been soggy on the bottom so which wouldn't be good the flavors pretty good I like the taste of salted the tortilla it's a little chewy it's not bad in a bad way I don't mind it but it was a little chewy the sausage well that by I just have to didn't have any sauce tuna olives all Haag and cheese and tortilla of course it's good you can taste the egg I'm really strongly in there so it's it's got a good flavor to it the sausage has a little bit of spice to it not like burger mount hot spicy sausage but just regular sausage I don't mind it and I know a lot of people like to put like salsa or ketchup or something like that on these I think it's also would be pretty good at this because that's the sausage it does have a little bit of spice to it and I saw some would add just a little more flavor to do you think he's good I think they're a little expensive for what they are 250 for a single burrito at breakfast Briana think it's a little high but it is you know organic cheese eggs in a tortilla so it is organic that matters to you no GMO all that kind of stuff so I guess it's a it's a more humane version of breakfast burrito flavors are good I'm gonna give it I'm gonna give it a 4 because I do like the flavors I have nothing to really complain about it but there's nothing like super spectacular either so I'm gonna give it a 4 definitely we're trying out if you don't mind spending 250 for a burrito that's how much it is so uh yeah oh my god we're spreading it to the back interweb the back still does have lots of egg and potatoes back there too and the potatoes are really good the potato you get a really strong potato flavor and even the eggs the egg by itself actually tastes good so yeah definitely were on I would try this out a few if you want and I'll catch you next down [Music]", "OQOWerOAqvE": "you hey guys welcome to a live interview damage home one of these artisan bistro burritos this one is the egg cheese and uncured bacon breakfast burrito these were 250 at Kroger's so if you got a coronary that's where you can get them contains no GMO ingredients no nitrates or nitrites made with cage-free eggs no artificial colors or flavors 15 grams of protein made with organic cheese eggs it is 310 calories organic flour we're gonna gags cheese bacon big hunk your cooked bacon bits organic potatoes organic Tomatoes 2 percent or less of so you can't be this in the oven there they are a few directions we're gonna do the microwave so remove the burrito from the package and place on the microwave safe plate flip side flap side up sorry microwave burrito for one true flip the bread out over and microwave for additional 55 seconds [Music] just remove the text like your typical burrito so let's do it like this wipe side I'm gonna pick out a packet of or put this sign up first one minute and flip it over and then another 55 seconds now they back when it comes out okay here it is out of microwave I'll let it sit for a minute and then I cut it just so I can hold it up and also what's a cool ball so this one and you can see the eggs I'm assuming that's bacon up there at the top it kinda looks like bacon plenty of eggs and looks like a potato it does tend to stick to the paper plate so you might take your knife and just like scoop it underneath I cut underneath oh it's just to get it unstuck but you can see yeah looks like the pepper peppers now that's part time Amazonas B peppers on here then has tomatoes that's what the red is there could be bacon so how about this how about cut it up into smaller pieces and there just let it cool off okay hopefully it's cooled off enough I'm gonna bite into that somewhere I don't know where yet hate the flavor of the bacon mostly um it's got a good smoky bacon flavor the bacon is not really crispy bacon it's kind of a chewy bacon or I call it a fatty bacon it's it's cooked to where it's not crunchy so I like it that way but if you don't you don't like stop like chewy bacon you won't like this you'll you'll want it you want it crisper than this and it's it's not all kind of it was soft bacon hey what'd you get baking all through there though I got a little butter the tomato you can taste taste of the tomato it's mostly egg and bacon that's what that's what you mostly cook taste in this thing it's not bad at all though it's actually pretty good it's some is it worth 250 I don't know if you're if you're really into the organic you worry about the organic you want you know the the GMOs and the nitrates and nitrites and cage-free and all that if you if that's something you you you're concerned with then this is a good burrito to eat it's a good it's a good breakfast burrito nothing wrong with it at all it's nothing spectacular or super special or anything like that it's just your basic egg and bacon burrito so take that as it is I think it's okay it's not spectacular flavors but it's not bad flavors either so I'm gonna give it a three it's just your average burrito so um - yeah but like I said it's more important that not assertive flavor but it is really good for if you're looking for all of the organic and all that stuff because there aren't a lot of options in that and if you're looking for that kind of thing this is a really good option so so yeah I personally flavor-wise I'm gonna give you a three hope you enjoy this video thanks for watching [Music]", "9rM3eep9iDw": "[Music] foreign let's see here [Music] a [Music] and love is all we'll ever [Music] i

chopping up on trapeze GOTV and I got another episode of covet cuisine for you guys so today I'm gonna show you guys a little bit of a burrito a quarantine burrito that show you guys hey just cause we're on lockdown doesn't mean we can't be still eating good so stay tuned and check it out all right so the bass filling on the burrito it's gonna be chicharones some canned sardines and smoked oysters that we had left over from the last recipe the trap oyster burrito check that out the top ramen a little bit of Doritos just for a little bit of an extra texture first things first you gotta smash the noodle all right so once it's all properly smashed and go ahead and put in a bowl where as its boiling water I'm going to put it in this glass pool so you guys can see exactly how much water you should put you don't want to put too much you don't want to put too little just the right amount you save that seasoning packet later let's get our hot water started all right you boil some water let's go ahead put that with the ramen don't put this evening tag right just the water guys [Music] just to about there not too much just barely covering the wrong want to soak up that water and then blow up alright next thing you need are the teacher run it these are for price go ahead and put them into your skillet or your pan nice alysha's pork rinds here these are the ones with the skin and the fat and a little bit of meat these will make real good film alright the next thing where I do you got some green salsa I got this from the market you guys can also check out my recipe how it made tomatillo green salsa from my cousin Valerie go ahead check that out but that we're going to be cooking it in that sauce [Music] now I don't want you guys to have salt just yet because what we're gonna do is have some flavor right here from smoked oysters and the sardines now that's a little salty and that's got a little bit of flavor already so don't add your seasoning pack yet unless you know when they do drink gonna add that in to stir it all in now if you got it go ahead ask the Doritos in there we got the sweet spicy chili that goes along with the theme of Latin Asian fusion so go and add those have you got it nacho cheese or Cool Ranch whatever flavor it all be so what we gotta do is whip it up till it cheese you're only soak up all that flavor they're gonna soften up and really absorb that salsa verde flavor so what we're gonna do now just give it a little taste a little spicy tangy from the tomatillos and what it needs is a little bit of salt so what you're gonna do is get that seasoning pack on the ramen which is almost done cooking too by the way and I want you to open it up and just sprinkle it on not too much okay just a little here in there stir that all in and give it another taste oh yeah that's perfect I got a bale of flour tortilla I like 14 inches or so what take you guys back to the stovetop turn on the griddle I'll show you guys how to make and wrap this trap burrito all right we turn the stove on high all right we turn the stove on medium heat what we're gonna do flip this back and forth make sure we get all the sides evenly heated because that's gonna warm it up that's not gonna make the real tear when go ahead and roll once it gets heated through turn it over see my bro doesn't totally fit the tortilla it's too big so when I turn it actually flip it to get all the sides heat it up as well what you can also do because it's softened you can fold it try to get it all up on there let it heat through guys let it heat through patience it's getting nice and soft and pliable you don't want to heat it and char it just want to get it warmed up okay let's transfer to our plate all right let's scoop some of our noodles up on there don't

I'm a barista at\nThird Rail Coffee right by Washington Square Park in New York City. I'm going to teach you some basic coffee-making\nskills. I'm gonna show you how to make a cappuccino. A cappuccino is traditionally between five\nand six ounces. You have your shot of espresso, some milk,\nand then foam on top. Usually it's gonna be in thirds, which is\ntwo ounces of espresso, two ounces of milk, two ounces of foam, but somewhere around there\nis good. Officially, they say between one and two centimeters\nof foam on top, but there are many different interpretations. So, let's start off by pulling the shot, steaming\nthe milk, and then pouring it. OK, so we have our espresso, we have our milk. Since I've let more air into the milk on this\ncappuccino we can do a little bit extra texturing, which is just swirling it around. You can give it some side to side shakes to\nincorporate the foam into the center. Sometimes if you've added just a little bit\ntoo much, you can pour about an ounce off the top. All right, now just pour and that is a delicious\nlooking cappuccino.", "f1ciredAmh4": "hey coffee lovers it's Morgan from Whole Lotta Love calm and today I'm going to show you how to make a cherry

"okfLMCMjUWI": "okay finally back although probably wouldn't seem long before you uploading it it's been probably about a week since i last played this game for various reasons first my pc died not so much died it's either the processor or the power supply just stopped working it just starts up for like 30 seconds and then immediately just drops not entirely sure but it's been dying for the last year or so anyways it's been getting to the point where even just unplugging my microphone just kills just i get a blue screen of death whenever i unplug my microphone and that can be a bit of irritating and second off we had what was it the equivalent of a category 2 hurricane tear through iowa and so i was out of power for like four days i'm like one of the lucky people i mean i mean by the time this recording goes up that would be long past even if it's not really mentioned in the news at all for whatever serious reasons you'd think that something like that would be majorly newsworthy because right now it's uh august 16th so yeah and there are still plenty places that are like in cedar rapids that are still completely out of power and it sucks i have friends who live there anyways uh video games enough about my life [Music] anyways yes i'm on a new pc right now it runs a bit better than the old one yeah i i think the graphics card and the processor are way better than what i had before but i did downgrade the ram because 16 was like the highest i could get and edit my affordable and my price range and that why am i in the guild hall i meant to go to the port and i'm down i'm down to 16 when i was at 32 before so it that kind of hurts but it's not that big of a deal anyways what we need to do is go to the uh um take care of some of the stuff like at uh utah so you can upgrade our ship i won't be able to make much any progress in terms of the ship stuff because i need to actually do tortu do stuff at tortuga first in order to even progress any further than that and i probably won't be able to do that until like near the end of the second stride anyways okay so so [Music] as um because i don't remember the best route to get there okay so we need to go or this way all right i can see the path actually on my map i could check oh whatever i'll wait for that now [Music] you're not adventurers are your adventures are you knocked by or the king i have something to ask of you a foreign merchant ship has arrived at italia damaged is undergoing repairs but silver falls island and turns to look at the ship should be out by the harbor at the highest top shipwright is a high is highly skilled but prone to wandering often is missing about a lead to give orders the repairs are going slowly we need a chief ship right back the chief shipwright bound oh yes he does a lot of cheap cheese so he might be out somewhere getting a bite if this foreign ship's repairs take too long it may become a diplomatic issue we need him soldier battles respectfully to you and leaves in the direction of the shipyard you can search for the missing shipwright or you can put your own missions first so yeah we are required to do that i forgot if i switched them because i did do some grinding with some of the other characters i have because i will be needing them okay let's see start going this way first i do need to map out this place that was not what i meant to do actually now that i think about it which window captures this one too let's change i'm going to change something on it real quick there we go look you could maybe yeah you can see my mouse now yeah i'll make it easier when i'm trying to point this off like oh look over here or something instead of me just uh automatically go rem forgetting that no you can't actually see that because i usually just turn that off it's [Music] a annoying here yeah those trees oh right right we had to come in from this side in order to get to that guy over there but we won't be doing that there's no point i don't think i can actually do that until um i finished the second stratum honestly i think about it okay trees oh i'm out of provisions anyways okay what continues at least oh yeah [Music] because after this our reward for finishing the second stratum i think is the ability to go through is a part that either goes through seaweed or rocks i forget which one it is either way this needs to actually progress so you are pretty much so you can't do all the ship stuff if you could this game would be stupidly easy considering some of the stuff you can actually do with those okay oh yeah right we need to set sail again um let's see let's see i need to get to this island right here [Music] to save some cash [Music] oh okay well this works too you're having a small island you've visited before it's possible a surprise here leaving the ship you come across a giant a giant of a man strolling among a flock of sheep he takes a bite from a hunk of cheese in his hand silently stares at you unquestioningly you must be the chief shipwright he nibbles on his cheese as you ask him to return to ayutthaya after you explain the situation the man patiently finishes his cheese and suddenly stands up you cannot help but flinch his massive presence as he walks to your ship although he remains silent it seems your awards have reached him relieved you set sail do i need to get him back there i forget i mark this out while i'm looking about [Music] it that's uh palm trees i don't remember i don't think i actually took those ones out those are the black sailed ones you don't get decks you don't get the ability to actually destroy those until much later you arrive at the plane looking island a good distance from armor road it's likely unnamed you're about to pass by um by without a second glance when olga lets out a shout over excitedly says there's a barrel wedged in the crevice in the cliffs you need to use a telescope and take a closer look and you do indeed see a barrel as olga claimed if you're interested in the barrel you're free to recover it yes it doesn't bark from the ship and head towards the crevice and the cliff face reach the cliff and find more barrels stacked together behind the first you open one discover crystalline stone known as niger a material used for gunpowder of course you would know about that another ship must sell this shipment here fearing it uh being wrecked by violent currents you decide to load this cargo onto your ship [Music] well we're done here [Applause] [Music] okay yep it looks like we have to go back there i think just making sure yep we do have to go back there just kind of hoping to not have to do that oh well i like it take so long but you know still [Music] okay oh it was the one back there oh that was on accident [Music] it doesn't bark into a higher soldier approaches against speaking to you in stern tone i you i've been waiting for you it seems you returned with the ship chief shipwright the repairs can now begin in earnest thank you for your efforts please take this silver hands you with silver coin in an old book then turns towards the ship right let's go sir everyone's waiting for you there'll be plenty of cheese later the shipwright nods firmly and trots off the shipyard up until one after hearing this you board your you board your ship and set sail from it [Music] do you recall or talked before about refitting your ship thanks to reaching ayataya well skilled carpenter arrived sounded like there was going to be some sort of problem i told him the order was for kurohanship and he got right to work he's on the ship now you should make your voyages even more comfortable but if you're planning on passing through the straight near high towards the north sea you have to do something about those pirates who have staked the waters as their so we have an extra equipment slot now all right so so um yeah our next objective is to get up here but we need the um cannon otherwise we blitz it can't actually do anything because we need to go up over here to progress to the north sea which is a second map i think there's only two maps for this i never really went check to see if there's anything beyond the north sea i pretty much just hit all the landmarks over there and just did the quests but whatever um all right there's my party okay so this is normal party [Music] okay anyways we got sequest too might as well take a look at those real quick especially since i might be overloaded for a couple of them at least the first one because you get good stuff from them [Music] i know i need to do this one if i want something to really help me or it's this one it's one of the it's one of them i forget which one it is okay anyways let's start here [Music] by orders of my master i've come to arma road in search of an item called swallows calorie judging tells it over wherever that person once every hundred years but princess caggia will only marry my masterpiece found and i mean to do so alright so we got kirikaze here and yeah we only get five slots still even with him so we're gonna have to deal with that rhiannon has to come along because she's my main healer here's a tank comes along i guess olga will be the last one unfortunately rick is to stay behind she kind of has her she's not that terribly useful during boss fights unfortunately as much as i like her [Music] okay so cross slash [Music] staying sale from the ocean city you eventually reached the scandalia lighthouse with a bird rest yes if you're cautiously proceeding through the ruin in the lighthouse you find a gigantic bird monster at the top your party and the ninja take weapons in hand to challenge the as the birds spread the swings of the challenge the monster lets loose a blood curdling shriek as you dart towards the threat before you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh he's almost dead no worries about wasting tp and stuff on this because you get fully healed after these fights it's actually a cheap way of actually fully restoring your party members if you just want to do that anyways i did that because yes that does stack charge [Music] yep dead okay [Music] the monster crashes down and defeat thanks to your relentless attacks and ninjas quick reflexes as you celebrate your victory the client dashes off to examine the monster's nest but judging from her gloomy expression it seems she hasn't found what she came for in any case you have defeated the bird monster must now set sail to report back to the ocean city oh you returned he must have defeated that bird monster thanks to you the marines can continue investigating that lighthouse up here if all goes well the lighthouse will be on its way to serving its purpose soon well done everyone oh by the way this was found in one of the previous investigations i'd like you to have it triple script okay so yes you do get uh the um you get more scripts the first time you clear one of these fights so they are worth doing just if only just for those also you get more stuff for doing it which i will be doing as well because you get gear for doing these [Music] usually it's a weapon or a piece of armor so like redoing this one would get me uh one of kirikaze's things i forget i think it's her boots i don't remember but yeah basically literally the exact same question [Music] also uh the experience you get from these quests count as quest experience so therefore anybody with combat training does not actually get any experience from this unfortunately so yes uh what we got was a three strike for all to all enemies at random [Music] now you notice that i could put put it on one person like that and then just go into something else there's some cheesiness you can actually do with that like uh for example what if i put one cross slash on to reika and then have her use boonsheen then that technically counts as two of her with cross slash so she can still do it stuff like that or charge tactic or pretty much anything else like this so yeah you can get you can get pretty cheesy with that if you know what you're doing okay so the text is literally exactly the same so we just go beat it up again okay [Music] [Music] i have no idea what conditional drop is off hand honestly and yeah same flavor let's see you back safely after defeating the bird monster i have a message for you my humble thanks for all your help i'm i'm satisfied to have looked for the cowardly there don't worry the sea is fastened in the forest and the force is deep i'm sure she'll find what she seeks eventually oh and take this with you the client left it for you yeah a hood okay so head armor so you know if you're if you're able to do these early okay that's only three two luck i mean luck is nice because luck does affect status elements in fact looking ahead it doesn't look like luck always affects spines and stash ailments [Music] and so that would mean that it technically helps reika a bit oh she's already pretty fragile to begin with i'm not sure how well would actually help her so maybe that's not as terribly useful well if i did it earlier that would have been really good anyway we still got more quests from this [Music] well it's the same stuff stargazers man calling a man calling himself the zodiac of the fire of fire which is to be the stars from the top layouts but he and his father cannot fight the monster along i'll look to the stars and marvel at their power but we zodiacs have learned to harness it the choice of star is key and i'd like to view them from the top of the lighthouse to refine my skills [Music] now we have two people coming with us [Music] and travel to the scandalia lighthouse as you reach the top of the ruin light as you can enjoy bird monster glaring down at you especially why the brothers requested your protection now bravely take your weapons in hand and challenge the nightmare beating twins above you so yeah the boss is always the same for this one it's the same as the other ones you just have different party members that come with you or if you had co-op play you could actually do that but i have no means of actually being able to do that anyways [Music] [Music] order [Music] back [Music] it's not missing [Music] i think i need to block [Music] [Music] of course she gets confused oh thanks [Music] no whatever my strenuous efforts um to back you up paid off as the bird monster crashes down defeat my clients will be able to observe the heavens from your peace of mind thank you as you wave goodbye you return to your ship and report back to the city glad to see you back safely after defeating the bird monster i have a message for you thanks you were one step closer to becoming full-fledged astrologers with our research there you have it it's nice to see young people so driven by their goals hopefully you are too and this is also for you the younger are the brothers left as a token of his gratitude yes um if that's a book which i will be giving serious [Music] yeah i can't do this from here so once again because i will be needing use serious during this thing because the game really just had because there's a number of enemies with physical resistance unfortunately this is this trial presence from the north has come to the ocean city with their hoplite to take uh to take a royal trial she must defeat the monster to earn the throne my own sound is a kingdom part of the north our king is grand or general is bright our citizens noble however by royal tradition i must hunt a fierce monster display my strength will you help me so yeah now we got three people [Music] you can actually go oh we have to do back flying people so i guess it's right there because we already with the princess and their vassals in tow your ship finally reaches the lighthouse of the bird monster atop the lighthouse the bird monster spreads its wings and adopts a menacing stance clan's vessels quickly stepped before the princess forming a defense defensive phalanx for her in response you draw your weapons as well prince's valiant command echoes over the commotion and battle ensues do [Music] i'm sure my group's doing all the work you know what go for it charge tactic go overkill not needed but okay [Music] the party in the royal guards attacks punish the monster bird relentlessly and finally falls as you confront that the sea has followed the beast the princess rewards you all all for smile to report your victory you leave the lighthouse and set sail glad you are okay and that you've accomplished that request the princess left you a message thanks to all you we were able to defeat the monster however my battle has only just begun quite a valid part to say but i guess you'll be leading a kingdom someday she'll need your energy or vessels asked me to give you this to you they helped you make be able to make use of it howard space which i think yeah that's way better than what you guys it's oh it has ice damage that's nice or whatever so yeah that's that place that's not the last of them let's take a look at the next one [Music] i think it's this one i need to do for something influence the wildling claims these pieces are stronger than any other spruce designers okay that's it farmer and his wife know three young adventurers are found selling away and afraid that they're handing them over to guards they must meet the harvest monsters me at bar get drunk said be stronger than fish but may not need to drink to say that but they laugh me got mad me show them me and beast fight fish uh we need shift driver yeah that's around my character's levels i i prefer having more of my party members around because they're useful as you as you sail towards the trade city of batavia a severe tremor shakes the ship you stop and drop anchor damaging the water you see a shadow of countless monsters circling your ship you'll see behind the abnormal events threatening the trade city now draw your weapons and follow the wildling that charge into the swarm okay so you can see that there are some annoying monsters here i forget which ones do which be honest i don't want to use tpe too much because this is a this is not the only fight i think you fight three battles and then a boss or it's two thousand a boss it's something like that so i wanna try to avoid using too much [Music] okay my party's definitely much better than it was the first time i tried this [Music] [Music] before you can confirm the monster's remains have sunk into the sea a second wave attacks brace yourselves and confront the swarm monsters new threat yeah this is what i remember [Music] okay [Music] for me [Music] oh no yeah okay we should be fine we're not getting that much and they should recover most of my damage outside the fight as you defeat finally defeat the second wave monster you see a gigantic fish approaching fast wildland shouts a war cry before running towards the fish you must also muster your strength to join in on the attack here's our boss [Music] [Music] [Music] um [Music] okay i wasn't sure if charge actually counted for that wait no just putting charge on ourselves nevermind i can't i it's a case of i don't remember if charge takes up a fluff slot or not it does not okay [Music] i didn't want to have attack order push something off [Music] easy enough with the final desperate strike the gigantic fish falters and meets its moderate grade watching it sink the wildlings partner a roar to the heavens as proof of their strength you look around cautiously but batavia ce seems calm and clear there are no signs of monsters you wave towards the well-wishers who are reveling the glory of victory before setting hell again all right you came back in one piece you must have defeated swarm monsters next to you the trade along batavia i can see can flourish again free of monsters the main hindrances in the ocean city restoration is an important duty for you keep it up also this is a reward in honor of your appraised worthy deed take it as a sign of batavia's friendship breath i do not believe the thing is [Music] that is not [Music] that was not the thing i came here for [Music] sadly so we're on to another sequester i'm not going to do the other one i will do the other ones off screen stream because there's yeah off screen simply because i don't want because doing all three of these again is boring okay so it's probably here [Music] of fisherman drake ran out to fight the giant shark he listens to my warnings i'm the mayor of ayuda he may be a former pirate but now he's a fellow assistant please help him before the shark gets up he is 22 so he's stronger than my party [Music] you and the ex pirate client reached the commercial port of by utah on your ship just then you spout a gigantic dorsal fin protruding from the water as the circles are shipped there's no mistaking it this is the behemoth shark terrorizing eye taya the nervous tension in the air is broken when the figure is so large that obscures your vision rips the water you must join forces we've reclined to defeat the impending truck threat okay [Music] order [Music] um [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] um oh wow it's so healthy [Music] i did do this one a bit too early [Music] [Music] [Music] engine if i'm using am radios i'm about i'm going i'm getting to the point where i'm going to recover them anyways [Music] [Music] okay [Music] [Music] [Music] paralyzed [Music] [Music] there we go [Music] the surgeon combination of attack attacks of your party and the client finishes off the gigantic chart this shark is no long will no longer be a threat to ayutthaya your party and client wish each other good luck before setting sail back to portland marines tell me you managed to defeat the shark in niagara thanks to you the distance from armor to italia will feel that much shorter but hey if they share their ship with construction and expertise they may be in for a more comfortable voyages which reminds me this came from aita trying to make good use of it on your adventures that that right there [Music] hoo boy inferno script that's the good oh okay i didn't even know about this there's a time when the cu seas were not troubled by pirates back then not everyone recognized the sea as the dangerous place that it is but one man's rise of infamy and then the legend changed all that same family jolly roger began as a fisher fisherman for rapier and by the end he had sac cities across the world even after his deaths voices of those that fear him linger rumors of his ghostly ship attacking and living is not so far-fetched okay okay so [Music] do i have anything no all right right stuff on v1 right got a bunch of stuff i vaguely remember that sword for some reason please do confusion or something like that yes confusion which i think i put on rihanna for a long ass time because that helped out a bit [Music] that would be pretty nice [Music] that would be good for well it's like damage with lightning damage i mean elemental damage is always comfortable [Music] okay because i did use a couple of those i want to make sure before i head off and do other silly things okay i do have that i want to make a certain event i have one amrita which you know i will i can i can start getting those so you know okay okay so it's basically a case of who do i bring along with me obviously aedric has to come along faden's my main attacker rhiannon has a stay because she's my only healer reika and olga are characters that they can they can be here although it would be very good rica right now she's just okay izuna is basically her only real good skill to be completely honest aisha might i mean aisha and her and hanging could be very useful at this point i'm going to bring her along serious is an absolute yes because he's my spell caster and a lot of enemies are weak to elements in this place specifically ice and that it and that one thing i just got will make them an absolute monster good stuff [Music] because i did level them up a bit [Music] a little bit i mean they have stuff [Music] knowledge book yes yeah more tech more tp good stuff [Music] yeah i can bring them along for now unfortunately i don't have a means of actually being able to do certain things so so so what we want right now i would say let me look at the status tech tech is important says look at 16 [Music] so we're putting hellfire on rhiannon and serious because yeah it'll do a lot of damage especially when serious is super ready cross slash [Music] we'll try this party out for a while but i would like to vary my party a little bit at least [Music] and serious is definitely gonna have to stick around for a while for at least a second stride him he'll make the boss of this area it extremely easy to be honest okay okay undersea grotto same again unfortunately most enemies here are weak to ice [Music] okay okay i remember correctly these mostly just leave the treasures and i have to go up here in order to progress [Music] except for this spot which had absolutely nothing i guess [Music] these things are not super threatening though unless adrian decides to murder my party [Music] [Music] let me look at my notes real quick world puffer uh i don't know these things have a specific job oh they do ice [Music] [Music] you can potentially get levels faster potentially [Music] okay okay so what um he has it he has each of his stars which are important next we need to pump points into dark ether he probably will never use this skill i mean it's good skill it's a very cheesy skill too especially if you when you get uh sub classes [Music] basically once he gets that he can get this which is basically charge except with magic which that which like i mentioned before with cross slash yes this does stack of hellfire and then we combine that with aside from you know aside from stuff like uh you know fire mastery also stacking with increasing the damage of hellfire so long as he's the one who's cast it there's also this so they're weak to fire yeah you can kind of see where i'm going with how he does his stuff like he'll be doing absolutely insane amounts of damage and guess what the boss of the stratum is weak to fire [Music] so good stuff so series will be an absolute damage monster after a while once we get to that point anyways okay so [Music] okay we need to kill the world puffer first because i think [Music] [Music] [Music] rosa [Music] god damn it i hate it when that they can do that [Music] i was actually hoping that wasn't going to kill them but i guess they're not fired also he's not powered up yet [Music] [Music] i only have an actor too and i don't want to waste it on that [Music] it's cheaper it's cheaper to revive her and get more nectars than wasting a nectar 2 on something like that first off no i almost forgot about that [Music] okay thank you hopefully store that coupon for later because we'll be needing it later i just store the formal behind too because i don't have any use for that at the moment i can't even buy or make those yet [Music] for now i don't think you can ever get those back anyways because you only get those items once [Music] [Music] it's a decent increase what does it do hp oh hp increasing hp is always nice [Music] i can't equip any other types of hats oh he can't [Music] i guess i didn't give him the good stuff i mean that makes sense they kind of need the good stuff now because they're in the main party for now anyways [Music] save again because i'm paranoid", "bZA7EFVLvlE": "this is the beta double wall mug uh it's very lightweight um not sure about the thickness of this glass seems very thin uh compared to like an ikea ikea single walled one so this is like weighing at 253 grams you see here how hollow it is when you put it down this is an ikea glass it's at 239 so this is just nearly as heavy as that but you hear how this sounds when it goes on the quartz you hear this one definitely a lot more hollow with dinner", "WJzuX1R4nxI": "besides riding roller coasters and going to amusement parks one of my favorite things is coffee and today I'm going to share with you two of my favorite methods of making coffee at home my favorite way to make coffee in the morning is with my arrow press and I usually make an iced coffee and the arrow press is really nice because it's easy to use and it's also super portable so Tim and I when we go on vacation or whatever we like to just take this with us because it's super easy to travel with we also bring our electric kettle these come in a lot of different sizes so this one's nice because it's a little smaller and it's easier to travel with so I just turn on the kettle so I'm waiting for the water to boil so while I'm doing that I'm just gonna put a little bit of ice in my cup here depending on what size cup use you don't want to put too much ice in so I'm just gonna put five ice cubes in there and then I already have the attachment ready to go on the Aeropress here and I'm gonna put three scoops of finely ground coffee in here and I like to just kind of make it level and this is seven grams okay we also have a fellow prismo attachment and what that is is instead of the paper filters that come with the Aeropress it's a metal mesh filter that is reusable and you just rinse it off after each use so that eliminates the need for buying multiple paper filters and as much as we use coffee in this house that's definitely a better method for us so the water just finished boiling so I'm gonna go ahead and I make sure made sure I have all my I like to have all my ingredients ready because that one once the ice starts to melt I try to just get everything in there as quickly as possible so that flavor doesn't get messed up because when the ice cubes start to melt then it kind of messes up my perfect coffee ratio so I'm going to go ahead and sounds like the water has died down so I'm gonna go ahead and pour it in here now the Aeropress has numbers on it and they're right here you probably can't really see them but we've used this and washed this so many times it had like a gold foil on it and it's totally gone now I can kind of still see where the line is right there so you're going to want to fill it up to that line and then once I get it kind of close to that line I always stir it I might need to add just a tiny bit more water so I'm just kind of mixing up the grounds on top there and it looks like I need to add just a little bit more so right about there I'm just gonna rinse off my spoon roll it okay so now you are ready to use the plunger I always like to get the plunger just a little bit wet on the sides before I use it there's there's kind of a trick to this because you have to get the seal just right so once that's like that you just kind of lean in I always kind of use my my chin here and I'm not pushing really hard this cup makes me a little bit nervous because I usually use one that has a wider wider brim on it so you have to be careful that you don't knock your whole cup over and then you have to push the plunger down until you hear like the suction sound that's the sound and then you can carefully lift that up and turn it over if you don't hear that suction sound and you tip this over coffee goes everywhere I've done it a bunch of times so don't do that so now that we've done that you can see that the ice has pretty much melted already so I'm going to add just a little bit more ice in there and then our the ingredients will cool it down a little bit - but this is my oat milk I'm going to dump that in here and then I use the same amount sometimes they use a little bit less of the maple syrup because I'm trying to not have it as sweet bad in there and what the maple syrup you kind of have to give it a good good stir to get that all the way mixed up and then you have your delicious I don't know what I would call this it's just my my usual drink but it's really good and I will add more ice to super good my other favorite method of making coffee at home is a French press this isn't something we do all the time or as often as the Aeropress but I like it because it makes a really nice strong cup of coffee so we usually set our grinder to medium coarse when we're doing a French press and then our grinder automatically you can calculate - how many cups so when we do this we had it already set to 6 cups so this is already pre measured and ready to go so we can just put it right in the French press we like the French press because Tim and I usually share it so this is like the perfect amount for us to just have usually like a cup each and then maybe a little bit of a warm-up I sip on my coffee for like five hours and Tim's is done in like two minutes so he's usually done way before me but French presses also come in different sizes - this is perfect for like I said just for the two of us to have like a cup and a half but we also have another one that's makes even more cups and I've seen they even make little individual ones so maybe if it's just you at home and you just want to have you know a cup of coffee for yourself and not waste a lot of coffee I would say that's a good way to go and let's be honest I think you're gonna have a better cup of coffee with a French press then your little Keurig machines so just sayin so our water just finished boiling so I'm gonna go ahead and put the coffee grounds in here this just lifts off but I always like to just kind of tap it in this way because it makes less of a mess that way let's face it I make a lot of messes when I comes to coffee right about there and then our new trick from Alton Brown that we just watched a video of his on YouTube is adding a little bit of salt I know that sounds super weird I thought it sounded really weird but you can't taste it and according to him it takes the bitterness out of the coffee so gives it a smoother taste but we don't like better coffee to begin with so I don't really think that's a problem here but okay so we have our grounds in there so we're gonna go ahead and pour our water in and another method we've been doing is kind of stopping [Music] just a little bit of the way and creating a slurry just kind of mixing this up getting those grounds saturated and then once we add the rest of our water in we're gonna let this sit for four minutes so I'm just gonna set the timer here in a moment go ahead and pour the rest of the water [Music] I'm gonna set the timer for four minutes and now we wait times oh yay Coffee time so they say to press this down for like 30 seconds that feels like a really long time so I'm just gonna kind of gradually just do it kind of slowly on a side note with stirring when you're mixing the grounds up in there just be really careful I used a metal spoon but probably use a wooden spoon if you're gonna do that you need to be really careful up here with a metal spoon I've never had an incident but I've read lots of things about people cracking their French presses and the glass breaking so surprised that hasn't happened to me yet knock on wood but just be really mindful of that we can go ahead this is my favorite mug my Patrick Bateman mug we have a lot of mugs in this house but this one is is my favorite it's actually my second one I had another one and it got destroyed so I had to get another one [Music] it's good to go these are my favorite ways to make coffee both at home and on the road I'll leave a link in the description below of all the products I use today if you're interested I hope you enjoy your next cup of coffee you can find me on Instagram and Niki G does things and I'll see you in the next video", "pWKMTLOeaAI": "the best Roble burglar groans copy from coarse to fine quickly and efficiently with this strong durable stainless steel cutting blades it's compact modern design makes this space efficient grinder perfect for any kitchen the transparent lead allows you to monitor the grinding process the longer the grinds the fine of the grains the power cord can be tucked away beneath the grinder it's easy push-button control allows for a pulse or continuous grind enjoy", "J2KGqljzrFs": "and a knack for reviews he's the hungry hi everybody so today we're going to take a look at the bottom pour over coffee maker the one here is the a cup 1 liter 32 ounce model it includes a stainless steel filter and it's made from borosilicate glass which is heat resistant and tempered on the outside the box includes directions on how to make the coffee it's pretty simple since there is only 4 steps the bottom pour over includes many other colors the one selected here today is black but red green and white looks just as good so let's take a look inside you have the cover the reusable filter and the craf itself the filter is the stainless steel fine wire mesh it's different from the traditional paper filters the carafe has a plastic and silicone Colin this is how you will handle the carafe without burning your hands the collar is held on by tension there's some simple warnings on the bottom of the carafe it warned you to keep this away from children do not place on the stovetop and be careful with hot liquids so let's make some coffee the ratio I like to use is 68 grams 2,000 grams of water you could adjust to your taste another popular ratio is 68 grams of coffee to 1000 165 grams of water the coffee's ground at a medium course and I place it in a filter I'm going to treat this like a regular pour over so of course I'm going to bloom for 45 seconds after 45 seconds I'm going to start pouring water in small circles reaching my goal of a thousand grams of water this device works just like any other pour-over similar to the Chemex you let's take a look at the coffee so using the stainless steel filter you get a layer oils on top of your coffee many people enjoy this as it brings the extra layer of flavor there's also others that don't like the oils they associate the oils with bitterness or offsetting flavors it comes down to personal preference the stainless steel filter is normally additional cost it's nice that Bodrum includes it overall I enjoyed this pour over and I liked it when you get a chance please subscribe thanks for watching see you next time", "jG3FompIjGk": "i just posted the body adi video okay oh ooh i almost said booty oh no i don't want to show blue i don't want to do i want to show the booty okay are you really flying through my facebook there um he almost always knocks down that cat let's see is he gonna do it i feel like i'm waiting to see if the dvd thing will hit the corner no i think he's too far away oh my gosh the brightness cheese and cracker sarah what were we doing yesterday i haven't worn my hogwarts shirt in the longest um anyway i'm gonna do some editing today it's friday there has been something on this lens all week does it make a difference i took it off just enough but can you see a difference probably not um gonna do some editing today i have mostly just been editing like vlogs all week ah what so it's friday you'll probably see this on how well are you working sarah monday tuesday i don't know um i'm still not trying to do daily vlogs or anything but the kids get out a little bit early today i'm just chilling i'm gonna edit i'm gonna tackle some emails before the end of the weekend um like i said i posted that i posted a vlog today so i'm like kind of going through the comments and stuff right now um i have some plans this weekend i mean out like plans like some plans to like make hot chocolate bombs and stuff kiddos we might do that today so um oh my gosh my hands are so and so like i'm on the fence about putting my little nails on because i want to try them so bad but at the same time i'm like i'm gonna be digging in chocolate and doing all kinds of dumb stuff like do i really want to waste them you know because i got the nail tax ones on a sale and then obviously the claws by red one she sent those to me what i'm talking to myself how many of the people talking to the people anyway i don't know what the heck i'm doing but oh how pretty you guys follow the iconic girls on um sorry i'm moving again um moon no this girl though she's from out here and she bakes and she puts together these sick boxes and she sells like uh on last sunday she was selling fosole and then she does all these dope boxes like um i don't know if you can really tell but it's like so good um anyway i think she's doing them again this weekend right now she's been like making these cookies panda she's been making like she said she was making like two thousand she's just so fun to follow she's in this area so if you're like not in this area and you like food i would follow her anyway her name on instagram is ud cooks y-u-d-y cooks um her name's judy and uh i've had some of her stuff before like my friend would use her for um birthday parties and stuff like that i actually tried to get her to make nala's first birthday cake like that's how long ago i was like i found out who this person was and i was like damn girl good um so i just kind of silently follow her on instagram but i think this weekend i'm gonna try to buy one of those boxes if she does them again um because i'm buying some cookies from a local lady too easy crummy's the dough i have mentioned them many times mention her i don't know if it's one or two people but um i don't know how many people do it but i i have tried to at the very least in my desserts and stuff like that i've tried very hard to support like individual folks i mean like the bakeries are not doing great but like the people at home i feel like are being so innovative and like so smart you know what i mean like just making these moves so if you're a girl and you bake or you cook or you dip a strawberry or you make a hot chocolate balm or you do whatever it is that you do i'm holler at you girl cause i don't really eat it so i gotta share it with other people but um well my cousin does it now too my other cousin so my one cousin that i mention all the time her name is doris hi doris she's she's probably watching this she does youtube videos and a lot of her videos are in spanish too um so she doesn't love like home decor stuff and her stuff is really affordable so that's like her spin on it but it always looks so cute and then she like makes stuff and then she's pretty active on instagram too um but then now my other cousin who is actually her sister um she's in this area too and she makes uh like those hearts that you can bust into and she does like chocolate um strawberries and the oreos and all the sweets and then now she's also doing the hot chocolate bombs so i'm obviously i'm gonna try to make some this weekend but if that's a fail i'm gonna hit her up and see because i want the kids to be able to have them but you know like we're trying i'm trying to make it like a whole big thing almost like cookie baking but instead of that we're gonna make the hot chocolate bombs and then i'm gonna like disperse them i'm gonna give them out to people because i have a feeling we're gonna end up with too many and i want exactly one that's how many i want and i want my kids to have like maybe three or four over the course of the week but that's it guys oh she turned around good job freaking cat was sitting over there with her feet dangling off the thing i am in an uncomfortable position but i have myself all set up you can't see i have myself all set up with all the different nails i don't know which one i'm going to put on but i think i am going to go ahead and pop on the video and um try to put on these fake nails and see how it goes um i will say that the ones from claws by red are um not as arched which they they seem to fit my finger a little bit better but i've since i've never actually put them on and then the ones by nail talks are a little bit more arched um so like my nail beds like flat and it's like arched you know what i'm saying um so i don't know which one i'm gonna do yet but we're gonna see oh okay i got them on this is what i have left in the box so there's still a bunch in there um because these ones so my hands are not identical because and i will tell you why in a moment but these ones that are like full of the rhinestones they're thicker and they have the higher arch on them and so um i knew those were going to end up kind of bothering my nail unless i could flatten them a little bit and so i pushed down on this one and it did help flatten it quite a bit i pushed down on the other one though and i was using the um i was following the video i used the bottom of a nail hardener and um like a bottle and uh bad idea because i broke it so then i cracked the other one as well so anyway it seems like um the slightly bigger size fit this hand better than this hand anyway so clearly my nails are not like identical which is fine but i'm going to put these away and this was out of that set that like i said um she'd sent me from claws by red um i'm gonna see how this goes i did follow like i said i follow jackie's video pretty much to a t i didn't do the whole self-care thing not self-care the pamper thing with like the um olive oil and the scrub and all that but i think actually next time i will do that because i have all that stuff on hand anyway and plus i already have like little holes and everything that i have up here and all my little nail stuff um because i have since you know grown on all that um i definitely have done a lot more nail stuff on my own i was going to get them done like um before that and then i did acrylics briefly in the last few months but i just ugh i hate the upkeep i really do i hate that it's like oh okay they're growing out again and then i really like a lot of times i don't even like them that's what i love about these press-on ones is that you see the final product before it's even on your nail um so this is the final product and i think they look really good actually they're very similar to another set like i said that i had recently these two i did differently but i don't mind that because um this finger is just so heavily used um i tend to always like destroy it like it gets shaped differently and everything um but they're all on they're nice and they're like on the thinner side these are thinner than my usual acrylics which i really like because i hate the super thick nails so how long will they last i don't know i mean i did pretty much what i was supposed to do i am going to put a little bit of cuticle oil on the toughest ones to get on were the thumbs try to straighten it out but anyway this was cool my kids are going to be home any minute so i'm going to probably go chill with them i'll check in with you guys later i don't think we're going to make the hot chocolate buns today but that'll probably be the next thing that you see me do maybe we will do it today i don't know okay i promise you weren't gonna see me again but i got a package from sephora and i had to re-glue like the thumbnail it was already giving me trouble like this one nail um but i had to go pee which meant i had to wash my hands which meant i had to add water and sure enough it loosened itself up so um i did like i said it was already giving me trouble so a package from sephora you guys want to see what's in there um i ended up buying that really expensive i'm not gonna say overpriced because i've never smelled it so i don't know but that really expensive like perfume i think it's by killian or something like that um steph and the sml exo had posted it and uh i would say generally i trust her scents like you know she talked about perfume and i like that trust her sense um so it it's like always sold out and i was like there's gotta be a reason this is always sold out and so it came back in stock sold out immediately again but i got one right i hope fingers crossed i don't know i don't know if it ship yet or not that's what i thought was in here no this was a previous order that i made um and i forgot why i did it i think i had a good coupon or something so i ended up getting another clinique take the day off um balm or take the day away whatever this is whatever this is called but this is my favorite like makeup balm and it's legit like it's just a nice thick little balm and it just removes your makeup it is my favorite it's just so expensive that i don't like to buy it oh i got a couple of little samples of perfume that's what i ended up i like doing perfume samples because i love perfume um let me just smell this one libre but you've seen a little wrong hello okay so this is the burberry blossom for her that smells good this one smells like gonna give me a headache though but that you've sailed around one um and libra that i'm smelling pretty good and then i also got my regular old hourglass veil retouching fluid this is the the fluid or the concealer or whatever that i'm always using is this even focused i don't know sorry i'm so far away i can't actually see it but it's it's 34 i believe and i like i mentioned before i have yet to find like a good dupe for this which is why i have purchased this so many times because i wear it all the time when i want to look nice but i don't want to put on makeup this i got with my insider points i have a ton of points and i never use them but i saw this and i was like oh that's interesting because i did recently throw in my clear sonic since it stopped working um and this is just a little like face scrubber thing i guess okay so it looks like this one side has all these little like bristly things and the other side is like crazy this is so soft and i assume there's a battery or something how do you turn it on hey guys i don't know how you turn it on but it's like a little facial scrubber what's up children and then i got these little slip um scrunchies which are apparently all the rage everyone and their mom online talked about them and so i was like i'll try them out but they're wildly expensive they're forty dollars for a six pack of scrunchies which is like insane but supposedly is your hair tied tough on your hair oh that's what it says pure silk skinny scrunchies so i've seen multiple people talk about these now and i was like ah all right let me try them out um the hair tie i have in today is awful it's one of those overly tight ones well i do love the stretch of this already i mean i wonder how long it'll stay though let's see a good hair tie goes around three times keeps it in there but doesn't apply tension oh so far wonderful so this is the makeup eraser it just says erase all makeup with just water we'll see this is must be a miniature one right i've never bought one of these before but since it was free with my points i assume it's a mini um that's all i have in here but i just thought i would chew these boys and i'll let you know how it goes i'm gonna keep this little perfume it smells good hey bug you want a tiny perfume bottle nala i'll give this to my daughter finally get the molds we got the little ones for two inches and the big ones are two and a half inches we've got good and gathered vanilla and they just call this chocolate i don't know if it's milk dark semi-sweet i don't know what it is they just call it chocolate so it's not that fancy white baking chips and fillers cute little candies for the top got some slightly fancier chocolate we decided to get fancier on the second go around a bunch of sprinkles and cinnamon and then two things of peppermint one regular marshmallow some stuff so we don't have to eat all of this and we can send them away and then a whole bunch of a whole bunch of whole bunch of hot chocolate white chocolate mint chocolate peppermint hot chocolate willing participants [Music] willing participants that's what we're doing [Music] i like food that's sweet so we're just going to melt the chocolate line it in here throw it in the freezer and then we'll get back to you it's going right yes numbers all right so we did two layers and we made sure the edges were as thick as i don't even know oatmeal right and this stuff is coming right out i will say there's like a little thing hanging on bug there's like a little flat part yeah so that's just the mold i mean that's not really a big deal can i try popping one out mom um wash your hands again and i just wash my hands you did that straight up from the bottom but kind of catch it let her do it and then go ahead and put it down do another one yes yes yeah there's a whole nother set maybe we should just wait till we get them all done huh and then do them all at once man you guys are awesome go ahead and put that down what do you have to do with these even so [Laughter] is that we'll put yeah what's going to happen well we have to see which ones no that's too big okay we have so we have the minis the minis are a lot smaller yeah here this is the first set that we got these are definitely going to be they're like teeny tiny by comparison these are going to be mini bombs yeah these are only um two inches and the bigger ones are two and a half but it was really hard to get the right size like amazon was playing with my life some of these are like they have a lot of extra you're gonna have to pop that off like because otherwise this is um i mean we can fuss with it when we have something hot to smoothly pop it but yeah i kind of feel like we should do all of them and fill them all at once and you know what i mean like yeah so we'll do the milk chocolate ones next is it worth your patience i don't have that much patience i know we're working on that because it's not good to not have patience yeah life is not a race i i kind of i don't know i would maybe sometimes with some things i would agree with some things okay so i'm gonna clean these molds up and then we're gonna get back to it i will say we use a lot of chocolate right we used an entire one of these but the white chocolate and we used half of this bag yeah so we used all of this which is how much 16 ounces plus half of a 10 ounce bag so we used about 20 ounces okay and we saved some of this for the topping or whatever but that was what 20 ounces of chocolate for six minis and six big ones oh no this one has a little fuzz in it that's great well we're not gonna eat this one but if we break another one then that'll be fine because i told you like but they like little hair and fuzz and stuff wants to stick to these little silicone things so it probably came off one of our shirts or something um oh it must have been mine because it's good yeah well do you see it well we we're not going to use this one but i'll eat most of that oh you see it's like right at the bottom i tried i tried to make sure there was none in there i'm sure it just happened while we were holding your arms but it's all good all right i'm gonna clean these up we're gonna do the milk chocolate the exact same way okay we ended up using the cupcake pan with little cupcake liners and i'm heating up a plate because they're gonna use that to you know um put the half circle on and kind of even out the edge and then i'm going to be working on the milk chocolate [Music] is this it looks good yeah what's that one white chocolate white chocolate white marshmallows and sprinkles i'll do i'm gonna do beans yeah we have a couple of options this is the mint cocoa this is the white chocolate this is a peppermint one from trader joe's and then we do have a regular one but it's in a bag so if you do just want to do regular one two bug and i'm heating up the milk chocolate and jaden's listening to the loudest tv ever right over there aren't you going to help with this one jay no i'm tired oh you're tired you just want to be here for the end result lovely and this is how you do it [Music] that looks great isn't it crazy how perfect they come out oh yeah yeah and then um if for some reason like they're not lined up it's super easy to just kind of seal it with with uh chocolate later and then cover it with like sprinkles or something we took a picture so we remember what flavor these all are and i am starting to fill the mess one of those super i would not be giving that impression based on how many things she's popping into her mouth over here i like white chocolate not i i don't like white chocolate i literally tried everything i have tried every single thing and thrown every single thing into my mouth so it's pretty easy to do these you just kind of put it in there and make sure that you're covering the sides and it's like kind of a little labor of love we're doing like two layers and then freezer and then another layer and that it really only takes like i can't imagine we're leaving it more than five minutes in the freezer yeah and then boom little perfect ball okay that one um let me see if i want to add oh sorry you could put a little uh the little like quarter things a little candy one so somehow we have to remember what these ones are what what do you have bug i don't know i forgot what i even put in them well how are we going to know how to top them well just make sure none of them were like what was that one now what you've only made two bug what kind of chocolate was in that one you can just kind of smooth it out with your fingers yeah [Music] of course what a time to be out oh [Music] is that one done now what is in that one um white chocolate with every single one of the toppings so let's try to like keep them straightforward if they went to a walmart don't go there [Music] something else on there though what should we put on there um chocolate marshmallow this could be like a smaller one you could put two like other marshmallows okay and then the next one looks like it's all kinds of colors so we'll just oh but this one has regular chocolate in it okay yeah let's cover him in it yeah let's come with you oh god this is just that one jesus's cup of marshmallows okay but like once it's in a cute little container you want to put a reese's cup on that one too [Music] let's put a reese's i mean uh marshmallows see what sticks it it dries so quickly thank you and just blow it out let it chop it on my shoulder some you have some glue need some glue right here too some glue this is honestly not a one-man job no especially that one little shop coming at you yeah we need some glue where y'all okay i don't know who's in these ones do you guys want to know um so chocolate or not which one is chocolate this one means um i'm gonna put no which one's peppermint i think this one is these are the ones that got closed so okay then okay then let's get the peppermint stuff can you get ready on the peppermint i'm gonna go with chocolate chocolate chocolate chocolate peppermint peppermint peppermint peppermint peppermint peppermint all right next what do we got next um this one is white chocolate so let's add white chocolate on this one so not okay okay so i need the ones that do need it so okay so that one was this one this one looks very chocolate here you look at what's inside of it and now you tell me what you're putting on

this is confusing all right looks great let's do the whites the white chocolate okay because like half of those are gonna have white chocolate are we done with this i think we're done with this good enough okay look at it i get one more chance oh my gosh she gave you the dirty marshmallow well you gotta [Music] haven't you gotten one yet now so we're almost done uh my worker's distracted oh my god chocolate all right guys we have the milk going we have all of our minis they came out so cute and then we have all of our big boys over here and they look adorable this was a labor of love took about three hours two to three hours for all of us with a few of us doing it but moment of truth will be when when we dunk them in let's see how they pop open over here i heard she did her first tick tock i love that everyone's so excited the vlog family no i don't okay mom's gonna do it she's gonna you got the video going yeah that looks like i'm a professional you've never done supposedly two professional vloggers here oh okay that makes sense okay so well ideally yeah i know it takes a minute give it a second let it i think it's burping oh i forgot this one is like doubly sealed as well yeah man it's gonna go okay drink it it's drinking it oh it's gonna pop open it's gonna pop oh i think it already caught up oh my lighting is all off i can only do so many of these things at one time you take yours okay grandma okay okay hang on one second do you need more hands that's what i know raw milk how does it taste like by going upstairs you missed me eating like 20 pounds of calories well not tick-tock this is not going to be pretty darn this for my old my og's on instagram all right so this is a mini one for my mom i made [Music] i mean i feel like the white chocolate is going to be harder to like to see oh and to see that's a great point oh i feel like he bubbled open right yeah i saw him i think he burped he's like an alligator okay i think he's open yeah i think he is hopefully he had marshmallows in him now it's popped open so cute i know we're gonna do one for jay now it's all pink since there's a marshmallow sure what i have in here oh who knows oh so that's the one with everything in it okay but like if it was perfect all right this is jaden's he can go ahead how close am i too close to you oh nice that's okay you should have seen what it looked like down here it might have dissolved bug the idea is for it to dissolve open oh yeah oh i like the james is floating yeah so some of them just break open and then all the little marshmallows pop out oh there he goes he's getting everything in there oh oh this one's great i love when the marshmallows come to the top you know right now is she oh yes but that's what we're doing right now this looks perfect now you want to stir it around and let it melt that is perfect perfection my mom got vaccinated right i got vaccinated i've covered free tell the people what you think 95 this one is delicious i'm at the vaccine this is this is gonna have to go in the title now yeah how do you feel about it [Music] i was nervous but and i'm glad i did it yeah did you if anything i'll take one for mankind but i will say i got a tiggly tug oh no she'll get a set she'll still get the second dose though right yeah that's pretty cool well we're in the hospital so when is the second dose in three weeks oh that's not bad and you guys are all giving it to each other right oh yeah oh each other's little tests there are six there's six doses in each vial in case anybody wants to know oh yeah wait what does that mean when that little fizer box oh so we're getting the pfizer ghost i guess there's six doses and you gotta keep it super cold right that's what i saw that are you jealous is the question after she took it she hasn't had any side effects other than she's had to pee a lot and she got really hyper so i'm pretty sure she's like water it was actually just a cup of coffee okay we didn't really explain the joke so i just wanted to pop on in case anyone was confused there uh the day that my mom got vaccinated which she did truly have those um side effects the tingling and everything and her friend did have the side effects as well but um hers were worse um because she i think like she said she had a i think her lips and stuff got swollen um but the reason we were talking about the coffee was because that day my mom also had a coffee and it was just a joke that my mom had to literally get up to go pee like 14 times afterwards so had nothing to do with the vaccine for anyone who actually cares you know what i mean it had to do with the fact that my mom decided to have a coffee eight o'clock at night which is a big no no how is it delicious like it's not wonderful great great i'm excited we're doing the same thing i'm gonna have to do one too i didn't realize how much milk i boiled what was that thing you said i was saying this is some really tasty stuff he didn't say that it was genuine it was more genuine before i know i know i know i didn't i didn't have the camera on they are look what the sugar works bill murray proves these are super good and none of ours were the same yesterday are you watching guys these are so good highly recommend overfilling with everything you can think of this is next level we're gonna do this all right i got a package today in the mail

holiday love your friends and fam at ftm well i saw a video where somebody ripped them out of your fingers like [Music] [Applause] oh okay so while i was actually opening the package i wasn't listening to what jason was saying and so it's not until now that i'm re-watching it that i'm hearing that he's talking about that video oh and it makes my skin crawl of the acrylic nails getting pushed all the way into the finger and it's like a fake hand or whatever right i am assuming and it's like all over the internet or whatever and it's like men reacting to it because they don't know how how acrylics work and so now i'm just hearing jason talk about it and i wish i had been paying attention but like it was super hard to open these frames i kid you not i spent like 25 30 minutes opening these boxes so um i'll show you obviously what's about to happen and it is gonna end as soon as i show you guys the frames the video ends so i do hope that you enjoyed it that we got a couple

"good morning everyone this is Cornel dame from japonica's at fitting in here today I'm going to talk about the features and benefits of the Bona Dea let's jump right into it we're actually going to use mighty egg today I've had this for about three years and as you can see it's still in great condition the cool thing about this thing is that it's got a nice stainless steel durable design is dishwasher friendly you've got the silicon grip here you know perfect for the retractable infuser there but also it's resistant so when you put this in your glass and it gets a little warm your fingers won't burn because of the silicon grip okay it's got the nice large infuser I think you'll probably take comfortably I was a teaspoon and a half of teeth and it only works on some teens I mean if the tea is really fine it's not going to work quite as well because the holes are a little larger so it's great for loose leaf teas beyond that it just makes bro agency easy and so I think it's a perfect gift for Christmas or what have you and we sell for about $10 on our website modem itself sells about 1250 so if you're interested and you'd like to learn more about it please visit us at believable and we'll see you there have a good one", "aoM0-_vVRcQ": "you yes welcome to hello to review today I'm at our these artists League Bistro grilled chicken burrito this one contains no GMO ingredients chicken raised without antibiotics no artificial colors or flavors and 18 grams of protein bought these for 250 at Kroger so if you have a Kroger need to fund they're made with organic cheese tortilla and vegetables it is 340 calories for the entire burrito there's a list on the since I've posted all the different organics now organic Monterey Jack cheese black beans has water long grain parboiled rice organic Tim atomic pillows onions 22 or 2% less of those things so most thing rinse in here are supposed to be okay so you can do this in the oven if you want and there's the directions if you want to do the oven of course we don't do the oven we're doing the mark plate so we're going to remove the breed out from the package place breed on my microwave safe place for just geese paper plate with flap side facing up microwave bread out for one minute flip the bread out over flat side down and microwave for an additional 55 seconds and then let it sit for a minute before you eat it looks like every other burrito you see in your life I'll take you out of the package because flat side up for a minute flip it over 55 seconds and then it's ready so I'll be back once this comes out of the microwave okay here it is other microwave and I let it set for a minute and then I cut it just let it cool off and so I can show you what it looks like inside and you can see there's a lot empty space in there but you see chicken and beans nice in there yeah this sides a little fuller than the other side part take a bite out of this side so imma let this sit and cool off her man I mean that hey just give you a close-up that's the take a bike run out of this bottom corner right here let's a little spice to not not sit your mouth on fire spice but there is all just a touch of the tingle insurance from those tomatillo yeah I don't see anything else then here that would necessarily be wrong hot unless it was a spice on the chicken but that's really good I actually get more of that peppery tomatillo flavor more than anything the chicken is really good it's really good and tender because one of those peppers right there that's got a good Southwest kind of flavor to it actually you know it's really full of flavor and the black beans are are not overpowering I mean you want that sell blood beans have that it's it's cooked so it's soft is I don't really like hard but the black beans that are hard these are soft kind of like a pinto bean and the flavor is not too bad either that's really good I love the little peppery spiciness to it and once he is there's a far bit chicken in there there's chicken pretty much been in every bite um I really like this so if you're if you're looking for something that's organic in nature and it doesn't have GMOs and all that stuff and you're looking for a decent breakfast burrito this one's really good I really like this one I wouldn't mind eating this one the tortilla is organic but it's it's got a you know it's not gluten-free or anything it's got a really good flavor to it a good texture everything about it's pretty good so I'm actually gonna give this one a four I've had a couple other ones of these and they were okay this one has a ton of flavor to it so I really like the amount of flavor and the textures are good and yeah this is one I would probably buy if I was interested in all the organic stuff that being said but it's 250 so if you want a cheaper burrito and you're not worried about the organic stuff then you'll probably be able to just eat one of the cheaper ones would be fine so but yeah I'm gonna give it a 4 I love the flavors the textures everything about it it's pretty good so hope you enjoy this video thanks [Music]", "JrUZDddevWY": "what's up guys mr.

buh-bye", "B2CvzzaE3rc": "heavily playing off nostalgia but great for anyone who drinks coffee or tea comes the set of four stackable Gameboy coffee mugs hey Nintendo fans and collectors lithium here from my channel Nintendo collecting this set of four coffee mugs comes in four colors and obviously I'm a sucker for anything that is Nintendo branded or themed and I thought hey these are on sale I'm going to pick them up so the sale price that I got these for was $17.98 specifically but they're normally $40 where I am sometimes they're around $35 but wait for these to go on sale because once like you get these for less than $20 or about $5 a mug I thought it was worth it specifically these are 15 ounce mugs and they're 444 milliliters is what they hold so you already saw the side shows you all the colors on it what you need to know about these is on the back this says hand wash only do not soak and do not microwave and they're actually trademark of Nintendo as of 2016 so these are not new to this year so let's open these up there's no seal on them or anything like that which is good and bad I'm wondering if I can get this to open without damaging the box too much I'm not sure if I'll keep the box for this I usually do keep the boxes so you have the mugs in here with a little bit of hardware to with some plastic inserts let's just take the mugs out what's great about these mugs is that they are stackable so I didn't know that at first when I was looking at them in the store and they are stackable which is really neat so these are huge my first impression is they're way bigger than I thought they would be let's just take a look at one of these so you have the Game Boy Color specifically going around this mug and I'm wondering if we can see any seams or anything like that and really you can't it's really it looks like it's well put on these are huge there's a little bit of like dirt in this one or something but I think we're good to go there stress these are giant mugs so on the bottom it has all that information all over again which is a nice reminder do not microwave Gameboy this looks like it's funky I think just funky it says it's an official Nintendo licensed product like I said 2016 hand wash only do not so 14 years plus it says specifically here but it is made in China unfortunately so these look really well made the handle on them I think you're gonna be fine and the best part about these is like it said they're stackable you a little bit of a ridge here at the bottom so you put one on top of the other if that's what you're looking to do you can stack them all the way for high if you were interested let me just move the camera up while we do this so for high and they look they're actually pretty sturdy I don't think they're gonna fall over because all that little lip that's in here so if you want to stack them four high you can if you want to stack them just to I you can do that as well and either way these look really cool in my collection but they're even going to be better to use now side note I actually don't drink coffee that often I might have a cup of coffee once a month when I really needed at work but in general I'm not a coffee drinker my wife and I both don't drink coffee we don't often drink tea however our friends always do so whenever we have a party or a Mario thon or some sort of gaming event people eventually do want coffee and now I can offer it to them in some sort of Nintendo themed Cup which is pretty cool comment below what's your favorite color on this set of four personally I like the green one reminds me of the Green Ranger for some reason even but most of my friends are gonna probably say blue my wife wait might say red and hey if you're a fan of The Simpsons I guess yellow might be your thing really cool how Game Boy had all the different colors and it's smart of Game Boy Color to be used here and not just the original Game Boy that was great let me know your thoughts on these stackable set of four and what price point would be good for you to buy these at if any or if you would just wait for them to go on discount for like $5 or $10 I'm not really sure if they go much less than 20 in my area thank you so much for watching the game boy set of four stackable coffee mugs they're 15 ounces four hundred and forty four milliliters and comment below your thought on

we reduced the shipping and handling you guys asked for a little help on the shipping and handling we're doing our best and we did it for this so anna everybody anna how many people have asked you if we were going to launch this eventually well it has well it you know it just came out right it just like there was just a little hint about this on the 11th of march and people have gone crazy suzanne what's so great is that qriket once again raises the bar makes it easy for us to craft makes is us look professional makes it easy well actually puts us in business i mean puts us in business now suzanne i'm going to show you this up close all right look at this very professional monogrammed mug porcelain ceramic all right not going anywhere completely dishwasher safe i have prepared one because i need to put it in my mug press so let me do that so that we can actually create our design while we are watching today all right so here's what's happening i put it in it's actually surrounding the mug and the infusible ink is being infused into the ceramic surface on the top of the machine it's plugged in everything's plugged in and it gets really really warm a lot like your cricut easy press and it's going to go through a series of dots and it's going to let you know just like the easy press it's going to actually beep when it's finished so i'm going to back up rewind to the cut that i made on the little joy with the infusible ink and what we need to do is take away we're going to weed we're going to use that weeding tool that came with the cricket joy maybe you already have this you're going to take away the excess material from the this is actually this is an amazing project because in design space right now we have let me just show you um when we go to all categories and we type in mug press watch this there are so many projects ready to go right now right here in a way that we can choose uh you know caffeine caffeine club or you make something specific for someone your design here you you put your own beautiful spin on the mug but that this is how it's going to work says because the design space uh the the everything about this with the infusible ink it's actually going to cut the shape that goes around the mug and as we're waiting on this one what we did ahead of time today just to show you and then we made it a little difficult because we used the heat transfer tape that you can buy on the hsn website because you want to keep it together as we're as it's going like a machine so cool and look at this okay so this one guys that's permanent yes this this is going you know i'm double l's now and um now you can act you know what i should make y-a-l-l y'all um and have a whole set of mugs for my southern miss nna would be funny yes yes and you just one of the things like when you start to think about being able to do this suzanne i mean making something as unbelievably professional looking yes as say this cute little mug with the little bunny you see the little bunny's face just in time for easter i swear this looks like something you would have bought in a fancy store now my machine is still going over here for anna and wait anna can you hang on one second let me just go over all the extra goodies with it because i know you've got more demos since we're waiting on the machine um so let me show you what we have okay from qriket you can get the additional goodies to be able to do so many cool things for example we've got the mugs now they're very specific mugs you just can't use any old ceramic mug they have to have a sublimation um kind of coating on them and ours do and here's your choice of the set of six 12-inch mugs or 12-ounce mugs or look at these guys i love them the set of 15-ounce mugs they will both work in the same machine so if you need mugs and remember it's not just you can't go to the dollar store and get a ceramic mug you have to have the sublimation coating which you can't feel you would never know it to be able to do this whole process so there's your mugs okay now come over to this side because this is really really cool all the vinyls remember that plaid that buffalo plaid she just showed us we have a set of six vinyls they're designed to work in your joy machine if you'd like them to you can freehand cut them whatever you want to do you get a set of these plus she was talking about that heat tape you get 52 feet of the heat tape that's included in this bundle okay and this bundle is called the infusible ink transfer sheets and 52 feet roll of the heat resist tape so there's your item number if you want to do all this crazy fun stuff now there's another special thing too is you can actually use the in infusible pens p-e-n-s pens we have two different sets we have the fine point infusible pens that are 30 count and then we have the medium point so what happens is now you're going to be able to create your own artwork using your maker or using the joy and letting it drop let me ask you a question anna will these work in the joy or only in the maker the infusible ink pens will work in the explore family of products forward to the maker and then there are um special pins for the joy so that's what you're just showing is for any of the explorer machines i actually have um right they they look like this as well and what's really neat that was a great segue suzanne because i'm just going to show you what happens when you actually color okay and so i have the in i have copy paper all right and so i used the the my maker to draw at this beautiful e in reverse okay and then we take the infusible ink pens and we color in the details okay this can be any color from the pen and you can just you can use the the black pen in the machine to draw the design but then you can color in this it comes you get the little butcher paper to go over it and when you wrap your mug okay so you've wrapped your mug with the butcher paper and your copy paper with the transfer and you see what happens is that we get the infusible ink transfer just like we do on the t-shirt on the cosmetic bag on all the things infusible ink okay so that's the that's the trick okay that's the part that we have to really pay attention to that we have a special coating on the ceramic just like the infusible ink coaster set that hsn.com has the mug set has that same coating so that it accepts the infusible ink it is now part of the surface which and again remember that's permanent guys you don't it's not going to peel off it's not going to you know how when you're using let's say just a vinyl you know those are great i do a ton of things with just the heavy duty vinyl but now this will never peel off it'll never scrape off it's literally permanently embedded into the mug when you use it it's incredible so again if you're picking up the pens we have a set of 30 each one's thicker one's thinner all you have to do is use those to color them in and you do use copy paper which i love that feature so let the machines either one draw your pretty picture then you just color them in and then infuse it on the mugs and again this has been one of the most requested items because everybody got a hint of it as anna was talking about and i've been asked so many times when we were going to finally launch it we've got it guys you don't have to go to a store you don't have to hope it's there we've got it right now for a limited amount and a limited time and remember nobody has five flex pays and we even reduce the shipping on this so if you want to make just that gift i mean who doesn't love getting a mug for the teachers for family for friends for your you know book club people for whoever it might be you're gonna buy this once and you have years and years and years of creativity by getting it but don't miss out we do expect this to actually sell out and i have to be honest i was i'm always honest i was thrilled to get into the show tonight because we did not wait to feature it on a day three months from now we thought you know what let's put it in the show and get it out there we're the only ones to give you five flex pays that's a big deal because you don't have to plunk out 200 right now you're gonna spread it over five months use any major credit card even paypal it's basically forty dollars and only five dollars shipping anna did you have you had a blast with this since you got it i really have it's just sent me into a creative frenzy i mean thinking we just saw in the video paulie the plant i actually have paulie and i have the the little mug and it's done on both sides but while we were um waiting our mug that we put in i just want to say this is you know this is a just a few minutes process and i'm using okay i'm using an actual pot holder too the the handle is pretty cool but the mug itself is really really warm so what you want to do is don't don't go and peel off the wrapper just when it comes out put it on your easy press mat or something protective put it over and let it cool completely because once the once this is all finished you really want to just be careful because we are working with heat so just look suzanne when you think about infusible ink right those of us that have used infusible ink many many times in lots of different ways three colors of infusible ink on this mug right that's great is this i love you love you does he love me love me not i'm not sure but you get it right then you get think about the teachers that are in your life that you want to um to make something special for or i when i was growing up one of the things that was really fun for me when we were on vacation was going in a store and going to the rack of all the personalized things and my name was never there and so now you can actually make the entire name for the person that's in your life you can like we started experimenting look at this with um the our anna griffin designs in uh in design space like what would it look like as a as a coffee mug done with infusible ink this is with the pink lemonade so you see it's ombre so the pink lemonade infusible ink is my favorite and again remember we've got that what she just worked with we actually have here as well so just you can see it these are our ink sheets and tape you get 12 of the four by and a half by 12 inch of usable ink transfer sheets you're going to get 52 inch roll of the heat resist tape that's how she taped it together so all of this comes together for the for the um we're talking 34.95 and with five flex it's only seven dollars now remember grab the infusal pens because you can use either any of your machines to draw a black image on copy paper just regular printer paper right and then color it in and then use the press to see the magic happen you really are going to be so excited about that and if you don't have the correct mugs we have a six pack of the 12 ounce or the 15 ounce available you cannot use a regular mug from the dollar place you know what i mean it has to have a substrate that you don't even feel nor do you see it on here but it must have that to be able to embed the ink permanently into the mug you just can't use a regular mug just to make sure we're clear on that because i don't want you to goof up your first mug and go what happened it didn't work but here's your chance to get it we're the only place that has five flex pays we reduce the shipping down to five dollars to make it even more affordable for you and with flex pay you spread those payments out over five months but you get it right away and you know i do i agree with you anna i think it's going to be one of those things that and you can get there's the substrate mugs you'll you can get tons of those you can buy them by the case if you want to right i think people are just going to love this and when you start thinking about all the things you can personalize you know it's the wedding it's the mom and dad gift it's you know what st patty's day was someone's name on it i mean there's so many fun things you can do with this right and maybe the art teacher is named miss jenna and she gets her own mug because it's spattered with infusible ink paint i just think that what is so fun about this is the how permanent this is when we're thinking about going from what we know as infusible ink right weeding away our cuts so this this little moon we're going to wrap this around the mug okay it's going to go in the mug press and then we'll press the button it will actually we'll just press the lid down to start the timer on i don't have one in there but it'll start the timer on infusing the ink into the surface and what's so incredible that in just a few minutes right with the worth of patience and time you have a completely custom permanent gift right this is something that's going to go in the dishwasher it's going to go with you you're going to i mean just to see the face of the person that receives your first mug the one that you dreamed up the one that you cut with the cricket joy or the one that you know the one that you made with them in mind right that that is where i mean that's a that's the most memorable thing that you can do for someone is to personalize it for them and now qriket's made it so easy for us to get a professional result on something that to me is so impressive that i just can't wait to make more and again guys um if you can stay on the line if you want to go to hsn.com you can grab it really quickly and you can order it right now if you'd like to only because i don't want them to sell out on you and we only got kind of a limited amount it's not like we brought in 5 000 for the day we literally have just a small amount available and we've got that five flex which totally makes it so much easier on your pocketbook and then you can be creative and have so much fun with it the mugs are available the markers are available these are great because you know you can use your qriket machine any of the machines and they will do a black drawing for you and then you just color everything in or whatever color drawing you want and then you color it in using these so i don't think you have to worry too much about which machines you're going to work on although these are designed to work on any of the cricut makers and that side of the world and then of course don't forget about these great infusible uh rolls plus the heat tape too all right anna i gotta say goodbye to you for now what a fun surprise thank you for joining me again this week you're welcome suzanne i'll be back next tuesday with you at 8 00 pm for the full hour we got a whole bunch of stuff left too so stick around thanks guys thanks anna all right don't forget coming up next hour we're going to

[Music] lovely mug to use even though I was sent the wrong color I ordered the volcanic orange but they sent me cerise I kept it anyway as the color is just as nice though it's definitely more of a red than a cerise solid keep the heat well be easy and comforting to hold however had to get used to the handle as the shape is a little different from other mugs I've got I will order some more in the future and take advantage of the offer on them which is a good value offer the color of the mugs makes quite a statement it's classic and iconic Furla crusade I have the teal mug and this orange
