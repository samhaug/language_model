Gerst Meyer who is one of our workers and one of the mail readers here at miracle Valley sister Berthe Park we want to consider together some of the promises of God upon which the answers to prayer or the prayers that we pray over these requests are based the Word of God says there one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ the law of Christ is the law of love and Jesus said that he gave himself for us because he loved us and God loves everyone this morning he loves you he wants to meet the needs of your life this morning and God is standing ready to meet the needs of every individual who will receive his word he said call upon me and I will answer you and we have an abundant evidence here in miracle Valley that when we call God has answered and Jesus is walking in our midst this morning and he is saying I love you this morning I am ready to hear your calls this morning I want to read to you from the Word of God from James the fifth chapters at the fifteenth verse and it says the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed and the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much I'm so glad that that is God's word this morning that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and we are expecting our faith in God to reach out this learning to reach all around this world to avail much for the kingdom of God over in the Book of Isaiah in the 59th chapter it says that this is the fast that is acceptable to God that we should undo the heavy burdens that we should break the bands of wickedness and that we should let the oppressed go free that is the purpose this morning of the prayers over these requests in miracle Valley that we would undo the heavy burdens that we would bind up the broken heart that we would heal all six bodies and that soul should be delivered from the oppression of Satan we not only consider the privilege to pray over these prayer requests but we know that God answers prayer coming now is sister Boyington and she's going to read us a couple of prayer requests and some testimonies of how God answers prayers in these morning devotions sister Boynton from China don't North Carolina brother Alan my little granddaughter that was

another fabric of clothes from Baltimore Maryland what while beings were listening to one of your recordings on miracles of deliverance she spoke of a woman whose husband was being delivered from alcohol through placing a deliverance cloth in his shoe unknown to him he worked all day and never felt like taking a drink you also added that if anyone was listening to you them they could write for Vaughn and God for deliver him and his own home at that time I spoke to drank very heavy although I always tried to give it up but still never did many times I would throw away my cigarettes and sail

later I received it I wrote it for it in my shoe as I heard you said the woman there to her husband before long I noticed the cloth wasn't in my shoe anymore and best of all the desire for smoking and drinking was gone and I don't even remember when I did quit praise God and thank you for your prayers [Music] everyone in the back of the room come up and gather right around the prayer request now

pledges in order to build a home for retired ministers and returned missionaries the time has come to build an airport for the airplanes that will go out from this place to drop Gospels in Mexico and in other lands and so the students line up on each side of the runway like landing lights and that is what they are shining lights in a dark world may God protect every plane that lands here and go with every plane that flies forth from miracle Valley as Nehemiah built for God even while defending Israel against her enemies Reverend Allen and his coworkers keep building building and building at

upon the wall he is building for God the men know that it requires perspiration as well as inspiration to build for God at miracle Valley how very fitting it is at miracle valley that there should be a cabinet shop for our Lord Jesus Christ was a carpenter in Nazareth this Christian workman is walking in the footsteps of the carpenter of Nazareth as he cuts and planed the lumber designs and assembles the pieces so that each joint is properly fitted and produces another useful piece of household furniture for a miracle Valley home as the mountains of Israel surround the city of Jerusalem even so the majestic mountains of southern Arizona stand like sentinels of God to guard this valley the valley that God has made and that God has chosen as a center for worldwide miracle restoration revival before even one of these many buildings was erected at this chosen site the Spirit of God prophesied that men and women would come from the north and from the south and from the east and from the West and that they would meet God in a new way and go forth from this valley told with the armor of God and armed with the mighty gifts of the Spirit and that this mighty army prophesied of by Joel would lift high the banner of the Lord and carry God's endtime miracle revival to the ends of the earth just across the highway the independent development company has provided a new community especially for Christians who want to establish permanent homes in miracle Valley in this fertile valley cactus flowers lawns shrubs anything and almost everything will grow in the fertile soil of miracle Valley the beauty of the valley is enhanced by the many colorful flowers that grow on every hand inexpensive but modern and comfortable homes for Western living have been built by many members of the staff the faculty and the permanent employees and by others who have chosen this spiritual happy life in this spiritual environment of miracle Valley as God's crowning blessing upon their golden years those who do not choose to build or buy permanent homes find many modern conveniences in the trailer court at miracle Valley not many years ago this was a desert rangeland today it is a fruitful orchard the apples are shining ribbed crisp and tasty the soil of miracle Valley is rich in the minerals that make fruit production a predictable success the first crop of hail and freestone peaches was almost unbelievably large luscious and delicious samples were sent to friends more than a thousand miles away and these brought back enthusiastic expressions of amazement and appreciation what is better than fresh fruit picked off the tree growing in God's good soil at miracle Valley Arizona but most of the crop was devoted to the highest possible use it was canned for the use of the Bible school students and the faculty in the winter months that were ahead the big kitchen becomes a busy cannery as the workers peel the peaches remove the pits and slice the peaches for either the cold pack or for the cooking kettle the large peach half of the hail peaches are carefully placed in the half gallon jars for cold packing others are cooked in a syrup then poured into mason jars and field for a winter's use imagine how happy the students will be as they come from many states and some foreign countries for another semester at miracle Valley Bible College and in the midst of the winter are served these delicious and beautiful features from miracle Valley [Music] many different crops are grown at miracle Valley the tall green stalks of corn hold the promise of another bountiful harvest the farmer can hardly wait to see the results of his Labor's and the husking of just one ear of corn reveals the promise of many meals that will feature roasting years at the College cafeteria even the corn stalks are put to good use at the power drawn corn cutter chop the corn stalks into small pieces of silage this will be preserved in an underground trench silo and used to feed the Holstein cattle of the dairy farm the mineral-rich soil produces up to eight crops of alfalfa each year resulting in hundreds of tons of the finest hay in southern Arizona this alfalfa is cut and rolled into wind rows for proper drying and curing and at just the right time the farm manager will send his crew out with the hay baler to pick up the wind rows of alfalfa and compress it into neat bales for easy storage and convenient handling [Music] what a wonderful sight row after row of bales of alfalfa and soon these two will be taken to the hay barn what a joy and what a pleasure for these young men to be working on God's farm the best part of it is the rides of the hay barn and there the bales of hay will be neatly stacked under the protection of a large metal roof to provide the choices of feed for the finest dairy cattle throughout the months that lie ahead these choice falstein cows of the Dairy Herd provide an abundance of milk butter cottage cheese and other dairy products not only for the use of the cafeteria but also for the entire community this dairy is modern and complete in every way well equipped to pasteurize the milk and to process the other dairy products other farm crops include large green peppers red ripe tomatoes and cucumbers and all kinds of squash grow profusely and especially the yellow squash yields an abundant harvest and this is popular with everyone the fresh corn will be served in the college cafeteria and every kernel will be full and tender and flavorful cantaloupes and watermelon grow large and sized and in great abundance on the valley farm are these melons ripe many melons will be needed for this feast and for the watermelon contest that is going to follow after the young folks from the Bible College have each received their portion of melon a group of the young men will engage in a watermelon eating contest to discover the champion watermelon eater of the miracle Valley Bible College in this contest everyone is a winner there are no losers but only one can be selected as the champion watermelon eater of miracle Valley the excitement rises as the boys look to see if any of the other are ahead of them in their battle toward the Rhine and as the judge draws near keeping a watchful eye on each of these eager fast eating boys he wonders which period this is the champion the champion is chosen the champion watermelon either of the valley and then follows that great event each year at the height of the midwinter camp meeting a great barbecue feast is held for all of the multitude of visitors that attend the miracle camp meeting even Reverend Allen serves as one of the chefs this feast will include baked potatoes fresh milk and there is plenty of barbecue beef for everyone [Music] at a time of happiness and fun and fellowship well Tommy Anderson and Jean Martin enjoys the happy fellowship of this outdoor feast from the nearby bus depot at Bisbee Arizona the Bible College limousine brings another load of new students young men and women who have come from many parts of this country they can hardly wait to see every part of the campus this campus which will be their home for many months to come they have heard so much so very much about the healthful funny climate the deep blue skies the colorful mountain ranges of Arizona and now they are here Old Mexico is only two miles away a foreign mission field right at their door no one can guess what freedom of spirit each student will experience as he breathed the fresh air from mountains and deserts climbed the nearby hills and watches with wonderment each Golden Setting Sun in this fascinating land this land that God has set aside for the preparation and training of young men and women by the God called Faculty of the miracle Valley Bible College dr. Roy gray Dean of the Bible College personally welcomes each new students upon their arrival as one of America's truly great Bible teachers dr. gray knows that any one of these students may become a mighty messenger of the Lord one of these students arriving today may be used of God to turn an entire nation away from sin and godlessness one of these students may start miracle revival fires burning in some heathen nation that today is held in the grip of satanic dark yes these students are important to God they are part of his plan and as they registered in the office of the College registrar there is a deep sense of destiny upon Velma each one of these students knows that they have been brought by God to this time and to this place so that God might fulfill his purpose in their lives and now while but done the assistant dean of the Bible College is busy preparing for his next lecture let us pass quietly on into the Bible class that is being taught by dr. gray he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses anybody know where a witness is Wayne what is a witness with someone very forced even though a witness is the first who has a personal knowledge of something he saw himself where he heard it if you got a personal knowledge of Jesus do you actually know him now that's the issue and that's what the power of the Holy Ghost is for it is to make me to know Jesus and you know it takes time to know Jesus it takes time to know anybody doesn't it you can get acquainted and then you get better acquainted but you know a real friendship has to ripen and that's the kind of friendship as the Jesus if I'm gonna be a witness I don't know to me he makes me want to know Jesus he makes me want to get a role whatever time so like when I go out into the world I can really speak with authority in nearby cities and towns the students clout in companies to hold Street meetings in which they sing the songs of the gospel and preach the word of the Lord they boldly proclaim the good news of miracle restoration revival and they are ready at any moment to pray for the sick or to deal with a penitent soul during the restoration revival at miracle Valley many converts requested water baptism some of these have been nominal Christians and formal churches others were children who had reached the age of decision and had chosen Christ the thick and afflicted who had received miracles of healing and now with joy they follow the Lord in Baptism joyously rising to continue their Christian walk in the newness of life for these have all been transformed and anointed afresh in God's miracle restoration revival the words of the Apostle Paul are literally fulfilled therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of God even so we also should walk in newness of life the founder of miracle Valley the president of the Bible College evangelist AAA Allen has been chosen and sent of God to take miracle restoration revival directly to the people of America and the world Reverend Allen conducts miracle tent meetings with three great services daily in the large tent people from all walks of life come by the thousands to hear his anointed preaching to seek his personal prayers and to find salvation healing and deliverance under the mighty Ministry of God's man of faith and power Reverend Allen has lifted the veils of limited religion and has opened unto many God's way to prosperity as he boldly proclaimed the Bible truth it is God that giveth thee power to get wealth it can be said of Reverend Allen as it was said of Jesus the common people heard him gladly in his compassionate ministry they have found a man that of God a minister who cares enough and who dares enough to challenge the powers of Satan and set them free the missionary outreach of the a a Allen ministry has touched many far-off lands and foreign fields and now it reaches to Mindanao in the Philippines throngs packed the building and sing with enthusiasm under the inspiring leadership of Ken Rogers Tommy Anderson plays the piano with power and authority as the vast audience enters into that harmony and oneness in Christ in which all things become possible to them that believe expectancy fills the air the presence of God is so strong in the preaching of evangelist a a Allen that even the sinners and the heathen sense that this is a supernatural ministry the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he up anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord how the multitudes thank God for the good news that God is here in power to deliver a little child crippled from one leg three inches shorter than the other is carried up to the man of God how the hearts of the people go out to this poor child as they see the great difference in the length of the right leg and the left but gods man of faith and power looks only in compassion and faith and says Saints believe God God is going to perform a miracle his heart is lifted toward heaven Oh God have mercy on this child tonight and let your power be revealed and let this short light be lengthened and let this little child be made everywhere hold the right leg and the left leg exactly the same length it seems almost too good to be true but nothing must be left to chance brother Allen takes the child by the hand she walks back and forth across the platform not a sign of a crippled condition she is perfectly whole through the miracle power of living faith and the Lord has proven through the ministry of his man of faith and power that all things are possible to him that believeth [Music] bring the full diamond here Jesus thank every better and he sets the free did you bring me this man's

he say this going through the word of god god always use signs for his people when because of man's sin god destroyed the entire human race and he set to know it to build an ark you all know the story of how noah built that ark and god brought him safely he and his family through the flood and god gave him a sign and every time you see it rain and you see a rainbow in the sky that is a sign that god gave generations ago that he would never destroy the human race again with water can you say amen god is a sign god god's people were in bondage to pharaoh and he was looking for a deliverer god prepared him a deliverer on the backside of a desert his name was moses god said to moses he said i have called you to be the deliverer of my people moses said but lord they will not believe me give me a sign so that your people will believe god said all right if that's what you want to sign i'll give you a sign [Applause] he said what is that in your hand he said why it's a rod he said throw it down he threw it down and it became a serpent and moses was startled and he stepped back god said break down and pick it up again he reached out and got it by the tail and it became a rod again god is a sign god god said now moses just for good measure if they don't believe that sign i'm going to give you another sign put your hand in your bustle moses obeyed put his hand in his bosom and now god said moses take it out and when he did his hand became white with leprosy god is a sign god he said now put it back in your bosom and when he did and pull out his hand again his hand was normal god has always given signs to his people and he is the same today as he was yesterday can you see amen somebody [Applause] there was a man by the name of gideon whom god had told to bring deliverance to his people the philistines were coming to destroy and gideon was a man who was unheard of but god likes to reach down and pick up somebody that is a nobody if you are a somebody god can't use you but when you become a nobody you are right for god to reach down and pick you up god came and said gideon thou mighty man of power and he said lord who who's talking who else is in the room mighty man i'm nothing i'm nobody he said i have called you to bring deliverance to my people the angel of the lord came and stood by his side he said lord if this is really you talking to me give me a sign give me a sign let me know that it's you talking to me and i want you to know god gave him a sign hallelujah gideon said angel you wait right here and i'll come back and he brought back with him some cake and he brought back some oil and he brought back a kid and they roasted it and he brought it and laid it on the rock the angel said lay it here and when he did fire came up right out of the middle of the rock and consumed everything that gideon brought he said now i know god sent him a sign and he said now i know but he said that's not enough he said lord if it's really you talking to me i tell you what i'm going to do he said i'm going to put this fleece out tonight and i'm going to lay it on the ground and if it's really you talking to me and you want me to deliver my people you let the fleece be wet and let the ground be dry and he went in and went to bed next morning he came out he was walking on dry grass and when he got to the fleece he picked it up and it was soaking wet and he wrung a bowl full of water out of it he said now i know god has spoken to me god gave him a sign god is a sign god so he said now i might as well make it hard on god lord if it's really you talking i'm gonna put it out again tonight but he said this time reverse the order make the ground wet and make the fleece dry he goes back in the house and goes to bed comes out in the morning and he gets his feet wet before he gets to the fleece the crown is soaking wet with a dew but when he gets to the fleece it was just as dry as could be i said god is a shame god and he is the same yesterday and he's the same today can you say amen our bible says concerning jesus christ that a virgin would conceive and bring forth a son this shall be a sign unto you a woman who knows not a man is going to give birth to a son and you shall call his name emmanuel hallelujah this shall be a sign unto you and to every one of you that are looking at this telecast the shepherds that watch their flocks by night when that virgin gave birth to jesus christ the angel of the lord came to the shepherds and said this shall be a sign unto you you shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying in a manger i'm here to tell you that god is a sign god hallelujah in this generation that we are living we have seen some modern day signs that has been recorded here in the 16th chapter of saint mark's gospel he said in my name you shall cast out devils this is a modern day sign you that have been looking at this telecast you literally have seen demons cast out of people here sunday after sunday god is a fine god in my name you shall speak with new tongues this is another sign that god is using in this generation today in my name you shall take up serpents in my name if you drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt you this is another sign about eight years ago reverend allen and i bought in brooklyn new york he told this incident the other night how we were in the restaurant eating some soup before the night service when all of a sudden he began to swell until he had to loosen his belt and after he loosened his belt he had to unzip his trousers because he was floating up like a balloon somebody poisoned what he was eating he said brother sound back i've got to run to the hotel across the street but before he got to the room an angel came and brought deliverance to him and he was healed my bible says if you eat or drink any kidney thing it shall not hurt you if you believe this say amen this is a modern day sign and then week after week on this telecast you have been saying the man of god lay his hands on the sick they come by in wheelchairs they come on stretchers some hobble on crutches some are carried in some are brought in by others that are blind deaf dumb cannot speak all manner of sickness and disease and infirmity but hands are laid upon them by the man of god in the name of jesus sickness is commanded to loose and turn loose of god's people god performs a miracle and they are healed right before your very eyes on this television screen this is a sign i've heard so many people say preacher i don't see this in my church it's in the bible it's in the word of god you may not have signs like this out where you live but it doesn't mean there aren't signs like this [Applause] amen you may not have signs like this in your church but it doesn't mean we don't have him in our church hallelujah i believe that these signs shall follow them back to them and i believe that god is getting his church ready for one of the greatest signs that this world has ever seen if you believe this say amen [Applause] for three weeks people have been here fasting and praying waiting on god to manifest himself we are literally waiting for a sign something that we can behold with our eyes bless god we're waiting for an angel to walk on these grounds we are waiting for the dead to be raised i read to you a portion of scripture a while ago when god would rather when jesus

[Soloist]\n\u266a I feel the Spirit moving \n[Choir]\n\u266a That's alright  \u266a That's alright, alright  \u266a Revival comes from Heaven \n\u266a That's alright  I truly believe we are in\nthe last of the last days. - Yes, I agree. - And if that prophecy is true and I'm not saying that\nprophecy is not true-- You went to the \"tent\"\nRevival Capital of the World - That's right.\n- Uh-huh! - If that's true that--that\nwill be raised again, - That's what he said. - Is that what he said? In the last day? Then we are seeing it. - I believe we are. - Yea. In January 1958, the\nground I'm standing on, 1250 acres became what we now know as\nMiracle Valley. Yea, this is Miracle\nValley right here\nbehind me. It's the Miracle\nValley Tabernacle where A. A. Allen held so\nmany camp meetings, thousands and thousands of\npeople would come to be a part of the\ncamp meeting. Healings, deliverances,\nand so much more. There is so\nmuch more to A. A. Allen and what you see\nwith this temple or this tabernacle right here. The Bible school that is here, the dorms, everything\nthat he built. It was a huge operation but there is so much more to\nA. A. Allen than just Miracle\nValley. Take a look of who A. A.\nAllen really was. I command this\nmountain go! Be that puffed up! Removed! Embraced into the sea! Oh! You mountain! of crippling arthritis, go! [People cheering] Come on! [People cheering and clapping] Come on! Come on! [People cheering and clapping] Come on! [People shouting] Come on! Come on! Raise your hands, everybody! Rejoice in God! This man has not been\nable to walk, impossible for him to walk. Listen! This is a mountain removed. Roberts, tell me about A. A.\nAllen's miracle crusade. The \"tent\" days. - The \"tent\" days. Brother Allen went and saw Oral\nRoberts preach here in Dallas and came out\nof it thinking, \"If Oral Roberts can do\nit, I can too\"! So he ended up buying\nJack Coe's tent. - Since Jack Coe\npassed away... - Jack Coe passed away and\nthe tent is somewhere else around with the\ntrucks and everything. And so he buys Jack Coe's tent\nand starts his tent ministry so I find it very amusing\nand wonderful that the great men of\npast tense get used again\nand so he\nbegins to do the same thing as\nyou see all the other tent preachers do with\nthe way they set it up. Now where Allen was\nvery exciting was, he was one of the guys that\nknew how to use music in a way that other guys had\nit as a preliminary or just a part of a\ntraditional service. Gene Martin, his soloist was a very affluent man. We recalled that he would sing\nthe song of the Lord or would play under the\nanointing. - Right. - That was something\nkind of new. Allen's crowd was a mixture\nracial crowd-- of black and white\nbecause in this time, there was still a strong\nracism in America. So the Ku Klux Klan would\ncome at times and fight in the South... but he'd fight\nthrough that. And so those were the\nthings that he would do and it was huge, I mean. Ten of thousands of\npeople would come and they would have afternoon\nteaching sessions and things. I guess the best thing to\nsay is he would look for the worst case first. When he would come on\nstage sometimes, he'd pray, \"God, who do\nyou want to heal first\"? And he'd say, \"I want\nthe worst case first.\" If you get the worst\ncase first healed, then it's easier than after. And that's why in some\nof the old films, you'll see him pull up\na stretcher or a person and somebody\nis like, \"Oh\"! He would go after that one and he had tremendous\nmiracles, I mean, there is no doubt\nabout the miracles and he would build that up. I mean the interview\nwas perfect TV. What's wrong with\nhim?\n- He can't eat. - Go get him a sandwich. He's going to eat tonight. I mean the whole thing and\nthen he would pray for them and you would see, it\nwould happen in front of you. And he said, after\nthat hard miracle, people faith was so high,\nit would just flow very wonderfully. Another fun miracle was an\noverweight lady that was\nvery heavy, who had some type of\nglandular chemistry problems. She was close to\n300 pounds that had come. He prays for her and she\nkind of falls out over on the sawdust thing and he goes on and do\nsomething else. When she stands up, she's\nlost so much weight that her undergarments all fall\noff of her onto the floor. And so you know, these are\nthe miracles brother Allen had. These are not hip. These are things that\nyou can see where people saw them by\nthe thousands. And so there was also the\nperson that came with, they call alligator skin.\n- Right. - And he prayed for them,\nand they were healed. And so those are some of the\ngreat miracles I can remember but the music was tremendous. The crowds...\nPeople got saved. The one thing people\nsometimes forget because healing, the greatest\nhealing is that from sin and so all these\nphysical miracles, drew people to the altar moment so all the tent preachers\nand all the great revivalists that we admire, if\nyou notice, they all have that in the\ncore of their heart that no matter how great the\nmiracles were, there's coming that moment when I've got to throw the\nnet for salvation. And Allen had tremendous\npower to bring people to Christ and to get Spirit filled. He was not ashamed of\nspeaking with tongues and the Holy Spirit baptism so\nhe was a Full Gospel guy. He also knew, like Sister\nMcPherson, how to utilize newspaper persecution\nso he knew how to build that. It's a common fight because he can take\nthat opposition and move the crowd with him too. \"Tonight, they are against\nme in the newspaper. The news media is telling\nme I'm a false prophet. What do you think\"? [Amused] He knew how to...and\npeople loved him. It was almost like he and the\ncrowd were two people, you know. So I mean, brother Allen was... I wish I could have seen him. - Me too. - I was a little\nbaby and I don't...\n- Yea. - My parents went to some of\nhis meetings but I never got to go. - \"God's man of\nfaith and power\". - Yes. And he'd bounced on that stage and he wore those bright\ncolor suits for the day and he was made for TV. He was made for the\nwhole Hollywood, and he was perfect. I\nmean, loved it. Here the daughter lying\nin a hospital dying and doctors could not help her from an incurable\nkidney disease. Doctors had given her up and her own father, who is an\nundertaken, knows death when\nhe sees it. He took one look at that\ngirl and said, \"I didn't know she was so bad\". You know Roberts, we've\ntalked about A. A. Allen and things that gone on. When I was there in\nMiracle Valley in Arizona, I noticed something\nthat I noticed with Charles Parham in\nTopeka that there was... In Topeka, there was all\nthese churches right around where something had happened. Same thing with\nMiracle Valley. There were Catholics\npresence there. There is Our Lady of the Cross\non the side of the mountain right near and even back to the\nSpaniards had came through that whole area on their\nway through Mexico earlier than that, I mean there was...something\nhappened in these areas and you know, we've\ntalked about this and some would\ncall it portals. You know, I like your\nterm, \"Open Heavens\" on\na certain areas. Tell me a little\nbit about that. - Well in history, you'll find\nthat certain cities were opened where all of a sudden, society\nand spirituality worked together and had a breakthrough,\nwe call it revival. Chicago, Dallas at one time, Los\nAngeles, Topeka, these places and it's where I think... I use the term \"Open Heavens\"\nbecause I try to stick... When I get the portal talk, but\nit's where work had been done where the heavens\nhad been opened. The demonic powers had\nbeen bound to the degree that their influence became\nminimum to non-existent and the spirituality\nbegan to work and it began to bless\nand churches grew and the economy grew and\nadvancement happened for\nthose people so there are places where you\ncan go back in time and see when the move of God was\nthere, how it would explode even\neconomically and so those are open\nheavens where places where God did something and\nmoves began to happen. - Miracle Valley, Arizona. When I was there, I kinda\ntell you, there were some-- Guys, it was quite an experience\nfor me I didn't expect. - Wow... - When I was there and\nyou know this guy, uh-- he had such an effect on\nAmerica during that-- that season of his ministry,\nthere in the late 50's and 60's even up to 1970. But that property, while\nI was there, is very interesting because\nit's got a church on it, it's got offices, and it also\nhad a recording studio and it had an airstrip. - Uh-oh! - With some hangars. Does that sound\nfamiliar to you? - Ha ha. - I'm like...\n- A. A. Allen. Yea. - And it was about the\nsame amount of-- - Oh, wow! - Acreage. So I'm walking through\nthis place and it was just... I don't want to get spooky but I\nmean, there was a gravity. That's the word. There was a gravity\nto where I was at. - Uh-huh. - So I'm going through and you\nknow, this is a piece of glass that I brought back\nfrom top of that-- uh--part of the original glass. Some of it was replaced\nwith fiberglass but this was an actual shard of\nglass I brought from the dome of the tabernacle there. What had happened? I mean, there is a\nstory of the... when they drilled a well... I want to tell\nyou that story. He had a prophecy. A guy came up to A. A.\nAllen and said, \"On the property, you're\ngonna drill a well and you're going to\ngo down 750 feet before you hit water and you're\ngonna break off a drill bit to get there and you're\ngoing to lose the drill bit - That's very\nspecific, isn't it? - It was a very\nspecific prophecy. So guess what? A. A. Allen, they\nstarted drilling. They didn't hit water. They thought they\nwould hit it earlier. Now this is in the desert. You're just a mile from\nMexico, you know, and so they drilled and they\ndrilled and they drilled. Guess what? They hit rock, couldn't\ndrill anymore. The bit was stuck.\nThe bit broke... - Wow... - When they pushed in a\nlittle bit further, they went to 750, exactly\nthe prophecy. - I love that. - The bit broke off and\nfell in the water and they were--that's where\nthey hit the water. Now the interesting thing is\nnot just the prophecy. That water supplies all\nof the property... Wasn't supposed to be water\nthere anyway but it was there. They found the water, it\nsupplies the property and inside the tabernacle\nwas where they actually had the water fountains. Now people would come to a\nA. A. Allen meeting at the Revival Tabernacle would drink the water and\nthey actually had reports of people getting\nhealed in the lobby from drinking the fountain. - Wow. - At the drinking... - That's a great story. - So you know... - Streams in the desert. - Streams in the desert.\nExactly. So there is something\nthere and so I started looking around\nwhere I was at. And there was...I think I told\nthe story or not of the 2 girls. Did I tell that story of\nthe 2 girls that I met? While I was there, we were\nshooting and these girls came, starting to driving up. While I was doing the\nopening segment that you saw, - Out of nowhere... - They drove up. - Wow! - Now understand, there is\nnothing there to see. I mean, when I say--tumbleweeds\nand shells of buildings. - Wow. - While I was there, these\ngirls came up and I was talking to the camera and\nI see this truck pull up in my peripheral vision\nand these 2 young girls walk and I'm thinking\nas I was recording that opening piece to\nthis program, they must not know where\nthey are at... - Ha ha. - They are lost. - The mall is nowhere near... - Ha ha... [All laughing] - No record store or anything. I said record\nstore, didn't I? - Uh-oh! - Yea. - Ha ha! - So after we finished\ntaping that segment, and we were walking through\nthe tabernacle you saw, they came up to us and they\ncame up to me and said, \"Excuse me\"? Now I'm thinking, they've got\nto be 15 or 16 years old. One of them had to be\n16 because she drove. And \"Can you tell us\nwhat went on here\"? - How would they know that? - And I was like, \"Sure! But\ntell me why are you here\"? - Yea. - Well, we've just seen this and I wanted to bring my\nfriend here and so... I said, \"Sure, let's go here\nand let me give you a little quick story\" and I'm... was just amazed and so I\nstarted telling the story of revival because I was\ntrying to understand \"Where do you\ngo to church? - Well we don't really go\". One didn't really go. One, they go every once\nin a while so it wasn't like, these are kids\nfrom the youth group. - Right. - So I'm really trying to\npicture \"Why are you here? What is it\"? And so I went through the\nstory and told it and one was 17 and one was 16\nand they were there and they were so enraptured. \"We just wanted to come to\nthis place and see and found out what\nhappened here\". - Wow! - So through out the day,\nI saw them and they were just walking around. Again, there is nothing\nthere to see except shells of buildings and\ntumbleweeds, - Shards of glass... - Shards of glass... You know, plywood. It wasn't anything to see but they were drawn to\nthat place. Now Roberts just shared\nabout Open Heavens and how we call them \"portals\". I know that's such a\nspooky term for some but the reality is there was\nsomething so I called\nback home here, to Linda and to Chris\nand like, \"Tell me what-- Is there something else\nthat happened here\"? But before they told me\nthat, one of these girls said, \"Well, have\nyou seen the cross\"? And I'm like, okay, is\nthis like?... - It's getting interesting. - \"Are you pointing me\nto the cross\"? - Ha ha, there we go! Being spiritual, you know? \"No, no, the cross\non the hill\"! I'm like, \"No\"! So sure enough, we drove\nand as we went up, we found this huge cross, Catholic\non the side of the hill. - Impressing! - Now knowing history\nhad shown me, when you see more than one\nin a place like that like Topeka, where all those\nchurches are right there, - Yes, - around where\nCharles Parham. There is something\nthat's noteworthy. - Uh-huh. - So we started researching\nthat, Our Lady of the Cross... It's a chapel on the side of\nthe mountain right there. We went up to it and they\nhad services. So in research, so I'm\nfinding these guys, I'm talking to Gary\non the phone and he tells me about\nCabeza de Vaca. - Yes - Who came through... - Now wait a minute. Who? - Cabeza de Vaca, Spaniard, a\nconquistador who came through... - Uh--The 1500's\nor 1600's, was it? - Uh? When was it, Chris? 1500's so he comes through\nand he comes from Texas and he goes the Rio Grande\nvalley and he goes through having meetings... - Yes, - Winning the lost and\nhaving signs and wonders and he goes all the way. In\nfact, we can show that map of where he went and he\ngoes right through\nMiracle Valley area. - Now the Spaniards, Gene,\nall they were about was finding Cities of Gold\nand killing people. You are telling me\nthere is a Spaniard... - Yes! He's coming through... - have healing meetings. - He had healing meetings\nand he goes through that area. - Yes. - So I'm like, \"Oh, my\"! And I get chills just\ntalking about it. - Yes, ha-ha. Oh my goodness, there\nis something here - Yes, that happened... - that something happened here\nand he goes through that area and even in the prophecy that\nA. A. Allen talked about in 1959 and you know, and things that were\ngoing to happen there and the way he got\nthe property... The guy couldn't sell the\nproperty to somebody else... - Wow. The guy went blind who was\nsupposed to buy the property. He couldn't sign... - Uh-huh. - So he knew he was supposed to\nsell to A. A. Allen. He gives it to A. A. Allen. So it's this story of time\nafter time after time, God has a plan. So right before A.\nA. Allen passes, I believe it was in 1970, if I'm remembering correct,\nhe gives a prophecy as a prophecy about this place. - Yes. - Now he doesn't know he's\nabout to not be on this earth but the prophecy is, this\nthing is going to... will deteriorate and will\nalmost go away totally. - Oh, wow! - But in the last days, there will be a great\nawakening in this place. We will see the\npower of God. - Yes! - But there will come a time\nwhere there's tumbleweeds\nblowing through. Well as you see, when I\nwas walking through. there were tumbleweeds\nblowing through. Now several different ministries\nhad tried to buy the property and try to do something\nwith it or... You can do research\non the Internet. In fact, if you want to\ngo to our timeline, there is a lot of links there on\nthe website that you can go see what all happened with\nthe Revival Tabernacle and Miracle Valley,\nthat whole area. But there is a season and\na time of revival - Yes. - but that resides\nin the ground. Like the well, the\nwater that they found... - Yes. - had healing properties. I don't have...I\ndon't have anything. There was a story\nthey told me. Luis Bettencourt, who owns\nmost of the property now-- He's telling me the story\nthat he's heard of someone landing--a\njet landing. Now remember, we are\ntalking about the 60's, a plane landing on the airstrip wheeling someone out - Oh, yes! - and pushing it up\nthe street... It's not really a good\nterm, up the road, up to the tabernacle. She gets healed, they\ncome back and take off. You know, of these type of\nthings that were happening. - The Revival Tent\nCapital of the World. - Is this how it was called? - Yes. - And it was actually\ncalled that. - Oh! Is that right?\nThat's astounding! I'm thinking of what you know, the blood cries out\nfrom the ground. So I mean, there is\nsomething there. We often think,\n\"No\". There isn't anything\nthere, but yes, there\nis, you know. - You know, I'm reminded\nwith Abraham and God told Abraham,\n\"Go to the place where I have\nplaced my name\". - Uh-huh,\n- Right. It's right. - It's spiritual. Now here is the thing. So why are we--so many of\nus have a tendency... We are out digging holes. Instead, we should\nbe uncovering wells. - Oh... - And finding the history,\n- True, - of your area. The spiritual\nhistory, not just the history. - It's just like you shared on some of the other programming\nabout your grandfather\n- Sure! - and the history that you go\nback in your own heritage. - As we learned with\nAzusa Street where there was that girl\nin that lovely tribe that there was that healing process\nand then here is Azusa Street, same location.\n- Yes, from Azusa. - Her name is Azusa. - Right. So there is so much\nhistory that we have to-- lay hold of. Now other than the\nscriptures you just gave, we don't camp out there like we start worshiping the\nground, that's wrong. - Right. - But we need to be aware\nof where we are at because of the revivals\nthat happened. Now A. A. Allen had miracles. Obviously, you know,\nR. W. Schambach still talked, you know, up\nto the day he died about the miracles\nthat he saw on A. A. Allen and how tremendous... - Outstanding - this man's ministry\nwas. He saw-- A. A. Allen went to an Oral\nRoberts tent meeting and he saw the power of God on\ndisplay in his tent and he said, \"If Oral Roberts\ncan do this, I can do this\". Now you can take 2 ways. One, he was just like, \"Oh, I'm\ngonna go make a lot of money\". That's not what\nhe was saying. He was saying if\nhe can be... because God is not a\nrespecter of persons. - Exactly right. - If God is not a respecter\nof persons, I can let Him, I can see Him do that. I can do that. - Yes! - and he grab hold of that. In his ministry, he was known as \"God's man of faith and power\". - He was, he was. - And so here he went out\nand he went winning the lost and seeing great things\nhappen in his ministry. When he spoke, it was\nnot a man speaking but it was a man filled and\nanointed with God. speaking with the oracles of God and it was God\nspeaking through man. [People clapping and cheering] God promised me in\nPhiladelphia number years ago that I could\nspeak the Word only. And according to I\nCorinthians 16, God said, \"He will walk in them, I\nwill move in them\". And I believe a man\nanointed with God and filled with God\ncan speak for you. He can speak the\nwords of deliverance. I mean, it's an\nopportunity anytime we see any of these\nthings going on. Anytime we've seen things here\non the Kenneth Copeland campus where this is the Revival\nCapital of the World here now. And it's\nlike a shopping list. When you see things happen\nin terms of miracles. When you see\nbreakthroughs. I mean we're seeing it\nin every single category. It doesn't matter whether it's\nhealth or finance or\nrelationships or where people are\ntrying to--you know, \"Hi, I have to get to my... This is the destiny God is\ntelling me to head towards\" and look at all these\nbattles that can come\nbetween here and there. You know, no matter what\nit is, we are seeing... no matter what it is, you know, in terms\nof challenges, God has the answers and He\nhas the opportunity for us to step out and make\nthat difference. So every time I see\nanything happen in terms of a miracle or a\ngood news of anyone, you know, it's like, \"Yea! That's on my prayer list. Yes\"! - I think of that old hymn, \"What He's done for others, [Together]\nHe'll do it for you\"! - Greg. - I just want to--it's something\nI think is very interesting laying here on the table. The Tent Masters and it's\nAimee Semple McPherson, T.L. Osborn, Jack Coe, Oral\nRoberts, Schambach, A. A. Allen and it's each one of\nthem message, right here on cassette. Not one over the other but\nI'm looking at the unity - Sure,\n- of their faith. And T.L. Osborn, he went to a Branham meeting and he heard the Lord say, \"You can do that\". - That's right. - So you can be the one. - You can be the one too. And he was. Yea, absolutely he was. A. A. Allen. \"Born to\nLose, Bound to Win\". - Here we go. We are always trying... - He was not a man, he\nwas not a man of great uh... financial standing, you know. - He was not perfect. - I'll tell you this. We don't worship the place, we don't worship the person, except \"The\" person,\nJesus Christ. And you'll go on, Jesus said,\ngo on and look up things. You'll google A.\nA. Allen and you'll come across\na whole lot of\nnegative stuff. But what God did\nthrough that person, that's what is lasting. - That is what's lasting. - Yes. - We have to see what\nGod is showing in that whole--everything from\nCabeza de Vaca, - Exactly. That's\na new one.\n- A. A. Allen. - I'm intrigued\nnow by that. - Oh yea, yea. - So go to the\nwebsite! We'll put the links up\nthere you can see. See what God is doing as\nwe go through. But I really want us to\nunderstand. This is why the whole program of what we do here at Revival\nRadio TV, even exist. It's not to lift up\nthese people because everyone of these\npeople that we talked about, everyone of them failed somewhere in their lives. You know, we talked about\nLester Sumrall. He wasn't perfect, neither\nwas Kathryn or... - Kathryn Kuhlman... - Whitefield or you know,\nany--Dowie, far back as you want to go,\nthey're all fallible people - Yes. but they did\nanswer the call. So we go back to visit and I\nreally and I'd said that quickly but I really want\nthis understood... We don't have to re-dig\na new hole. - That's frequently. - Which is quicker? You dig a hole or\nuncover a well? - Oh yes.\n- True. - You know, that's why Isaac, dug again the wells of Abraham. - Amen. - Because of that water\nwas there and that's why we have to. That's why it's so important not just to be history buffs but to understand the ultimate\nhistory that we have right here in this Word and what\nGod is doing, He can do again. - I truly believe, we are in\nthe last of the last days. - Yes, I agree. - And if that prophecy is true, and I'm not saying that\nprophecy is not true-- You went to the \"tent\"\nRevival Capital of the World? - Uh-huh.\n- That's right. If that's true that that\nwill be raised again, - That's what he said. - That's what he said? In\nthe last day?... Then we are seeing it. - I believe we are. - Yea. - You know, as we go off\nthe air today, I'd like to just play\nanother clip of A. A. Allen. \"God's man of\nfaith and power\". Watch this. Bring me the last one. The last should be first and the first should be last. Stand her right there. Right there. I decree that when my shadow, according to the will of God and\naccording to the prophet, that the moment my shadow overcast this\nlittle woman, that God is going to\nput in a new disk and let her do what she has been unable\nto do since 1962 because she cannot bend,\nshe can't stoop, and can't do no work. How many believe\nGod tonight? [Crowd shouting]\n- Amen! - Do you believe it? - Yes! - Do you believe it? [Woman]\n-Yes I do. - Tonight. - I believe it tonight. - God is going to\ngive you a new disk. - Tonight. - A new spine. - Oh, thank you, Jesus. - Step up a little closer.\nRight there. - Lady, stay right there. When I step in front of her,\nI want everyone of you to shout, Jesus! Because when I step in\nfront of her, my shadow is going to overcast her and she is going to\nstoop and bend and God is going to\ngive her a new spine and a new backbone. Say yes. [People shouting]\n- Yes! - Lady, are you ready? - I'm ready. - God is going to do it. - He's going to\ndo it tonight. Say friends, - Friends, - When this shadow, - Overshadows me, - God is gonna give me, - A new backbone - I'm gonna bend - and I'm gonna stoop over. - Get ready. Are you ready? 3 steps. One for the Father, one\nfor the Son and one for the Holy Ghost. [People shouting] Thank God, thank God! Raise your hands\nand rejoice in God, everyone! [People shouting] Oh, thank God, thank God! - Right here. In the name of Jesus,\nshow these people. Wait a minute. What's happened? - Oh my back is healed. - It's healed? - I'm healed. - What happened to the pain? - Oh, the pain is gone. - It's gone? - It's gone... - And you got a new spine. - I got a new spine - Bend over! [People shouting, clapping] Touch your toes! \u266a\u266a", "oWj9NWIWAPI": "nestled beneath the majestic mountains of southern Arizona in the beautiful and fertile San Pedro Valley only a few years ago this 2,400 acres on which miracle Valley is situated was just cattle grazing land growing only mesquite bushes and a few native grasses miracle Valley now blossoming like the Rose is located 20 miles west of Bisbee Arizona and only two miles north of the Mexico border this growing community is a living monument to the faith and dedication of the anointed ministry of evangelist AAA Allen from all sections of the United States and from many foreign lands hundreds of dedicated young men and young women have come to study in these classrooms to worship together in the college chapel and to prepare themselves for a miracle ministry to the nation's the great miracle Valley Church seating more than two thousand persons is the scene of many miracle revivals and now let us go together into the administration building and meet the founder and president God's man of faith and power evangelist a a Allen in 1959 through a supernatural gift of utterance God said concerning this valley and I quote this is my valley here have I called my people yay I have ordained it in the beginning in the earliest centuries have ah ordained this valley when I did lay the foundations of the rule when I faced the heavens above and when I leave the waters of the seeds at that time did I make this valley yay I did walk in it from Mountain to mountain yeah in this valley have I called my people and from this valley they shall go forth and I have the LORD thy God shall go with them and I have looked upon my harvest and I have said where are my Labor's there are so few the fields are white and the sheaves are falling there are many that I've called and I've chosen I've said in my heart I will set my Valley aside I shall call my people those that will hearken unto my voice and I will speak unto my people and I wouldn't do them with power through the Holy Ghost yeah I the LORD have spoken unto my people and I will walk among them and I will speak through them they shall come from the east they shall come from the west from the north and from the south into this place to prepare here to go under my whitened harvest fields I will open the windows of heaven and I will pour out of my power and I will bless thee and I will give thee that which thou hath desired unquote and in nineteen and fifty-eight it will desire of my heart to have a huge piece of property or a piece of land whereby we could build a great Bible training centers and house hey Allen revivals incorporated this is miracle [Music] [Music] [Music] come at this time is a man who performs many duties at miracle Valley a man whose life is in accordance with the scripture whatever thy hand findeth to do do it with all thy might Reverend Gerald W Kean executive director of aaand revivals incorporated as played a very important part in the development of miracle Valley beginning in the early days of miracle Valley in 1958 he has constantly guided the construction the supervision and the fast growth of our booming community and now it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you a great workman of God reverend gerald of yaqin god bless you brother king this is the time of the day we set apart that we consider the most important time of our work here at miracle valley and that is our morning devotions this is the time of day when we put on the whole armor of god we might be better prepared to do a work for god we consider this the most important few minutes that we spend before God not only that at this time we join with brother Alan in praying for the many prayer requests that come from across the country and across the nation in meeting the needs of the multitude of people I thank God that we here at miracle Valley can join brother Alan and have a part in this great ministry in praying over the needs of the people and now I'm going to introduce one of our workers that leads in the morning devotions and later on we'll pray over the prayer request so at this time I'm happy to introduce mr.

committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed and the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much I am so glad that that is God's Word this morning that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and we are expecting our faith in God to reach out this learning to reach all around this world to avail much for the kingdom of God over in the Book of Isaiah in the 59th chapter it says that this is the fast that is acceptable to God that we should undo the heavy burdens that we should break the bands of wickedness and that we should let the oppressed go free that is the purpose this morning of the prayers over these requests in miracle Valley that we would undo the heavy burdens

crew out with the hay baler to pick up the wind rows of alfalfa and compress it into neat bales for easy storage and convenient handling what a wonderful sight roll after roll of bales of alfalfa and soon these two will be taken to the hay barn what a joy and what a pleasure for these young men to be working on God's farm the best part of it is the ride to the hay barn and there the bales of hay will be neatly stacked under the protection of a large metal roof to provide the choices of feed for the finest dairy cattle throughout the months that lie ahead these choice falstein cows of the dairy herd provide an abundance of milk butter cottage cheese and other dairy products not only for the use of the cafeteria but also for the entire community this dairy is modern and complete in

Roy gray Dean of the Bible College personally welcomes each new students upon their arrival as one of America's truly great Bible teachers dr. gray knows that any one of these students may become a mighty messenger of the Lord one of these students arriving today may be used of God to turn an entire nation away from sin and godlessness one of these students may start miracle revival fires burning in some heathen nation that today is held in the grip of satanic darkness yes these students are important to God they are part of his plan and as they registered in the office of the College registrar there is a deep sense of destiny upon Velma each one of these students knows that they have been brought by God to this time and to this place so that God might fulfill his purpose in their lives and now while but done the assistant dean of the Bible College is busy preparing for his next lecture let us pass quietly on into the Bible class that is being taught by dr. gray I shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and shall be witnesses - anybody know what a witness is way mother to witness a witness someone who has a friend or Stevens Oh a witness is the first who has a personal knowledge of something he saw himself where he heard it have you got a personal knowledge of Jesus do you actually know him now that's the issue and that's what the power of the Holy Ghost is for it is to make me to know Jesus and you know it takes time to know Jesus it takes time to know anybody doesn't it you can get acquainted and then you get better acquainted but you know a real friendship has to ripen and that's the kind of the Jesus if I'm going to be a witness to me he makes me want to know Jesus he makes me I get a robe whatever side so like when I go out into the world I can really speak with authority in nearby cities and towns the students cloud in companies to hold Street meetings in which they sing the songs of the gospel and preach the word of the Lord they boldly proclaim the good news of miracle restoration revival and they are ready at any moment to pray for the sick or to deal with a penitent soul during the restoration revival at miracle Valley many converts requested water baptism some of these have been nominal Christians and formal churches others were children who had reached the age of decision and had chosen Christ the thick and afflicted who had received miracles of healing and now with joy they follow the Lord in Baptism joyously rising to continue their Christian walk in the newness of life for these have all been transformed and anointed afresh in God's miracle restoration revival the words of the Apostle Paul are literally fulfilled therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of God even so we also should walk in newness of life the founder of miracle Valley the president of the Bible College evangelist AAA Allen has been chosen and sent of God to take miracle restoration revival directly to the people of America and the world Reverend Allen conducts miracle tent meetings with three great services daily in the large tent people

and power Reverend Allen has lifted the veils of limited religion and has opened unto many God's way to prosperity as he boldly proclaimed the Bible truth it is God that giveth the power to get wealth it can be said of Reverend Allen as it was said of Jesus the common people heard him gladly in his compassionate ministry they have found a man of God a minister who cares enough and who dares enough to challenge the powers of Satan and set them free the missionary outreach of the a a Allen ministry has touched many far-off lands and foreign fields and now it reaches to Mindanao in the Philippines throngs packed the building and sing with enthusiasm on the inspiring leadership of Ken Rogers Tommy Anderson plays the piano with power and authority as the vast audience enters into that harmony and oneness in Christ in which all things become possible to them that believe expectancy fills the air the presence of God is so strong in the preaching of evangelist a a allen that even the sinners and the heathen sense that this is a supernatural ministry the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because the up anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord how the multitudes thank God for the good news that God is here in power to deliver a little child crippled from one leg three inches shorter than the other is carried up to the man of God how the hearts of the people go out to this poor child as they see the great difference in the length of the right leg and the left but gods man of faith and power looks only in compassion and faith and says Saints believe God God is going to perform a miracle his heart is lifted toward heaven Oh God have mercy on this child tonight and let your power be revealed and let this short late be lengthened and let this little child be made everywhere hold the right leg and the left leg exactly the same length it seems almost too good to be true but nothing must be left to chance brother Allen takes the child by the hand she walks back and forth across the platform not a sign of a crippled condition she is perfectly whole through the miracle power of living faith and the Lord has proven through the ministry of his man of faith of power that all things are possible to him that believeth [Music] bring the food I'm man here Jesus Thanks every Pecha and he sets the free singing oh my did you bring me this man's dinner they've got it ready tend

property with our friends apostle Warren hunter and Kayla hunter and we just wanted to show you some of the things that that are here this is where Allen stayed when he was ministering to tens of thousands of people and this doesn't look like much now but it's like the Lord told me the bones of the prophets he brought us to Arizona because he said he's going to raise up a new generation of spiritual mothers and fathers desert mothers and fathers on the bones of the prophets can you see Allen coming into this trailer soaked in sweat having spent hours raising the dead healing the sick working miracles what an amazing sacrament of revival this is okay I'm going to walk around and I can enter this building from the side but I want to go in from the front the dome from what I understand was used for a phone center and also used for a prayer Center there's a beautiful picture of this dome with the cross lighted up with the Milky Way superimposed behind on the Facebook page for miracle Valley today on Facebook you want to go take a look at that it was an astonishing picture that was just taken here recently can you imagine the ambulances lined up here Ricardo can you imagine the ambulances lined up as they lined up at miracle Valley they're going to line up at miracle mountain and they're going to come away empty because everybody's going to be here vandals have come in and vandalized the property arsonists burned down the forty-seven thousand foot square foot administrative building last time we were here they'd come through and broke it out all the glass is it amazing a controversial man of God like Alan that denominations would not support they vilified and assassinated his character but they wanted to come out here and pick his bones I'm here to tell you God's racing up men and women of God that organizations like that will not be able to marginalize or destroy their reputation and that the world will not be able to dismiss because of unimpeachable Ricardo signs miracles and wonders is that you one man God spoke Warren's grandfather apostle Warren hunter kept talking to him in his 90s about what one man could do and everything you see here is a product of the anointing on one man on one man now imagine coming in you've got a report from the doctor and you need to hear from God the usher opens the door for you and you come in and you hear the people praying up in the prayer dome and people are milling around in the back beginning to file in to find their seat in this three thousand seat auditorium Buford Dale or RW schambach one of those is on the organ and the music in the ministry is beginning the excitement is building 3,000 people in this structure ambulances lined up out the door medical workers in white forms willing people down in wheelchairs you could see the mural that was painted of Jesus inviting people to step into the waters you could see at the front and the stage the ramps where the wheelchairs and Gurney's came up and Alan would be standing there ready to lay hands on them and we have many many videos on YouTube where you could find Alan's altar sessions where people came back to life came out of paralysis came out of wheelchairs came out of death beds imagine yourself coming down the aisle and one of the altar workers has taken custody of you and is helping you along because you're going to come where the man of God is anointed with a mantle from heaven to lay hands on you and as the crowd begins to clear and you pass the seating you come up to the ramp and the altar workers the ministry teams are helping you up and there is a a allen full of the Holy Ghost and fire full of a miracle gift to impart to you and he lays hands on you and it's like a lightning bolt from the glory and you are instantly healed and you came in struggling and you run down the ramp on the other side and out of the building screaming because you don't know what else to do because God has moved and thousands upon thousands coming likewise to receive are they coming to a man I want you to look at what Alan honored above himself I am in the midst of you he always put Jesus first I'm here to tell you there's a miracle even now they threw a dead man on the bones of Elijah and he came back to life here are the spiritual bones of a a Alan and I'm here to tell you today's the day of your miracle today's the day that a new movement of science miracles and wonders is coming into the earth and you are a participator are you willing to be an early adopter of that which God is doing it's a new day says the father and it's time to walk with Him in a new way and begin to experience not just the testimonies of old but a today word of what today is happening because he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever", "QJZOadqXyx4": "hey guys I'm Layne from Food Box HQ here today we're talking about miracle noodles so this is a little bit different for us because miracle noodles isn't necessarily like a subscription box or something like that it's more of a product and you can get it directly from them but you can also get it from other retailers as well so what miracle noodles is is a low carb or no carb noodle that's made in so many different ways they have a ton of different products they've got Rice's they've got noodles they've got pastas they've got all different things but I'm gonna open up these boxes and then take a look at what we've got all right so we were able to unpack both of those boxes and we have so much stuff and it's really really cool we've kind of sorted it into two different types so they have the ready-to-eat stuff which is all back here that stuff is already within just a few minutes you can make it in the microwave or in your stovetop and then you also have ingredient focus so these are more noodles that you can cook into a meal so you've got fettuccine style noodles you have spaghetti style noodles angel hair style noodles and even some rice and then in the ready-made stuff they've got a ton of different recipes they have pho they've got Japanese curry they have vegan spaghetti bolognese they have Thai Tom YUM they also have spaghetti marinara as well you've got pad thai green curry and even some rice so like whatever you're looking for there's probably a version of it so this is really cool I'm really excited we're gonna check out one of their ready-to-eat ones we're gonna make the green curry so let's get cooking all right so it says to tear open pouch 1/2 du inches and microwave that for 60 seconds or you can heat it on your stovetop so we're gonna heat it on our stovetop just open that guy up bad in there I just want to get all that curry in no we just heat it up all right now for a taste test taste like noodles they're a little bit lighter no you know it's not like exactly like normal noodles but so good and technically each of these packages is two servings it's low carb low calorie that's pretty cool all right I'm gonna finish this up I'll see you in a little bit for a quick wrap-up all right so just some final thoughts on miracle noodles I know personally like one of my biggest downfalls is definitely pasta like I love pasta I've been trying to lose weight and all of this stuff and so I've tried the low-carb thing but it never really goes well for me because I always want to have pasta this is a really nice way to sort of incorporate that and sort of kick that craving without completely kicking you off course what's really cool about it is if you go on their website they're compliant with a whole bunch of different diets they have different products for different things not all of their products are gonna be complaint for everything but if you pick from the drop-down menu which one you're following whether it's paleo whether it's keto whether it's your you know the gluten-free you've picked that and then all of the compliant foods pop up for you it's super fast and it tastes delicious I know I'm definitely gonna be using this more often so if you want to learn more about miracle noodles click the link below", "nqtVyf82mW4": "welcome to the hawthorne studio my name is jessica and today we are actually going to be trying out a brand new luxury wax called soy bliss i couldn't say that it's 100 new but it's new to the market it's only been out for less than a year and i have 45 pounds of it and you know what i have tested it in the past before very briefly and i loved it but at the time i was too focused on coconut apricot to try it out any further and i'm really excited to pour some testers with it i want to see what kind of wooden wigs work with soy bliss and the reason why is because there's no information on this wax like i can't find any information on it and no one's really like saying what kind of wooden wigs work with it so we're going to try to solve the mystery with that and i'm really excited to try it out all right let's go ahead and clear off this mess and i'm going to get my jars lined up and i'm going to show you a up close of soy bliss i had to think about it for a second i was like what was i talking about i'll be right back and we're back we're actually losing the natural light so it's probably going to get darker from here on out however this is soy bliss and as you can tell it's not a stark white or bright white and it's definitely a little less white than um cocoa apricot or even virgin coconut soy but it is a brighter white than accusoy10 or 464 so this is a pretty standard color plus the discoloration on the camera probably plays a role as well now this is a very buttery smooth wax i have used this in the past it was beautiful to work with if you are used to using virgin coconut soy or coconut apricot then you're going to be used to using this wax as well so one thing i do want to say is that we are going to do a wickless test method and if you don't know what the whiplash test method is we are basically going to make a bunch of candles without a wick in the center and the reason why is because we are going to insert a wick after the fact that we can take it out and reinsert a new one however there's a trick and no one talks about this when it comes to wooden wicks and we honestly need to because it's a thing it's a real thing um with the wickless test method with wooden wicks is that wooden wicks absorb oil and they absorb wax when you are pouring your candle in it wooden wicks are not primed with anything because the wood is so porous it is priming itself when you pour it in to the container or when you pour your wax and oil into the container that heat that oil those waxes it is priming the wig so it gets ready to burn so if you've noticed when you try to use the wickless test method and you do not prime your wicks with the wax or the oil prior to inserting the wick you're just inserting a dry wick you are not going to get the same burn it's going to be incredibly inaccurate and your you might even have issues with the flame burning out and you know you don't know why you think it's the wick it's not the wig it's your process so we are actually making or i am actually making a different um additional little tin i'm just going to pour a little bit of wax in it from each scent that i make today whatever extra i have i'm just going to pour it into there and the idea is i'm going to set those aside that way i have something to dip my wicks in and let them dry out with those oils and that wax that way it doesn't have a inaccurate burn when i go to insert a new wick in the bad side is is that it's not very um it's not very fast you have to wait for the wick to dry before you even put it back in once you prime it um but i am going to insert a clip right now and on the left side you are going to see the wick is very dark its darker than the one on the right and they are actually the same exact wig however one of them has been sitting in a candle that i had taken out and the other one is in it's just a brand new wig it's just completely dry wick they are the same wick they are the same width they're the same density they're the same type they're the same everything and i'm going to light the left one on fire first no i'm going to like the right one on fire first i'm going to light the left one and you're going to see the difference what i mean when i say prime your wicks with your wax and oil don't just pick any other oil though pick the oil and the wax you are using so when you're pouring your testers just set some aside a little tiny cup uh in a tin i'm going to put mine in 10 of just something you can prime your wicks with when you when you are ready to swap them out using the wickless test method so let me go ahead and insert that clip for you right now [Music] and as you can see i'm going to insert another clip where it shows you the difference half of this wig is primed the other half is not the half that is prime is darker in color and you can also see through it when you hold it up to the light and this is because that half of the wick has absorbed the oils and the wax [Music] now that you've seen the difference you know what i'm talking about now when i say don't just insert a dry wig into the candle and expect it to light it's not going to light and it's not going to give you an accurate burn even if it does light because you haven't changed the way that it is working it's not working the way it should when you don't prime the wick now do you have to prime the wick when you are making your candles now because you're priming it already when you pour your candle when you pull a full candle but since we're pouring testers without a wick inside i want to make sure when i do insert a wick it is primed with the oil and the wax that i use so i'm going to put the wax in this presto pot i already cleaned out my cocoa apricot out of here and we are going to give this a shot and i'm going to heat this up to 200 degrees fahrenheit i'm going to take it off i'm going to stir adding oil i'm going to stir and then i'm going to pour i am going to pour again messing up my words and basically i'm going to be doing the same method i did last time and i'm going to use 11 no i'm going to use 9 fragrance oil and i'm going to use um 11 ounces of wax so one ounce fragrance oil 11 ounces of wax that equals out to be about nine percent roughly or close enough and we're going to go from there so if you watched my last video you know that i had made testers with 11 fragrance oil with my cocoa apricot and 47 blend don't do 11 it's not good it didn't work out nine percent was definitely the winning number in that scenario so with the coco apricot blend nine percent was good i would not go above nine percent um you could probably try 12 or 10 i didn't try 10 but definitely not 11. okay all right so i'm going to let this heat up get this up to 200 degrees and then i am going to come back and we will do the pour and we will see what it looks like in the end all right so right now we are around 204 degrees um i went a little bit warmer because uh these pots that i'm pouring it into are pretty cold and i don't feel like heating them up so we're just going to compensate by heating up the wax just a little bit more so let's go ahead and pour this now we're trying to aim for 11 ounces it might not be exact but it'll be close enough for the test [Music] this part gives me so much anxiety [Music] all right we're at 10.99 that is good enough i'm going to do lavender in the length first [Music] we're going to go ahead and stir this for about 20 seconds or so you want to pour it while it's pretty hot because even though it is soy it is a fortified soy which is different and i don't know if i mentioned this earlier but this wax does consist about 98 fortified soy wax and then the other two percent is food grade paraffin so it's not a lot it's not enough to make a big deal out of it um so we are almost done [Music] okay so now i'm going to go ahead and pour this i'm going to pour a little bit into these tins first like i said this is just for priming for the sake of priming and then i'm going to pour the rest into these jars that have no wick in them whatsoever [Music] okay that was pretty much it i mean it's super simple at this point i just have to clean out these jars real quick before they cool off if you're not doing this already just immediately clean out your jars as soon as you're done pouring because this even though it's a little time consuming it's a lot easier than trying to clean them later after your wax has already solidified it is such a pain once the wax solidifies at this point it's all clean so now we can put it back where i found it um i'm gonna go ahead and pour the rest of these bring this back up to 205 and then i will come back and i will show you how to prime your wax once you are all poured um again i want to emphasize this is only if you're doing the wickless test method all right so i'll be right back okay so i quickly want to show you what i mean by with this test method so let's say you have a link in here you hate it it's awful it doesn't work this is actually one of the failed testers all you would do is take your pliers and remove the wick it's probably not going to be easy to do when you're using wood so then you remove the wick and then you slide a new one in but before you slide in a new wick you want to prime it before you put it in so i'll give an example here is [Music] here's a wig all right it's just a little tiny way but i'll show it to you so you have a new way you want to put it in all you would do is take your excess wax and kind of scrape the top so you have like a good chunk of it on the wick all right now that you have the wick we are going to take our heat gun and we are going to melt it over the wick and let it dry and insert it back in now you don't have to wait for the wick to dry if you don't want to i've done it both ways it works perfectly fine either way you can just put it back in and just don't touch the candle for a while for it to cool like let's say four to six hours or so and then by then it should be dry or dry enough and then you would heat gun the top of your candle to make sure that it is smooth i will just show you real quick with the heat gun let me just go grab it [Music] i also want to quickly add a secondary way to prime your wigs let's say you have your little container that you poured in excess wax all you would have to do is take your wooden wicks or whatever wicks that you want place it inside and what we're going to do is we're going to heat gun it until it looks completely saturated and you'll be able to tell because you'll see the color change just be very careful when you do this and don't touch the container afterwards because it does get very hot so i'm just going to show it to you real quick using my heat gun [Music] okay so now that it is heated up don't touch the wick because it will be very hot we're just going to remove the wick [Music] and we're going to basically set it out like bacon [Music] and then from here we're going to take the heat gun again and we're going to heat it up even further and the purpose of this is so we can basically remove any excess wax on the wig so bear with me just a moment and at this point i'm using the whisper looks right now so you probably can't tell because they are a lighter wood at this point it's going to look darker than a traditional wick and if we were to light both of these on fire this one will probably fizzle out really quickly whereas this one is going to maintain its flame a lot better and it's going to simulate a cured candle burning so this is just the easiest way to do it this one is uncured or unprimed and then this one is primed and you can see a difference in the color [Music] once you're done heating up the wick and you insert it back in you would heat gun the top again to make sure that it's nice and smooth again and ready for a burn i didn't fully heat this one up but i'm not really worried about the wax on the edge um and it's very important when you're doing your testing make sure your surface is really flat make sure it doesn't like dip the wax doesn't dip down in the wick because when you cut the wick it's going to basically self drown itself or potentially self drown itself so just make sure your surface is like completely flat before you start burning it and at this point i would trim it and if i didn't like it no big deal i would do the same process over again everybody i'll rip it out with some pliers insert a new one back in after i primed it and not touch it until it's fully cooled so at this point let me go ahead and show you the end results of the soy bliss i mean this is really a beautiful wax i am so excited for this um so let me just do a quick close-up shot of that so you can get an idea so this is what it looks like i mean how beautiful it looks like cocoa apricot or virgin coconut soy is a great alternative to those waxes right now it is sold out but i think they are restocking soon and these are the just how much i filled the tins like i barely filled them up it's just a sliver because you don't need a lot in order to prime the wick um and you don't even have to do this part if you don't want to you can literally just use the top of the failed tester as your primer as well um i just have some aside so i can do a full burn test but this is pretty much what it looks like tell me what you think i don't think you can get any more perfect than that i mean it's creamy it's smooth it's white there's no frosting it's absolutely gorgeous now soy bliss according to the owner of 1617 her name is vanessa she's super sweet um you do have to wait two weeks in order to get a accurate representation of the hot throw the scent release of when you are burning the candle so that's pretty much true for all natural waxes cocoa apricot virgin coconut soy 464 and the same thing's true with soy bliss there's no difference in that aspect now as far as i know when i tested it before the hot pro was really good so i will be coming back to this to do a two week update um i'm actually probably gonna do a burn test on these in seven days and if you want to see the burn test on that i can definitely go um through that process with you and that's pretty much all that i have next week's diy i didn't have time to do one today because i was stuck in texas um we are going to be doing a tutorial on how to make handmade concrete vessels for your candles and i'm so excited for this because i've been making concrete vessels behind the scenes for like months it is literally so therapeutic to make and we are going to talk about how to color your concrete vessels different techniques different materials you can use we're going to talk about um how to seal your concrete vessels because if you don't seal them concrete's very porous and the wax will leak out which is very dangerous so we're going to talk about how to seal them as well um but i am super excited for that diy to show you guys in case you've ever been curious on how to make your own concrete vessels for your candles all right this has been a really long video so if you are here like thumbs up that's awesome uh thank you so much for watching don't forget to hit the like subscribe notification bell and comment down below what you thought of the soy bliss review thank you so much bye loves", "X7b5DITgHCQ": "[Music] let me tell you about miracle noodles and why they're awesome these noodles really are a diet miracle not only are they zero calories seriously but they're not loaded in lectins in fact they're made from glucomannan starch starch that comes from a sweet potato like tuber called the konjac root well the fiber in these miracle noodles is prebiotic fiber it's the stuff the good bugs in your gut uses food so not only are you eating a delicious noodle substitute you're nourishing your microbiome at the same time so let me tell you how to prepare shirataki noodles the Gundry way here's the thing about miracle noodles and the other shirataki noodles they're a little different from regular pasta they really do smell a little fishy at first but rest assured that smell goes away pretty quickly and it's not fish and it doesn't impact the flavor at all and whatever you do please don't follow the instructions on the package especially if you're using a recipe is featured in one of my blogs or my book instead follow these simple recipes whether you're using angel hair fettuccine or spaghetti it works like a charm so bring a pot of salted water to a boil now remove your noodles from the baggage and put them in a strainer so you put the strainer under running water now if you're not in California you can rinse these for Oh two or three minutes and you'll definitely notice a fishy smell since it's California I'm not going to do it that long because the salted water and the boiling will take some of this process out okay so we've got these noodles rinsed and now we're going to put them in the boiling water and so we're just going to boil these for a couple minutes and we'll cut there and I'll show you what's going to happen after we boil them okay so once they're boiled you strain them again and you put them in a dry pan now here's the secret it put them over medium heat and you and stir now the key is you don't have to use any oil and in fact the oil at this point ruin the process now you'll hear them pop and sizzle and that's actually them drying out the longer you do this the more this will taste like what you think of as pasta so that's about a minute I could go easily for another minute they absolutely will not burn they will not stick it's actually kind of fun to play with once you get used to the fact that they're not going to stick I'll let you in on a little secret while which is burning off if you're a newbie to this the angel-hair variety is smaller and thinner and it'll dry out a lot quicker the Spaghetti is the next up the fettuccine takes the longest [Music] there's an epidemic sweeping this country some would say it's as addictive as hard drugs or even its deadly I'll be honest that's a pretty extreme point of view but that doesn't mean sugar addiction isn't incredibly dangerous for your health [Music]", "84Mv_H7D_SA": "Oh what's up everybody I want to do a quick experiment with y'all farm is very long you know I'm a huge fan of the miracle rice products because it's like really low caloric load I use it a lot during my contest prep it's very volumizing it's like 97% water by weight so there's not very much negative impact on your glycemic index or anything you know so big fan of that stuff I just got a ship and I get like I have a subscription to it I get like bulk packages in but I'm going to have 32 ounces of it so two pounds American rice with four tablespoons of almond butter and four tablespoons of this butter butter for a total of 757 calories 74 grams fat 15 grams of carbs and 14 grams of protein and I want to see I want to test my blood glucose now I'm attesa an hour after eating it and I'm I tested two hours after eating to see how much all of that miracle rice impacts my blood glucose if at all so it is currently seven oh six pm let me uh take my test strip here and test blood glucose so we'll see how much of an effect we're getting here all right sir I lost it in my camera memory was full so it is 709 currently haven't eaten the rice yet just tested my blood glucose and my strip just went dead but it was 77 on the on the test here so it was 77 I was gonna show it to you but technical difficult yeah technical difficulty was like crazy right now so 77 blood glucose prior to eating the miracle rice is cooking up you know see what happens all right here is two pounds of rice four tablespoons of butter 4 tablespoons of almond butter and a whole bunch of caramel Walden Farms syrup that stuff is sweetened with sucralose by the way so I'm gonna eat this and then we'll see what happens that's what it looks like after it's all mixed up on a side note what do you got going on baby baby that does look intense on the other side no stuff is so freaking good it's like dessert it's Gillis place to help us kill us we'll find out soon enough but this second blood says so stay tuned alrighty it is 8:30 which means it's been one hour since eating all of that food to test my blood glucose now for my one hour postprandial blood glucose three-to-one [Music] 8989 all right so I have a little bit of a spike that I was 77 so a little bit over 10 milliliters per deciliter so a little bit of a response they will check it again in another hour to get the two-hour mark hopefully it's gone back down some but on although 10 or 77 to 89 so 12 points over an hour with that much food isn't bad I'd be willing to bet a few had two pounds of standard American rice it might move a little bit more but we shall see where it into our in one hour for the two-hour marks off each other time to take my last blood glucose test it is 9:30 which means it has been two hours since consuming two pounds of miracle rice 4 tablespoons of almond butter four tablespoons of butter and whole bunch of water Farms caramel syrup so here we go see you again we got it up we gon' down 81 81 so started at 77 that was my baseline 8 that food one hour later I was at 89 and now at 81 so it's pretty safe to say that you can have or not necessarily use totally individualized but it's it's cool for me to know that when I'm in a prep automatic Lord deficit I don't want to see the huge volume of food without having to worry about negative consequences I can pretty safely say that I'm good to go eating a whole bunch of miracle rice with whatever added to the one throw in there as long as you know patent based without having any negative repercussions on my blood glucose and very likely my ketone levels which is very comforting because that stuff came in clutch when I was down to sixteen hundred counters today so I'll catch you later that's been all there is to say about this little experiment so uh until next time", "1ZLdq8gZyKQ": "I stood atop the Empire State Building I could see the Statue of Liberty illuminating the gateway to the new world as I step to the telescope and drop down my dime immediately the ticking started again suddenly as the Spirit of the Lord came upon me the fog seemed too clear until it seemed that I could see for thousands of miles but that which I was looking upon was not Manhattan Island it was all of the North American continent spread out before me as a map spread out upon a table instead of the Statue of Liberty standing there in the bay on her small island I saw her standing far out in the Gulf of Mexico suddenly from the sky I saw a giant hand reached down a gigantic hand was reaching out towards the Statue of Liberty any moment her gleaming torch was torn from her hand and in its place was placed the cup and I saw protruding from that great cup a giant sword shining as if a great light had been turned upon its glistening edge as the great cup was placed in the hand of the Statue of Liberty I heard these words thus saith the Lord of Hosts drinkie and be drunken spew and fall and rise no more because of the sword which I will send then suddenly the giant hand forced the cup to the lips of the Statue of Liberty and she became powerless to defend herself the mighty hand of God forced her to drink every drop from the cup as she drank the bitter dredges these were the words that I heard should you be utterly unpunished then as I watched another amazing thing was taking place far to the northwest just over Alaska a huge black cloud was arising in the shape of a skull it seemed that what I saw was the entire North American it spread out like a map upon a table with this terrible skeleton arising from behind the table it seemed to bend towards the United States stretching forth a hand toward the east and one towards the West I knew it's only interest was to destroy the multitudes as I watched in horror the great black cloud stopped just above the Great Lakes region and turned its face towards New York City then out of the horrible great gaping mouth began to appear wisps of vapor these wisps of vapor were being blown towards New York City and all the eastern parts of the United States then the skeleton turned towards the west and out of the horrible mouth and nostrils came another great puff of white smoke this time it was blown to the entire west coast and Los Angeles area then towards the center of the nation came a third puff of smoke in st. Louis in Kansas City New Orleans until it reached the Statue of Liberty where she stood staggering drunkenly in the blue waters of the Gulf of Mexico then I heard the voice of God as he spoke again will hold the Lord maketh the earth empty and maketh it waste and turn it upside down and scattereth abroad the inhabitants thereof and it shall be as with the people so with the priests as with the servant so with his master as with the buyer so with the seller as with the taker of usury so with the giver of years read to him the statue was moaning and groaning she was in mortal agony I watched her in the Gulf as she staggered clutching her lungs and her breast with her hands then she fell to her knees in a moment she gave one final cough and made a last desperate effort to rise from her knee and then fell face forward into the waters of the Gulf and lay still as death suddenly the silence was shattered by the screaming of sirens the sirens seemed to scream Run For Your Lives the sirens seemed to be everywhere to the north south east and to the west and as I looked I saw people everywhere running but it seemed none of them ran more than a few paces and they fell even as the Statue of Liberty fell and finally falling to die on her face I saw millions of people falling in the streets dying in the sidewalks I heard they're horrible coughing as their lungs have been burned with fire I heard the mornings and groanings of the doomed and the dying as I watched a few finally reached shelters then suddenly I saw from the Atlantic and from the Pacific and out of the Gulf rocket-like objects leaping out of the water each headed in a different direction but everyone toured the United States on the ground the sirens sing louder and descending from the ground arose intercepting rockets but none of them seemed to be successful in intercepting the Rockets that risen from the ocean on every side then suddenly the rockets which had leaped out of the ocean all exploded at once the next thing which I saw was a huge ball of fire as the explosions of the h-bomb in the South Pacific the vision spread before my eyes and I viewed the widespread desolation brought about by the terrific explosions in America", "VcQ6nGEbDgs": "what's up y'all so today I decided to film or not feelin I'm actually doing it but like my second time getting a Brazilian wax and I go to this place called cabana wax and Huntsville is downtown if you guys live in Huntsville so this is my second time and I just want to kind of like blog it for you guys [Music] survive just got in here and you have to get a dress from the waist down the same go I did it the first time she's gonna do with the second time and I bought two ibuprofen look over I came in here so I should help a little bit with the pain of the ripping so stay tuned [Music] I put my mom she should find me at her swag yeah she was like No maybe one day yeah [Music] [Music] [Music] sorry literally no slides 15 minutes for her to do it this time it was not as painful as it was the first time on some parts where a little Cindy but okay so as you guys could see in the other clips of me going to get my Brazilian I just wanted to like tell you guys about my experience the first time getting it and like some tips and some things that I learned before and after so my first experience was like two months ago before my birthday and I'm not gonna lie like your first time it's gonna hurt the most so if you have a low pain tolerance I suggest that you take at least two ibuprofen or Advil or whatever you take like painkillers before going in there about like 30 15 minutes like before going in there and like just breathe because they're ripping from the cuticle like the root the first time and your hair is gonna be the thickest the first time so it's just like you have to like prepare yourself even if you have a high pain tolerance obviously just again taking some type of painkiller the first time it lasted at least like I give it like 25 30 minutes just because you know she had to get everything and she's really sweet your most sensitive parts are gonna be like straight down like going towards the lips and like the big Clint area I guess and like the straight line before like your middle part of your vagina because it's the most sensitive that's where all the nerves are and the lady recommended that you do not go when you're ovulating or like it's like a couple days after your period that's when your most sensitive so it's gonna hurt a little bit more when you go those days or times some people do go on their period just so that they don't mess up their rotation of like when they go they just recommend that you wear a tampon a clean tampon when you go in there I by this time I'm in last time I didn't go when I my cycle was supposed to come on I made sure to book either before or after this time going though I took actually took three ibuprofen I know in the video I saw it took two but I took three and what I tell you like it did not hurt like it did the the first time it barely hurt to be honest I'm not going to have a high pain tolerance because I mean I do get tattoos and piercings and stuff but I think I've been pretty much like normal pain tolerance I can't stand something is better than others but it did not hurt took less time like so my hair did not grow back from the last time and the reason I wanted to try Brazilian wax the first time was because I experienced like razor bumps or like like sensitive areas down there like when shaving so like I did my research and I was just like you know let me just try it out because they were saying like getting it wax can help with those things and it did like like the bumps and stuff they went away and like it's smooth down there and like the hair it thinned out like the lady she she told me that when I went in there she could tell like my hair has been doubt from the first time and I will definitely be going back to get um Brazilians instead of shaving I do recommend it to people if you're scared like again just brace yourself and know that the first time it is going to hurt like you can't really escape it that's just it is what it is but I mean like as you go the pain like it's like almost non-existent to be honest so yeah that was my experience and thank you guys for watching", "2zaCGTRU-kE": "honey believe

perfect introduction let's jump right in what our miracle noodles miracle noodles are shaped from the root of the konnyaku EMU plant a type of wild yam found in Japan because miracle noodles are 97% water and 3% vegetable fiber there are only trace calories and no net carbohydrates in the noodles that's why they are called miracle noodles this particular style of noodles is called shirataki in Japan miracle noodle was the leading brand of traditional shirataki noodles sold in the US and today miracle noodles remain synonymous as the trusted leading brand of shirataki noodles the miracle noodles taste like real noodles if prepared properly miracle noodles have a very similar texture and taste to that of high-carbohydrate pasta dishes especially when you dry roast the noodles and add sauce then the miracle noodles really soak up the flavor of the sauce and taste incredibly similar to regular noodles but without the guilt do you cook miracle noodles just like regular noodles no it's even easier to prepare miracle Newell's than regular pasta simply open up the package of miracle noodles and empty the noodles in a strainer or colander then rinse the noodles in cool water for about a minute after that simply place the miracle noodles in light boiling water for no more than three minutes to maximize the texture of the noodles and the absorbability of the sauce dry roast the noodles in a non-stick skillet with no oil for about a minute when you move the noodles around you'll hear a slight squeaking sound don't worry the miracle noodles aren't being harmed they're screaming with joy that they are ready to have the sauce poured all over them for the healthiest meals eat miracle noodles with lightly cooked vegetable stir-fries you can also add miracle noodles to

so today we're making Quito savage kitchen quito fried pasta and pretty simple recipe we've never made this before so it might be a total bust but we're gonna find out today so you need three bags of miracle noodle and I'm using the ziti in the noodle style they look like this boom and then we got three whole eggs we get three tablespoons of coconut oil we almost lost Nate we almost lost the name but three times put the coconut know if we're gonna deep-fry these so it's gonna be kind of hard to quantify how much coconut over actually using you could measure that in the pan and then measure after it's cooked to see and then we're doing one bag of pork rinds and I highly recommend these epic brand pork rinds because they're just way way better from a digital perspective but these ingredients yield these macros 972 calories 82 grams of fat 5 grams of carbs and 58 grams of protein which breaks down to 75 percent fat 24% protein protein and 1% carbs I don't know why that didn't add up in my head but that's what it lets make [Music] all right so the first thing we're gonna do is been straining these out rinse them and we're gonna do this because these miracle noodles have a funky smell all right yo the next thing I'm gonna do is scoop out some of our coconut oil I'm just gonna put it in a pot heat it up and we're gonna deep fry them in here I've honestly never deep-fried with coconut over five always use avocado oil so this is a mystery to me we'll see how it works and you can reuse these you can strain this and reuse it for future frying so while your oil is warming up heating up we're gonna go ahead and put the eggs right into a bowl bit ready for the next step alright now that we have our egg wash I'm going to go ahead and open up this bag of pork rinds crush them up for the batter all right so now we've got our ingredients all ready to go we're going to take our noodles put them in the egg wash kind of mix them all up in there make sure they get all coated with that egg mixture and then from there we're going to dip them into the pork rind mixture and we're just gonna basically stir all this in together all right now we're going to grab this these noodles covered in the egg and the pork rinds and we're just going to dip them into the hot oil and let them fry up all right so these are done after they start floating because when they start floating all the moistures been sucked out of them and you want to kind of let them flow for a little while but once they start floating they've been there for the while you're good to go just dip them out that's what they look like put it on a plate boom we have Vito fried pasta pasta and for crunch all righty young this is done and in hindsight we probably used more than three tablespoons of oil so you might want to compensate for more oil but high fat ratio who's gonna complain there and it's pretty the crispy now I'm surprised usually the miracle noodles are just like slimy but these are actually pretty crispy look so I'm just gonna skip the fork and buy it right in here very good this is the way to eat miracle it'll go pretty good this looks so delicious you can't go wrong with pork rinds it tastes like um it's like popcorn shrimp that's what tastes like popcorn shrimp yeah I'm gonna be showering down on this so give it a shot deep-fry your miracle noodles get the zeny noodles fall in love here we go all right really good yo check it out let me go to think let me know it ain't no robbery even I mean even my little heaven right now yeah so okay Jolie yeah [Music] boom you add cheese you get something like that that's what I'm talking about", "kQnYPpBWMZ4": "[Music] welcome back to my Channel today I'm going to show you how I make my Asian inspired of miracle noodles if you've never heard of miracle noodles this is a low-carb keto friendly option for anyone who misses their noodle carbs so if you're interested in learning how I make my low-carb asian-inspired noodles please keep on watching so I'm going to start off with the ingredients and here I have the star of the show the miracle noodle angel hair Shirataki konjac pate pasta and this is the low-carb pasta it actually only has one gram of carbohydrate and actually two grams of fiber no sugars and no added sugars so this is perfect if you're living a low carb or Aikido lifestyle and we also have here some shredded carrots white onion the white parts of the green care the green onions minced garlic the green parts of the green onion and my protein option today is going to be shrimp I love having shrimp and I have some avocado oil and my sauce is here are the Bragg's Liquid aminos I also have some sesame oil and the rice vinegar so I'm going to show you the type of rice vinegar that I like to use so this is a type of rice vinegar I like to use it it's a natural one and there's no sodium no sugar and I like to use this one because it has zero carbs the other rice vinegar that I used to use had about 2 grams of carbs I believe or maybe 5 honestly I don't remember but this is a no sugar a no carb rice vinegar so this is the type that you want to use if you're living a local Paquito lifestyle and now I'm going to show you my dress these names here I have some onion salt some ground ginger as well as to add some heat I'm going to be adding some crushed red pepper and also this chili garlic sauce and this is also to add some good flavor as well as some heat so I'm going to show you guys how I prep my miracle noodles angel hair pasta and I've heard that there's some of these miracle noodles that actually have a potent smell to it but honestly I don't find that there's a smell in this one so I'm just going to cook them as directed on the back of the package and it says to drain out the package and I'm going to rinse them very well so this is the entire packet of the angel hair noodles and I'm going to rinse it so after I rinse this I'm going to boil this in some boiling water and then I'm going to try it I'm just going to let this boil for a few minute this is supposed to I think take away the stink but because I doesn't have any smell away I'm just gonna leave it in here for a few minutes just maybe no more than five minutes but if yours have a smell to it I would recommend that you took maybe some lemon juice in it to kind of remove that smell so will I have that boiling I'm going to be seasoning my shrimp because I'm going to first cook my shrimp before cooking everything else so I'm going to drizzle some avocado oil as well as some of these dry seasonings I like to add onion salt pretty liberal with that as well with some ground ginger and some crushed red pepper I also like to add some liquid aminos to my shrimp so I'm going to just give a couple of splashes in there just like that just to give it some color and then I'm going to give it a good mix so after i season my shrimp I'm going to cook it in my little pan here just waiting for my panty feet up and you give that shrimp an extra mix before [Music] just dump it all in there you don't need to add any oil because your added oil to the shrimp so once I'm done cooking the shrimp I'm going to just remove it from the pan and set it aside until I'm ready to add to all the noodles [Music] my friend sighs just a couple minutes on each side so you see both guys okay - you know your friend is family [Music] going to be making the sauce and the sauce is to give it flavor the noodles and the dish flavor so I'm going to be adding in my rice vinegar and this one is my Bragg's Liquid aminos my minced garlic some of these crushed red peppers not too much as well as 1 teaspoon just a heaping teaspoon of this garlic chili paste or garlic chili sauce so now I'm just going to drain the noodle and I'm going to dry them so I'm going to take a paper towel and I'm going to just dry all the excess liquid out of these noodles it's gonna dump the noodles in the paper towel spread them out and move them in the paper towel and the consistency or texture of these noodles are like rubber they are made by a plant or from a plant so they do have a texture they're not like regular pasta noodles or rice noodles and happy appearance so as you can see the towel is really moist so you want to make sure to get out it as much moisture as you can using the same saute pan that I need my shrimp in and there's a lot of flavor in there that I want to keep so I'm gonna reuse that first going to saute my vegetables my onions and green onions [Music] good [Music] try to scrape the bottom so that we can incorporate all those bits into the news so I'm just going to move that to the bag I'm going to and I want to just cook it for a little bit not too long and just remove all the excess water that's probably [Music] so it's good man almost goes away I like to eat this because it's perfect for one serving honestly I just purchased these and it was at Walmart there in the total section so the produce refrigerated section is why I am so now I'm going to add in so I'm just going to incorporate it until the carrots just often lightly so just mix it until your carrots become your desired texture so I like going just a little bit soft but not all the way together overcooked - whether they're bending a little bit but I don't want to overcook it to where they take away that the flavor of the carrots so now I'm going to add in my sauce I'm going to raise my heat just to target so for Redick carrots overcook I'm going to now add in my green onion and just sprinkle back home if you have some sesame seeds that would be great to have in this dish since you know asian-inspired sesame seeds are really nice not bad a nice trick give that a good mix I'm going to now turn off my eat cuz I don't want to overcook everything and lastly I'm going to add in my cooking oil and this will just give you the extra flavor sesame oil is really concentrated so you don't want to use too much of it this is how it turned out as you guys can see it looks like awesome Asian noodles I'm going to try this out it looks amazing and like I said I've made this times before and the texture is not like the noodle texture it's not soft you're going to have to chew it and it is crunchy mmm amazing but you know what you can definitely use these miracle noodles and like a spaghetti dish your family is eating spaghetti or chicken alfredo this is a really good alternative so you don't have to miss your favorite dishes well I hope you guys enjoyed this video thank you so much for watching and if you enjoyed this recipe and if you plan on making it let me know leave a comment and let me know how you guys like it thanks again so much for watching and I'll see you on the next one", "dvUF649l1KQ": "I wanted to show you really quickly how to make miracle needles now if you had a bad experience with these in the past just hear me out if you haven't heard of these we think they're awesome at our house their miracle noodles and they're made from cognac and there are zero carbs we love these things this is their fettuccine brand these are thicker noodles like fettuccine noodles and this is the angel hair pasta and the angel hair is more like traditional spaghetti very thin so when I first found miracle noodles and these are made from cognac not soy they're not the sure talking needles they're different I mean you can't find these on Amazon our local grocery store carries them and the Asian food section and they're on the very bottom shelf and so anyway the first time I brought these home oh so excited to use them and so I got them home and I cut them open and I had read the directions on the package and I cut them open and I was greeted by this really fishy seafood smell and my first thought was my family will never eat these they're about 250 a package and I thought I wasted my money but hang in there follow the directions I promise you you're going to be pleasantly surprised okay so when you cut when you cut it open it's going to have a fishy seafood odor I'm not sure exactly why but just trust me I'm going to pour it into a colander and this is really larger than you need but what did you be able to see what I was doing the package if you read the directions actually says that you drain the water of the package rinse them in cool water for 10 to 15 seconds I rinse them more like 30 to 35 seconds you can't ever rinse them I rinse them until that seafood smell is gone then you're going to blanch them in boiling water for a few minutes and then you want to drain them on paper towel I actually tend to drain them and butter so let's get to rinsing they are smelling really strong rinsed anandwali rent but I just put them in the colander i rinsed them pretty thoroughly I'm gently turning them over you'll see that these are thicker this is the fettuccini needle so it is a little bit thicker this is actually my husband's favorite and you can put them with any kind of meat or seafood dish anything that you would normally use better chaining for my rule of thumb in terms of how long to rinse them I don't set a timer but I do smell them so I'll rinse them for quite a while and then I will pick them up and smell them and if they still smell sea Duty or fishy I'll keep rinsing now another thing that I've done is see how long some of these are that's pretty long another thing I've done especially when I've used them in soups and these are great and soups so you can make a chicken noodle soup with this I take my kitchen scissors and I trim them and so pursuits that length or this link is a lot easier so if you thought your return with chicken little soups you aren't get some chicken bones make some bone broth put your chicken in there maybe do some zucchini do different vegetables that are although carb and you can have a wonderful homemade soup but the garlic is perfect for cold I'm just going to clip this in my kitchen shears as it drains and I thought I'm clipped and let's smell it again make sure you rinse it really well and there's no smell and as far as taste once you get there really roll rinsed there really isn't a taste it's a very neutral taste that's why it's great with a marinara a tomato-based sauce or it's great with just butter and works great with seafood like I said a cheesy alfredo sauce any of those things would work with us okay so we've rinsed them now let's take them over to the stove and give them a boil okay so we've rinsed them until there's no smell and our waters about to boil it was boiling before I had it's more water do it and I'm just going to drop the pasta right in oh there's a long one I didn't clip I'm going to drop it in and let it boil now you'll see as it boils that it changes colors it's kind of a translucent color now it will become more white so let's put that in there they make in addition to the fettuccine noodles they make this spaghetti that I was showing you the angel hair and they do make a rice and my family really likes the rice in fact I made some of the other night and served a kind of an Asian dish and when you add the butter and the salt the rice is very similar so we're going to let this boil it says for a minute I've never over boiled it and while this is boiling I wanted to show you and by the way the miracle brand company has not sat me they're not endorsing this and they haven't sent me any products we just use it as part of an important part of our low-carb diet if we're quick meals especially during the week so that's why I wanted to share it with you however this company chefs limited did send me recently a set of their kitchen utensils and so I'm just using them one of the things I love about these utensils is that when I put it down on the CAD nut you can see that it doesn't touch so if I had spaghetti sauce all over this it still wouldn't touch my cad nut and I really love that feature and they're all like that the spatula is like that and the whisk the whisk actually touches the only thing that touches there's a slotted spoon with holes there's a potato masher which I'm going to call a turnip masher or cauliflower masher husband says another expand and then this which I never thought I'd use a spaghetti grower again but anyway I am using it and you can see that it's turning more white than a peg as it boils now again keep in mind that once this is done and I usually cook two packs at a time the nutrition information says that it is less than one car per serving and there's two and a half servings in one package I tend to do two packages and get probably three servings out of that so you might want to count two carbs if you're eating that much of it again this is awesome and soup you can use it with marinara sauce again alfredo sauce Oh homemade alfredo a cheesy sauce any of those things so what I would do at this point and it's boiling now but what I would do at this point is simply drain it really well and serve it with my sauce or I can put it in a pan with bacon fat or with butter cook some of the water out of it and then add whatever I'm going to put with it I could put spinach I could do some chicken I could do spinach and shrimp sun-dried tomato a little heavy cream and have a really nice quick meal during the week so these are miracle noodles I have that your family enjoys them as much as mine", "rFwwaWbOMwY": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

efficiently as possible and today we're not this tangi Xfire alien or live resin bye once again cash value as you guys know this is one of my favorite companies so with that let's hop right into the numbers so thca let me zoom in and get this all nice and clear for you guys boom there we go THC a comes in an eighty point four eight percent Delta 9 THC comes in a two point two percent with the total THC coming in at seventy two point eight if you don't understand why there's three different numbers for THC there is gonna be a video linked at the bottom of this towards the end that goes over that and I highly encourage you to check that out but I also encourage you to keep in mind that I don't buy my cannabis based off of THC if I did there's a chance that I might go past this one considering the fact that there stuff that claims to be ninety eight ninety seven ninety nine percent THC on the shelf but I just know that there's so much more to cannabis than just the THC alone and that I just kind of ignore that number and I go for the other things that I know affect the high kind of like the look and the way if you know we'll go into it and further videos but this is the terpene breakdown they do include this for you I won't go through and name each and every single one of these you guys can check them out right there feel free to pause do some googling and see what each one of these does because each one of these has a different effect and it does something a little bit different so always worth checking out with all that I'm gonna go ahead and open this up let me zoom back out so we're gonna go ahead and pop this open as you guys know they always have their sort oil right here and this is me opening it up and do this alright so let's see what we got going on so as far as this stuff is concerned it looks beautiful look at that color let's see so this is a live resin and it's got no man look at the way that looks the granules on there are so nice I almost thought this was like those THCA dipped in like terpene stuff almost and I was like wait a minute no it's not as far as the flavor is concerned this smells like mango oh my god this smells like mango mixed with like a little bit of skunk enos Oh oh man that is fruity that is incredibly fruity I don't think I've ever smelled a concentrate that smells this fruity it's like yeah it's like mango cantaloupe kind of like one of those like fresh tropical type fruits with that I am incredibly excited to go check this out and I'll be back again with you guys in a couple of days to let you know how this went [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so I went ahead and tried that tangi Xfire alien Arkell sorry that's a really long name and try to remember her and as far as the flavours concerned this stuff has been one of my favorite concentrates I've had in a long time and the reason is because it tastes like candy if you guys remember in the beginning I said it kind of smelled like guava tastes nothing like guava but it does taste like melon it tastes like a really really bright sweet just like candy delicious freakin melon and that's really the only way I can describe it it's really amazing we've been babying this stuff for about a week now and just because it's so good that you just you don't want to just let that go as far as the highest concerned this thing hits like a truck there's no and ifs or buts about it it does give you kind of like a happier euphoric kind of you know lift to it but I would still say if you're a newbie take it easy on this one because no matter what you're gonna be floored if you're more of a you know regular user this is something that you'll be able to enjoy just the flavor and just sit back and then like I said it does give you a little bit of euphoria it does give you a little bit of like uplifting this but I would say that it's still something that you want to be careful with and you still want to wait till you're done doing whatever you need to do for the day before you go ahead and start dabbing this stuff with all that if you enjoy what I'm doing go ahead and hit that sub button if you're watching this on Facebook make sure you follow the page this has been recreational 420 and I'll be back again with you guys soon", "HmP4ROuz2mg": "yo what up youtube welcome back smoking with small town you know the

overfilled it this time but we shall see another nice healthy dab on there nice little dibble dabble let's get her heated up oh sorry i'm gonna get those burps out i like the email so you don't have to do the whole torch thing but i like taking old school dabs i'm not taking them all the same way give you guys a little variety i had a damn frog in my throat these yoshi rigs are pretty expensive i got lucky and wanted a raffle a big i think 25 bucks for it and then an extra 15 for the shipping so like 40 bucks total for this bad boy i looked up on looked him up online there pretty [ __ ] expensive okay let it cool down a little bit so we can get the second hit in so i can get a review for you guys two for the review okay fruity pebbles oh gee crossed with grape pie and it's sunday driver uh like like uh spelled like ice cream sundae not like sunday of the week like day of the week type [ __ ] all right let's go this might be a little hot but let's get it fat dab damn that was a fat ass dad [Music] that one hit me sunday driver okay so start calculating it up price where i got this at blue fire dispensary in merced california it's gonna run you up like 30 bucks for the gram it's a great price the taste i really like it it [ __ ] tastes really good you can taste the terps in it and you take a you know a lower temp dab but it tastes really good the smoothness is there didn't [ __ ] up my throat uh the high is definitely [ __ ] solid i'm getting higher as i'm sitting here so it's a live resin sauce hybrid indica dominant skunk feather let's see so for the sunday driver live resin sauce by skunk feather i'm gonna give it the even eight i really like it it has good terps to it it got me uh pretty [ __ ] baked nothing really negative to say about it the the sauces are really messy they're hard to put like in the car loser and stuff like that so that's like the only knock other than that it's a really good strain if you guys are into live resin sauces or into the strained sundae driver i highly recommend it the skunk feather sunday driver live resin sauce i'm giving it to eight that was my review i hope you guys enjoyed it until next time smoking with small town", "Bb5T554-fKU": "okay thanks thanks hope for a nice introduction and this is a thanks for speaking with the conference to the end and this is a really tough a to follow after three terrific talks and especially after they keep saying Genie words how I tell you this at Geneva that you're back so I was as they speak I was taking our slides that I returned and putting in slice edge they say they promise in the end I gave up so I'm just going to they're just going to give a talk so this is so this is a long day this is going to be a really light talk so I am just going to talk it's a little bit in general about nanotechnology and in particular graphene okay so nanotechnology 101 what is nanotechnology I'm sure I don't have to tell this crowd just the creation control manipulation matters on the scale of 1 to 100 nanometers how big the nanometer nanometer is one billionth of a meter 100 thousands of the width of the human hair and you say ok that's all sounds really small I still don't know how small it is ok so we can try this way you take a basketball and blow it up to the size of the US and the basketball which is here where's my people yeah the basketball is one point one nanometer in diameter so the same scale of blowing up you it's basically a size of a tennis ball so that's really pretty small ok so here's a look at scale of things we can start with kind of human hairs which is kind of smallest thing you can see with naked eye and then you go down three orders of magnitude go down a hundred times in diameter we'll have spider silk and blood cells and eco bacteria is about 200 nanometers viruses about 30 nanometers in diameter DNA is about my 2 nanometers in diameter with this so these are pretty small and if you consider item to item distance in the solids they are point 3 nanometers in diameter so so in one nanometre you can fit maybe three items items up casa really really small high-energy physics which we don't try to try not to work with okay so we say all right so the next question is always why should we care okay so or I would prefer I prefer several answers the first one is because it's there okay because it is edge it is at the limit currently of human knowledge it is fun to just push I'm a lot of the knowledge a little bit more to learn more at this fundamental link scale is such a strange name scale because you know you have huge objects it's actually very well described by Newtonian mechanics and you've had very very small in scale so may order high energy physics actually a lot is known about them actually know that math you know the the interaction etcetera etcetera but on the order of you know this ring scale when you have hundreds and thousands of items actually very little is known about them and what we we always say even in condensed matter physics when theory agree with with experiment with infighter pie it's good enough so that's what we're talking about so actually very little is known about when you have this complex interaction of large number of items that described by quantum mechanics is actually a very interesting problem ok but ok pushing human knowledge video there ok all right so that's the next question next next times I prepared is given by Jerry Thompson who discovered electrons in 1897 so this part of the member asked him is there any use for those electrons ok so his answer is I don't know well sure you find a way to tax it okay so I think graphene nanotubes I don't know about but I think they'll find a way to tax it to okay all right it was s2 doesn't satisfy ever ask a question alright here's then work I always fall back to nanotechnology which is of course starts with this talk by family like Richard Feynman now who gave a talk really missionary talk in 1959 he titled there's plenty of room at the bottom you've probably heard about it I prefer the body but you I didn't realize how visionary it is and here I read it is preparation for this measure actually so he said what I want to talk about is a problem maneuvering controls in a small scale miniaturization he said all the information we're accumulated by mankind can be read in a queue material one or two hundredths of an inch exactly there is plenty of room by the bottom and I did go on to make predictions why can't make the computing machines very small by the time they occupied rooms why can't we will make the wires 110,000 items in diameter and they say if we have millions of the computing elements they can make sure the computer can make judgments ok so that's so this is so that's kind of starts a revolution of micro fuss and micro and nano technology this is Moore's law ok it's not a law of nature possible because lots of lots of physicists engineers and materials NSF have been working on this so it's coined by Gordon Moore the in hell founder who said the number of transistors on integrated circuit doubles every 18 to 24 months so they start with kind of modern number 8 8,000 so integrated circuits about maybe says they speak it may be interesting also so you have eight thousand transistors on them and then you can see now it's actually already 2:30 can you have a few billion transistors on the size of this big you think about it's amazing right fit your every man woman and children on this world unless what if you imagine sometimes string them down and they can fit into something about the size at each of those present little person and to computation okay so that's amazing feat achieved by the industry okay so the another version of the most law he says size of transistor reduced by 30% every 1/2 to 2 years and so you can see it's basic he's actually 2010-2011 he went on to already 22 nanometers in size so you will look at the scale of this naturally naturally occurring things may seem and may things so basically start start out an Intel chip in 1980 it's like a little bit smaller than human hair but still larger than the bacteria the Intel chip last year Oh two years ago now now it's already comparable to the size of a virus okay so it's and so each of those competing computing elements use a size of a virus okay so this is another prospective we can see to what we have done in the past 50 years you know this is one of the worst first computing computers well my calculators it was actually in display and have a science under the future room is ten thousand pound it performs 93 multiplication in six seconds and cause half a million in today's money and of course everyone know we have now right we have the iPhone which you know it's much smaller much lighter and with Giga curse of computation speech it's a camera is a phone with its music player it's a GPS as calculator its place games and keep track of phone numbers it's like extended playing of hours right and it's only three hundred dollars so it's a human this is huge progress were made all because of relentless effort to to make things smaller and smaller okay so here's the prediction that fire has made in night in 1960 so they said I was a time I'd be the room size you think we can make this much smaller now they're of course palm size they say that why the time was about about the size of a human hair and he said they can be 10 200 items in diameter actually now that's 22 nanometer size it's actually about only 60 item in diameter so it has been achieved they said at the time we can only do a simple calculation so I'm and say we can computer can run their judgment of course we have Watson who actually won the Jeopardy I think and probably before long it's going to probably take all our jobs away okay so this is this is a very nice law so well of course we want want you to continue to for another if we can for 20 years but so you can see that here now it's reaching the size of items reaching the size of single items in size of basketballs so and when things are that small a lot of things to happen you have charge leakage for example the you crime so many you know 10 billion transistors as this more niche have them cranked out doing the computation they need to take power the power dissipation becomes larger and larger in the strip that's small and that's why your life becomes harder and harder right so how to remove the heat efficiently it's a problem then this link scale also quantum mechanically first start to set in then you have charge leakage you can have so the little wires and it's you know your face the current current limit you can not carry very a lot of a lot of current because it's just like little future it won't blow up so it's a many minor injures when we try to make things smaller and smaller another things that you can see as a challenge both former physics point of view I think it's also a very inch opportunities there's a lot of an expected phenomena just arising from confining electrons and items through this nanometer scale they still called low dimensional physics and there's interesting properties you know just fun to understand and to study it's just a 1 it's like a gift from nature to tell us something but it's also maybe one we really understand this phenomena we can make them to use make use of this phenomena to fabricate new devices ok so that's some sort of motivation so ok so we are looking at the link scale of a comics link together here ok so let me just go talk about gravity now graphene okay we already has three talk so I don't need to thank you much about it so graphing is basically open you can just pass this around graph needs a piece of soap it's a carbon atoms arranged in the honeycomb rockers high second no structure so it's flat and with a good electrical it's called the electrical conductor and you can stack them up to from graphite you have T to piece or graphene well imagine this goes to many many layers you can have one to four graphite okay and it has been dubbed as the mother of carbon allotropes if you roll it up you can form this is so casino dimensional buckyballs okay see you dimensional because it's small on all three dimensions okay so it's nanometer scale in all dimensions of a zero dimensional bar keyboard and you can roll it up to form a carbon nanotube okay we call this one dimensional conductor one dimensional my hero because it's it's only long in one dimension okay I already add all the other two dimensions are small so it's one dimension and the graphene is to yourself is to that motion okay because it's it's it's long into them and two of the dimensions but very very tiny thickness okay and then we can stack it up to from graphite okay this is a c28 where she's also kind of I just made it okay so a brief history of graphene a alright let me skip this really fast so first we'll make used to mark sheep okay and then you was made used to make pencil and then it's industrial usage it's a lot of industrial use for graphene was still making making crucibles lubricants etc so in the so 1947 theory of graphene of the electron movement of graphene was was or was already discussed so from the 60s or 90s actually the people find there is no sense of more mono layer graphite point of microservices a high vacuum and people this so Eva can probably tell us this but they find this very very very annoying because they really just want to study the metal surface okay we'll come back to that later so soon from 95 onwards here is the time to make graphene a very very fancy techniques like pushing the wrong with this it only force micro so every tiny tip and try to push things around various degrees of success of course in 2004 by the guy and Earl of Manchester a useless scotch tape technique okay so let's we already heard about it and the rest is history okay so there's a huge since 2004 2005 there's a huge increase sudden increase in the number of paper this is the physics free print server where people post the results on there so if Q ography you can increase it almost exponentially and this is restarting the huge huge bandwagon okay so this so a lot of people start to get on board okay so physicists chemists everyone so you know sometimes I have to feel like this guy's okay guidon okay 10 these two guys and I came across Universal of won a Nobel Prize okay so we already know okay so this is the Nobel winning experiment already heard about it but basically just take a piece of graphene and it's like pencil writing this is one two three layers of graphene and this is thicker layer so I can see you can see the type of number of layers just under optical microscope so this is such amazing you think about you can actually see the single light hummock layer of something this is largest piece of graphene we had in my lab a millimeter squared this is piece of my students hair so he's so proud that he wasn't for the head was in comparison see on the same scale and so okay so the Segura as we know is two dimension and so this is not a new system because it's actually is actually has been the favorite system for physicists of study for a very long time past 30 40 years the the thing is that they all these typical experiments require very expensive requirements look for example molecular beam epitaxy costs about million dollars to maybe two to build okay and and you have to do things with it you think scanning electron microscope so but so graphene that's why it's so great is that you know we replace that with scotch tape we can appreciate a good optical microscope right so it makes things a lot easier accessible for us for for three success worldwide because those those expensive equipments also takes years our training are really really difficult to make there so only a few labs worldwide making those type of systems and you have to know one of them be good relationship with one of them 750 I'm just kidding but you do have to you do have to have access to there's very very specialized training for to produce to my dad I manage our system prior to graphing graphing you know you just call up the company and say hey I need some nitro graphics and holes and they send you a bag free of charge and you start rubbing well hire 20 high school students that's that rubbing okay so but on the other hand it's also the most expensive material actually Amanda 2008 it was first point out by sheet office now at University of Edinburgh but so this is a graphic industry happily recession located in Manchester so this fell gravity materials and is taken from the wife at the website it's a pricing guide is about 1 micron square per pound and you will do the best ok the cost per gram is you know 10 to the 15 US dollars okay so then h\u00e4\u00f4s our bailout we save a hundred billion okay this is really chump change compared to the edge national debt challenge okay so if we can only only even we can take the payment make the payment graphing will solve all our economic problem okay okay so that's it so yeah we're army are millimeter square size sample you know it's a it's a should what Amelia anyone are interested you welcome to contact me after that okay so so it's a big bandwagon it's been evolving both in terms of Science and Technology talk a little bit about science a little bit about technology but mostly the science okay so why is graphene the faeces a favorite toy it's a truly two-dimensional and right here oh so this nice remove article physics today written by a professor crime fighter download talking about graphene right one eye another thing is the rich really immediately captured people's attention is a relation loss and Marcin discovered the sheet I think your Idaho talks about it so I'm just go through this really quickly but I do I will show this where she's big band theory I can't believe no one has shown you before mine so I just catch it I just have to show it engage the superior colliculus interesting I usually just have coffee been up all night is it morning yes and I've been up all night and you're stuck why else would a person try to engage their superior colliculus sorry sweetie I can't help you till I've had my coffee penny activity if you don't put him in his crate at night he just runs around the apartment he's either isolating the terms of this formula okay so the idea is that Sheldon let string theorist intellectually about 30 hours emotionally about 29 years the Sheldon Cooper the theorist the shrimp theorist have trouble he's really really really vexed by the problem why election law said math okay so well I think professor Kaman professor andry already explained it very nicely so I'm just going to skip through this so this is equal to MC square if you basically get rid of the mass the energy will be proportional to 2 to the momentum and so that's this is why it's called the relativistic miracles because the energy is just simply proportion to momentum and like massive particles were energies quadratic in momentum so that's relationship it's linear okay so that's why electrons in graphene that has massless relativistic particles so one of the consequence of that is that the so-called client handling which is relativistic particle path row by row perfectly this is like graphing quantum cars that you already seen the here you already seen the animation of also is predicted by Oskar Klein as a Swedish physicist so the problem is this was predictable high-energy physicists but so it's thought to be realized by only a edge of black holes it requires enormous electric field so what graphing you know here's a piece you graphic boom from the pencils so I like to tell my students that whenever you're right yogi you're making black holes for the electrons okay so the graphing is actually electrons in graphene just can basically like this has been verified you can go through the barrier perfectly okay so sorry so what does my group do is my mostly I'm mostly interested in electrical transverse my Charles okapi okay that sounds like maybe dragonish so what does it mean you just need to mention its resistance okay so then your next question is do you really get a PhD for doing that okay so but it actually it's actually very powerful tool to study the electronic states the spin stage electron phonon interaction etc etc you can power the electrons that have charged particles or waves you can study the transport of either energy it's also an art through to fabricate and locate graphene and you have to make something this tiny right I wanna tell me later they can come and connect to your hand that you can turn a knob on something to change it property right so that's that's not easy now I have to perform the measurements and the hardest part is to figure out what the data tell you okay so how do we do it you cannot do this okay you can do this in my life kick you out immediately so so first is we we rub it okay so this is a million dollar piece but but and then I and then look at it and an optical microscope the next thing we do is to make a graphene transistor main meaning we we put electrode of them so here's basically you would put the electrode and next I'm gonna tell you how it for the electrodes on them so this is so basic piece of graphene you put those electrodes and they're connected up to a battery and so this part we call the source is you to Kendra's imagine it's like for sale you think you're injecting the electrons and this part is drain so you cover it so like a drawing your drains the electron maybe you saw that you basically push regulations through from one end to another and then they'll have something called a gauge which is basically like what they see you later you you turn this knob on the game is controls the total number of electrons and grab you can elect you can let you can you know change in the total number and also can change into contacting by the electrons are holes white horse loose horses look okay so so this is this case right so I will make a graph in transistor okay so how do we attach electrodes now so graphene is only why atomic layer thicker it's not very big and even with links are not very large so this is something called reducing lithography this is so-called lithography printing well you all know what lithography is racist people have doing this for ages what do you do is you put one type of lithography anywhere you put the wax layer on the plate against the knife to carve the pattern on the wax they pour ink so then this was staying where the where the patterning is and then you remove the wax and this will give you the pattern this is what something would do very very similar so called lithography this is their same kind they used by semiconductor industry to meet all the computer chips you just own a little bit smaller scale so what we do is so called we put the wax layer on the plate of the wax is just some sort of here we use some sort of a polymer okay and then we use light of electrons in cell knife we use light of electrons because they have very small wavelength for yourself so they they equivalent to a very very fine knife to carve the patterns on the surface so here's the put a circle resist and then you put you put a light on you later on to occur to pattern to pattern it basically this polymers probably the one in wanna light a relational hits which it goes away and then we can the importantly in this case we put my met on top and then he softness works that way all that lift so car lift all that put you you dissolve the resist away and you're left with this little person the patch of metal on the surface so this is a piece of graphene and these are the electrodes so this whole thing is maybe a 10 micrometer long I said well how would make the tiny little relations now there okay and that would measure the devices at low temperature in soco helium-3 fridge the Sidney quick ileum 3 boils at 3.2 Kelvin they actually manufacture for nuclear reaction it's actually was actually a crisis in the in the United States and some time ago because they're not enough helium-3 going around and and I will evaporate helium-3 so it's like a massive cooling the vibrating it goes down to about 0.25 Kelvin this is what I like to tell my students is that you're cooler than outer space it's it's cool literally okay so then we now we have a graphene graphene device so we call it bipolar I feel you fight transistor so this is what you have so on the left side is so-called ho doped so you can think about this it's like an hourglass on this side of a voltage the electron so it's a so called p-type of photo on the right side you kind of feel they feel the electron up to here then it's a electron tubes or endo and so on the right on middle it so called the direct point of the the charging trade points like a glass half empty half full kind of scenario then so that this is actually where the point is really interesting physics happens so the conductivity goes more or less linearly with number of electrons and also amazing thing is that you can carry really high current density you can carry about well microamp Tomic row so it's really this is I think the kind of a record of what can be carriage should not know how the material have shown this and so it's about twenty times more conductive than silicon okay so this is some of the data for my lab this is one of the first thing we do not put in the put the graphene and then we measure conductance as a function of bias voltage which is voltage applied to that battery and the fortune of gate so this is basically a way of looking at 30 megabytes of data at same time we plot the conductances function of color and so then hem this three dimensional plot so the so here basically the red is high conversions and yellow is local nothings now you look at this hopefully you can immediately see I can immediately see that there is this kind of checkerboard pattern right so you can use oscillations you will go horizontally you can see right yellow right you know right you know Meiko vertically it's also you know right yellow red yellow so which means conductance oscillate as a function of K voltage of the bias this similar thing has been seen that this is Theta this is not simulation this is just really very very very nice angle you can see this really nice chat about fashion nanotubes okay so what this happens is that what we have you so cause some sort of interference effect the electrons are basically waves in graphene so they're reflected back and forth between the electrodes and interfere with each other so they come from standing waves and what happens when you're changing either the gate voltage which changes or change the bias as above change the kinetic energy of the of the electrons and that actually will change the wavelength because of changing the energy will change the wavelength and therefore standing wave pattern changes you are going through interference maximums and minimums and that's why you have this kind of oscillation conversions as a function in both bias gate voltage so this is we call it quantum billiards so it's like a paling playing Billy aboard the basics the boys are the electrons the graphene is a table the glycans kind of zooming around inside graphene but they they kind of reflected by the boundary or the by the electrode but but what makes economy said in here the boys are just classical at the supports the particles being in graphene the electrons they are also quantum they also waves of the waves can interfere with each other and so you can you also can see this kind of get this type of patterns okay so I just have to show over this oh the motion of the waves is a molecular well honey not to complain but we were starting to think you didn't either is that really necessary good lord the interference pattern in the fracture the motion of the wave to the molecular structure I've been looking at it all wrong I can't consider the electrons as particles they move through the graphene as a wave it's a wave the moment to applaud would be now troglodytes where are you going aren't you gonna clean this up I'm sorry I don't work here right one bacon cheese okay okay so I'm so the idea is that Sheldon really started working on the problem of master\u00eds electrons and so he has to take up some menu job to liberate his subconscious to work on this tough problem so I'm a final figure out across electronic right here wait so happy father I did not have to do that okay so anyway that's wow this is very nice that's a nice demonstration of the interference II fresh off you like not what you think right okay so so what can this leader so one of the things they so called electron optics for example we can explore the wave-like nature of electrons in graphene we can control the electrons like optics for example we demonstrate a fiber pair of resonant cavity which is rest which is optical cavity and Philippines Gruber Columbia demonstrated for example the PN junctions are spaces for some sort of lenses this is because you expect for example focus electrons making electrodes instead of right now a right answer so no-go everywhere they pass up on a heater defy the heater boundary but maybe we can use it so forth and for example focus elation like we focus optics that make it go interference okay so graphene also have macing mechanical properties which you already heard very nice talks of Jim about that I'm going to skip this it's it's a very strong tough it's very elastic and it's very soft okay soft in the sense that because it's two-dimensional material even though it's very hard to stretchy this way it's a very easy to bend it okay because it only atomic layer seen so this is one of this experiments that grew out of our kind of failed attempts it's one of those as dental discoveries so for example we try to make suspender graphing devices because they ask because a free of suffering they're very very clean so we we try to feel things what we want to do is what messages make trenches on a substrate on silicon wafer and then with our LED positive but again 500 graduates ruff-ruff-ruff a across the trenches and we find that we deposit electrodes and I will finally have very very low mobility and what we think is what the heck is going on okay so they said me I'm saying huh am I still then just say okay we are lost okay so this is the thing is that well a case which one would try to figure what's going on that leads to some really interesting discovery in Salem we try to start an image to look our devices look at this graphic membranes across the trenches and SEM the scanning electron microscope so this is just this is a piece of graphene this is these are the trench so this subtree is a little brighter so it's graphing covering most of the image here you're just looking down really downward I think this is really no really just no a piece of graphene we tilted to 45 degrees of looking at pressuring edge it's still really normal piece of graphene but then you 32 very high angle they have start to see this kind of fringes forming okay so these are very very clear outer fringes and you say look look at almost from the side so then this so what are those those are actually repose so they actually formed spontaneously form ripples and this is some SEM another irrational image this is AFM again Jim talked about using this tip he said how many force microscope using tip go through and you can actually measure you can actually image the look at the profile of this repose here I should really sinusoidal from the right sign from this kind of sign shape and so here's another one this is actually the edge so it's here the tip goes into the trench so this is just really beautiful pictures at least okay it's a really really fun thing to look at and at the time is also very surprising because people's conceptions the graphene is very rigid strong by professor home before it's very very rigid material it's very strong very rigid materials of why we found the ripples that returns out to be understood by just so cosmetics of wrinkling is actually a basic competition of you get energy by you want to stretch something so you can either stretch it but then it's so stiff him you try to then it goes up to the third dimension now I'd received a very life I don't know this is good demonstration you take a piece of saran wrap and then you stretch it then you'll see repost out the format is somewhat periodic right so that's what this is you know nice physical review like I talked about this actually explain how wrinkles form among the eye around the eye first and how how the I post dried out and the hype of those wrinkles so you know Aiko scheme that she's really nice that he's a vertical so finally some that we can't explain I'll take it perfectly and so the so this is very illustrative and take-home message is that gravity is the thinnest in our lab we all have done this this is you every time to a single at how many level this is actually really ugly - really ugly piece of graphing device and because the trench is really ugly just a bad example but you can see this irregular ripples form because a pinned by this rugged address and but if you can pin everything and stretch it so then this is what you have for the Sigma atomic motion I think of a song Malaya bushes oh this is so you after this will never look as he ran right in the same way in the kitchen another really interesting thing about graphene actually you can probably another saran wrap physics if you take saran wrap and put in the microwave a protein in the oven well what happen this post up right it's actually exactly what happens to graphene so this is when we heated up and cool down again we see the ripple so change and sometimes he actually forming so they either had larger amplitude their wavelengths or sometimes he actually the park house upwards from the little tunnel our ghost goes down with sex into the trench and so this is of this year's a movie of okay so here's this electron microscope movie show you a piece of graphene over the trench and why were heated up to 200 Celsius you was flat and you couid aah I hope you can see it becomes your own code so this is just like you take a piece of graphene and you know tightly over a piece of paper where and then you heat it up cool it down again so this is again graphene version of that if you see this very nice figure out the ripples forms around the square this high Seconal and a circular hole and you can also see that the ripples are all aligned perpendicular to the edge so depending on whether your edges so this is basically just the the tenth of the membrane to release there's a to release a stream because from this thermal expansion so what happened is the graphene has actually so connectives thermal expansion it just says that when heated up we actually contract my couid are you actually expand so it's one of those strange things that behave contrary to what you would expect but this happens in Oh two dimensional material for example in a silver gray perhaps in Survivor two and and so because of its large difference in the thermal expansion coefficient in the graphene and a substrate so they're going to cool it down again graphene so they try to release a string by forming the ripples and perpendicular to that to the edges so this is another really kind of really interesting piece of physics again every 10 kitchen you don't think too much about it but then we actually start to understand it from the atomic version okay so what is that interesting this is because graphene is really has a double identity it's also it's a really great conductor of all this amazing in our Charlie properties it's also thinness isolate a membrane and you don't have really don't have any other system like that so maybe we can control that so combine the two we one can explore electrical properties of Rico graphene and this is because when you start to make the items go out of plane depending how you make go those you know orbitals start to enrich themselves you can actually change the electrical properties by doing that so so the shape actually does have an effect on the electrical properties for example in diamond I think Rafi so you can there's various predictions that for example you can produce effective local local magnetic field or even electric field without the external field meaning making graphing go in certain directions or go in circles without actually having to apply this kind of the electric field magnetic field externally so this will be of course really really interesting and these are some of the some of the it's a lot of predictions by the theorists community and it's a little harder to see experimentally as usual your some things predicted by theorists but but if this was maybe last year yeah half ago so this very nice paper from Berkeley talking about string induced my night a few greater than 300-thousand grass in nano bubbles they they were able to create this triangular shape nano bubble and determined that it's actually have electrons on this on this bubble experience my night II feel that's equivalent to 300 Tesla so this is gigantic field if you don't know don't already know the highest magnetic field at least steady magnetic field is 445 Tesla the National analytical lab which actually I'm going there next week try to use well I cannot see I can only access to 30 Tesla field so about a factor of 10 smaller than this this is one of the one of the first demonstration of the string based engineering so based on this you can we can probably just a lot of things to go by engineering a shape etc how am i doing on time two minutes okay really fast okay finally requirement so now I say why the waste of a single layer by layer by layer essentially it's interesting for its own sake the pants for example we would want to open a gap in in digital electronics for because single layer graphene scapulars file a although applying electric field can probably can open a bank app now the introducer is a fundamental understanding of nature for example it's possible we kind of to see the spontaneous symmetry breaking by layer this is similar mechanism of exposures so again last week's conference were debating whether we're going to have a bad weather will see Higgs boson before the higher energy community do so okay why stop to that we go five three one two three infinity so Charlie a gravity is actually interesting this lemme just go through this very quickly what we this is another one of those accidental things we discovered when I started magic try layer graphene this concept conductivity as a function of mobility mobility roughly measures how well how clean this angle is how well the electrons contact okay so then we actually have lots of samples that we see is that so these are the different stacking I will tell you what a stack is well we spy that you said it's excited oh there's very obvious two groups of samples so these are very high quality samples and you can see some of them are conductive and some of them just usually right so this is Felicis conductivity is almost zero and and what we saw then we thought is really strange and we go back and finally actually due to a stacking order okay so what is a stacking order so this you could consider the single layer graphene so you have honey these honeycomb lattice the basically from physics point of view with with honeycomb lattice consists of two triangular interlacing triangular lattice and each other triangular lattice is considered to be different so therefore we have we call a light and appeal as indicated by this red and the blue tart okay so and then you would add another layer the most stable way is to the so carbonyl stacking or a be stacking we should put one of the sub lightest so say the red dot inside the half of the honeycomb lattice okay and the other one respects up on top but but but this but this Rupa but this blue one stack up on top of the red one okay now you add a third layer of graphene the two ways of staking it now so you can stack it as the so called the APA which means the top table is just exactly same as bottom layer this red one is exactly on top of the bottom layer the right one on the bottom layer oh you can shift it by just single item like how medicine she's the hosting so that the top layer and bottom layer also forms the ad stacking but so this part this this red like before on the top layer is now on top of the blue bar the bottom layer so they should call ABA ABC stacking it's a little bit dragonish above is but actually today as you have very very different electronic properties they just okay you just look different I can tell you in detail if you're interested so basically what we do is you can just shift half sheet top sheet by one I how many position will cause a change from an insulator to conductor so that's actually amazing you various think about it and and if you go even further to end layer graphene then actually are 2 to the power n minus 2 different ways of secular layer so pilot is only one way three layers in two ways because for lasers there's four ways to stack it and they each have different pair instructions so perhaps you can change electronic property by simplest by stack if we could find a way to change the stacking so this is actually really interesting so let me get through this so this wonder my hero it's two dimension it's comparable silicon technology strong it stronger see sauce and silk contest can count as heat better than the electricity better carries you can carry a lot more current without burning up and it's also transparent when you look around Oh for example most transparent stuff actually actually insulators for example plastic but graphene is a conductor and transparent so it chemically stable and inert so we just face it there's a fact there's a lot of fascinating physics you know that's what keeps the physics isn't interested but he also holds a lot of promise for post silicon electronics I think now this application already so for example making return replacing and although this is a steal at how older people are working towards it well have the really probably really immediate application is for graphene to to be used a transparent electrodes the touchscreen solar cells LCD displays it can be for some kind of mechanical sensors and it is storage and one of this interesting thing from the Rubik's Cube at Texas for example they take a piece of this painting u.s. pennant you could half of it with graphene half and coated and sticky in the oxygen furnace and commodities Palace your shining eyes completely tarnished so this is really great single humming the entire oxidation film this because it's so so so impermeable to others materials okay so this is expired okay so people are making last year graphene synthesis I think Jim already mentioned it so it's actually see a lot of challenges in this field but we can I want to show the Moore's law I do of graphene we here see you have made huge progress in past five six years this is mobility vinyl which measures how clean how good the devices goes up by a hundred times where size of graphene made is already wound up by you know 10 to the power five hundred thousand times so it's amazing progress I think it's only a matter of time before we overcome the these challenges okay so let me I want to thank my collaborator and also my my students funding support okay so let's okay we have about five minutes for questions and discussion I see someone in the back there yeah I'm curious with the rippling effect do you think you could physically constrain and only allow it to ripple in a certain space so if you only allowed like one ripple to pop up in a certain space then you could have only graphing up in that area and then it's conductive there and then it's not in the spaces you don't allow it what's outside the yes I think you ready yes you can't do that various ways so we're trying out actually way and other groups are trying to do that the thing with graphing I guess it's still candidates outside the ripple region the quake is a matter of fact how much ink and data can we engineer the string in such a shape that makes make it go only where we want it to go so for example with you or the prediction probably that if you can make the string have a triangular shape for example you can create a magnetic field and the electrons will just go in circles we can demonstrate that in the electrical measurement I think that will be really cool yes you had one chart indicating there was electromagnetic interference now is that indicating that it's susceptible graphene is susceptible to electromagnetic interference it was an earlier truth talking about sonic interference yes so that's just there's so many talk this is just only about your electrons graphene I think that's waves bouncing back and forth and interfering with each other when we can observe this wave nature of electrons in graphene in the experiment so let's I think it has nothing to do with electronic interference we talk about electromagnetic interference but regarding that question they're actually also proposals I think from sensor about using graphene as radiation shield because it's very it's very very thin line it's conductive and and also have all the other wonderful properties are being stable being inert being transparent and you can you say to God for example electronic sensitive electronic equipments inside were you talking about going down one order of magnitude smaller than substrates so you would have more interference if you can use graphene as an insulator it be solve the problem graphene is conducting unfortunately well can also be used as an insulator right that's one of the grand challenges billion dollar question this whole field is trying to answer is how to make it insulating or better yet how do we control it so that we want to use everything sometimes and not in so in some other time should not we can turn to make it that way that is a billion dollar question if you answer it you know your provision famous I'd like to ask you you had a 300 Tesla magnetic field two parts of my question one how do you measure it and the second thing is how do you really model the you know creation of it is it just because it's a massless fermion and you're looking at a magnetic moment that okay so that's a very good question the life let me just show it it's not really it's pseudo magnetic field so it's not real magnetic field when they call about its okay it's okay let me it's probably same we go this way what it basically it's only described signify effect on the electrons so based okay so this is pseudo magnetic field okay so it's not real man ID field only described we fire on the electrons for example my night electron magnet if you were go in circles and this will do that and there's also other property I think professor eventually talked about earlier about the electron garbage in high magnetic field will form a circle and our levels there was something special will happen and that's how they measured it they were able to tell from the and the spacing between energy spacing between the lander level follow certain rules is proportional well you know it's actually determined by the electromagnetic field by measuring those Landau levels they are able to tell it's equivalent to 300 high so magnetic field but it's now saying that you you can levitate something okay by putting by putting this something above this bubble let's it's not it's only the effect on the electrons inside graphing they are under the equivalent influence of 300 Tesla so are there any other questions or comments okay if not", "v4tw421XQKE": "now that school is back in session I know you busy moms and dads out there are on the search for an easy keto dinner meal that the whole family can enjoy and I have just the recipe it uses sirtaki noodles in place of regular pasta I get my noodles from miracle noodle they are gluten free and low-carb because they're pretty much all fiber you can get a discount on your miracle noodles I'll leave the link below on how you can save 10% off your order and free shipping when you use my affiliate code keto focus so first you need some shirataki noodles I usually use two bags a pound of ground beef preferably grass-fed you need about half a cup of chopped onions some Italian seasoning garlic powder a sugar-free marinara like rao's but you can use tomato sauce if you don't have that and then also a half a cup of heavy whipping cream a mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese I like the shaved coming it's my favorite so in a skillet you're gonna drizzle down some olive oil in order to saute the onions and then we're gonna pour our onions in there and just cook them until they're softened and maybe even a little bit caramelized then we're gonna toss in our pound of ground beef and break that up with your spatula until it's in little manageable chunks and continue to cook it until it's browned and always make sure you use season your ground beef before it's finished cooking that way that saltiness can get right into the depths of the be fair meanwhile you can start your noodles make sure you make them according to package directions so they taste their best and then head on back over to your skillet with your ground beef and your onions and now we're gonna start to add our seasonings going pouring in some garlic powder you can use whatever combination of seasonings you want to use this is just my favorite it's garlic powder and then a little bit of Italian seasoning the real simple [Music] and now comes the time to add your marinara sauce like I said before I like the Rao's brand that I pick up at thrive market it's great because there's only four total carbs for a half a cup of it like most marinara czar about like eight or nine grams which are kind of hiring sugars but you just pour that in but like I said you can use whole tomatoes crushed Tomatoes a little bit of tomato sauce but this is my favorite so far so we're just gonna pour that in and mix it until it's all combined and then I like to add a little bit of water just to thin it out too and then after that we're just gonna cover it and let it simmer for ten minutes or so or as long as you have the longer the better and once it's a nice and summery give it a good stir again and then this is a port where we add in our miracle noodles so after we've stirred that to combine it we're gonna pour in that heavy cream and mix that all in and then usually at this point I'll kill the heat and add in my cheese's like the mozzarella cheese and even a little bit of Parmesan cheese too I actually got the idea of adding the cheeses and the heavy cream to my spaghetti from an old college roommate of mine she was actually not Italian she was chinese-american but she made the best spaghetti [Music] and now we're ready to serve that was really simple guys this is such a great meal that you can make on a busy weeknight and don't worry I'm gonna have more ideas for you super simple keto meals that you can make for you and your family coming up so make sure you subscribe to my channel keto focus and don't forget to hit that Bell so you don't miss any of my videos in the future [Music] you", "FIZCRY7vc2c": "oh [ __ ] oh thanks Trey them [ __ ] go hey are we salad clouds around hey what is up can of famine welcome to another product review video so check it out for this product review right here I'm gonna be trying here for the first time this is the golden lemons by Willamette Valley alchemy this is a one-gram BHO coming in at 72 percent THC with 0.8 teen percent CBD and then it's got four point seven eight percent terpenes and that should be pretty good alright should be should be okay I haven't had a bad one yet for from Willamette yet so that's that being said we're gonna go ahead and over before I open it let me just show you guys that look at that that is beautiful beautiful look at that nice stable if you can feel it it's actual shatter so it's nice and stable it's got just a nice beautiful golden color to it go ahead and open this they make everything child safety protected everything nowadays [ __ ] anyway so this golden lemons is in fact a hybrid and there we go that's it out of the package look at how beautiful that is look at that that is some amazing looking stuff let's see if we can focus better on that look at that they're way better that looks delicious guys I can't wait to try this I can't wait right alright so for this product review I got me a new nail here this frosty OPEC quartz nail and I'm gonna be using the fruit detox nano rig here by Empire Glass Works [Music] [Music] all right so we got our nail nice and hot it's gonna take a minute to cool down there and in the meantime we're gonna get a DAB ready here on our he a damn stick and anytime you got shatter anything you know really shattering really like that glass shatter because I know a lot of people have a hard time dealing with it on their dab stick all you got to do is once your nails hot you just kind of hold it underneath your nail for just a second or two that's probably long enough and then you should be able to slice through your shatter like warm butter you know what I mean or if it's in chunks like this one is you should be able to just pick up a nice chunk just like I did see and that is the effects of having a warm damp stick anyway make sure [Music] this is a virgin nail by the way this is is literally a virgin nail it's never had a dad before this is literally its first dem golden lemons by Willamette Valley alchemy alright gets gets the pleasure of blessing this virgin nail I mean good always I mean that's some damn good dabs to start your first day off on the nail so anyway all right so golden lemons let's see how it tastes I hope to god it has a lemon taste I really do anyway I love you guys thank you smash that like button show your support and let's get it all right that's pretty good that's pretty good that's pretty good that is that's good huh first off let me just say it's not like super lemony okay it's not like a burst of lemon in your mouth okay that being said okay that out of the way I really like it I really do enjoy it it's got almost everything you want and as you can see it hit me pretty good it's got a good high it's got a really good high my eyes would not like this before we did this dab it's got a nice high a nice relaxing high to it it really does it kind of hits you it's right where you want to be so if you're somebody that I mean even somebody who has a high tolerance this would do it you take a good size to have of this I can imagine you'd be a pretty floor for a while okay I couldn't even a bad taking like the whole gram that would be you'd be floor to instantly off this that's awesome but nonetheless seventy-two percent THC I believe let me just double check I'm sorry I took it down 72 percent THC that consistency that though you know just everything to it the look everything I mean the highs great the terpenes taste great I haven't even gotten to that but we will everything that you want about tabs is there everything you want about good solid quality gaps is right here in this product okay and in my opinion okay now maybe your opinion differs which you should let me know in the comment section below if you do have a different opinion if you've tried this product or if you you know have this company let me know your thoughts but the terpenes overall the taste the flavor it's really good okay you get a little bit of like a lemon citrusy tinge you know mixed with like a sweet earthiness okay and it's got just a nice well-rounded well blended terpenes to it I mean you get almost an equal amount of each flavor and its really good I really enjoy it that being said I mean yeah I would definitely give this product two thumbs up to big thumbs up and the reason why is because all those things I just mentioned plus the fact that you can get this for about twenty four dollars a gram that's what I've paid for it depending on what dispenser you go to here in Oregon the prices may vary but about twenty four dollars at grandmas what you're going to find this product at and that is phenomenal to find a quality that good at a price that good okay I mean very very few far between okay very few companies are very consistent like Val amat Valley is they make a very good consistent product you can almost just blindly pick one of their dabs and no matter what it's gonna be at least decent quality goodness I mean it may not be the best of the best it may not be the ultimate Terp sauce shatter live resin just lit whatever the [ __ ] but you know it's it's still gonna be good quality especially for shatter for just BHO you know it's gonna be definite good quality so I highly recommend it I highly recommend picking up some Willamette Valley out to me and if you're going to or you might as well pick up this golden lemons and let me know what you think about it okay let me know what you think about the golden lemons all the lemons golden to you are they nasty boo boo caca let me know your thoughts and opinions in the comment section below", "PFjdOwWUX6Q": "all right below my sister

channel today's video i'm gonna be waking and baking for you guys i got a pre-roll from the dyspo it's a gelato pre-roll um from west coast trees go ahead and show you guys the west coast trees yeah west coast trees um it's a hybrid pre-roll it's gelato it's one gram costed six dollars from the dispensary but um unfortunately it says specifically on the package i didn't say it online when i picked it up but it says on the package it's the sugar leaf cannabis pre-roll which means it's made out of trim and [ __ ] um usually i like smoking um all flour pre-rolls or flour and infused with a concentrate but this is just going to be a regular pre-roll from the dispo with sugar leaf trim and all that so it only comes in at 13 thc not too high at all but um we'll see if it smokes good see how it lights up and i'll definitely give you guys my opinion on it it smells really good it doesn't smell like sugar leaf everything i do but i'm gonna open it well i don't need to open it they already told me it was sugarly [Music] this is what the joint looks like gelato west coast trees pre-roll it's a hybrid i believe uh gelato is indica dominant hybrid though so it's like 55 uh indica 45 sativa but let's go ahead and get this uh spark up pretty close get it to focus [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] how it tastes the bud definitely does taste like some um sugar leaf or trim it doesn't taste like normal bud it's packed down pretty tight i guess that's how they fit a full gram in there [Music] probably gonna smoke this whole thing this morning trying to feel some type of buzz i was debating whether or not i wanted to roll a blunt or just smoke one of these pre-rolls but i guess the pre-rolls [Music] as far as if it smokes smooth it smokes really smooth um the taste isn't the best as far as for the taste i'd probably give it like a 6 out of 10. but as far as for how it smokes it smokes pretty decently smokes like some premium flour this is my first smoke session of today i haven't smoked anything else besides [Music] this [Music] hope you guys are smoking along to this video hopefully you guys are smoking on enjoying a blunt a dab rig bong whatever you guys are getting medicated [Music] this is kind of a review of this product but it is kind of just a session as well [Music] i'll let you guys know how i feel about it and if it hits good and if i pick it up again then you guys can uh make your own choices from there [Music] as far as if i pick up this pre-roll again i don't think so i'd probably pick up a different pre-roll just to test it out i didn't know it was gonna be sugar leaf but um what else can you expect for only six dollars from the disposal especially if it's a full grain [Music] i've been to other dispos where i could get a full gram of premium flour for three dollars a pre-roll so i was just wondering but this is some sugar leaf [Music] i know this is uh west coast trees i'm not sure if they're connected with um the other west coast products this may be their pre-roll line um ibs district lbs distribution i don't know what the hell that is [Music] it's burning really slow it's pretty nice long burning joint [Music] if you guys see me messing around over there i'm just changing what song is playing with hiv keep being you and ask your doctor about the target big target you guys ever want to request for me to play a song in the background all you guys got to do is drop it in the comment section down below a lot of my best to play that song and i'll let you guys know that because it's what's important to me whenever i'm watching a youtube video um [Music] if you guys ever want to know what song is playing in the background then you guys can leave a timestamp down below and i'll do my best to let you guys know what song is playing don't think i'm getting too high but i definitely [ __ ] up my wording right there so maybe it's doing his job about halfway done in this joint [Music] as far as if it tastes the best um it doesn't it tastes decent um [Music] the only problem i have with this is that it's not getting me high like i thought it would it's um just something to smoke on really can't really expect too many effects from this [Music] i'm a little disappointed with the product because this is my waking bake and usually it's the easiest for me to get faded towards the morning time and i'm not feeling that faded feeling at all feeling pretty baseline still [Music] it's a bit windy out so it'd be pretty difficult to do any tricks right now i could try and do like a ghost or a french urine i'll see [Music] gotta watch how i breathe in the smoke that was a better ghost anyways this pre-roll was pretty decent overall it was probably like a five out of ten um doesn't get you too faded um but it is something to smoke on that isn't tobacco to weed i'm gonna go ahead and end this video if you guys enjoyed so far make sure and slap the like button down below if you guys have any comments

we own the low carb grocery and today I'm going to show you how to make these instant pho noodles bye miracle noodle and what's great about this is that it's really easy to make there's virtually no prep required all you need is a glass of water technically I'm going to show you how I kick it up a notch to make it even better I'm going to open this up and show you what's inside so inside you'll see that there's going to be a packet of noodles and also there is a sauce packet that's your full broth we'll add that later let's just go here and open it and rinse it out okay and I'm gonna throw them into the pan don't need any oil or anything like that just just throw it in okay now from here we do is we add some water that's four glass of water and we're gonna empty that packet of the pho broth concentrate and I'm going to cover the boil so while we're waiting for this to boil let me just kind of show you a couple of features of this product it's gluten free it's vegan it's dairy free and is grain free it's 40 calories per serving although I think there's two servings per bag so let's just say that's going to be under 100 calories okay these are made with sure tacky noodles sure attacking noodles are a very low calorie zero calorie depending how much you consume noodle that's made from a vegetable okay and so so what's nice about this is as much lower in carbs and everything I'm gonna do today adds very little or negligible amounts of carbs to the meal itself so they're very filling because the fiber really great if you're in a time crunch to make a meal so this boiling now when you can see looks kind of like an instant noodle doesn't it and I can already smell the broth it smells really good this is my favorite ready meal now I talked about how I'm gonna kick this up a notch you could serve her like this it's vegan in this form but I like beef so beef oh so I'm going to put in some beef slices into here okay and your local butcher may already offer thinly sliced beef so you can use that and just cook that in for flavor on top of that the other thing that I like to do is put in some garnishes if you ever go to a Vietnamese pho restaurant they always put in green onion and cilantro and in case you didn't know the most tasty part is this part here so we want to make sure we get a lot of that in there I'm just gonna dice it here and put as little or as much as you want I like to put a lot in there just throw it on top and cilantro some people don't like cilantro I would allow people to add their own slab know if you're making it for for your family or for for friends let's throw that in and this cooks really quickly okay the green on you and it's not show you're really just stirring it in and you even don't need the beef to cook all the way because the beef will continue to cook even after it's served and now that it's done all we got to do is transfer it to a bowl this could be tricky but let me get lucky here there you go and there is my miracle noodle thanks for watching check out the low carb Bruce calm thanks", "gVTZppltMSs": "hey guys Cassey here and welcome to my kitchen on today's edition of food bytes I'm remaking pad thai super healthy pad thai with the help of miracle noodles these are shirataki noodles now if you haven't heard of them these are zero calories zero net carb noodles sound kind of too amazing to be true well I did a little bit of research and these noodles are actually made out of this root called cone yuk root I hope I'm saying that right and the fiber in them is called glucomannan I think that's how it sounds I actually searched on Google for like 20 minutes on how to say this correctly so if you guys want to badger being on how to say glucomannan go ahead cuz I really could not even find one place I would tell me how to pronounce that so anyway this glucomannan fiber is water soluble so if you have constipation okay it actually helps because as it goes through your stomach and your small intestines it really soaks up that water and creates a nice bulk for you to be regular anyway not only is a zero calorie it helps you with your regularity so guys going to be using the zero calorie noodle along with tons of vegetables chicken breast in our own homemade pad thai sauce for a super low calorie meal for this dish I'm using a small onion two carrots three cloves of garlic a steamed chicken breast 1 can of straw mushrooms a small crown of broccoli and of course my two packs of miracle noodles they are 7 ounces each and now for the sauce one of the most important parts of this pad thai you are going to need a quarter cup of soy sauce right here I have key cumin less sodium soy sauce tastes amazing you're also going to need 1/2 a cup of lime or lemon juice 2 tablespoons of peanut butter right here I'm using better and peanut butter it's actually a substitute only to 100 calories for 2 tablespoons so I'm doing that so that I can reduce my calorie intake you are also going to need 2 tablespoons of hot sauce I might even have to up that and finally 1/4 cup of sugar here I am also substituting sugar for Splenda which cooks very well so because these noodles already come instant all I need to do is open the bag pour it in some warm water let it sit for a couple of minutes while comparing everything else and then dinner is done all right so I've left the steamed chicken going that should be breast in there and then the next two things that are actually become in that pot are going to be my carrots and my broccoli just for like a little bit like two minutes or something I am a big fan of steaming even versus boiling because all the nutrients actually stay in the food versus coming out into the water okay so I'm going to go ahead and chop these up and get ready to add it into the pot so my carrots I'm just turning them into tiny circles which is pretty much like the easiest thing ever you can do with carrots so once you're done with the carrots I've got my broccoli on hand and you're just going to simply cut off those florets and you make nice little pieces of broccoli um of course you always use like bok choy or added bean sprouts or whatever you want I love broccoli I love the green color that's gonna add to this dish so that's why I'm using pork alright so now that everything's all chopped up we're just gonna place it in the steamer for like one or two minutes you don't want them to be too crazy like cooked up because we are actually still going to be sauteing them with the noodles so I was that steaming I'm going to get my other sauteing vegetables ready my green hundreds my onion and my mushrooms all right Rahl sterics tiny sauce okay let's mix it all up ooh I feel like creaminess in there from the peanut butter let's go ahead and put it in the microwave all right it stops all this stuff it smells really good so let's give it t remember it's going to be a little oval a lot more intense than when you actually put it with the noodles so that in mine mmm oh my gosh it is so good umm I love eating spicy so two tablespoons pop glass is like fine for me I would suggest for those who that don't like office either just skip it altogether or just include one alright we're going to start first with our minced garlic alright now we're gonna add our medley of veggies our mushrooms and onions pretty good and in the veggies is chicken and the sauce okay time you can add half of the sausage okay laughs okay I think it's time for those shirataki noodles yeah these are miracle noodles fettuccine style so you guys got that wide little thing going on all right Lockman I cannot wait for this to be all done okay I'm going to pour the rest of my sauce in right here right I don't help you and there you have it guys look at that beautiful simmering pad thai I cannot wait to taste this dish all right so before we take our first bite I need to tell you the nutrition info now if you take a look at how much I actually made um it filled up a whole pan okay so look at that I am going to divide this by four servings okay but no need to feel guilty because one serving I just calculated this Anspach recipe calm a hundred and forty eight calories what that's so crazy so if you eat two servings no big deal 300 calories whoa okay so here goes and dividing it by four I've got one hundred and forty eight point one calories for this meal three point three grams of fat thirteen point five grams of carbs four grams of fiber and eighteen point eight grams of protein if you're vegetarian go ahead and sub that chicken for some tofu um and it is time to take our first fight are you ready I'm so excited okay here we go I'm gonna grab a little bit of everything making it a full bite here with this noodle oh my god I'm so excited okay here we go mmm oh my god I don't think I ever need to go to a Thai restaurant again this is amazing oh my god what you probably want to know how the noodles taste they actually they don't bother me no it is really good they're a little bit on a chilly side but I also tend to like to eat chewy so it's absolutely perfect and for zero calories I am not complaining this is absolutely delicious sighs I wish I could invite you to my kitchen and let you have some because I am honestly so surprised that we just made that like it is so good you guys you have to try this pad thai I am like so excited right now well like Holly bounced around my mouth I've been on fifty calories I wish I could invite you all over for dinner because I've got four servings now this is really gonna fill me up the glucomannan I've read some studies it says that it does help with like weight loss and diet because it fills you up it makes you full for a long time but you know it depends on how you feel and how much you can actually eat I mean I could probably eat that whole thing but I'm not going to because I would rather spread it out over four days so miracle noodle guys success I love it zero calories zero net carbs soy free wheat free kosher I love these noodles I'm gonna beat adding it to my daily diet and they they'll come up with more recipes for these noodles so go my blog at Blogilates calm and I'll have some comments and tips there on how to create this recipe step by step okay I hope you enjoyed it I wish you good smell I'm just gonna go ahead and eat this all up right now", "Q3GSHvcpaPc": "what's good everybody Sacramento driver here for exclusive Karen today I am reviewing the panacea 21 galactic gas sauce smells like pomegranates and blueberries and oh

"WLI6KkjO5mc": "hey everyone welcome back to my channel thank you so much for taking the time out your day and checking out this video this video is going to be my february candle and wax melt empties i don't have too many candles mostly wax but i hope you will stick around for it all right let's get into candles i did two of these huntington home frosted vanilla candles i have a couple of burns left i do have two of them because they were in my living and dining room they have really cute snowflake lids it is a vanilla scent but it smells very like reminiscent of warm vanilla sugar from bath and body works like it's a very body carry slightly perfumey but like not floral a little bit powdery type of vanilla scent very very pretty it is pretty strong for a vanilla scent now that i've got two going they did struggle a little bit but i did not cotton ball either of them they i just let them burn i never trimmed the wicks that is the trick for these huntington home three wicks don't trim your wicks and you will be good to go they pulled out just fine a little bit of residue on the side but not a big deal at all so i did like these these were from their one of their christmas collections i like them i would repurchase that scent if it ever made a reappearance another huntington home is this xoxo candle from their valentine's day collection so stinking cute with this wrap around label absolutely adorable it had red wax but as you can see it did not do so well so this actually looks pretty good i wound up taking like the first half looks great you know not much on the sides at all i want to taking a spoon and scooping literally like probably half of the candle out because it was just stuck to the sides and then this is what's been left i just left it let it burn let it live its life but yeah it's um it's not great not great to burn but i haven't had to cotton ball it i actually will say that this one has burned better than the pink sugar macaroons yes there's residue on the side but at least the flames have stayed upright they haven't gone completely sideways the scent is really lovely it's like a strawberry kind of fruity girly scent yeah very nice it is strong i think it would be phenomenally like blowing out the house strong if it could pool all the way but it doesn't so i have this in the kitchen i think i have like one bird left and uh it does okay it's all right they the scents in that collection they killed it performance no no no no so they need to re-release that collection just better wix then we have a mainstays warm apple pie three wick candle i love these little guys so cheap so affordable but they do so well i mean look at that that is that's a that's an empty candle burned all the way down this is not as apple pie as you would think on cold you get a little bit of cinnamon but when you burn it it really just kind of smells like a very sweet slightly tart red apple i don't get much of the cinnamon i get no pie crust but it is a very pretty scent still it's not like a macintosh apple it's got a little something else in there but i wouldn't be able to walk into a room and be like oh that's apple pie but i would still get it because the price point and it performs well and you could smell it i had that one in the kitchen as well and then the last candle is lavender vanilla from bath and body works this is a one wick really cute packaging just very plain simple i love the pop of purple this one left a lot of wax again just like my last months did and it is burned all the way down to the wick clip it did set a little bit right here just a smidge because this was a super super thick wick i mean really really thick so one of these burns in the middle it got away from me and it sooted a little bit but nothing too too bad wick steed perfectly centered it never had a problem pooling out it was so strong loved it i just wish that these would burn a little bit more because that's a that's a decent amount of wax especially when you only have seven ounces in here that's probably about an ounce of wax and the price point they want you to pay for these 14.50 no ma'am we do not play with that price no but i do love these i think that they just perform really well for me a lot of people say they don't like them but i i do personally i think that they're great especially for the bathroom okay on to oh look i have one more candle sorry one more i forgot about this is the sand and fog pumpkin coconut this is a soy candle that i got from where are you tj maxx for 7.99 this is a really pretty matte navy blue jar it like got really gunky like as soon as you started to touch it it lost its prettiness but it has a very pretty wood lid that says together and thankful you know it's got the story of sand and fog i did not like this at all this was a two-wick and you can kind of see that it does not pull out all the way i had to have this in foil its whole life like i would just constantly have to have it in foil or else it would not burn all the way i do have about maybe a third of it left and i just cannot bring myself to finish it it is a super slow burner because it is soy which is great but i don't like the scent so i'm just i'm starting to try and get in the habit of if i don't like it just move it on like you don't have to finish everything so yeah i'm just not a huge fan of this one and it i just can't even really explain the smell it smells like a very almost caramely sort of pumpkin i don't get a lot of coconut it's just kind of sticky sweet it smells like a slightly burnt when i light it and it's melted i just i can't get down with this one so i would purchase sand and fog again if it had three wicks because you know 8.99 for kid or 7.99 for a 12 ounce candle isn't too too bad i don't think um and the fact that they burn very very slow is great and the lid is nice i liked the matte packaging but that scent was just not for me i have two boxes of tea lights one in the blue summer sky scent and one in the old school french vanilla i love the french vanilla tea lights they're the best but i just use those in my tealight warmers honestly you can't even smell them i just use them because they last like the perfect amount of time somewhere between four and five hours they last so it's perfect for my tealight warmer alright now we're getting into wax all right let's oh gosh let's start with clam shells we'll do that i have teddy bees witches be crazy this is birthday cake pecan waffle sugar cookie dough and a pinch of cinnamon spice vanilla i love this scent so stinking good absolutely love it i have so much of it my stash i will forever repurchase just a beautiful pumpkin pecan or not even pumpkin just pecan waffle scent like extra creaminess extra bakery so good so strong love it love it love it i can't rave enough about that scent from better homes and gardens we have orange buttercream cupcake this is a tried and true favorite this smells sort of like fruit loops but better because i'm not a huge fruit loop or like fruity pebbles type of person but this is so good so so so strong even in a scentsy bulb warmer it does phenomenally i love this i would repurchase that always from sensationals we have cupcake it says fun playful and calorie free just a plain basic vanilla scent i like this in a tea light warmer it does not do nearly as well in a 20 watt hot plate tea light is your way to go for this because it becomes much stronger fills the space way better just a nice creamy vanilla type of scent from super tarts we have casper this is oh my gosh i can't even read this toasted marshmallow vanilla bean noel cornbread and mexican fried ice cream this is old from 2018 excuse me not too squishy because the clam shell what i mean the wax was white so it's not too squishy this is it's good but it's light for sure when you put it in the warmer it supercharts is usually like a one cube wonder you don't need a lot but this one was lighter i definitely used two cubes of this nice scent though a little bit rich from that cornbread and that mexican fried ice cream but creamy and sweet so i like that one i'm pretty sure i have another one from zape i have now naughty housewife this is clean linen juicy berries exotic blooms and vanilla this is gorgeous this is such a pretty feminine scent without being floral and perfumy i really really like this this smells like a fancy hair product it really does like imagine like you're at the salon like you're getting all girly you know get your hair did um and they just put like the most fabulous smelling hair product on you that's what it smells like it is just gorgeous i love it i don't i'm not gonna repurchase from zape just for personal reasons but i really really really like this and would recommend this one to anybody because that is it's a super pretty scent and it was very very strong from southbound we have super sugar cookie this is freshly baked sugar cookies with sweet vanilla so good so strong just exactly what it is super cook super cookie sugar cookie like on crack it is just so so good so vanilla e heaven i love it her bakery and vanilla is just out of this world good she nails it absolutely all right and then from goose creek we have peanut butter sugar this one's older i don't know exactly the year i should have honestly dated these but it started to turn yellow so i said girl you gotta go this is great i honestly don't really think peanut butter when i smell it i think marshmallow like a warm marshmallow with like something else in there but i don't necessarily say peanut butter it's a great scent though i mean i have a candle in it i think left or maybe two candles honestly i don't know but very very good scent i think they even remarket it or repackage this as something else i can't be sure but this is a good scent it did well all right on to we'll do bags we'll go through some bags rose girls vanilla crunch donuts this is her mini melter bags good just lost a lot of scent towards the end because this is from 2018 so just wasn't nearly as strong so gotta you gotta use that one up if you have it from silky soaps and scents vanilla lace whipped cream warm vanilla sugar a very nice then just literally just vanilla scent very warm a little bit like body care um pretty type of vanilla but i just don't get the performance that i need out of silky so i would not repurchase from l3 waxy wonders we have sugar cookie dough pink animal crackers mallow fluff really nice blend her pink animal crackers is not my most favorite like animal cracker scent it's good not my most favorite but i did enjoy this the sugar cookie dough and the mallow fluff kind of saved it not enough to repurchase that though because i would just have her i'd rather have other bakery of hers rose girls coconut pumpkin marshmallow cupcakes i would have loved this if that cupcakes was not cupcakes at tiffany's i was so excited to smell this when i got it and i was so disappointed because it's cupcakes the tiffany's not just like plain vanilla cupcakes that would have been way better but from this blend all i got was the cupcake at tiffany's and i'm not a fan of that one so that won't be new candy corn streusel kukin from rose girls these are oh yeah these were both her um muffins that i cut into fours candy corn streusel cooking was really good streusel cuckin is a nice cinnamony i think it's like a coffee cake type of scent but it doesn't smell like coffee it's just that nice cinnamon cake scent and the candy corn just gave it a nice creaminess did really well a little bit lighter but candy corn is a typically light scent so i did like this i would repurchase that though from teddy bee's pretty sweet this was one of her they're like tarts like imagine like what you would pour if you poured wax into like a cupcake liner that's what they look like i guess they're tarts i don't really know what they're called but this is pretty sweet this is pink sugar blackberries and marshmallow and magnolias when i first melted this i didn't love it and i think it was because it was just cold and dreary and blah because when i melted this the second time it was like 55 degrees here gorgeous sunny we hadn't seen the sun in like three weeks and i loved it it was just perfect for that day so i think i melted it when the weather was just not right and i'm usually not a seasonal melter but maybe i was just in a great mood that jack is the sun but yeah i like it now i'm not sure why but again at first wasn't a huge fan but then i turned i know i did like it but i wouldn't have repurchased it now i'm like i might it's just really nice scent it's a you get a tart blackberry you definitely get the marshmallow and magnolias which is her boardwalk marshmallow cloud set it's just great it was a really really pretty blend sexy girl aroma fall bakery this was a unicorn this is zucchini pumpkin cookies apple pie it had that zucchini i was like oh girl no and then from mayonnaise we have a bunch we have granny's pie crust this unfortunately was like basically scentless i put the whole thing in the warmer couldn't smell it orange creamsicle this was really really great very strong orange creamy scent i would get that one again and then summer breeze which is a game dupe loved it so strong only needed two cubes of her snap bar which has uh five cubes in it only needed two so strong has great longevity amazing amazing would totally repurchase and totally recommend berry confessions from closet full of wax this is blackberry raspberry pink sugar cotton candy great scent there was just not enough in here it was like one strawberry and then like a little blueberry i mean like little so not enough in here to get a good throw but a good scent nonetheless and then pear berry this is a bath and body works dupe very very heavy on the pear it was super strong because this was a nice thick sample but it mostly smelled like pear but not bad all right scent shots i've been talking way too long already okay um let's do these like oval shaped ones we've got cotton candy from nana makes sense great cotton candy scent very strong i cut these in half and they did well really really nice cotton candy oil i liked it i know i've seen like from watching hauls on youtube that she changed that so i don't know if it's still as good but what i got it was good white linen from wax incredibles this is clean cotton blowing in the breeze super super strong almost like a fruity clean cotton really really pretty scent though very very pretty laundry avo bath from wax incredibles fresh fresh citrus rounded with hints of lemongrass everybody pretty much knows what avo bath smells like very very strong lemony type of scent her avo bath is actually really nice it's not too heavy on that lemongrass like the grass note because lemon is different than lemongrass and i'm not a huge lemongrass person but this one was a very nice avo bath we've got from swanky this is pop tart this was okay it was all right i don't know it had like a weird kind of vibe to it yeah i don't know wasn't my most favorite then we have pour some sugar on me from heaven sent by beckham by becca marie which is now known as dream lux and this was nice i'm pretty sure this is pink sugar and like vanilla which has been my most favorite scent recently and this was good super strong i love her stuff in a tea light warmer it does so well from swanky we have cashmere glow i think i actually have yeah i have two of these cashmere glows this was the first cashmere glow that i ever smelled i absolutely loved it this was back in 2019 so good but hers um was not as strong as when i first got it so that's why i decided to use two of them up because just got to keep it moving we don't want our stuff to get old and not smell anymore so it was good just not as strong as when i first purchased it but that is a fabulous cashmere glow dupe oh my god is that good okay sugar cookie confection from k scented melts this had cherry in it uh or maybe almond i don't know just not not great did not like that one then morning beignet from k's this people rave about i honestly think i got a mislabeled one because this is so nutty i hated it oh i hate it people say it smells like a you know funnel cake like fried dough and powdered sugar this smells like nuts like you were toasting nuts on like the stove like toasted nuts that's literally what it smells like i do not like that one at all so i think i got a mislabeled one but i could be wrong because everyone says it's so good and i'm so excited to try it but it was a disappointment and then from caves we have boardwalk marshmallow clouds so strong a very nice version of this super super strong like i said yeah great great dupe for it hers is really nice from l3 brown sugar cookies sugared shortbread love this this was a sample in a scoopable oh my gosh so good i think her brown sugar cookies is something that i need to get by itself because man is that good such a great creamy dense bakery just it was delicious from teddy bees this was a sample in the perfect storm this was nice i put this on my tea light warmer in the kitchen and i thought it was going to be like way overpowering but it was very very nice kind of like a mellow perfumy aquatic pretty scent i don't know how else to describe it it was just very very lovely i have a clamshell of it which i'm good i don't think i would need more of it but i did really like that when i had that going and then sassy girl aroma this is a sample in by the campfire yeah toasted marshmallow type of scent with a little bit of smokiness to it and then i just have two little odds and ends which is a wallflower plug in lavender vanilla to match the candle lavender blossom creamy vanilla sugared musk not a lavender fan but their lavender vanilla is very very good i enjoy it and then finally for really febreze plug in refills in the crisp clean this is the heavy duty heavy duty um two times odor eliminator i don't know this is good i put these in the kitchen love them they do the best for me that is it you guys did i accomplish my 28 empties i'm pretty sure i did one two three four five six eight nine 10 eleven twelve thirteen forty fifty i have eighteen just in the clam shells and this and the um and the uh what are those kind of i can't think sunshots 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30. i hit 30 empties in wax not including the candles yes queen love that oh wait i think i hit 31. i think i forgot that anyway i have no idea but that was my goal was to create an empty for every day of the month so proud of myself that i did it and i'm very very happy let me know down below if you guys have tried any of this stuff what's your favorites what have you liked what have you not liked let me know down below if you guys have a theme for march you doing like a st patty's day theme like melting orange green and white you melting greenery type of scents like grass and coastal kale let a girl know i would love to chat with you guys thank you all so so much for watching and i will see you in my next one bye", "OmPpUx08RwY": "[Music] something I simplistic here back with another video and I know I said I wasn't going to include prices and stuff into my into my titles by figured you know other youtubers have prices and I feel like maybe the prices and titles didn't really affect my second channel from getting the lead is just a more eye appealing or eye-catching title when there's like the price in the in the title I just don't know why it just seems to get much more views basically this is going to be a comparison between two $20 waxes that I got from the club's recently you might have seen them in video it's already I don't know why I'm going to be uploading this but it's probably going to be after I reviewed those ones individually but the waxes in question are let's just see so I got two of each just put things so I mean you can see right here I have a gram of each well now not all of them are full grams anymore but as you can see I got two grams of each brand and they were both $20 so this is the reason why I am comparing them they're both the same price and we're just gonna see which one I like better I'm pretty sure you guys Brady know which one I like better but we're just gonna do it for this video as well so for the first one we got the quest go so we're gonna do the worst first I guess and as you can see right here that's you bet this is their strawberry banana which I barely have any left so please bear with me I'm going to try and uh zoom in you can see very sugary consistency and just show this one more actually hold that dot guys I am actually just switch my battery because it's low so this is the chunky diesel very sugar waxy twenty dollars this was and it is a live sugar so the consistency you can see very very stable and let me just take a hit of it he knows I'm just balance this a little bit my trusty utility in you guys already know the deal like I love this piece I really do black rings are [ __ ] nuts we're just going to get at this one we're going to say best strawberry banana I mean it's not like it tastes better anything but it's the only I barely have that much left of it so you know did I use what you have more even though it's not like particularly any good I guess alright but there's not too much flavoring and I think I mentioned it in those videos as well when I review them I mean the first initial taste was kind of second taste is all right but for waxes it doesn't really I'm not looking for a wax that gets better over time I'm looking for a whack that good off the first day [Music] like I said not too Pleasant in terms of taste or terpenes but not bad and you know I've had worse I'm had why's that you sleep under trash but this one's acceptable you know for 20 dollars I'm not too upset and it didn't taste all that great because you know like I said it's only twenty dollars if I would've paid thirty for this and it's trash yeah then I would be a little bit upset but all-in-all crystal is pretty good I just feel a little cheated because after I bought this I bought bear and it just blows out those out the park and it's the same price I'll be it you know they were at different dispensaries but they're both around the same price I feel like if fresco was that fee knows where I bought the bear stuff it'd be priced around the same maybe even lower I don't know when you guys know my history with fresco I wanted to try their cartridges and then they're basically douche bags to me so but this is not gonna reflect just like on the review it does not reflect what I think about their products you know I thought to you know if I didn't like if I really didn't care for them I wouldn't have bought two maybe not because at the time this was the best place to buy wax because everything else was in 30% off at other places so you know sometimes you just want to spend 20 bucks you don't have to even want to break another bill another 20 just to spend 25 on some [ __ ] you know now we got the good stuff we got there and this is botanical extracts and research labs guys and this is basically acronym but they use that it you know worked out it spells bear they got their right here this is their purple punch and I believe banana cream pie and these are full-spectrum boys full-spectrum for $20 you can't really like you can't really get that unless it's like I think bright Labs is full spectrum but the taste for bright Labs is uncompelled to this I'm saying when you just open these be these are running about be percent keeps the ugly it's definitely not bad you're just gonna so this is the purple punch guys this reminds me that the consistency that you would see in 710 labs like that very buttery a clean-looking butter eat look you know I'm saying my lewis [ __ ] and it smells phenomenal smells like purple punch for sure this is the banana the banana the bananas a bit darker than the the Provo punch and not as tasty but still nonetheless really really really really chirpy for for what it is you know full spectrum let's get let's get a double let's get it triple there you go hopefully you guys can see we'll take a hit at both you know they're gonna end the video here just a comparison video I do these videos to help you choose the best product for you at a reasonable price you know a lot of people complain that oh you only get them the Bunco leader or whatever it's like first of all we doesn't last meal what like it lasts me probably like hours just an hour or not even that long okay so what's the point in me getting like these crazy like [ __ ] designer strains that cost $50 an eighth and then I'm done with it for now you know don't get me wrong on the flowers it's probably phenomenal you know but flowers don't last me long you know and when I do get wheat I try to get a deal where I could just smoke out my homies because not a lot of us are buying weed nowadays and when we were craving weed it's when we're out in the city and we just want to smoke a joint you know but other than that it's just a waste of it's not a waste of money don't get me wrong but it doesn't last as long as wives get my drift this is the promo punch cheers guys god damn that's tasty that tastes like fruit spunk like no lie like if you ever see bear and you see purple punch get like I don't say that much [ __ ] takes me this is why we try to conserve this as much as possible but we're gonna take the hit of the banana cream pie now and we're gonna call the video just the video it's it's more of a side by side $20 wax I guess or I don't know if it was more of a comparison because you guys already know when my opinion was on all the B's and which one I liked better banana cream pie cheers this is my wake and bake as well guys so hopefully you guys are waking and baking with me Cheers all right guys [Music]", "v0fLwp9cVxk": "[Music] simplistic here back with another video if you couldn't tell from the title this is going to be another wax review video I guess but I'd like to be transparent with you and I actually reviewed this already I didn't last night in my room and the lighting I mean even though on the viewfinder it said it looked it looked pretty good when I put it on my computer is very very dark and I don't know if I'm actually gonna do that so we might as well just start again I am at the park near my house so please don't worry you know this is walkable distance five minutes walkable distance okay but today we're gonna be smoking on some bear which is an acronym for botanical extracts and research labs so this is not I guess they I mean their logo is a bear but bear is not there's a meaning behind the bear it's an acronym it's botanical Reese botanical extracts and research labs okay and this is actually full-spectrum live resin as you can see right here and it is propyl punch very very good stuff and the kicker is this is $20 this is this [ __ ] blows Cresco out the door like it's not even like me hatin on Cresco you know but like there are both $20 which one while I get this one although there they weren't at the scene dispensary this one was at doctor's choice this one was at fee nose but they're the same price in my area so I will I will compare them but basically bear just knocks it out the park this is purple punch and it is alive batter with 89 percent THC so it's definitely good stuff live resin concentrate all that good stuff and show you the stuff so off the bat it reminds me of that of you get the what was it the 710 labs live rosin it's a the same color not as yellow but it like just gives out the same or like look and feel to it not look in terms of color but like just the look of it like the bat earnest hopefully you guys got that music and zoom in again you got it I presume update on my ugly face no I'm saying but we're me taking a hit of this and yeah I actually purchased two more because honestly I am a big fan of their [ __ ] after trying it I tried it last night it's [ __ ] amazing and before we even like hit it I already taste it tastes like purple punch but then there's an initial like sweet taste that I really can't get my like the tip of my tongue on but it like remember when I had that purple punch lab resin video of I believe it was Ursa or her walks or mocks or some [ __ ] Ben said that it tasted like tape well initially it tastes like it has that tape taste I don't know how to describe the tape taste but like now I get it I really like I thought he was crazy when he was telling me it tasted like tape but I feel it but then that's just the initial taste and then after that it's [ __ ] pretty pleasant [ __ ] fruits and berries and purple punch you know all that good stuff but yes and this stuff is easy to work with I mean look at it it's like wax it literally is like wax you know so it's easy to just dump on the coil because it's a very stable very stable I mean you see right here yeah we're gonna take a hit for you guys or I'm gonna take a hit for you guys oh [ __ ] [Music] me like like I said like I was describing earlier basically how it tasted like if you ever get duct tape and you start taping your foxes you get like a very distinctive tape taste but if you were to get that taste but adds sweetness to it of berries and stuff that's basically the taste of this it's not bad if I can see why Flint I mean Ben said it did taste like tape but if you get past that you get you get to the fruity flavors of it like you definitely is reminiscent of purple punch the way it smells when you get the flower but I am honestly very very surprised that this stuff was only twenty dollars you heard it here first it's probably gonna be raised in price pretty soon like this is like just like it reminds me of when Arcturus came out people didn't know it was good and then people started getting it and then band they raised the price not too much but it was very noticeable you know like oh I didn't pay this much for it last time you know so really like this consistency and it just could be just me me you know it may be something some of you don't like it but I do it's just easier to [ __ ] with it just looks cool like oh it being white like I don't I barely get like white wax or like whitish you know when it's THCA or something it's gonna be white like usually it's usually yellow or orange you know one of the two colors for dark ass Brown but I don't get that [ __ ] I mean more like this color I guess looking at Cresco yeah their bare [ __ ] whatever that's just fired not gonna lie [Music] cheese guys [Music] Oh Oh all right so that's gonna be it for the video hopefully you guys enjoyed this little wax review hopefully it's not too long that you didn't get bored and I'll see you guys in the next one peace out [Music] [Music] you [Music]", "44OfSSsOXVA": "[Music] you but if this car gala Gorton goodness I serve on a financier volcania

on it's Little Miss cannabis and this is my part two video on how to use the pure distillate in the syringe form so earlier I told you how to warm it up to loosen up the consistency so it was easier to use so when it's in that state the best thing to do is if you want to eat it on a cookie just put a little rice grain piece on there and directly eat it that way and if that's not enough you can always up the dose and make your little amount on there bigger another great way to use it when it's heated up in the syringe is you can directly put it into say like a cup of hot tea or warm coffee and that's a great way to use it as well so another way you can use it at is you can vaporize it so if you have a vaporizer that looks like this this is a barbed coil vaporizer you see right in there there's a coil in there and that's what you're going to want to put the actual you know little des of medicine right in there and that coil is going to burn it pretty hot and you're going to be able to be braise it in that way now the best way to use the distillate is a way called dabbing and that's something that they are not allowed to talk to you about at the dispensaries so that's why I'm gonna do this video and show you exactly how to dab it so there's different devices you can use to dab this right here is called a dab straw so what you need to do is use a little torch and heat up the end of it you're gonna want to get it nice and hot it's going to turn a little bit once it does and you can see mine is a little bit you're gonna want to bring that parchment paper out of the freezer put it right on there and go ahead and take an inhale now this is gonna go way down in so you can tell it is definitely a deep hit for sure but this is gonna affect you really really well so another way to dab excuse me is to use add a brick so this is gonna be probably the most beneficial way to use it so what the daybreak looks like is this right here you heat this piece up right here until that gets red you put this piece on and then what you're going to do is have your little piece of distill it on here put it down in hit it that way and then feel it go away down in and then the party begins I have a good one see y'all later", "C6nG61ptouI": "[Music] hi everyone welcome back to crafty soul cafe if you're new here my name is janiece i am a candle maker and this video is all about wax okay so let's get started i'm just going to tell you a little bit about what i used to make candles and wax melts and some of your options there are so many different wax options but i'll go over the ones that i have and have used so the first wax that i tried for candle making was joy wax it's sold by nature's garden and i will be putting all of that in the comments it's a slab that you have to cut or break into pieces i usually use this tool to cut my slabs this is a combination of soy wax it's mostly soy it has a little bit of paraffin gives a really good heat throw you melt it at to about 200 and pour at about 185 or so it's a very good wax creamy very good setting once it sets it looks really nice white smooth tops so you don't really have sink holes with it and the best part about this wax there's no cure time so you don't have to wait two weeks to light your candle you can actually light it the next day i still would suggest giving it a few days to cure for the best heat throw but it's a very good wax i use it with my htp or my wood wicks the second wax which i actually haven't tried but it's a basic wax that a lot of people use it's a paraffin wax as you can see i haven't even opened it it's very hard so you would definitely need something um very sharp very sturdy to cut this it's um 6006 i've got it from candle science a lot of people use this wax because it's an easy wax to use it's an easy wax to figure out as far as heat throw as far as scent throw as far as wicks because a lot of people use it so you there's a lot of information available on how to use it um as i stated i got this from candle science the there's no really cure time after a few days you're great to lie to go ahead and light a candle with it to get a proper heat throw um people do say the longer you let it sit the better it becomes it does sometimes get sink holes though so you would just need to take make sure you take your heat gun after the candle sets to just make sure there are no sinkholes in the wax or in the candle and then another wax that is really good that i've used is the c3 which is i got this from california candle supply [Music] it's a all-natural soy wax but with a lot of soy like four six four and it's a lot of people start out saying they want to use all natural wax like four six four but unfortunately it's a little difficult to figure out so i don't suggest you start with the wax like that i would suggest perfecting a different wax and then if you decide that you do want to use an all-soy wax then try to um test still try to test but still make your candles on the wax that you've perfected so therefore you can keep moving forward and then testing soys and other type of waxes but it's not hindering your candle making at that time because it's not your main wax this c3 though is really good and i do believe they sell it other places like i said this comes from california candle supply it comes graded so it's um in pieces already so i've definitely it's very easy to melt um melt point about 190 195 i would say poor 170 even a little bit lower if you can it's not a hard soy wax to use i got a really good heat throw from it um that there is a two week cure time on it so um just like with any other soy so definitely you're gonna have to give it time to cure i don't know if you definitely need the two weeks but of course the longer a candle cares the better throw you're gonna get i believe that goes for any type of wax but definitely a soy wax or a mostly soy wax you definitely want to give that time to cure but i want to show you the wax that i use for my candles now and i love is the coconut apricot wax it's creamy it looks almost like the joy wax it's creamy you definitely still need something to cut it because it's kind of hard but it's not as hard as the perfect have a two week cure time to it that's the only downfall for me because i got so used to using the joy that i was like okay i can make a candle today shipping tomorrow by the time it gets there it is gonna smell great this you do have to allow that time for curing um i've tried to light it the next day and unfortunately i didn't get a very good synth row like i wanted which was like kind of scary and it kind of turned me off a little bit about it but i love using that wax because it is a more natural it does have a little paraffin in it to help the scent throw but not uh any substantial amount and it's a food grade paraffin so it's still good um for the environment it's still non-toxic so i have stuck with that wax um if by chance something happens and i need a backup wax i will probably most likely go back to my joy wax because i've already done a lot of testing with it and i feel secure in using it so those are the candle waxes that i've been using um and i have i do have and have tested now i'll go into a few of the tart waxes that i have and have tried out and then i'll tell you which one that i prefer okay so this is a candle science um tart wax and this is a soy tart wax um it's a 10 pound bag it rained it about 20 bucks it's about 20 dollars for each of these waxes for 10 pounds except for the coconut apricot it's a little more expensive but i like a better quality wax i feel it's better quality you may not think so or it may not be but i just like the blend a little better so therefore i do pay a little higher cost for that but all the other wax that show i've shown in this video thus far they're about 20 dollars per 10 pounds so it ranges the differences really are close in price so this tart wax soy tart wax is also shavings um graded wax just like the c3 as you can see um i don't prefer this honestly for my tarts i'll probably use it just so i can use it up but it's not my favorite um i haven't had a pellet wax as well with the bw 931 i think it was um i just recently completed um the bag of that that i had wasn't a big fan kind of just used it to get rid of it um i'm gonna i went back to my original tart wax that i love i don't even know why i switch well i do know i heard oh this is great but stick to what you know and you like i know it's kind of hard because there are so many new products always coming out and you want to try everything but honestly i wish i would have just saved my money and just bought more wax that i i love i enjoy using i know it's gonna give a good um scent throw i know it's going to look good with my color because i do use some color mica glitter in my tarts and i know how it's going to perform never had any issues with it it's the pillar of bliss soy wax i'm sorry it's a pillar of bliss wax it's granulated so it melts really quick this is from nature's garden and it's from um that's the only place that sells it it's proprietary to that company i love it great color um really really nice i have no complaints um i will probably stick with that wax for from here on out for my tarts as long as it's available that's another big thing about wax to use i definitely suggest that you research research research that that's the most important thing because there are so many options um i would decide first do you want all natural wax do you want to use something or do you not mind using something that has a little paraffin in it i'm going to tell you now the paraffin is going to help your cure time it's going to help your your scent throw but definitely decide which wax you want to use then check the availability of it check which companies sell that wax is it readily available because some of these waxes are proprietary to a certain company that will that would be the only company that would sell that wax and right now um supplies are kind of thin um i think it's getting a little better but still it's kind of hard sometimes to find things that you want to use so definitely make sure the availability is there so when you need more if you are able to buy a lot at one time that it's you can get it i found that the nature's garden wax i've never had a problem with getting it i never either the joy or the pillar of bliss anytime i've gone to buy it it's been available coconut apricot not so much i've purchased my coconut apricot from wooden wick originally which comes in five pound slabs i really only bought it to test i really liked it so i went and ordered more then i found some other suppliers that sell the what that wax which i ended up buying boxes from honey and hive usually the day they release they do sell out so join the group on facebook turn your notifications on sign up on their email list so you'll get notifications for several different place homes available that way you can buy a box or i don't know if they allow you to buy multiple boxes but you can buy a box when it becomes available that way you do have a stock of that wax so you're not stressed am i going to be able to get more of this when i need it so that's the way that i've been doing it haven't run into any issues with doing so the paraffin wax is usually ready available it's flaming candle lone star all cell 6006 a lot of these waxes come from the same manufacturer cal wax which distributes it to all of them just depends on which company gets more um to figure out which one has more to sell so kind of like i said do your research 6006 is usually you can usually get that i'm not seeing any issues with availability i do know there was some issue with the wax not being good you late in the year like in november december i hear that that issue has been resolved but like i said i would not really know much about it because that's not a wax that i use next i'll show you a couple of candles using our candle and a wax melt using the wax that i usually use so here is my candle using my coconut apricot wax how creamy that top looks how smooth and this is literally with me doing nothing to this so it's been curing for maybe about a week so the throw is there so by the time i ship this the customer gets it it's going to be fine they'll be able to use it right away you just have to do a little bit more planning and here's a chart here's a tart that i made with this tart was made with the um with my pillow bliss like i said this is my preference because i get good color the centro is already amazing i made this a couple of days ago there's really no issues with it um the coloring is good it

today i have another kind of first look at some new waxes now this is from a company called all seasons wax co uh this is a company i've been seeing online for a long time the only reason i haven't done anything with them so far is because they're out of australia so of course trying to get the wax and everything like that can definitely get expensive when you factor in shipping and everything like that so that's why i'm extremely excited to get these and finally test these things out i've been looking at these for a long time and i have a lot of people in australia that are always asking what waxes are good so this is definitely a good time to really go into these find out what's good about these find out which one works the best uh that way i can actually offer some advice when somebody from australia comes to me and asks what kind of waxes these are plus when you get over to other parts of the world some supplies can get kind of low or real sparse depending on where the area is and this is a company that does really well they have a lot of different waxes that range from like coconuts to beeswax to soy a lot of different blends so i'm actually real excited to get into these and do some testing with these and not only does australia have a good wax company like this but they have a good supply company over there also that does a lot of really nice vessels some vessels that really stand out some some vessels that i would love to see here along with packaging and everything like that so australia does have a lot of good stuff over there it's just i've never been able to recommend anything because it was really hard to get so going through these right now i've got a giant box uh they sent me a bunch of stuff it's i've got the pure soy s100 i've got the deluxe soy s16 i've got the superior coco soy a05 the performance soy blend a27 i've got this one which is a sample of their m12 soy wax now this is supposed to be kind of their top of the line i've heard a lot of good things about this one very excited to try this one apparently has some of the best of glass adhesion of any of the waxes that are out there and when i posted that one in the group a lot of people really commented and said that they liked it quite a bit and the last one i've got here is the bsoy b808 now this is definitely one i'm really excited to try out just because i've never seen a wax like that and i'm very curious to see what it says so i'm gonna go through each of these waxes talk a little bit about them and basically go into a few of the specs that are on these things so the s100 is pure soy no additives s16 deluxe soy high with a small amount of vegetable additive lower melt point great for glass adhesion the a05 superior soy and coconut only has a nice white creamy wax the 808 the b808 b soy refined beeswax blended with lower melt soy wax uh and the beeswax is refined of color and that honey smell i open this one up it actually does smell really nice it definitely gets rid of that that off yellow color and kind of the smell that a lot of beeswax definitely has with it the performance soy blend is a soy paraffin palm blend it's a melt in pillar formulation created by them best for these products good with color is a harder melt composition so we'll definitely be doing a lot of melts with that one testing out probably not pillars but we'll definitely do some melts and see how it does the m12 ultimate soy is the ultimate blend it's a single pore wax an all-around good performer loves color no frosting very excited about that one because you know a lot of soys really struggle with holding color and frosting so again like i said i'm very excited to get into these waxes these are waxes like i said i've been looking at online for a very long time it's uh it's kind of hard to get some of these waxes there's some waxes over in the uk that i'd like to try out also just because i have so many people that reach out and want to know something about these and i just can't give recommendations because i've never worked with any of them now of course getting into each of these waxes i'm going to do the standard tests with every single one of these we're going to do kind of heating them up letting them cool down trying a bunch of different wicks in these putting them in different containers adding color we'll go through i'm going to do like a higher temp or a lower temp or just to see kind of how it looks on both sides and then i do need to go through the website i'm not really sure where these fall as far as fragrance load i imagine they're going to be in the 8 to 12 probably 8 to 10 range like most waxes but we'll go through and do a lot of testing there now going through this one again it does say the soy a27 is a higher fragrance load i don't see exactly how much it says on here let me see if i can find it uh higher fragrance tolerance eight to ten percent the a05 coco soy is gonna be eight to ten percent as well like i said i think a lot of these are gonna be right in the same range i'm probably only gonna be doing about eight percent in in a lot of these anyway just because for the most for the most uh 10 seems to be kind of overkill for a lot of waxes i know a lot of people get some good results out of it but i tend to get very good results with eight percent so i think we'll definitely stick with that unless a wax calls for it i get once we once we get the waxes poor to go through do each one of them i'll go through and do a bunch of wick testing and burn testing on these just to see how well it throws and of course we'll alter the we'll alter the fragrance loads after that we'll go up or down depending on kind of what the outcome is and then of course i will section these off and do a single video on each one of these so i'm not going to lump all of them together i'll do kind of a full wax testing on each of these by themselves and then of course a full wax review on every single one of these and definitely go through and find out which one i like the best but most important i'm just excited to get a bunch of new waxes to test and a bunch of new waxes that a lot of people have been asking me about so to everyone especially people over in australia if you've used these waxes before please let me know what you think of them what i should watch out for or or what to look for when getting into these waxes and of course if you haven't used these waxes what would you like to see from these testing and review videos so if you'd like to see something in these specific wicks or anything like that please let me know in the comments down below i'll try to go through and do a lot of the testing when it comes to wix i don't know exactly which wix you have over in australia so there might be some that i just can't do any testing with so we'll do as much testing as we can here with a bunch of the wix that i have but like i said if there is something in the videos that you'd like to see please let me know and i'm going to try to update and include that in the video so that we can get kind of a full round review and test of every single one of these and i was talking to the person who owns the company and they mentioned that they're actually trying to get these waxes over here in the u.s so this would definitely be a nice addition to some of the waxes that we have here i don't know how far along that is but it would definitely be nice to get some of these waxes over here because a lot of people are definitely interested in the cocoa the beeswax uh the different soy formulations so this is definitely something that you should look out for in the near future as well so that's pretty much it i just wanted to do like a first look just to give you guys an idea of what i've got on hand and kind of what's coming forward in the next month or two getting all these done and tested so like i said i'm very excited for these and we're just going to jump right into it now of course you can follow me on any of the social media platforms that i've listed down below so if you want to see kind of testing in progress uh either on the diy facebook group instagram facebook my website all that stuff is going to be posted there you can follow me there as well and of course my email address is listed in the video description down below if you want to reach out and as always if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and thank you for watching you", "gVQZLMBiN-s": "It looks like worms. Like dirty worms. It can't be that bad, though, it's just mind\nover matter. It looks gross, but it's probably just... Strangers Try No-Carb Noodles Noodles are always a treat. Yeah, I like noodles with pieces of chicken. I think a good noodle should be... bland without\nany spices to it. I'm not really a big fan of adding- the noodles\nitself being too spicy, or too sweet, or whatever, before you add condiments to it. Plain Miracle Noodles\n0 Net Carbs! First of all, that is not what I was expecting\nto see when I looked in the bowl. Wow. It looks like sproot, like octopus. I just want to say for the sake of all things\ncivil, if I eat this- and I will try, I'm always a good sport- but just give a little\nlaugh, because I don't know how to use these things. It looks like a fish. These feel like tentacles, and it doesn't\nhelp that you gave me chopsticks. This is not going to be good. I don't know what people would eat with this,\nbecause the texture, taste, it just tastes like jello. It has a texture of fish. It tastes like... it tastes like- if you don't\ncook the fish, it's still raw, and it's kinda bouncy, kinda thing. But it has no taste. Like literally no taste. Texture's like slimy... like water. I feel like this is like play-dough, like\nplay food. It's not good. I wouldn't eat this. I can't help you, I failed you as a- I failed\nyou as a food connoisseur. I think you just have to throw the whole thing\naway. I feel like you started with such disgusting\ningredients, there's no way you can fix this. Like this is just- you've got to trash the\nwhole thing, and start over. Pesto Miracle Noodles It looks like worms. Like dirty worms. It can't be that bad, though. It's just mind-over-matter, it's just gross,\nbut it's probably just not terrible. Yeah, that's now... now it's more edible. They're not that bad. It doesn't taste bad, it's not that it tastes\nbad, it tastes okay. But I don't know if it's the texture that's\nthrowing me off. You know how when you eat a cooked noodle,\nit feels soft. This one feels like... bouncy. Maybe that's what's throwing me off, but the\ntaste itself is not bad, it doesn't taste gross. The same slimy. But now it has taste. Wait, actually those are good. I would eat those. I feel like they're not that bad, they're\nnot too- they have a lot of flavors I think that's a thing, I think the texture of the\nnoodles on their own: not good. But with all the flavors, the basil, the pesto,\nit's good. I would enjoy this with chicken or something. This is the better noodle. But it's still not my type for me. Cheese Miracle Noodles Miracle Noodles with cheese. So it's the same noodle, right? Interesting. So that's the only kind that they have? Okay. This looks really good. I'm hoping this is... this looks amazing. Let's try it. Hmm-hmm. That's really good. Okay. It's really cheesy. So it just doesn't taste like a healthy alternative. It tastes really good. It tastes like Mac and Cheese. You can taste that it's not mac, obviously. It's like Mac's cousin from Canada came to\nvisit. So you can taste \"okay, this is different,\"\nbut it doesn't blow you up. Hmm-hmm, yeah, it's edible. You need to add it here- the meat. Definitely. Like ground beef, I believe. That'd be great. What I would do differently, what I would\nadd, just because I like spicy food. You know the red flakes, the pepper? That's so good. The verdict Okay, so pasta's the last one was the best\none. My favorite would be the cheese sauce, because\nlike I said before, it just envelopes it. It takes away that fish texture. The sauce is like, \"come here, let me hold\nyou.\" And it tastes so good. It was a little bit too cheesy, so none of\nthem were perfect. But that one was the best one. And then the basil pesto was good as well. With the pesto, it's good, too. But you can still- I can still feel the bounciness,\nby itself. It's very hard, like for example, for me,\nthere's no taste to anything, so that's why the very first one is going to be the very\nlast place, like third place. The very first one I tried was disgusting. I did not enjoy that at all, because there\nwas nothing on it. There was no sauce, so maybe that's how they\nall start out, and you just have to cook it with the sauce. I don't know. But I wouldn't eat that one alone. I would- actually you told me that's like\npure fiber, right? So maybe I could buy sometimes this. I would buy the basil pesto, and the the fettuccini,\nlike cheese one. I would buy those noodles if someone taught\nme how to make the cheese sauce. Because I think it goes really well together,\nand I'm low-key sitting here, thinking to myself, \"I should try this, I really should.\" And you guys check me out in like a week's\ntime.

to use is up to you SOI 125 comes in flake form and is packaged in one-pound bags it's a very soft wax and therefore only appropriate for container candles it's extremely easy to use for a number of reasons its flake form makes it much simpler to melt as compared to handling a large block of wax it also has a melting point of 115 degrees Fahrenheit so it melts quickly another real plus is that it has very low shrinkage meaning you don't have to top off after the candle has been poured if this wax has a negative it's that it doesn't hold as much scent as paraffin SOI 125 wax is our most popular soy wax it's all natural and renewable container candles made with this wax have a soft creamy look and are great in fall colors the rest of the waxes we're going to show you are sold in ten pound slabs for the purposes of our demonstrations we'll be using one pound blocks CBL 129 is a paraffin wax used in making container candles as well as votives and tarts when using this wax you'll notice a fair amount of shrinkage as it cools as a result once the initial pour has cooled you'll need to add a bit more wax or top-off to complete the candle candles made with this wax have excellent scent throw it's a great wax for vibrant colors and is formulated to give a smooth finish in addition to container candles it is also suitable for votives and tarts CBL 129 is our most popular paraffin wax CBL 125 is another paraffin wax but it should only be used for container candles although the fragrance is good it's not quite as good as CBL 129 it's a one pour wax meaning no topping off is required CBL 125 is very soft and results in candles that are smooth and creamy our CBL 130 is a hybrid wax which is a blend of both paraffin and soy wax it combines the all natural aspects of soy wax with the improved scent throw characteristics of paraffin candle wax 2530 is a specialty blend of paraffin candle wax that promotes modeling the effect is the appearance of whitewashed clouds throughout the

interest in treating people nutritionally so I treat people with psoriasis eczema lupus and I treat them with specialized nutritional plans so nutrition has always been a real passion of mine and so in 2006 I was taking a trip to Japan visiting a friend and they took me to a Buddhist restaurant outside the city of Kyoto it was really incredible and they serve me a big bowl of noodles and they said this is the healthiest thing on the menu and I thought how can a big bowl of noodles be the healthiest thing on the menu and it turned out that the noodles were essentially calorie free and so when I when I you know learn about that I thought wow this would be perfect for my patients who you know they can't eat any more flour there's trying to stay away from you know these high calorie pasta like dishes so I thought this is like the perfect opportunity to bring this to the United States so I started the company when I came back along with my mother who's involved and my sisters as well and that's when miracle middle was born when these miracle noodle as a company special is one that it's a family company I started the company in 2006 and really there was no question that when I started the company that my sisters were brought on you know essentially drafted by me into the company then course my parents came on board and my mother does all the demos and she does all the food all the food shows my sister works with all the retail business and I like doing me the online a bit online type things and I used to my father helps with all me around sort of you know paperwork and that sort of thing so it's a nice family company and we keep it keep it small and as far as the product goes we're essentially a no-compromise kind of company we keep things as traditional as you possibly can wear a traditional food company anything that we make is basically based on some sort of ancient food tradition and we don't mess with it we keep it as close to the way with these artisans have been making it for centuries our basic noodles been in Japan for you know a thousand years at least and whereas some other noodle companies have added lots of kind of unusual ingredients artists is exactly the way they've made it for four years and as we expand our line you know we've kept that philosophy and with our meals that we'll be releasing maybe you're released when you when you watch this video there's lots of ingredients in there and they're all things that you can pronounce they're all completely natural and again we as a physician especially it's important for me to make sure that everyone can eat our noodles and so we keep all these ingredients as natural as we possibly can so that's what makes rope a little special tradition natural ingredients and everything kind of put together with with you know with the fan with the family in mind and and it's kind of from our family to your family", "eY60vv-Swa0": "miracle 11 smuggler's destiny in the early 70s president richard nixon formalized relations with china through a visit to beijing and a meeting with mao zedong not long thereafter word was out that westerners could travel to the nation for the first time in decades those of us in the christian world were desperate to know the state of believers in that nation since chairman mao and his minions had slaughtered hundreds of thousands in mass murders of followers of jesus christ we had heard the stories from escaping chinese believers of the underground church and of the persecution of the faithful we knew bibles were extremely scarce due to the repeated cultural revolutions which sought to eliminate any vestige of the christian faith an opiate of the people in 1979 andrew a china-born member of the staff of our organization had a vision to enter the nation with a group of american tourists we would he proposed attempt to link up with members of the underground church for potential support for these hurting brothers and sisters in the faith with a group of about 20 he suggested that we each carry two or three bibles in our suitcases with the possibility that we might give them out in china technically this was smuggling but hardly on a massive scale we had 50 bibles among us and had some expectation that they might be confiscated in customs a common occurrence we also knew from reports that members of intourist the chinese secret service would be with us as tour guides and security we just had no idea until we got there that the scrutiny would be so close or so constant every bus ride every meal every tourist site and every hotel lobby was marked by the soon familiar faces of the blue gray uniformed spies for the people's republic of china in the two weeks of the trip to the great wall the tombs of the emperors and other famous sites there were zero opportunities to meet christians get inside churches or communicate with anyone outside the protected zone of our chinese observers we all pray that somehow we would be able to deliver the 50 bibles we surely didn't want to take them back to the u.s and it was now the day before our departure the tour guides had saved the best for last in beijing the final feature was a tour of the walled imperial palace from the ming dynasty to the end of the qing dynasty a huge network of palaces called the forbidden city as we disembarked from the bus to enter the gate of the city on our final day in china our guide told us to stay with the group so we wouldn't get lost and that we would meet at four o'clock at the bus outside the gate on the far wall from which we entered it was a beautiful sunny day with clear skies and as the tour began i loaded a fresh roll of film into my camera to record the magnificent surroundings divine mistake about 30 minutes into the tour i realized that the film and my camera had not engaged the sprockets and that all the pictures i thought i had taken had recorded nothing i panicked and reloaded my camera i figured that i could run back to the entry gate retake all of the shots i had lost and catch up to the slow moving group tour so i split from the group and in the process apparently eluded the watchful eyes of our chinese monitors when i returned to the site where i had left the group it was nowhere to be found no problem i thought i know the time and place of the bus departure i'm on my own i finished photographing the rest of the magnificent palace structures and exited the back gate with about an hour to spare before i had to be back on the bus outside the back gate i spied a tall four-story pagoda on a hill about a quarter of a mile away through a park and thought what a magnificent place to get a picture of the entire palace enclosure and the city of beijing i raced along the sidewalks of the park and ascended the many steps to the top level of the pagoda spectacular view indeed each level of the pagoda was filled with chinese nationals wearing their standard blue gray pajama-like clothing the tall american with the fancy camera and long telephoto lens was clearly a fascination to the populace as i snapped pictures of the sights i recorded my impressions in a small hand-held cassette tape recorder i was in a world of my own my world was suddenly shaken by a voice close to me which said are you a visitor to our country the voice was strong and in perfect english i turned expecting to see a british or american national and instead was face to face with a mid-seventies woman dressed in the standard blue grays shocked at the discovery i blurted out where did you learn such perfect english in mission school she replied and all the bells and whistles in my soul sounded in the next few moments of conversation during which she kept looking around to see who was watching her talk to the american i learned that she was from shanghai and was on a short visit to beijing she had just happened to take a walk to the park and was up on the pagoda at the very moment i was away from my group for the first time in two weeks most important i learned that she was a devout follower of jesus christ the bible connection i asked if she had a bible she said she had one but that they weren't available her pastor didn't even own one and members of her church had only hand copied scripture portions i told her i could get some for her she repeated that you couldn't get them i repeated that i had 50 bibles and that if she could arrange a secret place to meet and pick them up i would give them to her her response was heartbreaking first she looked around again to see if anyone was observing our conversation then she looked at me with longing in her eyes as if to say you wouldn't be toying with me would you then she said we must leave that spot immediately walk a pace or two apart and not look at each other so it would not be so obvious that we were conversing we did this down the long winding walk to the wall of the forbidden city the bus was by the gate so i told her stay right here around the corner from this wall i will send someone mystified but obviously willing to risk that what i was telling her might actually be true she stayed put running to the bus i cornered andrew who was fluent in mandarin andrew go quickly to the woman around the corner she can arrange to take the bibles like a flash andrew was gone and just as quickly he was back it's all arranged he said with a smile as broad as the horizon that evening during free time between dinner and the evening schedule at the hotel the members of the team quietly dropped off the bibles from their luggage at andrew's room he packed them into an old suitcase and disappeared into the shadows behind the hotel he came back more excited than if he'd won the publisher's clearing house sweepstakes it worked we met and she took them he announced with but i feel so sorry for that weak old lady that suitcase was so heavy andrew get over it i rebuked with a smile that was the lightest load she's carried in her entire life we laughed together at the thought what a string of linking factors the day before our departure the jammed camera film my separation from the group and the state watchdogs the visit to the top level of the pagoda the woman's brief visit to beijing from shanghai and her stroll to the park and up the pagoda her speaking to the only american stranger there all of this ended in who knows maybe 50 different house church pastors getting their first copy of the holy bible i'd love to know it would be difficult to convince the recipients of those bibles and that dear lady that all this wasn't miraculous", "qarRY27ZNxA": "miracle 16 god at the bus stop i am sure that skeptics will have a lot of fun making sport of this story and a couple more like it that follow those who have experienced the miracle walk on the other hand will see added confirmation that god is at work in the tiniest most insignificant details of our lives to some it may seem extremely arrogant to believe that god would care about the tiny details of one life among the seven billion now on the planet i understand but arrogance doesn't drive these stories biblical teaching and personal experience do let me explain charles hadden spurgeon 1834-1892 was england's best-known preacher for most of the second half of the 19th century he was once asked by a woman in his parish dr spurgeon do you think god is interested in the little things in our lives in his inimitable bombastic style spurgeon replied lady do you think anything is big to god omniscience and omnipotence have ways of eliminating the distinctions between large and small complex and simple important and insignificant especially in the presence of love when infinite unconditional love operates nothing is too small to be a matter of attention in the life of the beloved a case in point my beloved wife's cut finger would be as much a cause of my care and concern as if she contracted cancer not because finger cuts in cancer are in any way on the same level of seriousness but because of the love that motivates the care so i tell this story in the category of the miraculous and a couple more like it with no apology at all some of the most precious experiences of my life are those in which god has touched me in some minuscule detail of my life something so dinky as to not think it worth bothering the god of the universe i'm sure the great hebrew prophet was dazzled when the master of the universe responded to his prayers to bring down fire from heaven on a pagan sacrifice or to stop the heavens for three years so it didn't rain but i can't imagine elijah was ever more touched by god's love and care than when god flew in lunch by ravens when he was alone and despondent running for his life in the desert first kings 17 5-6 the story my associate buster and i were working new york city and he was handling the appointment set up and execution we met early in the hotel lobby to go to breakfast with the vp of a cable television network in a different part of manhattan from where we were staying we decided that a subway would be quicker and cheaper than a taxi considering the distance and the time allotted it was rush hour on the new york subway system and the press of bodies on the train cars and platforms made sardine cans look like rural texas highways buster and i jammed into a car on a southbound train and held our breath as the standing room only crowd jostled and swayed through the subway tunnels at one stop buster thought was ours he got off the train car and then quickly realized that he was mistaken about the stop gentlemen that he is he allowed the herd of new yorkers to push into the car before he did and the door closed between us the image of him on the other side of the glass door as the train pulled from the station is forever etched in my memory it was one thing to be separated from my associate but the awareness struck me quickly that i knew the name of the man we were meeting and the time of the appointment but i had no clue about the name and address of the hotel i didn't have any idea what subway stop what street or even what area i was supposed to be visiting and the train was taking me rapidly somewhere what i lacked in direction i sensed i was making up for in speed it occurred to me that i should get off the train before i ended up in new jersey so i disembarked at the next station walked up the stairs to the street and stood there dumbfounded then it occurred to me that i needed some divine help i'm a little slow at things like this i prayed dear god i need your guidance i have no idea where i'm supposed to go and i need you to show me i had never been to the hotel where the breakfast was scheduled and couldn't recall its name i thought i might recognize the name if i saw it written or heard it because buster had mentioned the hotel in conversations about the schedule right where i stood there was a tiny store selling tobacco candy newspapers magazines and the strange assortment of things found only in these tiny new york establishments i asked the clerk if i could borrow his new york yellow pages directory and he looked at me strangely he dug it out of a pile of huge directories on a lower shelf behind him and handed it to me i opened the directory to hotels i was instantly struck with the idiocy of my idea do you have any idea how many hotels there are in the new york yellow pages a huge section of fine print listed them all there was no way under the sun i was going to find a single hotel in that gargantuan list i handed the huge volume back to the clerk with thanks stepped back onto the sidewalk and walked slowly away from the store well lord i prayed you're going to have to bail me out of this one i chuckled to myself at the thought of my predicament and the notion that the god of the universe would entertain such a request and actually extricate me i walked toward the end of the block there was a bus stop shelter there you know the ones with huge advertising posters behind glass there right in front of me was a huge poster announcing a change of name the poster read the hotel mackalo is now the millennium broadway 145 west 44th street new york new york that's the hotel i exclaimed i grabbed a cab headed for the breakfast and arrived within five minutes of the appointed time buster and i were in manhattan for another week and neither of us ever saw another one of those posters i'm not going to suggest that the miracle includes god creating just one and placing it in a city of 8 million people on the only corner bus shelter where i was walking at the precise moment i needed its information but neither am i willing to ascribe the incident to mere chance especially when it happened in direct answer to a specific prayer you decide", "rQ9k5xrDAPY": "eleven years ago started pediatric practice and the three partners didn't want it just to be another pediatric practice or medical clinic we wanted it to be extra extra special and to be honest we knew there wasn't anything extra special about us but only something extra special about for God and so a lot of the vision was how do how do we have a medical practice how do we doctor kids but also how do we introduce them or be introduce them to Jesus just praying with families was it Bible studies versus on the law all sorts of little things that eventually came to actually having a set division that we call Mission Park side of mission parks I started out basically with the goal of serving in three areas one area was within our team serving and caring for people in our team the second area was serving and caring for people in our community and a third area was serving and for people abroad or internationally [Music] our biggest partner is miracle Hill and so we introduced ourselves to miracle ministries early on and and really declared from the start that the mission of mission Parkside was going to be orphan and vulnerable children and so miracle Hill miracle ministry was just a perfect perfect partner for that when they say why do we exist we exist to serve they mean it because today costs a lot of money to them and they mean that we exist to serve not just today because today's not the only time that we're doing this but when you're at Brio seeing a patient they mean that they want you to serve that patient on that day to me personally this service day means a lot I'm a big action step kind of person what that means is I love to say what I believe and I love to go do it and one things that will leave at Parkside pediatrics and all I've tried five one three Medical Group is that you need to love to serve like making sure their insurance is verified or looking out for a mom who's very fragile with a newborn there's so many different ways that were able to serve at Parkside pediatrics and beyond and that beyond is one ways we're able to serve here in the community is to be able to give back to people around us nobody is more deserving or less deserving than me and to be able to be the hands and feet of Jesus in practical ways this is really really important to me our first retreat day it was with miracle film that's why I was thought so I got to go 200 stores with a had retail and be able to clean the back and organize clothes that came in for their Nations and that was very overwhelming for me because it just started me that day that I have so much more that could be giving even my time and resources that can be giving my sympathy being a resource people don't have what I have and it's not all about having what I have or but I don't have it's all about what Jesus it's given me a lot of things it's given me is a building the trash chutes are people to do it well [Music] well we got a lot done we trimmed all the bushes through here man will mowed the lawn we old stand plant some flowers out front we're a faith-based practice and we we fight for our values and one of the things that we believe is that we're all working toward something bigger than ourselves and giving back to the community and having the opportunity to do work like this with miracle Hill it's just one way that we can pour into the world you know we've all been blessed with so much and so it's an opportunity to give to those that are going through a journey in their own lives and so we're just we're thrilled and anything we can do to give back so real real pleasure for us grateful for you being here today caring for human [Applause] [Music]", "QicBKC-mqCA": "all right what I want to show you here today is the soy wax double use for making our fin maker candles this is freedom soy wax American soil organics it's a company out of Iowa this is all-natural soy wax I melt 260 degrees had the fragrance and the proper percentage depending on what you want we do a lot of testing to get it the right fragrance lowered for the wax you want a wax that we're using and then pour it into container of your choice this is a 45 ml bag here like I like using this wax it comes in bead form other wax I've used before like four six for gold and wax stuff like that is in flakes I prefer the beads just cleaner to use I want to scoop it up you get more into your scope where the flakes you know make more of a mess and take up more space in the scooper so these things are nice and this bead for work it's 45 pound bag it cost fifty seven fifteen shipping to Michigan was thirty one twenty but I've been using this stuff for quite a while not over here anyway and yeah I really like it so I'll be making some more videos showing some more the products to use for creating our candles so please check back and subscribe thank you",

a shout out to miracle noodle really excited", "5VmfcR2S9lI": "so without question one of the most popular and common questions asked by new candle makers and really even candle makers have been doing it for a while is what wax should i use there are so many wax types out there now this is a topic you can find a lot of different information resources on and facebook groups researching talking to suppliers manufacturers there's a plethora of information about all the different types of waxes out there but because picking a wax is such a subjective decision everyone's going to have a different way to approach it they might use different factors to determine what wax is best for them or just based off judgment everyone reacts to things a little bit differently and because of that everyone's gonna have a little bit different opinion on the different types of waxes out there so i thought i'd put together a video on my perspective and how i go about ranking waxes so to speak and we'll dive a little bit into a few of those waxes today i'm going to focus this video on five of the most common wax types that new candle makers begin with because i get that requested more than anything and a lot of the candle groups and forums out there you see this question asked a lot by a lot of new candle makers because they don't really know where to start when they go to research candle wax they see so many options and so i really wanted to choose five of the most common waxes that they'll probably see when they're doing their research fortunately for many of you these are five of the most common waxes anyways out on the market so hopefully you find this this information valuable hi everyone my name is way thomas i'm the owner of black tie bar and candle company if you are new to this channel i just like to say welcome though this channel is dedicated just to kind of sharing my experiences my knowledge my information that i've learned over the years to really help out other candle makers this channel really is dedicated to not just candle making but also candle making business so hopefully you find this channel uh valuable and helpful and if you're not already a subscriber please consider subscribing and hitting the bell notification so you can get alerted whenever i post new videos so i really appreciate you stopping by give this video a like and let's get started so the first thing we're going to do today is i'm going to show you kind of a presentation of the five waxes that we're going to review today and we're just going to go over real quick overview of each of those waxes just so more than anything you can re-familiarize yourself with them or an introduction to some of you brand new candle makers after that we're going to follow it up i'm going to show you the tool that i created that kind of ranks different types of waxes by several different factors and what's really neat about this tool that i put together is it has a default rating where everything's just kind of weighted equally but i've also set it up so that you can customize it because some factors are more important other cattle makers than others for example some care more than anything about how easy it is to use others care more about cost others care more about fragrance throw things like that so it allows you to adjust the weight of those different factors to meet your preferences we're going to go into a review a sample review of these five you'll see me using that tool to rank the five waxes we're going to talk about today and kind of see where they come up and i'll even do it a few different ways to show you how the factors or the rankings can change just by adjusting some of those weighted factors finally in the description below i will have a link to that tool that all of you are more than welcome to freely use if you have any issues with that link taking you to uh to the google sheet tool to use please just let me know but i am going to basically share out the template and then all you have to do is modify it the reason i want to share this tool is because it gives all of you individual candle makers a chance to kind of rank your waxes for yourself as you start sampling more waxes and getting some more experience then you can go back and edit this and use this tool to kind of re-rank the waxes most more to your needs so you can choose the waxes that you want to rank and you can fill in how you feel each wax does in each category and then you can change the weight of each category as well so again i really tried to create it and tailor it to specific candle makers so it's customizable for you all okay so as you can see here this is a july 2020 wax reviews and and you'll notice here we're only going to be doing container waxes you don't really want to do reviews of different waxes for different purposes because they all behave differently intentionally and so we're going to stick to just container waxes or jar waxes for this review and again we're going to start with just five today five we're going to do our gw 464 igi 4627 4630 6006 and a joy wax pro blend 600. now the reason i have those listed together if any of you are from really familiar with those two waxes you'll realize that they are essentially the same wax they're both a 52-48 percentage of soy to paraffin they behave almost identically really the difference is that they're just sold from two different uh suppliers so we're gonna group those two together in future videos we will go beyond this list of five and just continue to add some more a few assumptions that we have to keep in mind when we're going to be talking about these waxes and so i want to go over those really quickly the first is fragrance load as you will see once we get to the tool that i created the fragrance load is not i do not have calculated into the rankings of the waxes and the reason is is because as you can see here fragrance load is not reflective of how well a wax can throw fragrance or perform in general for example many waxes have a six percent or eight percent max fragrance load but they throw the oil or they throw the fragrance so well that they're still better than waxes that can hold 10 or 12 percent and so you don't really want to let fragrance load or the most the max amount of fragrance you can add to a wax to be any kind of deciding factor it should be about the performance not the capacity hopefully that makes sense and we're also going to not include color the reason we're not going to talk about colors there's too many preference variations many people don't use color at all some people use color and they really want a deep vibrant rich color others want more of a pastel looking hue to them so because color really doesn't affect so much the performance of the wax itself i didn't really include it in this in the calculations that we'll see later but you're more than welcome to so once you see the tool that i'm talking about a little later you can swap out any one of the factors for a factor of your own so if you don't care about how well something ships in hot weather you can take that out and put in color if you'd want you can customize this as i said earlier to fit your needs but for me i left out color next is hot and cold throw and i included this in assumptions just because we need to all remember that is a very subjective matter of opinion it's effect and it's also affected by the type and the quality of the fragrance oil so it's not necessarily fair to think that a wax doesn't throw an oil very well if the fragrance oil itself is not a very good quality it might not throw well in any wax just keep that in mind when you're doing fragrance testing that you're using a oil that is typically a good thrower and use that as your baseline and then shrinkage and sinkholes now this will be on the calculation sheet but again like color i do not have it included and the reason is is even though this is a major concern it is hard to factor in to a wax and the reason is well first i should say that i do factor it in into my overall ease of use category and we'll talk about it later but the truth about shrinkage and this is a really tough subject because everyone thinks shrinkage and wax contracting is a bad thing it's actually not it can be good and bad shrinkage is good if it's an even uniform shrinkage of the entire wax of all of the wax together for example modeling paraffins require second pour sometimes three pours and and many people don't like that but they shrink so much that all the wax shrinks uniformly together that it creates a nice big dip that you didn't have to do another pour to fill it in now you're probably thinking well that sounds horrible i don't want to have to do second and third pores the benefit of a uniform shrinkage is all of the wax shrinks in so tightly together that you get no sinkholes now that crater be where it needs another pour is not a sinkhole that's just where the rack wax has shrunk and you need to fill it in but it's not a sinkhole in fact you're not going to get sinkholes with that type of wax it all shrunk together so tightly that you're going to get completely filled full dense finished wax on the contrary a lot of waxes these days particularly soy waxes different parts of the wax will actually constrict and or contract at different times and different amounts for example you might have the middle of your candle that is shrinking really bad but you don't see it on the top or the bottom or maybe you only see it at the top or or only at the bottom and a lot of waxes do this and what that happens is you get uneven and non-uniform contraction of the wax that that is what creates pockets and sinkholes in your candles and you can't always see those from the surface and that is that leads to a lot of problems with okay sorry about that i had to swap out mics real quick my other one just randomly died on me in the middle of speaking so hopefully you can pick right back up where we left off what i was saying about shrinkage and sinkholes is just that so many people are afraid of shrinkage and and for good reason if it leads to sinkholes but not all shrinkage is bad sometimes it's just telling you something about your wax and as long as you understand what that means then shrinkage really can be a good or a bad thing so just just keep that in mind going forward i will probably do another video down the road on wax contraction and kind of go into those details a little bit more and then the last assumption is just subjectivity and that is just realizing that ratings and reviews are subjective by nature everything i'm talking about today is my opinion on my experiences that i've had with these waxes every candle maker has different reactions and different experiences with the waxes they use and so everyone is going to have a different opinion i mean we're all human which means we all have opinions so don't take you know everything you hear as final word you know i take everything with a grain of salt everyone has a different perspective on wax and the different factors when they're when they're weighing their waxes against one another so with that being said let's do a quick overview of each wax the first facts we're going to talk about today is golden brands gw464 or mostly referred to as just 464. as you can see here it is a soy wax most people are familiar with that in fact golden brands 464 is one of the most popular if not the most popular starting waxes for new candle makers and that's not to say that it's only a beginner wax i don't mean it that way in fact a lot of candle makers continue to use this wax for a while the reason though it's so popular with new candle makers is one because it's soy and new candle makers whether for good reason or not choose soy waxes when they begin candle making possibly because they're wanting to get into kennel making to offer some kind of clean alternative sometimes they've just read things about candle making and how regular paraffin candles can be hazardous on your health which is highly debatable again we'll have other conversations and videos on that topic down the road but uh last you know five to ten years soy candles have really taken off and now coconut waxes are starting to get popular it's really just kind of a circular thing and things come in waves and things go but soy is a highly sought after marketable niche right now and candle makers can use that to market their candles as organic and so that is a big reason that people flock to 464 early on but the single biggest reason that people flock to 464 when they're first starting out is purely because it is marketed so well it is marketed better than any other wax period possibly because of its low cost point so it's more affordable for a lot of new candle makers it's also highly available almost every candle supplier offers 464. that's not the only wax that is offered in high availability but it is it is probably the most popular for that reason it is highly marketable one of the benefits of gew-464 is that it comes in flake form pros of 464 is as i just went into detail on it is marketable towards customers wanting a soy or natural product it also has a nice soft creamy appearance it's fairly consistent with you know even burns it is in a fix inexpensive and affordable for new candle makers it's got great cold throw and again it is highly available the cons of 464 are very polarizing in fact the wax itself is very polarizing its benefits are great and its negatives and drawbacks are also significant and so it's really about what is the most important thing to you when you're candle making and we'll go into this when i show you the wax rating worksheet that i use but it's really about identifying the most important factors to you when it comes to choosing a wax gw464 is not a wax that kind of falls in the middle somewhere where if people can't really decide they just go with it it's not a well-rounded overall wax it's really it's got its strengths and it's got its weaknesses and you just got to determine what's important to you so the cons of 464 are that it's very picky on fragrances and and related to that is that it's got a weaker hot throw in general compared to other waxes now as far as compared to other soy waxes it's probably right around the middle maybe even a little bit better some other than some soys but compared to all your parasites paraffins your palm waxes your modeling waxes and things like that it is going to be weaker in general than those now it doesn't mean you're not going to have good acceptable hot throw still it also doesn't mean that it's not going to be good with really good with some fragrances oils that work well with 464 will throw excellent there's no question about that in fact you'll see a lot of people saying i've never had issues with 464. and so candle makers that have had no issues with 464 fragrance though is generally due to one or two reasons either one through experimenting and testing they have identified and selected oils that just happen to work well at 464. they're compatible with the wax and two to this point they may have just been fairly lucky choosing their oils it's very hit or miss there are a lot of oils that just flat out do not work with this wax no matter what you do it's not going to throw it very well now again 464 isn't the only wax like that but just know that it is a common issue with 464. um however also among the oils that it does throw well generally at an apple apples comparison to like a a paraffin wax like 4627 is just going to be weaker that doesn't mean it's a bad thing though some people don't want to be knocked out by the scent from their candle they would want kind of a pleasant balanced smell another negative is the frosting by 464 probably one of the biggest complaints with this wax in general the two are frosting and fragrance thorough frosting is that kind of crystallized white white crystallized look you see on the side of the jars on the top of the candle it's more noticeable if you use color with 464 but you will see it on your uncolored candles as well now there are little tips and things that you can do little tricks you can do to kind of hide that frosted look but at some point it's going to come back most of the time not much you can do about it so you kind of as most people that use 464 say you're just going to have to embrace it if you want to use that wax sinkholes is a big one for 464. it falls into the category of candles that shrink non-uniformly like i discussed previously it will cool at different rates um different amounts throughout the wax itself and so you can have sinkholes that kind of are hidden and that will cause drowning wicks air pockets sometimes wicks that end up actually being overly large and large flames it really how a sinkhole affects your candles is almost impossible to detect and that is one of the problems with sinkholes it also has a very unattractive surface and most of you probably know what i'm referring to here that is that rough kind of cottage cheesy cratered looking top again you can do things to fix that early on sometimes you can prevent it entirely early on and other times you can fix it with a heat gun but once it leaves your shelves and goes to customers there's nothing you can do about it at that point in fact usually after the first burn it's going to come right back customers of soil candles generally don't mind because they just understand that's what soy candles do but a lot of people just can't get past that that fact and so just keep that in mind and for some reason under con this was not a con it should have been on the pro side was that it has less noticeable soot it's generally a lighter color almost kind of a gray or a whitish smoke but that's also highly encouraging to people kind of going after that natural look all right so the next wax is almost like a polar opposite 464. that is igi 4627 it is commonly referred to as its comfort blend now this is a paraffin wax and it is a very soft almost vaseline type texture and it actually arrives in a bag that can be a little tricky to deal with and we'll talk about that here in a minute but it has kind of an in the middle average melt point for a container wax the pros incredible hot and cold throw it is almost impossible to find a better scent throwing wax on the market and that is its main attraction it's also fairly easy to use after it's been melted and that's the caveat we'll talk about that here in a sec and then it's got color great color and fragrance retention deep vibrant colors it also has a negligible cure time so once it's poured as soon as it sets up it's ready to go you don't have to wait you know several days weeks or a couple weeks like you do with some of these soy waxes to really detect that max fragrance that it's outputting it's also highly available it is a very common popular wax and so it is sold in many places and it's very consistently performing wax the cons you know this is what i referenced a few times and that is a very messy packaging because of that vaseline type texture it is extremely soft extremely greasy and it can be very difficult to get out of the bag initially now some people could maybe post in the comments in this video as well as you can find it all over different tips by candle makers who use 4627 on how to get that out of the package a little bit easier how to store it for easier use going forward but it is worth mentioning is one of the more difficult waxes to deal with out of the box and it's also more expensive than your average uh wax and then lastly you can soften up a little bit during shipping not too bad it's already a soft wax and its melt point is not super low like that of 46 464. so uh but it but it is something to keep in mind next and closely related is igi 4630 or the harmony blend the suppliers will market this wax as pretty much the the the brother or sister of 4627 in the sense that it is it is described as essentially the same wax but they were able to put it in slab form rather than the messy the messy bag anyone that's used both of them there's a noticeable difference it's not significant but it's enough that you recognize it's there for example it does have great hot throws still but i wouldn't say it's quite as good of the hot throw as uh the 4627 and it could just be because of whatever changes they had to make to put into a slab form maybe because it's not quite as soft it's a little more dense that could be the reasons for that but it's still great hot throw but not quite as strong as 46.27 again it is easier to use and uh it's it's easier to use than 4627 purely because of the packaging it still has great color fragrance retention negligible cure time and availability just like 46 27 did the cons are even though it is easier to deal with than 46 27 out of the box the slabs can still be a little bit sticky in fact a lot of them will use some kind of saran or some kind of wrap or sleeve or film that they'll package it in in the box and that can tend to really stick into that wax a little bit so it can still be a little tricky it does have subtle shrinkage again it's not a bad thing in this wax you're not going to really see sinkholes but you will notice some in larger jars you will notice a little bit of contraction by the wax wicking can be a little bit tricky with this with this wax and you could argue that with 46 27 too it's kind of in that range where due to the melt point being mid-range it's also a dense wax it's not tough to find a wick that works well with it or works fine but you just got to keep an eye on sizing it can it can be a little tricky you just don't want it to get too too large or mushroom too much and then finally the last con was that it's it's easier to use but not quite as strong as 4627 i don't know that's a con more of a note the next wax is a very popular one called igi-6006 you will see this one referenced and mentioned almost equally as many times as 464 these days um as well as the one following this it is a the first parasoy or paraffin soy blend that we're going to look at today now it's a 70 paraffin 30 soy it also comes in a slab form but it's a very easy form to use uh it's soft enough where it's easy to cut but not so soft that it's just melting in your hands the melt point is higher than on this wax than any of the others we're discussing today which is also important to note pros great hot throw it is 70 paraffin and the way this wax melts and the way this wax throws is is excellent overall availability such popular wax made by a very reputable wax company manufacturer and so it is highly available most your suppliers will offer it it holds up in summer heat better than most the other waxes simply because of that melt point 133 container waxes do have a tendency during hot summer heat when being shipped to start softening up and melting a little bit in the jars 6006 is not immune to that but it holds up much better than the average wax it's also considered one of the best overall waxes and that is because it's just it might not be the best at any one thing but it's nowhere near the worst on anything either it's really a really well overall balanced wax earlier i was talking about 464 being very polarizing it's got great pros and it's got bad cons well 6006 really is in the middle it really is a very well-rounded wax and then it also has excellent creamy soft smooth appearance and texture the cons is that it can take a little bit getting used to it is an interesting wax that really combines paraffin and soy and so you're bringing on some of the benefits of each but also some of the challenges and so if you're coming to 6006 from something like 464 which a lot of people do they'll find it really tricky at first it's a it's a different beast and so you just gotta get take a little time to experiment and get used to working with it and kind of to that to that point wicking can be a little bit tricky with this wax it is a very highly it's a highly viscous wax it's a dense wax and because of the combination of paraffin and soy wicking can be a little interesting but once you get it locked down it's it's a great burning candle it also has occasional shrinkage now you will get sinkholes occasionally occasionally with this wax if you're not careful you really want to control your temperatures when it's cooling the size of the jar matters significantly for example you're taller thinner jars or jars that are taller than they are wide and then large jars in general will have sink hole problems more than others and so it's really about experimenting and finding that sweet spot for temperature your poor temperature whether or not you preheat the jars the ambient temperature of where they're cooling things like that but just keep that in mind a lot of 6006 users will poke little relief holes with like a toothpick about two-thirds of the way through the settling process and then kind of just hit it with a heat gun and that'll smooth it out take care of any of those shrinkage or sinkhole concerns i mean the last con is inconsistent jar adhesion again once you've kind of got a good process in place you can pretty much eliminate this problem but and i wouldn't focus too much on jar adhesion anyways wet spots as they're known are an aesthetic thing only they don't affect the burn of the candle the performance at all but candle makers it drives us nuts at first but just the best thing you can do is learn to just get away from caring about that so much because once again your candles leave your shelves or leave your home or your location and go to a customer you have no control over the temperature what causes that wax to expand and shrink and expand and shrink and cause wet spots or jar adhesion issues is changes in temperature you can't control that once it leaves your ownership and so i wouldn't focus on it too much but just know that 6006 does have a tendency like one half of your jar one side of your jar would look perfect the other jar will show some of that adhesion issues where it's separated from the glass last but not least is a basically two axes we're going to review together one is nature gardens joy wax and the other is flaming candles pro blend 600. the reason i'm combining the two is if anyone has ever used both you realize that they're pretty much the same wax the only difference is the company the name that they slapped on it for the most part and then anything that they might be doing in-house to manipulate it a little bit i don't know that that's true i can't verify that but as far as the properties of the wax they're extremely similar if not the same they're both a paraffin soy blend this time slightly heavier on the soy at a 52 percent 48 percent um and the reason that it is intentional the reason is that uh it allows you to market it as a organic soy blend or soy candle although 99 of people will still say a soy blend um it also comes in a slab packaging like 6006 but it's a little bit softer and then the pros for this wax is that it is by far the easiest to use out of all the waxes we've talked today talked about today and i would say that compared to almost any waxes i've ever used period it's a huge benefit of this wax it has great adhesion it's mostly single pour wicking is easier with this that wax than anything else but you do have to understand that this wax because of its low melt point and 50 paraffin it does require much smaller wicks than average and so a lot of people have issues over wicking this wax at first and it's got a great smooth creamy appearance now the cons well for starters it's a little harder to find you mostly have to rely from your single source suppliers my advice is i would try whichever of these you you want from the company you prefer and stick with it and then just just know that one of the risks in doing so is that it's not as available as your other waxes on the market or as easily available i should say it also has moderate hot throw it's better overall than many will find with something like a pure soy like 464 but it's not near as good as your heavy parasol is like 6006 or your paraffins for sure like we discussed earlier and the reason part of the reason for that it is also fairly picky on your fragrance oils being half soy many fragrance oils it works great with some it doesn't so it really comes down to testing and learning what oils work best for you in this wax and the last one is it definitely does not hold up very well in summer heat which was a con of 464 as well if i didn't mention that they both have really low melt points and in shipping and summer hot heat sitting in trucks or sitting outside a doorstep in the middle of summer it doesn't hold up very well it will start to melt get droplets candles customers will open up candles especially if they're upside down that have started to kind of leak and and so if you're using this or fish 464 during the summer i would highly suggest if you live in hot areas or shipping to hot areas i would suggest using some kind of gel packs when you ship all right so that is a summary overview of all the waxes we're talking about today now i'm going to get into the wax rating and selection worksheet okay so here's that worksheet and before we get into it i'm going to have another video that goes into this worksheet tool and how i put it together in the way it works some of it is very self-explanatory but it is highly customizable and i'm not going to go into the details in this video but i do encourage you to watch that video as soon as i have it ready i'll make sure it's linked in to this description uh once it's complete as well as i'll put a card at the top of this video so you can click on it and take you to that video but just know that there will be another video going into the details about how this works how i came up with the methods how you can customize it for your preferences how you can adjust the factors that are used as well as the weight of each factor meaning how much you care about certain factors when it comes to deciding a wax but just to make sure this is understandable when we're doing the reviews today it is done on a five point scale which you'll see over here on the right side one being poor two being below average three being average four above average and five superior in other words one is low five is high once the worst five is the best you get the point so out of the gate i have this all set up for default and i do need to point that out to you because essentially what that means is every one of these factors is rated equally there are 10 total factors and each one is weighted the same so it's going to be a total score and a weighted score will be the same in this case because everything is equally weighted now i'm going to show you three other examples real quick when we're done putting in the rankings for each wax to show you how it can adjust the actual weighted score and then one more thing to note real quick is there's two columns that are have a black out here at the top and i already have them pre-filled in that is shrinkage which i just determine is low moderate or high in fragrance load the max fragrance load i don't have those calculated into the percentages for the reasons we talked about earlier fragrance load doesn't indicate how well it throws or how well it performs and shrinkage can be good or bad so you don't want it to really skew the results so i just noted for informational purposes only all that being said let's start with the rankings with golden wax 464 i gave this on a scale of one of five for cost and availability a five for readiness and cure time i gave it a one for jar adhesion i gave it a five surface and texture i gave it a one hot weather shipping a two overall ease of use a four fragrance compatibility a two hot throw 2 cold throw 5 and wicking and overall burn i gave it a 4. that gives it a total score of 31 and again the weighted score in this case will equal the total score because every factor is weighted evenly the next wax is the 4627 cost and availability it only gets a two but readiness and cure time a five jar adhesion a4 surface and texture a three hot weather shipping a three overall ease of use three fragrance compatibility five hot throw five coat throw five and then wick and burning is a three that gives it a total score of thirty eight 46 30. i gave it a three for constant ability availability readiness and cure time it has a five jar adhesion a three uh it has surface texture three hot weather shipping three overall ease of use four fragrance compatibility five hot throw four cold throw three and wick and burning three for a total score of thirty six six thousand six the parasoid blend 7030 paraffin to soy ratio i gave it cost availability of four readiness and cure time four jar adhesion three surface and texture four hot weather shipping five overall ease of use three fragrance compatibility four hot throw four cold throw three about average wick and burning overall would be three now the reason i'm putting these in so quickly is i've already determined these numbers i'm just using another sheet to reference them to kind of speed up this process but i really do take a lot of time to determine what score each one of these wax gets per category and then the joy wax or pro blend 600 is the 50 50 roughly paraffin soy blend cost availability i gave it a 5. it is oh i'm sorry that is not right cost availability it gets a three it's about average um fairly affordable cost but not the easiest one to find uh readiness and cure time i gave it a three jar adhesion five surface and texture four hot weather shipping three overall use of use definitely a five fragrance compatibility three hot throw three cold throw four and finally wicking and burning because it burns so well and it's very easy wick to a wax to wick it gets a 5 for a total score of 38. now there's little filters up each of these categories we're going to category uh categorized by weighted score and we're going to do highest to lowest so we put the highest score at the top lowest score at the bottom so if we don't change any of these factors and give everything the equal weight when considering each factor then these are the final results 4627 leading the charge actually tied with problem 600 and joy wax at 38 points just under that is 6006 and 46 30 and then coming up last would be 464. again this is just based off of the factors everything treated equally and my opinion on these factors i did mention in the earlier when we were reviewing the waxes that 464 is very polarizing wax and it's not going to do very well as an overall well-balanced wax as you can see here if every category is treated the same to me it's not surprising to see 464 having the lowest score because overall it is not a balanced wax but you're going to see in another example here that depending on the factors that you care the most about they can actually win and be the highest wax so out of the gate everything all considered equal i would 100 agree with this and that that is uh what i would have agreed with actually going into this um i find these top three to be my favorite overall overall waxes to use but let's look at an example where we're going to look at ease of use so if we care more than anything about the ease of use and how well it is to work with the wax i've already got the numbers put in here i've already sorted it highest to lowest and in this case you can see that overall use of use was rate was the most important surface and texture jar adhesion wicking and burning cost availability this these values are sorted in a way that the factors are weighted more towards ease of use and in this case the joy wax protein 601 with 6006 coming in second and then you can see going down now the reason 464 is still towards the bottom or at the bottom in this particular rating is because of the issues with the surface and the frosting and the hot weather shipping and having to fix the texture and surface you know little things like that and dealing with sinkholes and so again if if the factors you care the most about are aesthetics and ease of use then i would 100 agree with these rankings again now the next one is what if you care the most about performance and fragrance like fragrance throw is number one for you and that is the case for many people so this next one is going to have these automatically refactored where fragrance and performance are rated the highest and in this case it's already sorted but just to be safe we'll do it one more time 46 27 leads the charge with the 44.4 which is great score 4630 coming up next 6006 i mean you can just look at these and you can tell that they're kind of an order of fragrance throw capabilities and so these results wouldn't surprise me whatsoever either now that doesn't mean these easiest waxes to work with doesn't mean they're the most affordable um it doesn't mean that they're gonna have the best overall look and appearance but this is the order that i would put these in just knowing my experience with these waxes before i even did a rating any kind of scale this is the order i would have rated these on hot throw and fragrance performance for all you 464 lovers out there don't worry i haven't left you out there is use cases to have a preference for that wax over all others and the biggest of those is being carrying the most about the type of wax if you're looking for something natural or soy or something you can market as organic and you care the most about that well i've i've created i've waited on this next example i have weighted those factors heavier to meet those preferences and we're going to sort one more time just to be safe and this time you can see goldmax 464 is leading not by much but it is definitely leading the race and followed up behind that is a problem 600 or joy wax and then your 6006 you 46 30 and 46 27. again this completely makes sense to me you've got your soy first your two parasites next and then your paraffins and so the point of showing you four different ways of looking at this worksheet is for two reasons one it really matters it really depends on what matters the most to you um we can treat everything the same or you can desi you can weight these factors to your preferences and then the second point was just to show how customizable this worksheet is and uh in the video in another video i will go into more detail of how to do all this how i built this how it works and how to customize it for you but hopefully these four examples give you a good idea of these five waxes how they stand up against each other um if you're looking for that kind of overall well-balanced wax you're definitely gonna have a lot of luck with your parasois if and if you're looking for fragrance those you're going to look for your paraffins if you're looking for ease of use you're going to look at your problem 600s and 6006s and then you know if you're looking for something natural 464s are going to work so again hopefully these four examples really gave you a good idea on uh on how these waxes stack up against each other if you have any questions can always reference this video in the future and then once again i will have a link to this worksheet in the description feel free to download it and use it as much as you want and then again i really highly encourage you to check out the other video i'll get it posted as soon as i can that goes over how do you really use this worksheet for yourself so with all that being said i really hope you enjoyed this video if you have any questions or comments please put it in in the comments section below i'll do my best i try to answer every one of those and then finally just just remember this is all speculation this is all opinion based this is my experiences with these waxes i use all of these waxes every one of them and i use them for different purposes um and for different customers i have wholesale lines i have uh white label and private label customers and so i do use all these waxes and i use them for entirely different reasons but the most important thing about choosing a wax is they all have the pros and cons it's a matter of deciding what is most important to you you guys have a great day thank you", "ytvkzUUEDYM": "bland tasteless and smelly noodles sounds great right it actually is and it's pretty healthy the way we will take care of that smell later Pad Thai the best takeout dish but you don't order it too many times because you're worried about having the same post mates driver twice so you can just make it at home Fanta is not not healthy but I have a couple swaps here to make it even healthier usually it's made with rice noodles which is great if you can't have gluten like me but today we're using a different noodle that has even more nutrition in it they are shirataki noodles shirataki noodles are made out of a konjac yam and it's basically fiber and water so it really ups the nutrition they smell pretty gross not gonna lie you can't blame them though because they're full of fiber but I have a couple tricks to get rid of that stink and then once this thing has gone their tasteless they can take on any flavor you add to it the first part of that is adding it to boiling water so I'm gonna start that and you can check out my ingredients for the sauce I have coconut aminos sriracha garlic almond butter coconut oil lime and maple syrup we're using shirataki noodles and four toppings I have bean sprouts peanuts green onion bread cabbage and sesame seeds our noodles finish boiling and I have transferred it onto just a dry pan this is the step that really takes out the smell so next I'm gonna make our sauce all these continue to cook a little bit I have almond butter almond butter is the fat and the emulsifier of this sauce we have sriracha for a little bit of spice the tedious bit of maple syrup for sweetness melted coconut oil coconut aminos which is my favorite soy sauce substitution lime juice minced garlic a pinch of salt keep your eye on the noodles while you do this we don't want them to burn to the pan but it does take them about 10 minutes to really get to where they need to be I believe in you noodles now I'm gonna whisk together our sauce and this sauce has so much flavor that it'll be enough for couple servings so I'm gonna continue watching these noodles they got a couple more minutes and while I'm doing that check out my pretty healthy tip of the day the key to a good sauce is all the different ingredients that add layers of flavor I'm gonna show you how to make an easy sauce at home that's super customizable so you can make it however you want it the first element is something acidic I'm using lemon juice today I'm doing it first so I can watch out for seeds and pick them out olive oil is gonna give us that richness I'm gonna add a good dose of this eyeball it and then since water-based ingredients and oil-based ingredients don't like each other and separate we need an emulsifier and emulsifiers anything that's gonna bind all this together and today we're using DeJohn mustard I'm gonna give it a good spoonful and then some salt and pepper classic and whisk it together I think I want to add a little bit more olive oil told you we're eyeballing this looks great this is a great simple sauce but like I said you can really customize which you could add more heat more sweetness more garlic like we had in our other sauce and it stores perfectly have fun experimenting and get saucy ok so it's been about 10 minutes and our noodles smell like a field of daisies not really but they don't smell farty anymore which is great I'm gonna kill the heat and go ahead and add in our sauce while it's still a little hot leftover heat will just help this sauce to really spread throughout all the noodles and it will start to take on that color you love and know every noodle must be covered this is enough for two servings which means I can have some now and I can have some for lunch tomorrow I plants have my prep box the most successful people in life prep their lunch portion up some now whoa that's a long noodle alright and some for tomorrow this is this box so cute there's literally containers for my toppings it's like they knew I was making this for toppings Oh sesame seeds this adds a little bit of like nutty seedy flavor but honestly I just feel like it makes it look really authentic and then I have green onions which for tomorrow I'm going to put them in their own container obviously gonna put it on top some cabbage bean sprouts and the name of allergens kind of separate these and for the last little bit of flavor some more lime on top this will also help keep those bean sprouts fresh until tomorrow tada dinner and lunch how's your favorite part you get to laugh at me trying to eat this with chopsticks but first look at all these colors [Music] mmm my favorite thing about this dish is a little bit of spice and now that we know how to build a perfect sauce you can taste all the components and you don't have to be embarrassed about ordering pad thai from takeout again you can make it at home you can make it a little bit healthier and you can make it with a lot of fiber thanks to these noodles even if they were a little stinky to start but no judgment", "EuPk8WLGdks": "what is up you guys welcome to my channel it isn't gonna be 69 back at it again with a new youtube video and it's clear me just clear my floor nightmare want a solid practice back to review if you don't like it you can do what now say with me so far there but but oh yeah yeah welcome welcome my channel my name is Michi Rochelle meet you 69 I floated on Mondays over anime on other days and I do crappy comedy and review it's like tons of cameras cuz I'm a medical cannabis patient in Florida so if that's your bag subscribe it says to my channel sis and if you new here welcome if you're here welcome back and if you're hater oh my god okay so let's address the elephant in the room um my hands are a little it stain from cooking and there's no no pause but besides that my eyeshadow it's flawless I mean let's get into today's video so today I have a little bit of a dispensary fail so I went to cetera and I picked up some shadow the shadow that I picked up was the string called sherbert and it was really burning my throat I mean hella bad I did a review on it and I didn't even upload it because I wasn't quite sure if I was getting sick or if it was a product so I did some quality control it was the product so I returned it and I picked up some one this is what I have left of it it's like orange II there it is this was my kyon ativ which is a hybrid Leslie sets and here's you not leave Leigh sad I could not find this [ __ ] on Leafly or anywhere so uh what did they make up the strain I know it's florida finest but it makes for a really good read because apparently the guy who made this I don't know he's in [ __ ] jail for something or went to federal prison I don't read the article it's like I say read your Donnelly please that's okay so first of all I want to talk about the shatter I really did like the effects of it but it was just making my throat [ __ ] light on fire so I was like okay I'm big you know we refi they gave me credit I'm actually give me $50 credit so I didn't spend $10 and I got this mkhaya native but there is an issue with it so I'm just gonna let you guys know I have already returned this product of course they let me keep it and I'm gonna show you why and I did get some flour in replacement which was kind of low THC I haven't even smoked it yet I'm gonna do a different review on that so that being said let's talk about this wax and what's wrong with it so at first it doesn't really have much of a smell the smell that it has is pretty much identical to how it tastes which is actually I mean it's pretty good you're gonna see what the problem is in two seconds let's take a DAB so we got my dad too and I'm gonna do a quality assurance check with you guys just so you can see what I'm talking about I have a different banger originally when I made the video and I had problems even when I put it in my nectar collector it's gonna do the same thing let me show you guys what it does yeah some on here good I'll listen I have my and I'm gonna show you this night temperature I don't know if it shows you but it's at 595 97 it's definitely not too hot let's get it on alright it's still smoking cuz it has stuff in it so that being said I'm showing you there's still stuff in it burning off and earlier all right here we go listen what in the actual [ __ ] was that did you hear the sizzle it's like bacon grease by the way if you're new to my channel um I do have a new adapter to my rig this is called key bucket I also have the flower pot this is all by new vape you guys go check out their website the links down below and save yourself five percent by using code Meucci 69 okay so hmm and I actually wanted to do this review because somebody requested that I do more wax and that's what I was up to man I was like I'm gonna go I'm gonna I hunted it down and I got some more so that being said I you know was in a couple groups and they're like yeah you need to call this so I called them and they told me to bring the video down to cetera I brought the video down and I showed the management and he was like what the [ __ ] hi yes editing michelle here from the future the video in question is the video that i made with its sizzling in the bucket like that that i posted on a few groups so i believe i posted it on my Instagram check it out if you want to see it oh I think this by the way I think this was clocking in at like 69 percent convenient I did like the taste I like the takes I like the effects but that to me there is either like some butane in it or some ethanol or something that wasn't cooked off or water and that they told me that they thought there was just water in the product so they did actually give me store credit again kudos to them for backing up their product I definitely will say that picked up some I picked up some LA Confidential and some something cush it's something cush whatever I'll review those for you so I don't know if you guys have already had any problems with products like that like that [ __ ] was like bacon like [ __ ] that is terrifying so any out yeah what do you guys you know what do you think have you so if you guys are having that have then with your products just know that is not oh it's supposed to be and I'll do a quality control real quick I'm going to show you guys the quality control just so you know that it was not that banger okay so let's do this doing a comparison I'm almost done because I eat a heart that says old I'm gonna show him that it's it just is I don't know why all right for shits and giggles there's the 9 pound hammer shatter they made a little the beginning because there was still some on the end of that but there is no more now as you can see temperature for the same put two different products it and they did tell me it was not supposed to make this myself you guys are getting wax and it's making that noise in your rig please go return it that is not how it's supposed to sound I'm throwing that out there because that's not that's not that's not cool but like I said luckily they had no problems they corrected the situation but the [ __ ] flour I got was low THC go figure at least I'm glad that I got it so it is what it is so keep your eyes on your meds if you're unhappy with something do a little research call him up take it back I mean that that again kudos to them for rectifying luck to find situation that was awesome Oh quarry teams making me go [ __ ] nuts I hope you guys are doing okay and I think that's it we have made it to the end of the video so if you've made it all the way to the end of this video you are awesome go ahead and drop a like you can be a [ __ ] and drop a Dick's Lake and hit the bell to get notified when I post later [ __ ] but but but by qivana that she needs to go I'm just saying okay bye", "SPxA44jfuFE": "so at Vika welcome to hot Thai Kitchen today's recipe is going to be a treat particularly if you are watching your waistline I am making a Thai curry noodle bowl which I know sounds very rich and indulgent but I'm actually going to use these tofu shirataki noodles which are a low-carb low-calorie noodle substitute and I've always been a fan of these in fact back when I was watching my weight I cooked a lot with these and so I was super excited to get an opportunity to work with house was to develop this recipe for them so this dish is actually inspired by a traditional dish that has a spicy curry sauce poured over a kind of rice noodles we call kinome Deen but today I'm going to lighten it up by using these instead let's get started this sauce is essentially a basic curry sauce but with a little twist so I'm going to start out as I normally do all of my curries and that is sauteing the paste I'm going to saute it in reduced coconut milk I'm going to bring that to a boil and today I am using two types of curry paste red curry paste and yellow yes did you know you could mix curry paste together and come up with a new flavor I love the flavor of red curry paste but I also love the warm spices that yellow curry paste has these are just store-bought but if you want to make your own I have recipes for both these curry pastes and you can do all red if you want to or you can do all yellow really or you can do green really this one is a very very flexible sauce keep reducing it until it's very thick and what's going to happen is the oil from the coconut milk is going to start breaking away from the rest of the curry paste so my curry paste is very thick now and I can see the coconut oil breaking and separating on the edges now if your coconut milk is not doing that don't worry about it if it's very thick and you've cooked it for a while just move on some coconut milk just has been processed to prevent separation mmm smelling good I'm going to have the rest of my coconut milk and also some water now if you want you can add chicken stock and make it even better that is starting to look like occurring a secret ingredient now this is my own little trick I'm going to add some chopped tomato we typically don't do this in Thailand but tomatoes and red and yellow curries go really well together we add cherry tomatoes to yellow curry we add cherry tomatoes to red curry and I love how the brightness of the tomatoes really accent the flavor of the curry paste and so I thought why not add it into the sauce and actually let the tomatoes sort of become a part of the sauce let it dissolve turn it down to a simmer and let it reduce for about 10 minutes until it's thick and also until the tomatoes are completely disintegrated into the sauce and then we'll come and check back on it so the sauce is now reduced rich thick and the tomatoes have completely dissolved now I'm going to add some protein this is just some white fish this is barramundi to be exact but you can add any kind of white fish and I just cut it into little little pieces and what I want is for it to actually completely sort of break down and the fish becomes essentially a thickener for the curry and we do this a lot for the sauce bar kind of Dean and in Thailand what they'll do is they'll actually pound the fish into you know complete mush and you won't actually see the fish but you'll taste it I'm not going to go through that I'm just going to let it cook and then it'll just sort of break down a little bit they'll get little chunks here and there it is okay some sugar to cut the salt now this is a very concentrated curry and the curry paste or bought curry paste is quite salty so I just need a splash a little bit of fish sauce I will give you this tip though when you taste it make sure it is very strong because you're going to pour this over noodles mix it with a bunch of vegetables and it will get diluted quite a bit so if it tastes perfect now it'll be a little bit underseasoned once you put everything together one last touch kaffir lime leaves add some citrus freshness and in this form I won't eat the leaves but if you want to be able to eat it you don't want to deal with pieces of things in your career that you can't eat you can finally finally julienne it and give that just a minute for the fish to sort of cook and break down and for the lime leaves to do there magic and the sauce is pretty much done and by the way you don't have to use the fish you can omit it all together or you can add a little piece of chicken you can do ground chicken and ground pork whatever protein you want but fish is what's traditional always always taste your food mmm mmm so rich and thick and oh my god that does taste like Thailand so that's the sauce and we got a can't wait let's get all our other ingredients together all right noodle time so these are really easy to prepare they're already cooked so all you have to do is drain them and make sure you rinse them really well so you don't have any of the packing liquid left and when you're done that I'm just gonna blanch these for 30 seconds just to heat them up now these noodles have a unique smell to them I find them smell kind of seaweedy and I don't really mind them but if you want to reduce that smell it's a natural smell you can boil them for longer for two to three minutes and that'll help so off I go these noodles trainers are so useful and the sauce mmm that looks great ha now you can make the sauce as thick or as light as you want you don't want it as rich you can totally do a little more stock or water and a little less coconut milk well you don't have to reduce it as long so totally something you can customize so the coolest part about this dish is actually the toppings now kinome dean in thailand comes with a variety of different herbs fresh vegetables to sort of contrast the richness of the sauce so you can really choose whatever toppings vegetables you want but I'm going to show you some of the classic ones okay some long beans which I have blanched I'm going to do some bean sprouts this is not super traditional but I love radish sprouts I think they're so cute some Thai basil you can also do dill some people have some deal with this pickled mustard greens now pickled mustard greens is traditional you can get it at Chinese grocery stores but you can definitely do any kind of pickled vegetables so the idea is have something tart to balance out the saltiness of the sauce and the cherry on this Sunday is an egg a medium boiled egg is what I like but you can do hard-boiled wow that looks almost too good to eat and then a little final garnish if you're making this fancy for someone a little red is always nice ah isn't that so pretty let's taste it get some long beans in there the curry sauce so concentrated to really taste all of those herbs that are in the curry paste the creaminess of the egg and the crunchiness of the long beans and tartness of the pickles everything is working together super well and the noodles the texture you won't have had anything like it it's sort of halfway between tender and crunchy it's kind of a fun texture going on in your mouth it's so good so I hope you give this a try this is so good I can't believe it's actually a low-cal dish as a recipe as always is on hot tight kitchen comm and if you make this send me a photo Facebook Twitter Instagram and I will be you next time for your next delicious type you want some", "KlS0CI1bs3E": "hello everyone I'm filming from our beautiful store miracle leaf and I hope you can hear me but miracle leaf in West Palm Beach and we're located at 140 house and cold all in that same shopping center right on the corner of Southern Boulevard and Stansbury's way we are a medical marijuana doctor's office and behind me there you see Jenny representative from move before we hi say hi Chitti so I just want to show you around Jenny you want to walk around with me okay so first of all this is our lobby here so when you enter miracle leaf you'll come into the lobby right here beautiful Lobby over here is where we have our CBD products and then we have right here where we're taking your phone calls our greeting reception desk back here we're working on your files and let me show you our beautiful hallway here full of art and education so when you come back here we also have our believe in yourself wall I'll show you that pretty soon this is our doctor's office and you come back here when you come back here please feel free to sign our VIP wall okay hi everyone I just want to let you guys know that I'm from move medical cannabis dispensary so what do you guys come here to marry believe and you get your medical marijuana card you can then come to our store to purchase your product and we're right on 441 by the hospital if next to Cheddar's restaurant so it's very close to this location Ginny's going to help me in you with understanding the products that are available at move and how they can actually help us a lot of times people come in to the dispensaries thinking that their only options are maybe smoking flour or vaping so we do have those options as well and I'll get to those but I just wanted to first tell you that here at move we our research and development company and we strive to use medical basis for the most scientific form of medical cannabis so we have come up with exclusive technology that we use called encapsulation so what that means so some of our products down here we have our transdermal patches comes in THC CBD and one to one so what these are is these are transdermal patches they are three-day 72-hour slow-release patches they are micro dosing so there's small doses of your medication so it's a great way to put it on forget it and you're good for the day so it's also nice about it is that you can remove it so you've gotten relief if you start to feel better you don't have to feel like you have to keep it on 72 hours you can remove it and then reapply it when you feel it you need it together so with our encapsulation technology it does actually penetrate into your body making it fully systemic so it's not just a topical it gets into your bloodstream that's our exclusive technology these are the RSO capsules and we also have THC capsules as well which uses the same encapsulation technology that we use so what the encapsulation means is that they're gonna get quicker on scent although it's an oral product you're gonna be feeling the effects quicker so the teach seed capsules that we have those are 10 milligrams of THC these are so wondrous so actually our teacher and our THC tablets are basically the same except what benefits from the capsules that we don't use we don't have the ethanol strategy where you coming from the tincture we are the true form of a teacher which means that it's alcohol based and extract it's the safest the most effective way to extract cannabis next we also have a full line of flour which I was talking about before so what's nice is we actually have three different tiers of flour so you're getting three different pricing so we have our Tier one which will be our biggest buds and that's gonna be at $50 and then you have a tier 2 which is the medium size and that's gonna be $40 and then you have the tier 3 which is a little popcorn side and that's going to be 32 dollars in a different strain that you have here is modified grapes which is a hybrid and then you have Pootie Tang which is a sativa and then you have purple punch which is an indica so you have one of the o'night you have a nice variety okay so a common question we get from our customers yes the difference in the indica sativa in hybrids okay sativa when you think of Satya you think of a week yes a time so that's gonna be the energizing creative those kinds of feelings that gets you through the day energizing yes the indigo on the other side is in the back in the guy in the bed yeah think about its stuff that you're gonna take to sleep to help you at night to relax the euphoria type feeling and the hybrid is right there in the middle so you got a little bit of bulletins so it's an it's a nice blend so another question I have so let's take the three point five grams there what could you do with that like how many blunts can you roll with that or can you put it in a bowl or can you cook with it can you sprinkle it on spaghetti that it needs to be deep core so what that means is that needs to be heated okay you can't just take the flour and throw it over your pasta it actually has to be heated up first so the best way to cook is actually to use a distillate which we do carry in the store so if you're interested in making your own home baked goods anything like that then purchasing the distillate would be the best function that could actually and see whatever it is that you're talking for this early departure okay great to go thank you so with this you can grind it up and you can put it in so you know bowls you can roll a joint but we also have I just wanted to show you also is we do sell pre-rolls okay make it easy for it's exactly you don't have to do any of that so I'll show it to here and oh you know you had one gram of pre roll and this one you have here is our Colorado turbine which is a sativa and that's one gram and then we also have a wide variety of these are disposable bait pens so these are strains specific and they're constantly changing depending upon what we're harvesting at the time and we have multiple multiple strains all the time but we also have our regular 510 thread called pure vapes which are distant on distillate and it's solvent free and doesn't have any cutting agents and it's important and it's the purest form of cannabis that you're gonna get in the future and then over here you have your soothing sports gentle so this is great for an athlete or somebody who's in pain after working out or somebody who's dealing with arthritis and things like that this is a really nice cooling sensation tappable but you're gonna put on so it doesn't have that the capsulation like the other one so it's not systemic so it is spot specific but it does have all that cooling aspects of menthol and eucalyptus and all that really yummy stuff Thank You Jenna nice selection yes all right folks that was Jenny from wolves and I just went in Jenny thank you for bringing over some gifts can you take this I hope you've learned something from move they have amazing products and when you need your medical marijuana card or if you need to transfer or if you want education about getting your medical marijuana card please call us here at miracle leaf our telephone number is five six one two three four four four six zero and it's really easy to three four so five six one two three four four four six zero and see you soon", "vkw2ilv9pSg": "hey y'all trevor here with ready leaf and today we're gonna be diving into blend crafts indica blend wax you guys i'm really interested to see how this product is gonna do and how the overall flavor and effects are gonna be being a blend based concentrate you never quite know what to expect when you're diving into something like this so i'm looking to see that it's something tasty and something heavy hitting but the only way we're going to find out you guys is by cracking into it and checking it out so that's exactly what we're going to do right now let's pull up the website and get this information going so we can dive into this review y'all i'll see you on the other side of the intro welcome back everyone so as i said in the intro we're going to be diving into blend crafts indica blend wax you guys i am really curious to see how this is going to do so this package is only a half gram container so any of the information around the price you do have to be aware that this is only a half of a gram and it came in right around the 35 range for the half gram so it's not outrageous but it is still a little bit on the pricey side the thc content for this sucker is going to be 72.6 percent we've got a cbd total of 0.89 and a package date of september 26 2020. we do have the decibel website pulled up which is going to be kind of the over lapping company for quest blendcraft uh what other brands do they have prairie records and general admission oh general mission is decibel so that would be that's actually really good to know that's really really good to know so craft blended is going to be the base information that they give us here and then blend carb blend craft keeps it simple with indica blend sativa blend and hybrid blend created only created using only flour and trichrome coated sugar leaf from quest collection of superior cultivars small batch grown in bc the strains are hand selected based on aroma flavor and effect then blended for a smooth smoking experience that is all the information that they have right now for it which is a little bit disappointing but it means that we don't have to wait any longer to dive in and start smoking we're going to crack this package open take a look at how it's packaged before we go into our first reviewable smoke and that's going to be through the puffco that sucker come on don't be dead on me already don't be dead on me don't i think the puffco might be dead on me you guys let's uh plug it in and make sure that we can smoke through this sucker for the review i'll see you guys on the other side of the urban scale we're diving in to the puffco cheers [Music] okay guys so we're gonna give that puffco a little bit of uh time to charge up i think we're just gonna have to leave it and let it get nice and fully charged before we do the next one of these reviews but for now we'll just get it charged up enough for us to be able to dive in and take our first dab of this blendcraft wax so right on there you got a thc sticker and opening this up you're getting a lot more of a kind oh you're getting a lot more of a sugared like sugared shatter concentrate here you guys stuck pretty well together and it's held its consistency really well you're getting a really sweet sticky s not not syrupy a kind of a sweet berry blend for the overall aroma oh honestly you guys it's quite exciting and uh quite a rich sweet sticky kind of a smell i am very excited to see how this is gonna taste and to really see how it's gonna melt down and break as we uh vaporize it and we run it through the different temperatures and the different ways of of dabbing you guys oh it just smells so sweet and it's got a little bit of a kind of a gassy gassy tone in there that i'm not minding i'm enjoying actually quite a bit you guys so let's turn the puffco on let's get that sucker set to the right temperature ah yeah i know that thing's good that thing's gonna take a while so you know what we're gonna do the same thing that we did last time we're gonna run it through the glass first give it a lot of time to charge up and then we'll come back to the puffco so the way we're gonna run through our glasses we have three different temperatures we will be trying this wax out at you guys so the first one will be a cold start through our hydros banger here and that's going to allow us to really taste um all the variants in flavors and just overall experience with this wax because we're gonna be able to start tasting and experiencing the vapor at the lowest temperature because we are starting it from cold all the way up to the highest temperature because we'll boil it off right until there's there's nothing left you guys so we've got a good little scoop in there you're not gonna be able to see it too well because my bangers are starting to get chased and i definitely need to pick up some new ones but we're gonna start her out with a nice cold start bubble dab of this indica blend wax and we're gonna see how it does you guys i'm hoping that it stays with that really rich sticky fruity flavor because if it does i'm going to be enjoying myself all the way through this review so we're just waiting for it to start melting down and start bubbling there we go we've got it now take our first haul and see how this is you guys cheers it is very sweet you guys let's give this a little bit more heat try and encourage a little bit more intensity cheers okay guys before we actually move into scoring this i thought i would uh hit you up with a little bit of a reach out that i want to say thank you uh the couple you that reached out in the last video and were thinking that i might have been a little bit too soft with uh with the scoring so we're gonna make a little bit of an adjustment and we're gonna start scoring with this video kind of being the tester and friday being the full commitment to the transition for that sativa review we've uh adjusted the way the scores are going to be so one through two is just going to be non-smokable you guys like it is barely able to get it down if it's getting a three out of a four it's harsh like it's making you cough a lot it's just not enjoyable the flavor's not quite there that five to six is going to be tolerable the six is where the flavors are going to start playing factor where you can enjoy it the seven to eight is the enjoyable side of it where you're actually looking forward to smoking that and then the 9 to 10 well that is gonna be pristine experience and smoking flavor you guys we uh we're gonna start having a little bit of a harder ranking and harder hitting scale but uh let's go ahead and hit up the evan shorebanger with its warm up we've got 50 seconds on that before we give it a minute cool down and we're back taking another dab for the low camp experience you guys i'm looking forward to it i hope you are as well i'll see you on the other side okay guys so we're gonna end up giving the cold start a six out of a ten it was enjoyable it had a decent flavor to it where we could definitely come back and smoke it like that again but it just really didn't have the heavy flavor experience that i'm looking for with my concentrates because there really are the more dessert style of my smoking but this sucker is almost at its minute cool down let's dive into it and see how the uh low temp dab taste before we rock it on the high one rip rip it not reap it but rip it through the puffco then the email before we wrap the sucker up but let's dive into it on a low temp dab cheers hey guys so i'm going to give the low temp a 5 out of a 10. it was just not memorable very bland very light in the overall um like the overall experience for the flavor and just didn't really have anything there that i'd be looking to taste or experience when i'm dabbing this for flavor you guys it's smooth it's really enjoyable that way to smoke but the flavor is really lackluster and with for me my concentrates being the dessert i want them to be quite tasty and potent for the flavor you guys so we're gonna warm up our uh cheap chyna banger for the hot dab because i've chased my good ones up already enough there's no reason to do it anymore so i'll see you guys in a little bit when we're dropping a hat hat dab to try this ending blend wax out from blended craft [ __ ] show okay guys so with our high temp dabs what we do is we heat the nail up and then we let it cool for 30 seconds and then we drop our dab into it so it's been 30 seconds cheers okay guys so the high temps are only going to get a 4 out of a 10. it was really harsh like outright disappointing kind of a harsh um hit to it it didn't have any of that flavor but it had that burn to the back your throat that just wasn't quite enjoyable there are some concentrates that i find smooth at that higher temp not overly flavorful but smooth and uh still relatively enjoyable but we've got a puffco ready we've got that sucker warming up and i'm just curious to see how this wax is going to melt down in here because uh usually you get some pretty big bubbles with anything that's gonna be really flavorful i found with my puffco i don't know if it's just a personal thing or uh anything like that but this one's right down the middle so let's see if the flavors down the middle too cheers y'all and uh we'll be right back with the score sometimes you need to go okay guys so we got the email ready here and the uh puffcoat's only gonna get a four out of a ten it's definitely the strongest tasting experience i've had so far and it tasted like strictly burning terps like it just was a raw burnt flavor similar to what i get when i press some hash rosin with some really old keef where it just it hits heavy and it hits with an extreme intensity but it's it doesn't taste very good at all so that's a little bit disappointing but we've got our email here i decided to set it a little bit lower than typical we've got it at 500 degrees so i'm curious to see how uh how this wax is gonna do in the email and at this temperature you guys so let's drop her in there and uh let's try it out and see see how she is cheers okay guys so the email's gonna end up getting a 5 out of a 10. it's not bad it had a decent flavor hint in there like it was very light kind of peppermint hint in there with a little bit of a spice rack medley and it's overall quite nice quite light in the experience so it's only getting that 5 out of a 10 just because it's not really all that exciting you guys it's just kind of that the old 7 it's gonna be the new five you guys and that's that's really all we're doing for shifting this course it's just making it a little bit tougher to get into that beautiful garbage curve because some of you some of you have noticed that we've been given a lot of the higher numbers i i've been thinking that myself but with the 5 out of 10 for the e-nail we've got a high at it with a 6 out of a 10. it's not bad it's got a decent enjoyment to it a really heavy mental drift to it like my mind's already focusing on the next three things that i want to get done today and tackle and it's just overall not not a bad experience for this strain but it it's got a headache that came in right after the second dab and that that was quite disappointing you guys and that really is the reason why i've knocked quite so many points off but we end up getting an overall with a nice mid-range 30 out of 60 down the middle um so honestly this is called straight had just a lack of flavor with a decent high to it it it's it's something that'll serve a purpose it'll get you baked but it's not really overly flavorful you guys and that's disappointing for me and that's that's really all all i can say about it i wish there was more flavor to it i'm curious to see if the hybrid or the sativa blend does have more flavor but we won't we won't find out about that until they come into stock but for the time being i'm just gonna say probably not gonna buy another half gram of this i'll finish this one up and i'll be content but uh hope you guys enjoyed this review if you guys did definitely leave a like down below let me know what you think of the new more uh a little harder praised based review yes new scoring system let me know what you think because we'll adjust it to where more where it it kind of balances out my appreciation for the bud as well as what you guys are actually looking for in a review because that's part of the reason why i'm doing it is to one to be able to experience as many different strays as i can which is a benefit for myself and as i take as kind of a little bit of a selfish benefit to doing these reviews and then the the other part is being able to provide them for you guys which i love doing and i don't think i don't think my uh my interest in smoking as many different strains outweighs the fact of wanting to get these reviews out for you guys so you guys can pick and enjoy the strains that you actually want to smoke but um for for this wax mid-range score for kind of a mid-range experience hope you guys enjoyed when the end card slides in all you got

with CandleScience. Here to share some tips and\nbest practices for working with AAK 444 Soy Wax. 444 is a soy container wax like it's cousin 464, however, 444\noffers a few differences that may better suit your\nparticular candle making needs. Let's take a look at some things to keep in mind when you're getting started working with 444 soy wax. 444 wax is slightly harder and has a higher melting point than 464 ranging from one 119 to\n125 degrees Fahrenheit versus 113 to 119 for 464 wax. This wax can be a good option\nif you need to make sure your candles won't soften\nor melt in warmer weather. Like with 464 and other soy\nwaxes, use a double boiler or designated candle melter to protect your wax from\nscorching or burning. Don't be alarmed if the wax\nbegins to clump together. This is normal and you\ncan break up the clumps with your stirring utensil. Before you get started be\nsure to only use fragrance that has been approved for use in candles. Like 464 wax, 444 has a max fragrance hold of 10% or 1.6 ounces per pound of wax. However, we recommend starting\nat a 6% fragrance load, which is one ounce per pound. Remember more fragrance\ndoes not necessarily result in a stronger scent throw\nand too much fragrance may contribute to burning issues. For optimal scent throw, we\nrecommend adding your fragrance once your wax has reached 185 degrees. Removing the wax from the\nheat source and stirring gently for one to two\nminutes will also help ensure the fragrance evenly bonds with the wax. Your wick choice impacts multiple aspects of your candle. As with 464 wax, we\nrecommend the CD Wick series and ECO series. For more information,\nrefer to our wick guide to help choose the best\nwick for your candles. The pouring temperature can\naffect the finished look of your candles. We recommend starting\nat a pouring temperature of 135 degrees Fahrenheit. If you experience rough or bumpy tops in your finished candles, try pouring higher at around 150. As always, you may have to experiment a bit to find the pour temp that produces the best results for you. A heat gun is also an easy fix to help correct the occasional\nsurface imperfection. Compared to 464, we have\nnoticed that 444 can be slightly more prone to frosting. Frosting is a normal\noccurrence and will not affect the burning or the\nfragrance of your candle, but to lessen the effect\nof frosting, you can try preheating your jars in\nglassware before pouring. You can also use opaque\ncontainers like candle tins and avoid coloring your\ncandles to make any frosting that does occur less noticeable. For ideal results we recommend\nallowing your soy candles to cure for two weeks. This will help your candles to maximize their fragrance throw.

Jonathan Karp is a dermatologist we're talking about healing some some conditions some common skin disease through a skin through excuse me diet and nutrition and you've got a whole array of things out here to talk about how diet plays into both health and your your skin so let's talk about it yeah it's true you know the things that you eat we're finding that inside your body inflammation is extra showing on the outside so when your gut is not actually that healthy you're going to be prone to have things like breakouts as well as things like psoriasis as well and we're finding that say as an example with psoriasis that actually the life expectancy is 10 years younger and so this inflammation that you see on the skin is actually happening on the inside of the body and we need to know really how to control that inflammation so that we can correct some of these ok so the problems on the face sometimes reflect the problems on the inside yes exactly ok so what are some of the main points that you want to talk about in terms of the stuff that you brought in well we have the white flour and sugar everyone knows that this is a bad thing for you but what we don't know is a lot of people that when your blood sugar goes up and it spikes that actually changes the collagen in your skin which actually causes wrinkly ok so wrinkling basically it reflects what exactly it's basically your blood sugar just going out of control and she actually changing the collagen which is kind of the structure of your skin ok what else do we have over here I'm seeing some baking items here yeah well we have almond flour you know a lot of people when they want to give up white flour they have a great deal of difficulty and you can actually use almond flour to bake with you can make a really incredible cake and there's something about that texture when you have a cake that really makes you feel like you're not you know you're not missing something what are the main benefits of using almond flour in place of regular flour well you had you don't have that blood sugar spike and also when you're when you're eating these types of foods it actually changes the way the gut microbiome is which is the beneficial bacteria and your skin you're in your gut and when you're eating a lot of sugar that changes that i didn't even know almond flour was the thing so apparently this is great and what else do we have over here well we have vegetables and specifically cruciferous vegetables these have been found when we're talking about kale collards broccoli brussel sprouts that when the population increases by ten percent the rate of cancer actually drops by twenty percent Wow okay it's really incredible and in addition to this swap there's also pasta swaps you can actually use zucchini and this is this is called a spiralizer and you can actually make little zucchini noodles oh it's just kind of cool and then also there's something called shirataki noodles which are a good pasta swap they're actually zero calories zero carbs and there are traditional japanese noodle so you can have you know kind of all the pasta that you want you can put it in noodle soup it works really really well Wow shirataki noodles okay so is all this part of the way you were you're explaining anti-inflammatory lifestyle exactly yeah when we think about an anti-inflammatory lifestyle we also have to think about those other things that go into your overall health and we're talking about your mental state so if you're stressed quite a bit that can affect your your overall inflammatory rate also your exercise how you stand posture movement sleep all that sort of thing and also environmental toxins because we need to look at the environment and see what's in our environment to see just common skincare items have a lot of toxins in them all right a lot to think about dr. Jonathan Karp thank you so much Carlos I got to start standing up straight I have to eat well got it make sure my skin's perfect here I think that goes for all of us here right alright guys thank you so much for those tips and after", "3ccLN3TkNOs": "hey guys it's Ronnie from greenlight bikes calm and I am here to shed some light on a favorite ingredient of mine miracle noodle also known as the skinny new also known as to shirataki noodle so if you've ever gotten these you're either in one of two camps you love them or hate them but I'm convinced that you may turn from a hero to a lover if you actually know how to prepare them correctly and it's not the way they say on the back of the bag so join me on this little trip and I'm going to show you how I whip up a really quick dish with these when I just want something warm and yummy in a bowl that's not 800 calories hearing act now the bag says to I don't know put them in boiling water or something I just totally ignore them and I drain my shirataki noodles in a colander here in my sink so as you see all I do is dump them in here give them a really good rinsing and then I'm gonna let them drain alright so once they're drained pretty well just kind of try to get all that extra liquid off and then dump them on just a nice clean kitchen towel and we're the poll point here is to try to get as much as the moisture as we can out of them you can fold the towel over kind of give it a little bit of a press and kind of get as much as that water out now while we're kind of letting these sit on our towel I have a nonsence nonstick skillet heating over medium heat and I just sprayed it really quick with some nonstick cooking spray and I'm going to put the raw noodles basically just rinsed straight from the bag no no boiling or anything right into that pan your best tool for this job is not a spatula or wooden spoon but actually a tongs now depending on your nonstick you may want to get plastic tongs so you don't scrape up your non-stick pan but basically all you want to do is spread the noodles out on the pan and dry them that's the key you don't want them kind of it takes away that gel texture a little bit that they have so I'm just going to let them sit in there and what I'm going to do to serve these today is a really simple peanut based sauce using PB 2 instead of peanut butter just to save a little bit on fat calories so I have lots of actually other ideas on green like bikes comm a couple up there where I have different sauces and different things you can mix in but this is a really simple idea for like a basic peanut sauce using a teaspoon of or to taste of your favorite hot sauce two teaspoons of soy sauce a tablespoon of honey and 2 tablespoons of PB 2 which is powder peanut butter and I basically just put that in this little bowl and mixed it up for a nice flavorful spicy peanut sauce now with these drying out you see all the water steaming away you want to give them about 2 or 3 minutes take your tongs and kind of separate them and notice there is no kind of big I don't know glob of them that's usually what used to happen to me when I prepare them away the way that they say on the back this way you kind of kind of separate all the noodles and when they dry out they don't stick together which is kind of key so at this point really you can remove the noodles even and make like a quick sauce sauteed some vegetables some pepper zucchini whatever you want any leftover protein sources you can add in there I'm going to stick to just sauce today just to show you the basic technique plus I was feeling lazy and I didn't want to cut up any vegetables but um so I'm going to add that quick sauce I click the peanut sauce and kind of just drizzle it right over the noodles and then I'm just going to toss it through warm it up with the noodle and that's basically it again it'll start to stick a little bit again just keep tossing it around kind of separating as much as you can kind of taking little bits pulling it apart just like that that's it really oh I got some more white noodles though let's come out incorporate them all right I'm gonna shut off my heat and I'm gonna pour these into a bowl see if I could do this with you guys okay there we go okay and there you have it a bowl of noodles I even saved chopsticks from my favorite Asian restaurant down the street i sear I am with my bowl of new tools um I'm really enjoying it actually I stopped to take a few pictures for my website and then I found myself just eating it and I realized I never said goodbye all right there you have it my secret issue you're talking noodles I will post the details of the quick peanut sauce that I make in the comments on YouTube in the description on YouTube and I'll also post this on green light bites calm so for more light ideas check out green light bites calm and I will see you guys soon thanks for watching bye", "I6F4l5uX5Y8": "if your son or daughter smokes marijuana I'm sure they're going to try this so you need to stop it with the simple marijuana wax is a man-made sticky waxy yellowish almost a butter color or earwax that's probably where it got its name actual term for it shatter wax because once it's cold it's like glass so just shut well normal marijuana can be anywhere from say 19 to thirty four percent but when you extract the THC from the leaves if you do it properly it's anywhere from 85 to 99 percent pure THC a BB sized piece would would definitely do the straight whatever the effects of marijuana are this would probably be 10 to 20 times as potent for a very small amount and it's produced by forcing butane through marijuana leaves in a tube any extract then is distilled out and you've got concentrated THC it's really hard to get hold of unless you know somebody who you too grows plants or somebody who has connections with this particular thing it's not necessarily so hard to get it's an upcoming drug in Atlanta usually in sub-zero temperatures that's only way to deal with it it notes you know it's like nothing completely liquid so it's got to be cool in order to mess with it so you can basically find it in almost any format you could see it as crystalline you could see it as a sticky gooey mess it'll get on everything in your clothes you can't get it out of your clothes you can get in the car but you can't get it at a carpet anything fabric wise it's not coming out of you can barely wash it off your your countertops about a month ago we got 751 plants up to four or five feet tall the thing is back in the 70s people would smoke the leaves for marijuana now you can only buy the buds so the leaves are a byproduct so to extract the THC from the leaves is now an untapped resource that before was just thrown away", "3NxLYWWnS1Q": "hey welcome to another Atkins diet product review my name is course Kendall today and this week's episode we're going to be reviewing that add a readers or viewers choice shirataki noodles what's also called miracle noodles these guys are made with glucomannan flour or konjac flour and these are also fortified with tofu so the first things first is that you need to rent these thoroughly I'll be honest I've tried these in the past I haven't been a huge fan but I'm going to try them again and you'll get to hear my review the smell is very fishy at this point and if you know me I'm not a big fish eater so I am definitely rinsing these things thoroughly all right I don't think I can rinse them anymore all right shaking the water ah now they recommend you pat them dry on paper towels so I'm going to try that still kind of have a fishy plate fishy smell at home so I I'm not sure how well I'm going to like this but we're going to try it anyhow back I'm going to try rinsing them one more time because that smells not queried appetite maybe if you were a tuna eater that smell wouldn't bother you quite as much all right one more time in the paper towels squeeze all the moisture out all right so they're pretty well dry I mean dry as I can get them with a paper towel started just a little bit more not to be OCD about the whole smell but all right try that all right so I got my stir-fry over here in the paper basically there's some garlic in it and some soy sauce at this point and just beef summer sausage as lows carbons I could find and just some oriental stir-fry vegetables I'm going to add about two teaspoons of the Szechuan sauce that I've demonstrated in other videos they say the stir-fry noodles really take up the flavor flavor of the dish that darienne so I am going to make sure that there's enough flavor in this dish - honestly cover him up so let's go with that idea all right so I've got my stir-fry on as high a heat as possible to dry out the noodles which is another thing that they suggest and then throw the noodles in the pan when my favorite dishes is Mongolian stir-fry and one of the things I've never been able to get at that mine going in barbecue place is noodles in my dish so here's my attempt to achieve that now all right I'm going to cook this for about one to two more minutes to let the flavors sink into the noodles and I'll catch up catch back up with you then see you then okay well I just finished up I pointed the dish here see the noodles in it I'm going to smell it to see if I can detect any of that fishy smell that I was so not entirely enthused by nope can't smell anything all right final suggestion does it taste as good as it looks now I have the spaghetti quality or the spaghetti strand one they also have a fettuccine one as well as a little thicker breh noodle as well so let me try the spaghetti one not really can't taste anything on the noodle side it may have taken up some of the taste of the stir-fry around it I don't I certainly don't taste any of the fishy smell so from that point of view and is definitely able to be covered up or removed off the noodles hey I would give it at least a three out of five it's a it's decent pure in the mood for noodles for stringing noodles this would certainly meet the bill I've seen online where they don't particularly suggest for Italian but I don't see why you couldn't I have another konjac noodle made by Wildwood farms that does mention it being mean used as a pasta side dish so you certainly could um would I get it again sure it's not too bad one thing for those Atkins diet followers it's not induction friendly because no matter if it's yam flour or contact flour it's just not on the induction food list but you can certainly add it in afterwards talk to you guys later bye you", "_tB-WLOFEEQ": "hey guys it's your girl Oksana Messiah and I'm back at it again with a surprise video I'm just playing I'm getting right to it me and my

button leave me a thumbs up or thumbs down if you don't like to see it don't matter alright let's see what we got to the game alright well you know so Tara got there flower today so you know we had you up there for that well they gave out a free gift floats there I've guessed the flower line they're gonna call it float but this is a real cool jar I haven't seen anything like that for it's a stash jar it's a mason jar so you're going to take this plastic lid off and sure enough regular mason jar lid and then this is just a silicone cozy it's on there real tight by the way I'm gonna come up it'll come down a little bit but you can see it's just one the caning cars so the ones with a little design on it but the silicone thing makes it a little bit more indestructible like so I really kind of like that mm-hmm never seen one like that before hopefully they sell bees and a smaller one would be not you know they make a smaller mason jar I'll never have enough to stash in there so let's see what we got here we did yes flower I believe I forgot to take the tags off all the stuff so you gonna have to give me like a what second to do that yeah we'll leave it on the boxes we'll just want to show the boxes all right one more to go all right so I thought they was gonna do something different what the girl told me on the phone was it was gonna be like flood was gonna be the brand but then they was gonna have like rest and awake you know kind of like their a.m. their p.m. theirs in and all that pens but they actually it was granddaddy purples what I got coming at nineteen percent THC there's a squeezy jars come see a little bit of Leafs in there should a dealer went first so I can roll one but you see a few of the leaves in the bottle but there's some trichomes you can see that yeah let's take it up for the close-up look yeah it wasn't trimmed real good you can see that right there somebody left a couple leaves on there but when we flip it over you wouldn't get the light down here that's feel a little dry though which is kind of to be expected here in Florida to be honest with you guys not all the time don't get me wrong but usually when they come out with it for the first time and they hold it for a holiday like they just did this is Black Friday they just come out with their links flower today you got imagine even sitting on it for a minute like I said the but structures aren't bad they've got some trichomes on them don't know if you can see all that or not see glisten in there a little bit trim job wasn't the best but some of the other ones have been like that they learn as they go down here some learn as they go down here some dispensaries don't learn at all but so we'll probably stick these in a jar with one of them a little believe a pax I did a couple the other ones like that and it worked out pretty good alright and then we got the this is Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer if you look it up on their website it's gonna say Jackie Girl this is the Jackie Girl when you look it up Jackie girls across between Girl Scout cookie and Jack Herer so this one was coming in at 18 percent this was only two flowers they had at my location I didn't get there bright and early now this stuff does look good so whoever trimmed the granddaddy purp just probably fire their asses this one's nice because I trimmed up nice nice tight bugs this one's not really that dry we're gonna twist up one of these because you know we gotta smoke something so like I said this is gonna be a Girl Scout cooking a jack for rare it is a hybrid but I'm guessing it's gonna be more a little bit sativa leaning hybrid believed the Girl Scout cookie anyways a little sativa leaning one twist up too big of a ones and like I said with my cloud to the fire here later on I'll go out to the fire you guys can't see crap out there I've tried it one night but I can start the smoke session here and then after I shoot the video while uploading it I can upload outside around the pit and finish my lunch so we might do that we say from here and it's down here my nose is up here I can smell that when I ground it up got a little bit of that fruity smell like the member berries kind of like aluminum rg4 move - it has that kind of fruity smell to it it's also got maybe a little earthy smell to it something hit me a lot harder when I first rounded up but you never know there could have been something left over in the grinder - that it mixed with it that's why I really don't do a review the first time I smoked it because sometimes there's a left over traces of something in the grinder and I'll give you a little false taste on the first one I did that on member berries one time SOT my ground up before that just was a little bit more stronger than it was and carried over alright just twist it up and see what else we got from there now I will say I never really cared for cetera set up usually they're not real busy you know usually I go in there there's two or three people in there and I still wait twenty minutes so they don't have a real good setup you go up to the counter you order your stuff right in front of everybody there's only two people at the counter then you sit down if there's room but there's only about two little small couches in there or one little small couch and a bench or something I don't know then somebody makes up your order in the back room carries it out carries it all the way to the other side the store to the for cash registers they have and then they holler out your name so as you can imagine today they got flour and wax in they look pretty busy more people in there talking unless you can hear some of the some of the guys in there you know they was loud enough you could hear them but a couple of girls they was hollering names two or three times you know all that just slows the process so I'll know we was there for an hour today got no discounts got the float thing but apparently they was one of the few that didn't have any discounts their idea of a Black Friday deal is just letting us have flour I guess so we did get some shattered we got the Tillamook strawberry coming at 68 percent THC they come in these nice little black jars they're real easy to open not like some of them we won't name names and then it's got like a little cupcake thing in there candy wrapper and it's got the shatter which I don't care for this cuz it's as you can see it makes it a big globs so trying to break a piece off of that is a pain in the butt I like it better on a flat piece of parchment paper so it's flattened out hopefully they'll figure that out soon some of them do some of them don't someone just keep packing it in there but at least I didn't just put it in a jar by itself they did put it on some kind of parchment so we'll give that a shot later on it'll give you a review on it too along with the flowers and then we got some of what they're calling soft wax 69% then my native just as wax on the thing it's just soft wax online a little different than what I was expecting online if you look at it look more buttery more like moves rosin this is more like I don't know like if you melted a turkey roll or something or caramel and neither one never had a real strong smell to them so we'll just have to taste them here later on but like I said neither one of them had a strong flavor I don't know if I got a clean dab to learn on but we can clean one real quick you let it cool off I don't wanna melt it any get a little skip out see if we can get a little better look at it and I guess it is a little dance for sorry I was looking at it yeah once you dig into us a little more wet than I thought it was and kind of touched the top and it didn't fall apart I did ask him you always going to ask him Florida because you never freaking know they tried to trick us a few times I was asked if I can get it under inhalation we're not inhalation sorry oral it's got a little bit of flavor once your smell when you broke into it I always ask him if you can get it under oral if you can get under oil it's gonna be distillate the vitae can pulled that crap on us and rise pulled that crap on us with their turkey nectar stuff or whatever they had and by takane had to concentrate jars that they tried saying was you know they kept saying a honey consistency they never come out and said honey but when you do look online it does say on the float products it does say cannabis derived terpenes at it so you're not gonna add you can't I don't think you can I mean you might add terpenes to the flower so you can't really add it to the shatter I mean I guess you could before it was still liquid when you was pouring it out I guess you could add terpenes in but usually when you see they're adding terpenes back to it it's gonna be a more of a flavored distillate so I was a little bit nervous about that and we'll see cuz this one kind of looks like it could be a flavored distillate if it pops up next week that you could buy this crap under oil on no offense time so we'll just see we'll give it a flavor test all this was 180 bucks it's $60 a piece for the wax the soft wax and the shatter their flower is thirty and eight so neither one of these two strains I've had before I don't think I've had the granddaddy purple in a flower I think we've only had it in a vet cart before let's see what else this doesn't have a bad flavor to it I just smoked a bowl before the video because I got some phone calls on no one to smoke on here but I was wanting to smoke too so I didn't wanna wait so he's a little medicated when we started can tastes more like the Girl Scout cookie I think than the Jack Herer in here it does have a little earthy undertone to it but we'll do a full review on it later along with the Laxus so I think that's going to be it guys I'm gonna try to finish the rest of this we'll see how it goes you know it is only 18% but I've had some 18% hit me harder than anything else some of the hardest hitting flowers I think I've had here in Florida it was around the 18 or 21 percent not saying that there ain't some you know 27 that are good and stuff but I think the best strains I've had have been a lower you know run 18 21 % to be honest so like I said I think that'll be it guys will try to either do a smoke sesh or the other review tonight or will see you tomorrow one of the two pins on how the night goes you know I got a bunch of kids so yeah you never know what's gonna pop up around the air you guys haven't subscribed make sure you

weed like I did let me know and until next time keep on talking my friend", "kh88guToO2M": "- Hi everyone. I am Kevin with \"CandleScience.\" And this is the IGI 6006\nparaffin/soy wax blend. It's paraffin and soy all in one wax, so you kinda get the best of both. People love this wax for\nit's excellent scent throw, especially if you're used to\nsoy with a long cure time, you often get a nice strong\nthrow out of this wax, with just a couple of days curing. You also get really, really\ngood color retention, and a lack of frosting that you often see with soy wax as well. So you can achieve deeper, richer colors, and you're also gonna\nget a nice smooth top. Not just after pouring but\nalso after you burn it. If you're used to burning soya wax, you know about that rough bumpy texture that it can often have. You're not gonna see that with this wax, thanks to that added paraffin. So let's open up this box, take a look. This here is a 60 pound\ncase, which consists of six of the 10 pound slabs. We do also sell this wax by\nthe 10-pound slab on it's own. If you buy the 10-pound slab from us, you will see that it's wrapped in plastic. Inside this case, it is not. So this wax is gonna be, it's stacked, they are in a bag inside the box, but each individual slab is not wrapped. This is a highly refined paraffin wax, it's is filters, it's is cleaned, however it is rather sticky,\nso sometimes you may find on these slabs, some specks\nof debris from the box or maybe there's something\nfrom the manufacturing process. So when I open these up I like\nto take a look at the slab, go through it and then pick\nout any specks that are on it. Again, it is very sticky, you can see it's getting\nall over my hands here. If that bothers you, you\nmay wanna wear gloves when handling this wax. If you're used to soy, or used to those nice flakes\nthat come in that case, whereas this is one big slab, so you're gonna need to cut it up. You can do that with a\nknife, spatula a putty knife, also can use a flat ice cream scoop. I personally prefer a wavy soap cutter. This thing is awesome\nfor cutting all waxes. And 6006 is no exception. It's nice and sharp, it's\na little bit sturdier than our standard soap cutter. So if you want a tool for cutting\nwax, pick one of these up, I love it, I use it all\nthe time, it's fantastic. It slices right through\nthe 6006, so you can get it into nice, small, manageable pieces. So this is a semi glossy, opaque wax. It is usually very soft. You will notice from batch to\nbatch sometimes there can be a slight difference in the hardness. Can be a little harder sometimes, can be a little softer sometimes, but generally soft\nenough to just smooth out with your fingers. It's very pliable. Very easy to work with. You get a 10% fragrance\nload on this, maximum, which often you do not need because of how strong the\nscent throw on this is. We recommend starting at 6%, you can always increase\nto 10 if you would like. The pour temp if you're\nused to using soy wax. We recommend pouring this around 170, give or take five degrees. So you don't have that long cool down that you have with soy as well, that are benefit of using this wax. Because this is such a soft\nwax, it is only for containers and tealights, this is\nnot something to be used for pillars and votives. But, excellent for\ncontainers and tealights and anything that you're gonna\nbe putting into a vessel. So just a few tips when\nworking with this wax. Especially if you're\ntransitioning from soy you may notice some differences\nin the way it behaves. It is more prone sinkholes,\nespecially around the wick, particularly with taller containers. You won't see it so much\nwith tins and jelly jars, with some of your bigger\ntumblers, status jars, you're gonna see a distinct\ndipping around the wick. So you may need to do a second pour, or just melt it with a heat gun. Second pour is my preferred method. You leave just a little\nbit of wax in your pitcher, and then once your candle's cooled down, you go back, you melt\nthat little bit of wax and you just do its nice second pour on top of 1/8 of an inch, fill in that sinkhole, smooth\nout the top, works wonders, especially for larger batches. The other option is just use a heat gun. Once it solidifies, you\ntake your heat gun, melt, again about an 1/8 of an\ninch of wax on the top, let it fill in the sinkhole\nand it's gonna resolidify nice and smooth and fill any\ngaps that are in the middle. Another thing to keep in mind\nwith wax, is it does tend to soot a little bit more than soy, especially if your wick\nis not quite right. Tends to perform best with\nflat braided cotton wicks, like ECO or CD or HTPs. And be sure to check out our wick guide for our best recommendations\nfor your container. You also may see some more wet\nspots, as in glass adhesion, on the side of our glass. Because of the paraffin content, it' tends to shrink a little bit more. It's also why you get sinkholes that tend to pull away from the glass. One way to help combat that\nis to just preheat you jars around 100 degrees before you pour, and that's gonna help you\navoid those wet spots. But, to be honest, you'll\nprobably still see them from time to time, but\ndon't worry about it, customers never even notice. And also because it comes in a slab form, you're probably gonna wanna break it down in advance and store it. If you have a place so you\ncan store the full case, they can store in the slab, no problem. I personally like to cut it\nup, and put it in a storage bin or Tupperware, that way\nit's a little bit more easily managed, especially if\nyou're doing small batches. And one more thing to point\nout, that you'll likely notice, when you go to burn your\ncandles, it does tend to behave differently than soy wax. You may notice that while\nyou'll get a full melt, it's not gonna have the full\ndepth that soy generally has. But, as it burns down into the container, you will start to see\nthat deeper melt pool. So in the beginning if you're not seeing that nice deep melt pool, it may not mean that you need to wick up. I would continue burning it down. You'll often find that\nany residue left behind does melt and join the melt pool. If you continue increasing your wick size, you may not remedy that problem and it's gonna be over wicked when you get down to the bottom. So just keep that in mind. Be sure to test all the way\ndown before you start wicking up with this wax 'cause it does\nbehave differently than soy. Well thanks for watching everybody. I hope that this answers\nany questions you have about this wax. If you've been considering trying it, if you're having issues with soy and you wanted to try something new, remedy some of those common issues, you know, light scent throw,\nfrosting, poor color retention, things of that nature? This is a great wax. So give it a try. Leave a comment down below. Let us know your feedback. Don't forget to like and subscribe so that you don't miss any of\nthese videos in the future.

once it actually stopped letting off the fragrance was very fast I like that a lot I see the overall cooling time on this was probably in the area of 30 to 35 minutes which is incredibly good when you consider 4 6 4 takes about an hour and 20 minutes to go to a solid form again now as you can see on this wax right here we've got a few air bubbles that kind of popped in and the only reason there's those and the only reason those are there is because we poured so low pouring at 120 degrees in more of a gel form is gonna leave you a few air bubbles like that the heat gun just run that lightly over at and it's gonna fix it very quickly if you were to pour this probably we poured it 120 degrees if you pour it 125 you'll get a nice smooth candle like this one right here I poured this one a little bit hotter and it came out perfect I ran the heat over at just a little bit but it was only to get rid of some gaps that were around the wooden wick otherwise this is exactly what this candle looked like after a little bit of a hotter pour okay so that's pretty much it that's the IGI 46:27 comfort blend wax overall I like this wax a lot if you can get over the fact that it's a nightmare to work with it's unbelievably sticky this is a very strong wax to work with this wax cool is extremely fast like I said it was probably about 30 to 35 minutes from pulling from the stove until it was in more of a solid form and it stopped letting off fragrance that's very quick especially when you consider four six four takes about an hour 15 hour and 20 minutes before it goes fully melted to more of a solid form fragrance load on this is extremely high the the cold throw that's coming off of this is very nice I when it burns it's extremely strong you can see in the video that I lit it in the bathroom and you can smell this from probably about three rooms away so that's pretty good scent throw I didn't realize at the time that I had some of the windows open so I actually lost some of that scent throw so if I would have had those windows closed the scent would have gone throughout the house even more I really don't have any type of rating system but by the time this video comes out I'm gonna go ahead and list a couple rating categories here will come up with an overall rating of the wax I've got a few ideas that I'm thinking of as far as like consistency cost burn time cooling time so we'll come up with something and I'll list it right here overall I like this wax a lot and again if I missed anything please comment below I answer every single one of them if you've got questions about the wax please ask them below you can also get in touch with me through the website Stanley handcrafted calm we're very active at Facebook at Stanley handcrafted Instagram at Stanley handcrafted and that's pretty much it if you liked the video give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more", "ZHigI6sCelg": "SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT SOMETHING THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING SOMETHING THAT IS GOING\nTO SOMETHING THAT IS GOING\nTO ABSOLUTELY SOMETHING THAT IS GOING\nTO ABSOLUTELY BE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING\nTO ABSOLUTELY BE A SOMETHING THAT IS GOING\nTO ABSOLUTELY BE A TRUE TO ABSOLUTELY BE A TRUE TO ABSOLUTELY BE A TRUE\nGAME TO ABSOLUTELY BE A TRUE\nGAME CHANGER, TO ABSOLUTELY BE A TRUE\nGAME CHANGER, HERO- GAME CHANGER, HERO- GAME CHANGER, HERO-\nRESCUE, GAME CHANGER, HERO-\nRESCUE, SAVIOR GAME CHANGER, HERO-\nRESCUE, SAVIOR FOR GAME CHANGER, HERO-\nRESCUE, SAVIOR FOR YOU.

marijuana dispensaries and now in the middle of it all this new business which specializes in getting patients those medical marijuana cards we really wanted to just you know separate I set ourselves apart from the other doctors offices that kind of look like head shops Krista Fernandez gave us a look inside what he was talking about miracle Leafs newest office on clematis is another part of the growing medical marijuana industry in Florida a place where doctors help patients he says get medical marijuana cards the owners of the business came all the way up from Miami to establish this business here places to buy medical marijuana already establishing a foothold in cities like West Palm Beach and Boca Raton now looking at lifting a ban on the shops medicinal has grown immensely over the last couple years peter Picaro is a Delray Beach attorney who specializes in cannabis law and emerging specialty created because of legal issues affecting the several hundred thousand who are holding medical marijuana cards so you have employees who are valid card-carrying medical cannabis patients who if they test positive for cannabis on the job can be terminated that's just one of the tough legal issues servicing Peter says another one involves police trying to test drivers suspected of using medical marijuana we're live downtown West Palm Beach matt says new WPTV newsChannel five", "O3Xdy6jDQWQ": "hello everyone i'm jess stanley with stanley handcraft and today i'm going to be doing a first look at a new wax that aztec uh just came out with and that is their aztec container blend now it's an all natural wax blend it just came out i just got a couple one pound samples to uh to kind of go over and look at this one but this one consists of soy coconut and beeswax it's supposed to be a single pour wax so we're gonna go ahead and test that one out uh just going over some of the basics on this one it has a melt point of 110 degrees fahrenheit the color is a little bit off-white and i'll get into that when i like do the the overhead view of the wax it does not contain paraffin and the percentage of each wax is proprietary information so basically what that means is soy coconut and beeswax they don't have a percentage for what it is so we might be able to look at this and kind of figure it out just a little bit and the heating suggestions on this one it says to heat it to around 170 degrees fahrenheit add your fragrance pour around 145 and that's about all the information that we do have on this one i don't even know what percentage or the the fragrance load this one has so we're just gonna add eight percent eight percent is usually pretty safe uh we'll try to do a couple tests on this one where we add 10 12 just to see what it can hold but i'm thinking it's probably got a max fragrance load of probably around i would say probably eight or nine percent only because uh the beeswax in there isn't gonna hold near as much wax uh but if it's a softer wax like the coconut and the soy it could hold a little bit more so probably eight to ten percent i'm gonna lean towards eight percent i'll try to find out some information on that one uh when i actually do the full review on this one but let's go ahead and open it up and take a look at it all right so go ahead and pour just a little bit of this out so we can get a look at it obviously the first thing you're going to notice is it's in these little pellets which is really nice probably the best wax as far as like scooping up and measuring out it doesn't get much easier than the pellets like that the soy flakes are really nice these are right along that so the feel on that one is pretty good it's it looks like beeswax pellets if you've ever gotten beeswax but it's definitely a little softer than that i can feel it starting to melt in my hand a little already and you can definitely squeeze them together and they start to kind of form together not like beeswax that's a little bit harder it definitely has more of a wax smell on this one i wouldn't really call it i wouldn't really call it your normal soy wax smell i think you can definitely smell a little bit of the beeswax we'll definitely see kind of how that comes across when we start adding oils and burning it all right so that's kind of it right there real quick and easy video just wanted to get a look at this one get a feel for this one and just like all the other wax review videos that i do uh the second video that i'm gonna put out is gonna be the testing basically going through there uh seeing what it melts at uh pouring it cooling temperature pouring at cooler temperatures pouring at higher temperatures we're going to do a few of them in color just to see how well this holds up with color and of course i'm going to use the normal stuff that i use i'm going to use the color blocks and the dye or the liquid dyes just so we can see which one comes out better and then of course i'm going to do a couple black ones to see how well it holds uh a black dye and then of course as always with this one i'm gonna test a bunch of different wicks we'll try some wood wicks uh cd ecos uh i didn't see what wick works best with this one so we'll go ahead and try a bunch of them of course i'm going to try the htps in this just to go through and really narrow down what wicks are going to work best with this one now there's not a lot of information on this wax out there yet it's like i said i'm going to reach out to aztec and ask them a few questions see what they can give me as far as percentage load or what wicks they think work the best for it and of course i'll let you know in the videos if i hear anything back from them but overall i'm actually real excited to try this wax it's always nice when a new wax comes out and especially one that falls into more of an eco-friendly or one that falls into more of an environmentally friendly wax so i'm anxious to try this one the uh the soy coconut and beeswax combo is something that should turn out really nice i'm hoping and then of course the biggest one with this one just because it is soy and beeswax is going to be the hot throw now the hot throw is always a struggle with beeswax or soy so i i don't know exactly how this is going to turn out so i'm actually real anxious to try that one and that's pretty much it if you do want to see something with this wax please let me know in the comments down below and i'll try to add that to the next testing video that i do so if you want to see anything like specific wix or certain colors or anything like that just please let me know and i'll try to add that into the video and of course you can follow me on any of the social media platforms that i've listed in the video

the pony that's prettiest on any day and i am here to tell you the things that you need to know so basically today we're going to talk about actually how to make a brazilian or bikini wax more tolerable how to make it not hurt you know what the answer is nothing it's gonna hurt regardless especially if it's your first wax it's definitely gonna hurt regardless um just like we're yanking hairs out of your skin i don't know how to make that sound more pleasing um i could say i've gotten really faster over the weeks and months definitely got faster um bracing you know things like that can definitely help while we're doing the wax as estheticians before you at home before you even get in the spa i got a couple things just a couple tips and tricks that's it so boom this little guy right here silicone scrubber is a little hair in there oh well there's some hairs in there you know whatever like fully under my arms as well sometimes i'll bully it right after i get home don't judge me um don't touch me uh basically just because sometimes it's not like the deodorant gets kind of kicked up under there so i'm gonna go ahead and get her you know nevertheless um yeah i like to use silicone scrubber just because you know it's easier to clean i really don't have time to wash my clothes that often i get to wash my clothes once a week and it's three big loads i don't have time to wash these gloves but i do have them i haven't used them in a while stick out the scrubber but totally getting gloves just well you know slap her on you know if you have nails bless you you're gonna put holes in it she fits you know no circles but a product that i have to use with either the glove or the scrubber is li honeypot get a look at her give her a shine see your angles you know it's just still something she's a little full for me i just bought this one i like to use sensitive just because you know fragrance and stuff down there just isn't anybody's friend don't let anyone tell you otherwise it's not your friend um and otherwise the honey parts are actually a really good product um i also use the spray as well let me grab her i don't have all my props together can we grab grabber the spray the calming spray which is really good as well you can spray it and like your panty line keeps you nice and you know just all the days um i really like both of these products just because they do really well in keeping um the ph uh odor together uh-huh only none of that because you know what what does this have i think it has a little bit of the what smells what's in this one uh-huh aloe vera mineral salts and lavender now that's nice that's real nice this one doesn't have any scents at all i don't know i lied lavender apple vinegar and whatever that other word is it's flower this this right here i'm not gonna lie to you okay because i'm not at to spy even though you're gonna see me at the spot i'm not at the spa right now okay if you are not if you are not exfoliating before your appointment i'm about to start keeping wipes in the spa room before we even get waxed because through the mask through the mask if i can smell you sweetheart that's not cute that's all i got to say do not do not try and come get waxed after you come from the gym after you know you've had a very long work day you know you probably sweat um or if you were on your period and you didn't wash before you came like you went through your whole day on your period and you have a full temp and you just no no no no it's not okay is that okay you come and get wax on your period that's completely up to you but here's the gotcha right you're gonna change the tampon because i'm not gonna see any blood leaking out of you no you're gonna change that tampon okay for two you should have washed or brought a whip a lap with you to wipe you up so you can go ahead and just be fresh for me and y'all know i pay attention to details i try to get up in there to get all the hairs so i'ma get close so why would you want me to be close in your regime and use not smelling together smell together smell together be clean that'll help now i'm sorry didn't even have to get violent there but you know i love target you know i love target um you know you can take any ibuprofen you know a little cramp reliever that you may like um i find it oh there's gang signs there okay i found to do no good for me um take a legacy quite literally um i know some people really do have a low pain tolerance so i understand but you know especially if you exfoliate you take maybe two i think the recommended is two uh-huh two two before your appointment um not 30 minutes though 30 minutes your food really digest in 30 minutes so about like an hour before your appointment definitely take the pills um definitely should help ibuprofen advil whichever one you know floats your paper floats your boat um hydrate definitely hydrate um waxing on dry dehydrated skin i think also plays the part because i've seen where literally after i pull a strip like i exfoliated y'all and todd just even said how she exfoliated me and i'm a dry girl dry i am very dry so i don't know it could be a lot of things i definitely do want to say to you guys though that when you guys are when you guys are getting waxed on your period the skin there is already going to be sensitive because we have a whole hormonal thing happening right now um even when you guys are pregnant and you're coming to get waxed it's not that you can't get wax when you're pregnant or on your period you're just gonna be way more sensitive and it's never gonna be fun i definitely can say that um but that being said those are your things that you should be doing before you come get waxed this is brazilian wax or a bikini line wax um another tidbit since we're here we're not at the spa um so i know and i understand that we are all humans and we use the restroom absolutely a thousand percent um but if you guys could kind of do an inspection of yourselves before i get between your legs it would be really really really really really great i really don't want to see any tissue remnants i don't want to see any remainder of poop that you didn't get i don't want to see any type of discharge um that may be occurring um again like i said we're all women but we all know how to shop and get wipes and just wipe her up real quick make sure she's okay um that's really all i have to say now this doesn't happen as often that's why you know it's not really a pressing matter but it does happen it does happen uh a little more often than we'd like so yeah just just keep that in mind it's fine you know like i said we're all human things happen that's why we're having this dialogue you see you see that's why we're doing it um yeah wait other than that you know as long as you exfoliate um drink your waters indefinitely oh an appointment just came through hello oh come on time for your appointments so when you are due for a month and we tell you four weeks don't really push for that fifth week we'd i'd rather you come in either a couple days early but those couple days late will make a difference because the hair is going to begin to root after that fourth week so then it's going to seem like your very first brazilian or bikini wax all over again and that's what you don't want at all zero you don't want any of that so definitely i would definitely say just try and keep on track trying to make sure that you are staying on top of when you need to come get waxed because if we said full three weeks we should be seeing you like if it was the 12th means the next 12. it was 13. you see the next 13. well let me see on the 15th oh this one again or 23rd cause that's not a month that's a new wax a whole brand new brazilian wax like you've never had one before so all that squirming and screaming whoo all that you caused that on you it wasn't us accountability you mm-hmm but you can't say i didn't say the things because i told you and we just did it what who said it it was jam jam the what say i'm the party prettiest on any day told you what it was and that's what it is", "Bac1FcqDQ_o":

announce the 1k giveaway winner now this was really difficult for my husband i didn't realize how difficult it would be for him he was going through all these comments and he was like why didn't we win the lottery i would give kids to everyone and i'm like well we're not millionaires so we can't so he ended up picking keisha mack so congratulations on winning the wooden witco luxury diy kit keep in mind this does come with a soy palm wax it does not come with the regular cocoa apricot wax so i just want to clarify that for you real quick now we are super close to 2 000 subscribers once we hit 2000 we will be doing another 2k giveaway and then probably another one at 5k but that's way down the line so this will definitely be another option again thank you so much for everyone who applied for this contest or who entered into this contest i did read every single one of your comments i didn't reply though because i didn't want anyone to like well i didn't want my husband to be swayed by my words so i'm like you have to go through all of these and he's like i don't want to be the bad guy and i'm like no it's fine it's fine so we will definitely be sending those out sending the kit out as soon as possible message me on instagram at hawthorne company so you can claim your prize now today we are actually doing unboxing of candle supplies super fun i also have a brand new boiler i am replacing the presto pot with a digi boil so we are going to do an unboxing of that and i will probably do a full side-by-side comparison between the digiboil and the presto pot in one or two videos down the line and watch out for tomorrow because tomorrow i will also be releasing the room spray recipe that i was teasing on instagram about so let's go ahead and look at some of the supplies that i have recently gotten in for candle making and maybe you guys will get some ideas all right let's get started so i received a lot of goodies in the mail i am an over-the-road truck driver so when i got one every time i come home it's like christmas all over again the first thing i did want to show you was these um this is my shipping box and i'll do a close-up of it real quick so you can see the gold foil detailing but this isn't what i wanted to show you what i wanted to show you is the box that comes inside which is my little candle boxes that i got now these aren't gift boxes necessarily these are literally shipping boxes so they have it's um it's cardboard so like what you would normally ship boxes in so it is crush proof and this is what i'm going to put my wooden witco candles in and i actually i'm just going to label the outside i didn't do custom writing on each single one because honestly i don't have my scents finalized right now um there's a lot of good options but i didn't want to be stuck with the fragrance i wasn't going to use so i'm just going to put a label on it [Music] okay so here's an example this is just a label that i normally use for my spray bottles right here um but i think what i'm just gonna do is i'm just gonna put it on the side like this and have all the information on the side here and then the candle scent on the front like this and it has like this pretty gold foil texture which i print at home myself if you want to know how i do that i can definitely do a tutorial on that it is really expensive though fyi not so much doing it but the products that you need to do it is really pricey but it's kind of something that i have been accumulating over the past year that i've been doing this so it's not like i did this all at once but this also fits inside the shipping box that i have this shipping box is 12 inches wide five inches high ten inches deep so i could probably safely fit about four to five wooden wick auras in here or four auras and maybe like a body butter or something like that [Music] these boxes these shipping boxes i have actually purchased from china i purchased it from alibaba i will leave the contact information down below keep in mind if you're watching this video like tomorrow or something um china is closed for chinese new year's so you probably have to wait a long time which these boxes that i had shipped these white little um shipping boxes for my candles to keep them safe i mean this is solid this is not going to break or bend or anything like that like gift boxes are sometimes very flimsy so this will definitely keep it safe and everyone knows that a box within a box is the safest way to ship um but those white boxes those are those are from you printing and just to give you an idea between chinese prices and you printing prices this giant box with gold foil custom printing on it cost me a dollar 91 i think um after shipping everything out the door these boxes here cost me 2.53 but i was forced to get them because china's closed so i will probably change that packaging later when i can talk to my manufacturer again the next thing i got were the candle jars for my spring and summer lined and i am super excited for this because let me show you what they look like these are very much mermaid fairy unicorn vibes to the fullest let me just give you a quick close-up on each one but aren't they gorgeous i'm probably gonna do a mermaid theme in this one and probably a fairy garden theme in this one for spring and summer i'm going to launch them both at once i'll probably keep them up on my website until september and then i'm going to swap them out for the fall collection or winter collection and i'm not going to do like 20 candles or something crazy i'm just gonna do two cents each season so make it easy on myself the next thing i wanted to show you is i did upgrade my camera i am not using it to record right now this is still an iphone but i did finally upgrade my camera and i went above and beyond because i also wanted to do cinematics i also got a brand new gimbal for a set camera as well this was a splurge purchase i almost cried when i hit submit on the order because it was quite a few grand but i work 70 hours a week if i can't buy cool what's the point of working so hard next thing i wanted to show you is this i got a well i ordered a bunch of wickets and i told you i was getting the wig center tools and the packaging is so beautiful and they work so well so this will basically keep my jars or my wicks and my jars from moving because sometimes what happens with wooden wicks is that they will shift and move as the wax is drying so then your wick actually ends up bent or off centered so this will stop that from happening i just really want to give a big shout out to wicked they were so awesome to work with and their packaging is absolutely beautiful i really felt like i got my money's worth and this is made out of wood so it's not like a 3d printing or anything like that there's nothing wrong with 3d printed ones but i really wanted that whole earthy wooden vibe even though no one sees it but me it still makes me feel good so that is definitely something that you should look into and let's just do a quick close-up on that packaging because 10 out of 10. [Music] okay so that is pretty much everything that i purchased like outside of the digiboil let's go ahead and open up the digiboil though because oh my gosh i am so excited everyone in the group says it's awesome and my honestly my presto pot leaks so i'm not like here for it and it's probably because you know my husband and i made it ourselves we didn't actually like purchase it from a reputable vendor so my presto pot leaks it it does a really good job of doing what it's supposed to do besides the leaking so this digiboil is actually only about 56 dollars more and it is huge it will definitely grow with you over time and i wanted to get it now it costs about 156 or so it comes with free shipping and i'm really hoping that it works really well otherwise i'll feel like a giant jerk but according to everyone else it's supposed to be awesome so let's go ahead and unbox that now the ditchy boiler look how okay i don't know if any of you have a presto bot at home so you do a size comparison i'll show you the fresco pot in a minute but this is the digi boil if you're like oh my god where are you gonna put that i don't know either but we'll figure it out right we'll figure it together so let's open it up the thing about the disney oil is that it holds a lot more wax this is actually used for like distilling alcohol when my brother-in-law saw it he was like are you gonna make moonshine and like i'm pretty sure that's illegal in florida not sure but that's not what we're doing with this we are going to be making bikes all right let me do a quick close-up so you could see the whole view of me doing this okay so i have the instruction pamphlet and i assume this is the lid maybe we'll see oh i actually have to put this together oh no maybe i should call in my husband i'm not good at this stuff oh i think i do look there's even a handle all right ta-da look how nice it is look it's like half the size of my body [Laughter] this is crazy oh my gosh here's the inside [Music] who needs instructions we'll just wing it right oh god this is gonna end up awful i need a screwdriver so i'll be right back back with a phillips screwdriver and then we're just gonna put on the lid and this has actually been super easy to put together i really didn't need the instructions so let me just do this real quick and we'll see the final comparison between the digiboil and the presta pot to see the size comparison okay so we're all done assembling it this is it i'm five foot five so this gives you a pretty good idea this is pretty much the size of my torso and shoulders and hips and everything else this is huge i was not expecting it to be this big let me go ahead and just show you a size comparison real quick i'm gonna pick this up it's actually not heavy at all so don't worry about it being super heavy um i could pick this up one-handed it's not a big deal this is the presto pot this is the digiboil look at it it's huge this is like a little tiny baby compared to this that's insane this will definitely help me grow and it's only like 56 dollars more than a presto pot so to me it's a no-brainer i'd get the digiboil assuming it works well which i'm actually going to test it out today and tomorrow to see what it ends up looking like and if it's any good which i have a feeling it will be because i don't think people would lie in the group i mean they'd let me know if it was garbage but if you have one comment down below let me know how you like it kind of give me some tips or anything like that i should be looking for and i would greatly appreciate that one last thing you should know is that the results from yesterday no yesterday a week ago a week ago i had mixed the cocoa apricot 80 with 20 487 it's been amazing i'm going to insert this clip which is going to be a four hour burn don't mind if there's a little wax up wax hang up on the sides it's because my wipe was off centered and now i'm going to insert a clip with a comparison on a second burn same fragrance oil same fragrance oil percentage same everything but this the right one is going to have 100 coconut apricot with the smaller wick and then the other one is going to have um the blend with sorry i had to concentrate on my cap for a second the other one is going to have the left side is going to have 80 cocoa apricot and 20 48.7 and you can see clear as day the difference the coconut apricot is very unstable it's sodium the frame the flame is just going everywhere and then with the 487 blend it looks really really good so i am super excited about that that's pretty much all that i have for today um like i said tomorrow i'm going to be releasing the diy i'm going to be testing out my new camera so hopefully i can get some good shots and i will see you then don't

offer today we're not tackling a recipe we're staging a taste test of one of the most controversial low carb products on the market stay tuned ever heard of devil's tongue noodles neither never heard of elephant yam noodles me either never heard of shirataki noodles yeah I thought so if you've been on any sort of low-carb Facebook forum or Facebook group or any sort of website related to low-carb in the last 10 years you know about the phenomenon known as shirataki noodles so today we're gonna test those a lot of people have very strong opinions about shirataki noodles and today we're gonna find out why a lot of people think they taste very fishy that's one of the words that's used a lot of people think they taste earthy and a lot of people just hate them but a lot of people love them so why what makes it different we're gonna find out I've gone to some all the stores in my every single grocery store in my town to purchase as many different brands of shirataki noodles as I could and I also ordered some from online they're very popular miracle noodles so today we're gonna test these now about shoot I guess six or eight years ago was the last time I ever tasted one of these the last time I was doing a low carb diet and I wasn't wild about them I'll be very honest yes I know there's a huge rigmarole about how you need to repair them and we're gonna go over that today it revolves rinsing for a long time and then it involves parboiling them they're already cooked so they don't need cooking but boiling them in salt water helps rinse some of that strong odor off of them and then you put them in a skillet where you dry fry them no oil please just put them in a dry hot skillet on about medium or medium-high for a couple of minutes and you're gonna find out they make a odd squeaking sound when they're ready and then you sauce them just like you would any traditional noodle and from there people either love them or hate them I liken it to sort of like raw oysters you really either love them or hate them there's not a whole lot of in-between so today we're gonna find out what the big fuss is about and try about four these different kinds actually I think about three of these different kinds so stay tuned okay let's talk about these shirataki noodles to be very honest I thought that these were probably a specific product made for the low-carb market and this is not so shirataki noodles are made are a traditional Japanese noodle they go back hundreds of years in their culture and they've just become popular within the last decade or two in the low-carb world some obviously genius marketers realize that these were made out of a root that has very little calories very little carbohydrates and saw a marketing opportunity for the low-carb market and so now we have the I guess the the explosion of shirataki noodles and they're in every grocery store go look in the refrigerated section where the tofu is found that's generally where you find them so share talking noodles comfort this is from Wikipedia shirataki noodles can be found in the dry and soft wet forms in Asian markets and some supermarkets and when purchased wet they are packed in liquid and some brands may require rinsing or parboiling as the water they are packaged in has an odor that may be unpleasant to those not accustomed to it that was me about six years ago I couldn't stand a touch one alternatively the noodles can be drained and dry roasted this gets rid of the bitterness it also makes the noodles have a more pasta like consistency dry rusting is done by placing noodles in a nonstick skillet on high for a minute or until you hear a slight squeaking noise when moving them around after that they're ready to be added to soup stock or have a sauce added to them so what does that squeak about Halloween pair of these and what's the best-tasting one okay so behind me I have a pot of boiling salted water ready to go so we're gonna par boil all of these for just a couple of minutes after we drained and rinsed them well and then I also have just a very basic alfredo sauce that I've created just so we can sauce these and taste them I'm going to taste them raw without a sauce and then I'm gonna taste them sausage taste them sauced with a basic alfredo sauce so we can get a sort of baseline flavor on all of these so let's talk about these here we go I like I said I've been to every single store in town and I have managed to find pasta Zero by Anna Sawyer and this is shirataki spaghetti this is sold in the refrigerated section and it literally says on the back keep refrigerated perishable okay so second one I found in town was tofu shirataki and these are involved the cognac root and an addition of tofu so also these are refrigerated sold and says specifically do you have to keep them refrigerated the other one that I purchased is one of the more popular ones and it doesn't have to be refrigerated it's in the dry goods I didn't find it in any store in town but it's very popular online and this is the miracle noodle I don't know why I'm very curious why if you look at the ingredients they're all about the same purified water cognac flour and calcium hydroxide why is miracle noodle able to be shipped via the internet in boxes dry goods from Amazon and the other two require refrigeration I'm very curious about that and very curious if that changes the flavor the other thing that's odd about this is they all have very low calories literally about 15 calories per serving and they have very low carbs all of these are one net carb per serving but the odd thing is the miracle noodle their net carbs and total carbs match its 1 less than 1 gram of carbs per serving and no fiber the ingredients are purified water cognac flour and calcium hydroxide now the pasta zero by no Sawyer shirataki spaghetti it's for total carbs but 3 grams of fiber so a 1 net carb per serving and these ingredients are water cognac flour chickpea flour potato starch calcium hydroxide reduced iron keep refrigerated do not freeze so what makes it's the other ingredients perhaps that make that that make that perishable but that's just an odd and odd confusion for me and then this one is the house foods tofu share talking spaghetti shaped noodles substitute and these ingredients are water soy beans that's the tofu yam flour which is the cognac root they're also known as yams calcium hydroxide Glu Cano delta lactone and calcium sulfate again this has to be refrigerated so we're gonna find out what the deal is with all of these now all of these are made from cognac and I don't mean that cognac I mean this cognac it's a root it's a tuber it's actually a beautiful red lily that grows off of the top of these it's like an amorphous cognac is the name of the the scientific name and this is a common tuber grown in Japan from which these gelatinous noodles have been made for apparently hundreds of years and we're lucky enough to finally get them here in the United States because of the low carb phenomenon they have so few calories and so few carbs again we've said you either kind of love them or hate them I was not super fond over than the last time I tried them ok we're gonna start with the Mississauga pasta zero and you're talking spaghetti now aren't these come in all kind of sizes they come in like a fettuccine which is a wide strip noodle that you can use for a fettuccine alfredo things like that they come in a spaghetti or angel hair pasta size which is traditional and the miracle noodle actually even makes rice which is little tiny grains of this stuff so we're gonna just for consistency's sake we're going to do this spaghetti size the angel hair or the spaghetti size of all of these so here we go and we're gonna drain them here in a colander and whoo I mean it stinks it's not super strong but there's an odor they're kind of like an old dirty fish tank I'll be honest with you if you're sensitive to things like that it's strong and so here's the important part I think to enjoying these if you know that there is no fish in this it is not fish related it's not seaweed related that odor comes from the lime they make up flour out of the cognac root and then they add water to that and extrude it out of a machine that makes these noodles and they extrude it into hot lime water and I don't mean line like the fruit I mean lime and that makes this odor but that's also what holes the noodle together and makes it format shape and stay where it is and then they package it into that and it kind of just has a weird I mean I do get why that's off-putting it sort of smells like a swimming pool float kind of odd so all right we're gonna put this here I'm gonna go rinse this at the sink and the fresh cool running water for about two to three minutes I'll be right back okay now I'm back I've rinsed these like I said for about two to three minutes and they're ready to now go into the hot boiling water so we're gonna boil those I'm also preheating a skillet over medium-high heat and I'll be honest with you you need to do this in a non-stick skillet unfortunately just for our cooking setup and demonstration here today this is an induction burner so that means it works by the power of magnets and if you don't have a magnetic or steel or stainless steel or cast iron metal pan it doesn't work and unfortunately all of my nonstick skillet suites it's very common are all aluminum and aluminum does not work on an induction system so I'm gonna try I'm gonna try this in my cast-iron but it may stick and make a mess now the secret here is regardless of what kind of pan you use you cannot use oil do not use oil you need to dry roast these or dry fry them so we don't want any oil in this I'm hoping like hell just for this demonstration that this doesn't stick in Menon's in my cast-iron skillet we're gonna find out okay so stay tuned here we go we're gonna fry boil these for two minutes I'm gonna put them back in this colander and we're gonna drain them and dry fry them stay tuned now while my first noodles are cooking I just wanted to say like when I first tried these I mean the whole big deal about this is they need to rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse rinse that's what everybody says if you find anybody online a facebook or ever this says I hate your docking noodles the first defense people say is well you did you rinse them and I'm like well if these damn things taste so bad without rinsing them well why don't they rinse them well in the factory before they put them in the bag but now I realized that the lime water is what helps these boogers hold their shape so they're probably rinsed in the factory but then packaged again in some lime water which gifts gives us that odor but it also is what makes these things hold their pasta shape that's all I can figure out otherwise in the soil you can you rinse these things off for you to put them in the package please I don't know all right hold on alrighty we've got our noodles boiled for two minutes now these are sure talking noodles are already cooked so we're not cooking these this is specifically to drive off that weird odor and flavor so now it says we put them in a hot skillet y'all cross your fingers right now I don't know how this is gonna react into a nonstick into a cast-iron skillet it specifically says nonstick but like I said what we go with what we're doing so I hope I don't have to remake these let's go boom all right keep them moving and we're just gonna dry Friday we're just gonna drive fry or dry roast these oh they're doing fine all right so I'm gonna try to get close to this so you can hear this change in sound that we're talking about it literally says do it until it squeaks and I thought that's was stupid but you really notice it like it's weird you notice it so much listen up I'm Elaine Everett so you can hear my microphone okay it's happening I can hear it and to be very honest with you this little cooktop that I use has a fan inside to keep it cool and I don't know that you're gonna hear the difference in sound that I'm talking about I wish I could I wish I could show it to you now I'm busting this all up I'm trying not to break up this pasta but that's it so here's what we're going to do I'm going to put all this in a pan in a bowl and look at all those little pieces I'm also going to take out one or two get out of the way one or two noodles just to try if I can separate them just to try without a sauce because I'm curious what it tastes like it still has an odor I'll be honest with you I can smell it right now so here's what we're gonna do watch this all right I've made just a basic alfredo sauce here and I'm just gonna put a little on this pasta here and we're gonna gently toss this with our alfredo sauce now I'll be honest with you Alfredo a cream sauce like alfredo is a very forgiving sauce it hides a lot of flavor right it hides a lot of things with a red sauce or tomato sauce you might have a different reaction especially if it's an acidic sauce those kind of bring out that fishy flavor that we're trying to get out of these noodles so just keep that in mind so all right I'm gonna put these aside I'm gonna do the same exact thing rinse boil for two minutes pan fry quickly sauce and separate for the other two products and I'll meet you right back here and we're gonna taste them stay tuned okay the yard guys are here the landscapers and my two dogs think that they're monsters so unfortunately we're gonna battle some dog barking for the rest of this video sorry guys come loose there look at those how well they held together whoa that's massive I mean that's that's pretty pretty impressive and the pasta side of things okay so we're back we've done the deed on all of these they have been washed and rinsed for two to three minutes each they have been parboiled for exactly two minutes in boiling salted water they've been dry fried and dry roasted to dry them out until they're the perfect texture and flavor and then I've sauced them all with the same alfredo sauce so let's try these I'm gonna start where I start at the beginning first of all you'll notice the portions are rather small each one of these bags is about seven ounces and that includes the liquid once you drain them there's not a lot in them so just be aware of that okay so this is the pasta zero shirataki spaghetti buying a soya so let's try one of these just by itself the texture is nice they've held up well it looks like spaghetti it's salty we have a very firm texture a little more firm than pasta kind of tastes like salt there's no flavor there at all it does have a little bit of a pungent earthy flavor good Lord here they come literally right there on top of us if you can hear that I'm sorry I've got to go on so let's try these really dude get out from under my window okay so let's try these sauced and I may have over sauce to these but okay so this is two and a half servings just that little Bowl down there and this that's two and a half servings and you guys are used to seeing me cook and use these serving bowls so you'll see how much that is it held up well let's see what's up they are really long so you truthfully have to do the spaghetti twirl roll on your fork to be able to taste it tastes like Alfredo there is a slight aftertaste very slight aftertaste it's not bad it doesn't taste like fish but it definitely has no I wouldn't say unusual but an odd flavor aftertaste but the springiness of it the the way it gives the way it squeaks the way it handles on a fork really kind of feels like pasta truthfully now these are like I said very low-calorie very low carb the cognac root once you make flour out of that it's basically glucomannan which if you were an overweight teenager like me that tried that tried all the nutritional supplements and all of that stuff and all the weight loss supplements back in the day glucomannan used to be a very popular supplement that would you would take peels of it it would swell in your stomach and make you feel full and had no calories and no carbs and so it was a very popular weight loss supplement back in the day and that's what this essentially is but for better or worse that actually wasn't too bad now let's move on this is the tofu shirataki brand by house foods and this has tofu in it soy if you are strict keto if you are paleo if you are sensitive to soy this particular brand may not be the one for you just get one of the other ones that are just to share talking it'll not tofu share talking so let's try one of these this one is much more this is one of the ones that has high fiber in it it's four net carbs and three of those are fiber so you still get it's four total carbs three of those of fiber so you get one net carb so these are actually not translucent and they're not white like look at the difference in the miracle noodle and the tofu Shirataki you see the difference in color this one the tofu shiitake looks almost translucent this looks like that's Katie so let's see oh that one definitely has an unusual texture has a much stronger flavor than the other one not real wild about that let's try it with some sauce okay it is better with the sauce but it had a little more of the weird aftertaste than the other ones in so that's the tofu so all right our third option is the miracle noodle this is like I said the only one that came dry in the dry good section didn't require to be refrigerated it is bright white much clearer and it has fewer ingredients than all the others it is strictly just the cognac flower so let's try this by itself mmm kind of taste salty it's about like the first one then the soya pasta zero now let's try it let's try it with the sauce that had a little stronger odor and I wonder if that has something to do with the refrigeration you know the others are refrigerated that one's not I wonder if that has something to do with the residual aftertaste so look how long I mean come on that's pretty pasta rific if you ask me pretty good I gotta say um I was really expecting there to be a pretty big difference in the ones that refrigerated versus the one that wasn't I just assumed that the ones that were refrigerated would be fresher but that really wasn't the case I'll be honest out of these three I can't pick a winner they're all kind of pretty good to be honest I can definitely see how these would go in a recipe if I were just to eat a big bowl of this maybe not but if you were to add this with some shrimp for like you know shrimp Alfredo if you were to add this to chicken and red sauce and make a chicken parmesan I can see where this is pretty passable for for pasta like I said the last time I tried this was about maybe six or eight years ago and apparently huh there have been some improvements in the manufacture and production of shirataki noodles because these are pretty freakin passable in it all I believe has to do with how you handle them I don't remember back in the day being given specific instructions on rinsing them for a specific amount of time boiling them in salted water for a specific amount of time and dry frying them for a specific amount of time and then putting them in your recipe I don't remember that I just remember rinsing them and using them but if you handle it the way that they tell you to and in the way that its traditional in Japanese culture these really are pretty respectable of all of these the pasta zero by new soya was the cheapest it was available locally both at Walmart and at winn-dixie my local store and at Publix which are my three of my local grocery stores so it's easy to find it was less than two dollars for packaged of it it's about 8 ounces there's two servings you get four total carbs three grams of fiber so for a total of one net carb now there is potatoes and chickpea flour in this so if that bothers you then maybe use the miracle noodle the miracle noodle I ordered from Amazon in a package and I'm gonna put a link down below and it came with angel hair which is like this the spaghetti size it came with which angel hair pasta is not spaghetti size but this is we came with angel hair it came with fettuccine and it came with rice so pretty please with all of that so there you have it folks shirataki noodles if you haven't had them in a decade or more try them what do you think about them I know a lot of people actually buy Cognac flour and make their own noodles I would be very

"2dBOrTS5834": "okay zero calories if we go to the nutrition table backyard zero calories and I'm so full you guys I'm so happy about this noodles what's up guys it's Coco and today we are gonna be trying out the miracle noodle from thrive market so as you can see from the title yes it is this noodles are zero calories I'm gonna show you the packaging over here the packaging looks like this this one is the angel here I used all the fettuccine noodles that I have these are two packs right here I thought it was wasn't gonna be a lot cuz it package looks like this so it looks like really small so I thought to myself that's not enough for me so I did - I did two fettuccine which is right here so today we are having spaghetti and meatballs I did a twist on it do you know those um nuclear fire noodle packets the paste the one that's like makes it all the noodles spicy I put two packs of those in the sauce of my spaghetti sauce and I mixed it with a meatball and everything so this this spaghetti meatball here is spicy as how and then just to make sure I have a side of Meatballs - the meatballs has one gram of carbs I just got it from a regular store you don't have to browse it since it's meatball you know it's like lower grams of carbs so yeah let's just dig into this zero calorie noodles let's see I've never tried it I'm really excited to try it it is a work to kind of prepare it as you can see I prepared it you have to rinse it for like 10 minutes you have to like let the water from the noodles evaporate from a pan and then you cook it so it's kind of like the same as prepping a pasta but you don't have to cook it you just kind of like let the water evaporate and then you mix it with the sauce you can either do anything like alfredo or like chow mein Maine or anything with oyster sauce or soy sauce I know just just like a zero calorie noodle substitute they also have rice they also have zero calorie rice substitute I don't know how that tastes like I don't know how I feel about that but this noodles I really love to try them maybe you can put it on your soup so you can have like zero calorie like noodle on your ramen that would be really good too or like foie so enough said let's just try on this spaghetti I put like mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese on top because cheese is life that's what it looks like yes I made that I'm like scared still hot this is gonna be really hard to eat because all the sauces are like oh my God look at that it's so cheesy look at that it's so cheesy and steaming hot I don't know if I should eat this with chopsticks but it's just chicken meatball oh my god I just soaked I'm okay the noodles is really chewy what makes that on noodles - zero calories um I read it it's 77% water there you go and then 3% plant-based fiber I don't know what that means but whatever so that's just the like the counting ingredients for that it's not bad it almost tastes like it's um rubbery but it's not bad because it says in the packaging it says Shirataki konjac pass to your otaku noodles it isn't healthy option if you want to get rid of the normal ramen or like the normal posture in your life or rice I'd say get this four packs of these noodles is $15 I think that's not bad because if you go to a restaurant one meal of pasta is $15 to 20 you know and this is like a lot this is like two packs here and this probably could feed me lunch and dinner it's just something that you get used to you know hmm so really the only calorie that I'm taking right now is from the meat button from the sauce I'm after liking this cuz it's spicy hmm regular meatball hmm the only thing about these noodles you know how I nearly eating those you like cut it with your teeth you can't cut it with your teeth for some reason it's kind of like top and chewy but but it's good you just got to get used to depth texture it doesn't have any taste so you make sure you want to like kind of like make a really good sauce with this like spaghetti meatballs Alfredo but Alfredo has a lot of carbs too so it's kind of like defeats the purpose of having these noodles but if you're just like stir fry vegetables and have oyster sauce with this or like make an olive oil pasta with shrimp and garlic shrimp or scampi this would be good this is be healthy I couldn't cut in the nose so I gotta like put everything in my mouth mm-hmm just mean bother everything um hmm you you guys know in the past I was literally talking about oh my god if somebody invents like a zero calorie pizza that would be really good I would be really rich if I invented that and now they invented a zero calorie pasta or like noodles to substitute with anything but it's not the same but it's a good option I actually like this like if you're craving spaghetti or pasta and you can't have any and you're really strict on your diet like this is a really good option like you feel like just sick of zoodles because it's so obvious it's zoodles it's like vegetables and it's crunchy this is like the closest to the texture of a pasta or ramen or in Fond oh it's the closest to like glass noodles you know what glass noodles like texture is like it's kind of like if you're rather far or like Vietnamese noodles it's the closest to this but it's chewy and thicker I put a lot of cheese too so it's super flavorful YUM it's not chewing when you eat this it's kind of like you feel like you're eating better tarry noodles it has the same texture of like vegetarian meat cuz I've had vegetarian meat I'd rather have real me hmm close up yeah it's still steamy and hot I cooked today hmm I'm not gonna lie I will get this again because I do crave a lot of ramen and also this will really work out for me if I needed a break from just like you know salads and steak and broccoli and chicken and tomatoes how do you know I have so much meatballs in here I'm so happy hmm I wish I'd Tabasco hmm I don't wait you guys I just hit 2,000 subscribers today when I woke up thank you so much I love you guys and what motivates me is actually you guys could have done it without you so now we're in 2k and let's aim for 5k 10k 100k millions this is just the start I've been doing YouTube for five months now yeah five months and there's a whole like probably the first three months was like a learning experience for me I was doing that bad videos like uh

"(lighthearted guitar music) - Hey guys, Cassie here and welcome to Cheap Clean Eats. Today we're going to take a very staple and very Yolo all American recipe into an extremely healthy, low-calorie, and guilt-free recipe for you. And guess what it is? You've been asking for it. I've been listening and\nreading in the comments. And today, we are making mac and cheese. That's right people. These are the ingredients\nthat you're going to need. (cheerful accordion music) One bag of Miracle Noodle ziti for 3.33, but this will be on sale later. One pinch of salt, one penny. One eighth cup of almond milk, 4 cents. One eighth cup of low fat\ncottage cheese, 20 cents. Three tablespoons of low fat\ncheddar cheese, 66 cents. A quarter teaspoon of\ndry mustard, 10 cents. Pepper to taste, a penny. Pinch of cayenne, a penny. Totaling 4.36 for two servings of all American macaroni and cheese, making it $2.18 a person. So if you're ready, let's go\nahead and strap our boots on. Let's go. Okay, so if you've never worked\nthe Miracle Noodle before, I have to show you, or else you're going to think\nit's really, really weird. So you're going to head\nover to the sink. Okay? Because it comes in this\nbag. It's already pre-cooked. Now you're going to want\nto get your scissors ready and also a strainer. Okay? And I don't want you to be alarmed, but there is going to\nbe a sea salt tea aroma that arises from the bag, right when you open it. But this is just the\nwater it's preserved in. To really keep it\npreserved the whole time. And all you have to do is rinse it, as you can see, they're\nalready cooked for you. You don't have to do anything crazy. Just rinse it. Look they look like little worm, weee. Okay. So obviously they're super wet right now. And at this point, you're going to want to pat them dry. So you want to grab\nsome paper towels here, lay them on your countertop, see how they just come out, aww have fun like little slide. And then we're just going to pat them dry. If you cook them without patting them dry, then they get really watery\nand it just doesn't taste good. Because the Miracle Noodle\nactually takes up the flavor of whatever sauce that you put it in. So today we're going to put\na lot of cheddar cheese, some almond milk. It's going to really taste\ncreamy and rich and good. I am just going to put my\nlittle ziti into this bowl. Okay? And this is going to be the easiest mac and\ncheese you've ever made. I've got some cheddar cheese right here. And if you want it\nreally cheesy put a lot. You don't even have to use cheddar cheese, but I liked the orangy color and this is light cheese. So I've really cut the\nfat and calories in half. Now we're going to a little\nbit of cottage cheese for more of a creamy texture\nand for extra protein, because that's what you need\nafter your great workout to really build your muscles. And a little bit of almond milk, just to add a little bit of fluidity. And then now I didn't know this, but when I looked into making\nmac and cheese recipes, you actually needed dry mustard. So just a little bit of dry mustard here to give it some flavor. You know me and my chili tendencies, they said a pinch of cayenne pepper. I'll put a whole bound in there. Maybe more, a little bit more, okay. Whoever has to eat this with\nme, I feel really bad for them. Just a teeny bit of salt. Just a teens. Because there's already salt in the cottage cheese, and then black pepper to taste. This is like the easiest\nmac and cheese recipe you will ever have to make. Besides that, easy mazline get in the box, but that's just disgusting guys. Fine. Don't eat that. That's nasty and that is bad for you. Perfection. And of course, if you wanted to add anything extra to it you can add some kale or\nsome tomatoes or some onions, but we're just going\nto keep it real simple, real simple American today. And we're just going\nto stir it up in here. So now that this is all ready to go, we're going to place this in\nour beautiful white dish here. Ooh and I can just smell\nthat cayenne pepper. Okay. This is now going to go into the microwave oven\nfor like two minutes and it's going to come\nout so cheesy and hot and warm and gooey in your mouth. Let's go ahead and take\nit to the microwave. (lighthearted guitar music) (microwave door closes) (microwave beeps) And now it's cardio dance time. \u266a Oh ho \u266a \u266a Oh ho \u266a \u266a Oh ho \u266a It's done. Look at that mac and cheese. That is some real American macaroni. If you like it extra cheesy, I have no problem with you\nputting on some extra cheddar or mozzarella, or whatever\ncheese that you desire. I'm so excited to eat this. You know why? Because we have slashed\nthe calories of this all American dish, by like more way more than half. At macaroni grill, a serving\nof macaroni cheese is da da da daaaa, 580 calories. O M G. This right here, my dear friends, one serving, the sachet is two servings, is 88 calories. Are you kidding me? Now you can eat the whole thing for 176. And you're going to be\nso full. Look at this. Isn't that beautiful. That this Miracle Noodle, I love to eat it because I really like keeping my stomach full. So it's all about volume for me. This is the most exciting part. So let's go ahead and place some of this on a plate for us to try. Now look at this ooey gooeyness. Beautiful. (lighthearted guitar music) And now for the taste test, I cannot wait to put this cheesy ooey\ngooey goodness in my mouth. (upbeat guitar music) Oh, that was so good and so filling. I want you to make this\nskinny mac and cheese at home. You can actually click here, miraclenoodle.com, and check out the ziti noodles. They're really filling.\nThey're good for you because there's tons of\nfiber and water in there.

(upbeat guitar music)", "VsNu19aQehI": "so I'm really excited about miracle Mancha miracle matcha you've ever heard of matcha tea matcha tea is basically tea leaves that are ground up into a fine powder and what makes that so great is that all of those phytonutrients and all the vitamins and minerals that are in the tea leaves you actually get because you're actually getting the whole leaf so most green teas but most modules are green tea and this is actually white mantra and it's from a farm in Kenya in the Rift Valley and what makes it so amazing is that it's so high up in the Rift Valley that you know it's protected against pesticides of course it's fully organic fair trade certified as well but what's amazing is that when you take a leaf and it's in such a high elevation it has to struggle to survive and when when leaves and plants struggle to survive they actually produce more antioxidants and so this this matcha tea actually has three times the antioxidants of regular green tea matcha which actually makes it the highest antioxidant level pretty much of any green tea or any mantra actually any tea at all quite frankly we actually have this tested at a lab in Toronto and it pretty much blew away all the other teas that are out there and so basically it's just the powder of the of the ground white tea leaves and matcha basically all you do is you take a little bit of it you add a little cold water and you make a paste out of it and once the paste is made and you add hot water into it and just stir it up and then you have a incredibly delicious white matcha tea with antioxidant levels that are just through the roof", "yeOYrogHqjM": "[Music] okay so for this episode of Iron Chef dr. Dre will be using just a few strips of green bell pepper a quarter of a white onion a generous knob of ginger and then I'm also gonna be using just a few strips of kombu that I purchased on I herb a while back I get this in a large package and I it takes a long time to use it up so it's a really good value I use this in lieu of salt and it imparts a really nice flavor to the broth without adding any kind of funny taste if you're at all worried about that when the broth is done cooking this has this soaks up a lot of the liquid and has a chewy texture if you find that off-putting you can just remove it but I eat it and then I'm also gonna be using the enoki mushrooms that I purchased at H Mart our local Korean grocer and if you don't have these you could use a different type of mushroom but I really like them because they they kind of end up being like noodles in the end so they're sort of fun and then since you all are dying to know how exactly to use these shirataki ham noodles there are a variety of ways to prepare them but I'm going to show you how I use them in this soup today and I'm also gonna flavor things up with some sliced lotus root here that I have I purchased a lotus root at again my Korean grocery store H Mart this is not a necessary ingredient however if you don't have access to lotus root don't worry this is very similar to like rutabaga so you could use that instead or a parsnip if you wanted I suppose but it's really easy to prepare you just slice it like you just peel it like you would a potato and then slice it into thin slices and whatever you don't use you can just put in some water with a little bit of white vinegar to prevent it from browning so you can see it looks cool kind of like wagon wheels I can imagine this is entertaining for children to consume question mark not entirely sure I don't feed things to kids because I eat them pretty quickly but I don't really have children I eat food quickly not children though I do kind of have a cackle like a witch that might eat children that's not me and this is not at all a traditional ingredient by any means I just kind of invented this because I got this on my bottle a long time ago and I want to make sure I use it up before it gets kind of funky and it's actually been working quite well on this this is just plain mustard powder I suppose you could use like Chinese mustard in this and it might be really good but you're just going to use about a teaspoon of this and then these are this is the organic coconut aminos dynamic health brand that I got on I hope I'm really enjoying this I prefer this to you soy sauce it has no added msg and it is organic if you have soy sauce you can use that instead you can also use Bragg's aminos the non coconut version to work nicely on this and I'm also gonna throw in a splash of the rice vinegar if you don't have rice vinegar and not to worry you can use any vinegar that you like though I don't think balsamic would go too well on this TBH yeah I'm just going to be using a serving of black beans you can use whatever you want if you're not vegan or vegetarian you can use meat in this I assume I could just I would imagine you can also use seafood it would go well you can use any like Hume you want if you like tofu you could add that as well and that will soak up the flavors but I cook these from scratch I talked about how I did it yesterday in my crock pot and so I've just got them here prepared and I will add them in towards the end and they'll soak up the flavors of the magical broth so yeah that is everything and with that I'm going to get started again the end of the day for me this is usually when I prepare a dinner at night and usually you guys are you guys are incubating on the charger but I think it's fun for me to fill in these recipe videos for you guys to have an extra battery that I use I'm just dominating like five sheep out here but first I'm just going to peel my onion oh and I almost forgot you need a garlic because who needs friends anyway but first thing I'm just gonna you know chop and peel how was everybody's day today I hope everybody dawn there sunscreen how cold is it where you are it's not cold here it is for sure our winter blast has left us here in Houston and it's no longer cold but still rocking my sunscreen this morning I am out of the biood erm I used it up yeah this morning I am I ran out of my binder my I've used it up my biome is sunscreen so I grabbed my elta MD UV sport that I love so much and slap that off alright so chop chop my onion and now I'm just gonna I'm just gonna peel my ginger here but fun fact this morning with the black beans I made my matcha notes this morning for breakfast and I talked him with a few tablespoons of black beans and dusted some cinnamon on them I like to do that with beans because it ends up they end up tasting like sprinkles so yeah I just did some some of the black beans on with some of that Ceylon cinnamon and some of those black sesame seeds they are so good you guys alright I just diced out my ginger yeah Nominet I peeled my garlic on my diet him up but yet again I don't really have a name for this recipe the type of stock some people might call it donkey but I think that's typically made up in advance and then brought back out and reintroduced into suits and bringing heated up I'm not entirely sure but it's kind of inspired by that by virtue of the kombu and the mushrooms as well the nice thing about adding the the lotus root the lotus root really soaks up the flavors of the broth and softens and and it's like a nice thing that you want additionally the shirataki noodles they will pretty the longer and slower they cook the more the less chewy they become on us and they really just kind of soak up the flavor of the broth honestly they don't they don't taste like they're definitely not like a pasta at all so I wouldn't expect them to be like that if that's what you're looking for and really they're more like they're more like the kind of noodles almost this sort of the texture of noodles that you find in like Vietnamese pho the other way to do them is to actually put them in the wok with a little bit of sesame oil and cook them on low in the wok and they get almost kind of a little bit more crispy chewy almost not chewy but but I really love them and I've been eating them for years and alright so you can see here that I've chopped up the white onion the green bell pepper the ginger do a nice dice as well as the garlic clove and then I just wanted to threw into this bowl my pieces of kombu and I'm gonna walk this over the stove in a minute and I have it I have a pot on the stove sit with some simmering water in it about a cup and a half and I'm gonna add that to that about really quickly these are the enoki mushrooms I just went ahead and took them out of the packaging here and this is about how many I'm going to use and you can see they're all married together there at the end I'm just gonna cut that little brown nubbin off so that they separate and you can see they're kind of like they're kind of like little noodley friends yeah as you can see I've just got a little bit of water simmering away there on the stove it's about a cup and a half roughly and I'm just gonna add my onion bell pepper ginger and the kombu strips into the pot there's also the garlic in there and get to you cooking down and then I'm just gonna pick up with a fork a few slices at a time of my of my lotus root isn't that cool looking now I'm gonna add roughly a teaspoon not an exact measurement but roughly a teaspoon of that Coleman here and then we're gonna bring in the coconut aminos into the game do a little pork judge here oh yeah everybody's everybody's getting fancy don't worry I know what you're fretting about the salient ingredient has somehow been left down but oh no don't you worry about a thing baby okay I'm just gonna put about a teaspoon of this in and if you've never seen coconut aminos that's kind of what it looks like up close and here's everything as is not much to look at but don't you fret I'm also going to go ahead and add in my enoki mushrooms these are cute this is a very high-tech tool kitchen scissors handy dandy but a note about the coconut aminos I keep mine in the refrigerator it's us to do that on the package and I keep it in this little plastic doodle bob thing here that way it's it's almost like a little like a little bid for it kind of like my classy pal keeps my fridge clean messy spills alright and so now I've got everything that I've shown you so far the onions bell pepper ginger garlic lotus root enoki magic is happening and now to add in 1/2 a cup of black beans these black beans are a little al dente you could snap on them but they're gonna get soft and absorb some of the flavors so they're alright don't worry let's go prepare the shirataki noodles and add them in alright so as far as the shirataki noodles first up you're gonna just open the bag and dump them into a strainer and give them a rinse and they have a really strange smell when they first come out of the package don't be alarmed by that it's just kind of a little a little aroma they give off but that goes away with the cooking time so don't be alarmed by that so I'm just giving them a rinse here over the same cou your tail is flapping in the wind there see that's the annoying wrist strap I never use it should just take that thing off it clanks against the side makes it oh I think some of my frustrations here you can see they're quite long and they look like they look like they belong in a a Janu Dulce don't you agree I think I think so they're a little long okay you may you may have trouble swallowing them as is so I'm gonna do something that I've seen the pros do and I'm gonna I'm just gonna gonna pull them up I witnessed the woman at H Mart doing this here you just pull them up and give them a snip but yeah I just give them a snip that makes them easier to easier to handle this is an advanced noodling here alright those are more manageable bits so now I'm just gonna walk this over to my pot that's simmering over there and add it right in all right now I'm just gonna let all of this simmer for approximately an hour and a half to two hours give or take and it's gonna be a delicious got the enoki mushroom see they're already starting to soak up some liquid and this is gonna be fantastic I've really been enjoying this guy's so I'm gonna let that cook cover it on low for about an hour and a half and show you guys the magic when it's done all right that's all done fantastic dinner is served I'm so excited for this the noodles are nice and the right consistency I like I said I leave the like I said I leave the kombu you're steaming up I leave the kombu in there and the ginger is all smelling good and just to bring out the Tang I'm gonna add a tablespoon of rice vinegar here and it's gonna be delicious so yeah that's how I use shirataki noodles and how I cook them so you guys should experiment with them and tell me what you think if you make this recipe let me know how it turns out if you like this video give it a thumbs up share it with your friends and as always don't forget sunscreen and subscribe I'll talk to you guys tomorrow bye [Music]", "NK-NdTr16o8": "hello what is that um yes so I'm doing a taste test so trying to find all the time like I see Remy ashton mr. Ashman um I see Remy talked about all the time um like noodles like fake noodles that like low-carb noodles basically um and like I hold foods is like Oh far away and target doesn't really have anything we get like surprisingly Walmart has like wanted like a brand or something and I've gotten one miracle noodle I think miracle noodle is literally what it is I've gotten like angel hair which they have but they never had anything else and I want to sorry I'm gonna try like more so I have a miracle noodle but it's like pad thai but it's so it's obviously not like just noodles so basically to make a repo full packet of pad thai but it's like vegan it's vegan green free noodles gluten-free non-gmo I don't know if it's organic I don't think so so interesting there's two servings in the packet so it's 90 calories for half the packet 3.5 grams of fat 350 milligrams and of sodium and half the packet 12 grams of carbs in half the packet 3 grams of fiber 7 grams of sugar 3 grams of protein so like okay the ingredients are like the noodles there's tofu water coconut sugar garlic chives shallots peanut coke peanuts just peanut coconut oil garlic blah blah I mean nothing that I can't like read so that's good tear open the pouch 1 to 2 inches and microwave for 60 seconds so like who kind of skeptical just because I love Pad Thai like I love me I love me some pad thai but I'm curious so let's see what miracle noodle a pad thai is okay all right tear open pouch one to two inches all right I feel like I have to smell it okay it doesn't smell terrible and not gonna lie 60 seconds in the meantime one of my favorite sauces lambics love mexicana and some of my favorite clips to see this lately I've been doing like a from Target or Publix they're organic corn chips break in icky down according traps but I mean Tostitos especially these thin ones the restaurant style and they're good yeah how is that already a minute this was like two ish dollars okay so I poured it into the bowl smells okay there's tofu this what I look like there's clearly like a sauce and tofu okay huh hmm so okay the tofu the tofu is surprisingly like I don't have much tofu but like I don't mind tofu this tofu is very like chewy and like hard and it low-key tastes like like chicken the noodles are good the nanos are good the flavouring he's good it's like it's like it's good it's not like it's not terrible I think it's supposed to be like it's just good like I don't know it's not it's clearly a vegan it's clearly a vegan option for Pat I like it's not like if I wanted real pad thai I would go get pad thai but like if if I don't care about having a good pad type sure this is good alternative but also if I but also if I wanted if I didn't care about having a good good pad thai then there's other options in terms of like heat it up at your place but those are gonna have real noodles and cards this has way less carbs so this is more like if you don't care about restaurant quality pad thai and you don't want carbs this is great I wouldn't be able to eat your staff although maybe I would I don't know I'm just hungry so maybe that's why it's like in terms of it compared to a to a real like a chicken pad thai the flavoring is like mediocre it's just like it's weird like oh I'm eating it it's like I'm eating it because I don't mind it but like it's not the most amazing thing ever would I buy it again maybe I guess it's like this is so subpar that the flavoring is pretty similar to regular pad thai I don't taste the peanut like as much a little bit so overall maybe some people just forget what a pad thai tastes like if they're vegetarian or vegan so it doesn't really matter all right I think it's good if you are looking it's good if you are looking for both quick and low-carb pate it will wait quick I think it's great if you're looking for quick low-carb and vegan if you're looking for quick there are better options like in terms of just heating up if you're looking for vegan maybe this is the only option maybe not I'm sure there are other just go to Whole Foods well you're looking for vegan you can make it yourself if you're looking for if you're looking for slow and not vegan and healthy you can make it yourself or go to a restaurant that there's gonna be aspects of a restaurant that won't be as healthiest oh man it's really not terrible I'd probably buy again now I also just want to go get Pat with real pad thai I wish they sold the noodles in here like alone all right if you try it let me know what do you think oh yeah all right well thanks for watching", "oVk8sD497f0": "it's 3pm you're at work you're exhausted more than anything else you'd love to curl up in a ball and take a nap but you can't you've got lots of work

different videos on the left and today we're gonna be talking about this little guy this is a live resin cartridge the strain is purple haze and it's from Prime Wellness this is the craziest card I've ever seen you guys it is not like a normal live resin cartridge when I posted this on my snapchat last night there was a lot of confusion from people that didn't know exactly what this is this is a live present our trajactory at this is pure live resin when you look close up to it you can actually see little PACA rocks in there like little diamonds floating around it's basically like the concentrate sugar in a cartridge like nice flavorful intense clouds every time it really tastes like a DAB and it also feels like it's AB you do not need to keep cheeping on this like you do some cartridges it goes a long way since the little rocks in there are so small they should be able to just be consumed right through those coils there might be a little bit left over smoking on my Paquito from cloud products I really like this battery it's a magnetic over ring bottom so you just screw a little overhang into your battery plug it in and you hit it I really just like how small and discreet it is I've had a lot of lab resin cartridges before that say liquid lab resin on it and it's like actually liquid it looks like the same consistency as a normal car but this is totally different this is like something I've never had before when it comes to price it wasn't too bad now when you buy a cartridge no matter what it's gonna be expensive when you're buying it legally to restore there's just a hefty price on in my state cards go for forty to seventy dollars and this one was fifty five so it's actually right in the middle of price I know a lot of people are like shocked at how much I pay for weed sometimes it is extensive but honestly like you have to pay for freedom and I'm an estate that just recently introduced the medical bill so the fact that I'm allowed to legally buy this and consume it like I'll pay the extra money I'm happy to help you'll [ __ ] for those of you who don't know what live resin is it's basically just a concentrate that has an extremely high terpene profile the way that it get to that terpene profile is from the way the plant is cured typically when weed is grown they cut it then they cure it in a room and then let it dry and then they process it with live resin once it's cut they instantly freeze it then that fresh version product gets processed and turned into live resin since the weeds frozen the turkeying profiles are way higher think about freezing a banana if you kept it frozen it wouldn't ripen in the freezer it would stay how it is when you froze it so in that drying and curing process there is some flavor lost in cannabis should still taste good but it just tastes better with live resin because it has all the terpenes yet try different battery freshen unboxing got a break it you know this is the poquito push it's basically the big brother of the poquito definitely larger but what's cool about this one it probably conceals your cartridge so there it's like what is this portable charger what the [ __ ] no it's my cartridge if you can watch my videos for a while you know I love my Terps which is why I'll address is definitely my favorite form of concentrate I just love the flavor you get it really can't be lied resin except if you're talking rosin which is super crazy I've heard of some people doing like rosin karts but they are not cheap and like I wouldn't even consider buying one at the price that they are but these lab resin karts are the [ __ ] move I really like how convenient cartridges are which is why I still buy them but I have to make sure they're high quality ones and I just wish that there was a higher standard for cartridges as a whole like I don't get why it's that rare for me to find sugar and a cartridge like I feel like that should be somewhat easy and common of people to do like ethos incarnate oh yeah the beginners that I didn't order crazy how many people were telling me to like take back this cartridge and like this isn't a normal cartridge and that should be concerned as I'm describing it as a languorous and cartridge I feel like a lot of people just thought it was distillate and honestly guys if your discipline cartridge looks like this do not smoke black resin can have a file you look to it but this look and not like they're two totally different concentrates honestly guys just to warn you no matter what company or buying it from no matter what brand it is if you're buying it this little cartridge it's probably shitty even if it's fire like every company I've ever heard of puts their bottom shelf product in their distillate no matter what it's going to be there trim and they're like worst looking nuts the reason for that is all this tool it looks the same when it process the matter what the butt looks like it's clear and tastes like nothing so then companies add terpenes if you're lucky to the distillate to make it taste better for your enjoyment sometimes they don't even have real turf there's so many random ghetto [ __ ] that's been added into cartridges and that's why all these people are dying because of shitty black-market cartridges like dude these hits are so amazing it tastes so good I hate to be the person to say that even the most top-shelf brands of distillate are shitty but ultimately they are even when I'm smoking into the cartridge I know it's the company's bottom to your product if they added into Italy it just has to be there's no way around it every company has trim every company has dirt product that they have and the company's mentality because they're trying to make money is let's turn it into distillate they like actually hit you in the chest like a bat and you have to really think of breath like and it hits you definitely going through this cart look at a little diamonds whoo if you ever get the opportunity to get ladders and cartridges that actually have some live resin in it go for it there's actually like a lot of liquid ladders and cartridges but this is even better this is like a whole nother step ahead I would love that this became the new standard for cartridges just because it's not only a pleasurable experience for like the casual smoker that likes cartridges but it's also an enjoyable experience for the avid smoker that since all the time because I know a lot of people that just like won't even hit cartridges because they just don't feel like they get them high the people that have known that there was something wrong with these that were just like no I'm not even hitting that because so many people have had shitty cartridges they hand me a cartridge and they're like yeah what do you think and it's just moving faster than a lava lamp and they're just like bro what did what are you doing or you just see the tank big box and they're like no it's legit my boy told me I'm like yeah you hit that over there I'll follow the ambulance for you if you got something out in this video hope you guys are smoking with net let me know what videos you want

it's been a great night here at dispensary night one of the things that I think is really important for people to understand and one of the questions that determine a lot that easy is what are the different companies and fix the different cannabinoids that exist in a cannabis place so what everyone needs to understand is that cannabis plant the ask over a hundred different chemical compounds that are known as cannabinoids and they all have different process you know the one kind of annoyed that girls people are familiar with its THC tetrahydrocannabinol but there are tons of them and when they work together we call that the entourage of fingers so if you take a look at this layout here they have put together a great display of many of the different symptoms that a person might present with and also specify different cannabinoids that may benefit those specific symptoms so one thing that you have to realize that when you're using cannabis it really matters what type of cannabinoids you're taking and in what amounts of THC CBD CBN CBG these are all cannabinoids that you should be educated about and understand how they work if your endogenous cannabinoids system one other point I want to make most people don't realize that we are all equipped with our own endogenous cannabinoids system we make our own cannabinoids to AG and Ananda mine are the cannabinoids that are produced in the human life so it's important for us to understand how this system work because has a ton of health benefits and I for one am very glad we're getting back to knowledge and understanding about this transition [Music] hi guys i'm daniel ramos with cannabis care we're one of the dispensaries down here in south florida we're growing we're closest dispensing to that we have here's in North Miami

hey guys why do you suck comment today special cuisine for you Vietnamese beef noodle soup or better known as uh now I just turned vegetarian about a month and a half ago so I'm gonna show you a vegetarian version of this famous recipe but I'm also gonna give you carnivores out there are some options now this is also very special because we're gonna be using miracle noodles my favorite noodle to you because they are zero calorie carps meat gluten-free and basically the best thing ever I have two packages a miracle noodle fettuccine along with a bunch of Guardian fresh vegetables now this is going a hundred percent organic because I actually just picked these five minutes ago alright let's get cooking so the key to successful beef noodle soup is in the broth we're gonna start out with four cups of vegetable broth or beef broth if you're not vegetarian and here's the cool part you're actually gonna take an onion and it slice it in half just like this and we're gonna char it over an open fire same thing with the ginger you want to slice it in half and char both sides as well and smells so good in your house then once they look like this them off and you're just going to scrape off that blocking this a little bit and then place it into your broth then next you're going to take some carrots four of them actually chop them all the way we're gonna boil that into the broth and finally you're gonna add a cinnamon stick just one and a few pieces of 7e so while your broth is boiling you're gonna want to get those miracle noodles ready they're so easy to you because you actually don't even have to cook the noodle they're already packaged through some water now you're gonna do is cut open the bag chase it in a sifter and then you're just going to rinse it out garden fresh herbs are my favorite you can't get any more on panics in this so the garnish we're gonna want to top up your green onions tiny little pieces it's gonna pick that basil pace with any plate along with the cilantro and our lemon finally you're gonna add some fresh bean sprouts for the wind now after a broth is boiled go ahead and take a sip and see if it's where you want it to be if it's not salty enough you can go ahead and add a teaspoon or two of soy sauce or some fish sauce depending on is your dietary meeting now for the protein if you're vegetarian I suggest buying some firm tofu you can get at any Asian food store and if you're a carnivore you've got your thin beef slices preferably geese I around I'm so excited the broth is finally done I can smell it smells so good I've got my miracle moon on the bottom of the bowl right here and I'm just gonna pour some broth in I cannot wait to eat this I'm really hungry I have not used it yet okay so I'm gonna make a bowl for me and a bowl for my dad because he likes to eat meat and we're gonna garnish now so I've got everything in the bowl let's go ahead and add some of that protein in here and lay these slices right on top maybe maybe okay there's an aisle of green onion so I'm gonna put a bunch of it in there fresh basil you just want to pick those leaves off just whoop I missed the ball and then cilantro again just pick those beads right off and because I love spice add music peppers in here some bean sprouts squeeze of lemon yeah I like mine really sour oops and forgot to add some boiled beef for the dad put right in there and then this is what really makes buffa it is the hoisin sauce and the Sri Racha okay and I'm going strong today I'm going to put a lot of hot sauce so a little bit of sweetness with that poison right on top beans I'll let my dad do his own and then a lot of Sri Racha Hopkins okay here's my first sight mmm that is spicy but that is really good thank you so much for tuning in to this

alright till next time bye guys [Music]", "ZFwypzTMdic": "hi everybody i'm kevin with candle science we get a lot of questions regarding candle making math calculating your fragrance oils determining how much wax you need for a project and so on if you find this to be a little bit difficult to wrap your head around you're not alone so let's go through this step by step the first thing you're going to need to do is determine how many candles you want to make of each fragrance so let's say we want to make six straight sided tumblers using our cactus flower and jade the next step is to determine how much each of those containers holds and for that you can reference our website now keep in mind you should always weigh your materials on a scale as opposed to measuring by volume or in fluid ounces we will list the wax weight for each container that we carry on the product page now that we know that each of these containers holds 8.5 ounces of wax by weight we can multiply that by the number of candles we're making in order to determine how much wax we need total so for this example 8.5 ounces times 6 is 51 ounces of wax so the next step is to determine how much fragrance oil you're going to need and that does get a little bit more complicated we recommend starting at a six percent fragrance load which is roughly one ounce of fragrance for every pound of wax but you can go higher depending on how much your wax can hold and you will always find this information listed on the product page for your wax once you decide on your fragrance oil percentage you can use that number to determine the overall amount of fragrance oil you're going to need for your project and no matter what the batch size this formula is always going to be the same you take your percentage of fragrance oil multiply that by your amount of wax and it's going to give you the amount of oil you need for your project now this is where the math gets a little bit intimidating so don't be afraid to pull out your phone or use a calculator to help you with some of this precise math you may find it easier to convert that percentage into a decimal first and to do that you just divide it by one hundred so six percent turns into point zero six if you're using seven percent it would be point zero seven eight percent point zero eight and so on and so forth but again for this example we're gonna stick with six percent so if you take that .06 and multiply it by the 51 ounces of wax that we need you're going to get 3.06 ounces of fragrance and that's the amount you need for your project now many scales will not be that precise with their calculation so it's okay to round up or down slightly but you're aiming for that 3.06 so now we know we need 51 ounces of wax for this project we need 3.06 ounces of fragrance and that's what we're going to use to pour these six straight sided tumblers well thanks for watching everybody i hope this video helps you to calculate the amount of wax and

buying carts off the black market knowing what you inhale into your body should be priority number one and when stepping into the realm of vaping you don't want to inhale something that's gonna harm you long term so today we want to put an end to all the pleasures out there regarding bad practice and to truly answer the question what is a fake oil cartridge and how to avoid [Music] they coil cards go beyond branding and counterfeit boxes the number one question you should be asking yourself is where am i buying my cards from most reputable companies have authorized retail stores that are allowed to sell their cartridges if you're buying from anywhere other than licensed reputable companies or their authorized retailers nine times out of ten it's a fake and companies that are legit aren't gonna risk selling products to non-leap States eBay Amazon Alibaba are not where they experience weavers goaded by high quality oils sure you can compare your boxes to the boxes on the website but unless you buy from the right site you can still get it wrong also if you're buying oils on a budget you're gonna run into the same problem a big red flag is recognizable big-name brands at low prices let's face it if you paid bunk prices you're gonna pay for bunk oils but how do people get ahold of big name brands and if it's the same cart how can it be fake that brings us to fake cartridge answer number one fake oils take these sell cartridges for example defconn action calm says that all seasaw cards must have two logos a serial number and a transparent rubber ring at the bottom of the cart this cartridge is everything a vapor should look for but I know for a fact that the oil inside is fake meaning that nothing's tested and they let the name brand to sell the cartridge for them to me this is black market plus most cards and boxes can just be bought online and some people think that if cartridges and boxes look legit then there's nothing stopping people from putting their own formula inside plus cartridges can just be a replica and they use cheap metals unless you have somebody you trust a source who tests their oils you never really know what's in it from a normal customer standpoint so what could be in here was they can put synthetics in there like k2 which is a huge deal you shouldn't do that oil thickener or anything that you usually wouldn't see on the cartridge unless your oils are solvent free distillates which indicates that the substances are environmentally friendly with no des lunes then you're gonna run into terpenes in PG you want to limit the amount that's put into your oils both drippings and PG act as carrying agents to carry more flavors into your discipline because distillate itself doesn't really have much flavor and no PG does not cause formaldehyde companies only use these agents to give it their own unique formula and it may also indicate on the stickers the percentages that they use but not always think about as buying mid grade versus Private Reserve but you still don't know what a fake oil cartridge is so what's a fake oil cartridge okay so you got your cleaning lab all set up you got your formula lock down and now you're ready to start filling it up cartridges can you just use any cartridge no no you cannot in January this year of 2019 a new California State law was passed calls phase Reena saving that all California cartridges must be lab tested for heavy metals these tests are specifically for for metals cadmium arsenic mercury and lead and phase threes testings limit is 0.5 parts per million of lead allowed in your oils this is a big deal for vape cartridge producers because unless you have glass pores cartridges contain metal and sometimes the exact same cartridge will pass in one lab and fail in another causing producers to just bypass testing all together just to make a quick buck also the price of testing in a lab has gone up so people are cheating the system by avoiding it entirely so why the variation of testing there is no standardized testing procedures for each lab to follow this means that each lab extracts oil differently and if oil touches exposed brass then it may very well fail phase 3 testing so how to metal get inside of your oil cartridges well that's easy 99% of companies buy cartridges from overseas which allow up to 4% of your oils to be made up of lead which is much higher tooth into what phase 3 wants and unless you're on top of your menu this could be a problem let an arsenic is added to metals like brass which help make metal easier to mold into cartridges and oil is acidic so it eats away at cheap metals allowing particles to be invaded into your body so stop giving people reasons to ban they don't become a victim of uncertainty unfortunately some companies don't want to know how the cartridge is made because they don't want to be how reliable and there's just too much money to be made not to get inside of the oil cartridge market we can't change state law or lab test procedures but we sure can certainly change babe cartridges there are companies out there that are responding to the issue companies like Herve pur have already started innovating carts that are guaranteed to pass phase three testing and multiple facilities and are currently leaving the market who completely lead-free cartridges that vetted testing facilities in California that know how to properly test for phase three requirements the next generation of VAP cartridges might be hidden stores in winter time this year but keep in mind that cartridges made before January 1st 2018 are still allowed to be sold and could still be in circulation and states like Washington and have passed similar laws only allowing 0.7 parts per million so be aware of your state's requirements I know it seems like a lot but now you're in the know and knowing is half the battle so please no more black market cards we hope this video was helpful to you guys let us know what you'd like to see in the next video where do you buy your loyal cards did you know that metal could be in it as always don't forget to subscribe and like and we'll see you next time

THANKS EVERYONE AT NUW", "7QGnaSdRxk8": "(upbeat music) - Hey guys, Cassey here, and welcome to another\nepisode of Cheap Clean Eats. I'm so excited to be reading\nall your responses on YouTube. You really love these series and so do I. So I'm glad I can keep cooking and eating. So, today we're gonna make\na very famous French dessert or breakfast, I suppose the crepe. So what you're gonna need\nis one egg, 15 cents, one teaspoon of cinnamon, 2\ncents, one banana 19 cents at Trader Joe's, one third\ncup of oats, 12 cents, a quarter cup of almond milk, 5 cents, a serving or a pinch of Stevia, 10 cents and four strawberries for\n20 cents, totaling 83 cents. That is insane, so guys\nready to make this? And for those of you that\ndon't actually like bananas because there was an extremely\nabsurd amount of people who didn't like bananas on the last video, you can actually sub this\nfor a mango or persimmon or something with kind\nof the same consistency. So, no complaints let's make crepes. Okay, so first we're\ngonna blend up your oats. You can actually buy them\nblended, or you can do it yourself like how I am right now. And I'm just putting it on\nmy little magic bullet here. But you can use a food\nprocessor or whatever. Close your ears. (magic bullet whirling) (lively music) (magic bullet whirling) Look at that finally ground\noat, isn't it pretty? Now we're gonna add all the\ndry ingredients together. I have a bit of cinnamon,\nI'm gonna put this in right there, bam, I love cinnamon. Well I guess that was\nall the dry ingredients. Now we're gonna have the wet ingredients, so you're gonna have half a banana. So I'm just gonna cut it here. So it doesn't have to\nbe a ripen and banana, but if it is, it'll just\nmake it a lot sweeter. And the almond milk, now, if\nyou don't like almond milk, you're allergic to nuts, you\ncan use soy milk, dairy milk, or any other type of non-dairy milk. So, in it goes, put one egg. So can you use one egg with a yolk or if you're against\nyolks for some reason, you can actually just use two egg whites. (egg shell cracking) There it goes, so we're\njust gonna blend it up. This is gonna make it really fine for me. Close your ears again. (magic bullet whirling)\n(lively music) Okay, so now we have your batter. See how nice and fine and\nbeautiful, and it smells amazing. All right, now, before we\nactually make the crepes, we're going to chop up your strawberries and any other fruit you wanna put inside. So I chose strawberries and bananas today. So that's where I'm gonna use\nthe other half of the banana. So here we go. (lively music) Now, I'm just gonna chop up your banana. (lively music) All righty, we have our fruits all cut up. We have our batter made, so let's go ahead and finish up this\nbaby, we're almost done. It's so easy, so cheap, and so clean. So grab your nonstick\npan, really important that it's nonstick, because you\nain't gonna have any crepes. If it's all sticking on your\npan and you're gonna grab a Pam spray or just some kind\nof coconut oil or something, lightly spray your pan right there. And then this is the moment of truth. We are going to pour\nthe batter on this pan. So, I'm gonna estimate that\nwe're probably gonna have about three or four crepes\nor something like that. Make sure it's on low, medium heat. Mm, I feel that, all right,\nguys, so let's pour this on. And you wanna make sure\nit's just a thin layer because crepes are extremely thin. So, see how I have this on here? I'm just gonna wiggle it around\nso that it actually fills up the whole area of this\npan, it's nice and thick so that it's actually going to hold. Okay, and we're just gonna\nleave it there and wait. (lively music) So once you start to see bubbles forming. It is time to flip the crepe,\nokay guys, I'm gonna flip it. I'm gonna flip it, the\nlast time I did this was in Boston when I\nwas making my oatcake, and luckily it actually\nfell right back in. I don't know what's\ngonna happen right now. So, I'm gonna pray, here we go. So I remember last time it was\nlike a little bit of a lunge. It was like a front and\na quick back, here we go. Oh yeah, halfway, we'll\nget the next one, wee! Okay, so you know what that means? It means I didn't believe in myself. And when I don't believe in myself, you only get the job\nhalf done, half right. So the next one, I promise\nyou, I will get all the way in, vine yourself doing the\npancake or the crepe flip. That's really hard though, how\nwould I vine myself flipping? That's just really hard, okay,\nso, it looks like it's done. So let's slide that on here,\nlook how beautiful it is. Look at it, all nice and perfect. So we're gonna go ahead\nand make a couple more. (lively music) All right, guys, this is my last chance. I think I can do this. Okay, just believe, it's\nnice and flippy, and slippy. Here we go. (upbeat music) Yeah, look at that, mm, mm. Me, I did it, that's right,\ncrepe flipping queen. Mm-hmm, all right, so let\nit sit for a little bit. I'm so proud of myself. See, when you just believe in\nyourself, you can do anything. Whether you're working out, or\ncooking, or flipping crepes, it's all the same principle,\nso I think that's done and we have three\nbeautiful, totally clean, wholesome crepes, ready to\nfill up the fresh fruit. Okay guys, so I have three little craves that I'm gonna fill up,\nso, we place it right here. And now if you wanna\nadd like a Greek yogurt or peanut butter or something,\nfeel free to do that. Today, I'm not gonna do that. All I'm gonna do is fill\nit up with my freshly cut strawberries and bananas. Mm, a little bit more, okay, super cool. Then we're just gonna wrap\nit up like a little burrito, awesome and flip them over. Okay, we've got two more to go. (lively music) All right guys here are our little crepes. Look they look like sleeping babies, and we can pat them, aw. So at this point, what\nyou can do to dress it, is add a pinch of Stevia, right on top. It doesn't add any calories. If you want that extra\nsweetness, you can go for that. But if you wanna go crazy, let\nme tell you what you can do. We can add three dollops of Greek yogurt. This is your percent\nnon-fat, Greek yogurt. I'm using Chobani today,\nI've also tried Fage and yes, you pronounce it\nFage, I think not Fage. And I've also tried\nthe Trader Joe's brand. I kind of like Chobani\nbecause it is a little bit extra creamy, mm, okay,\nand the exciting part, we're gonna add some honey\ndrizzle, big Z shape. Oh, yeah, look at that. Mm-hmm, honey drizzle, oh man. Okay, so before I do the taste\ntest, we have to talk about how many calories this\nis, versus a normal crepe you would eat at, I don't\nknow, Ihop, Denny's, the mall, whatever, wherever\nyou get your crepes. So my crepes here today,\nminus the Greek yogurt and the honey drizzle, because\nthat is totally optional. 250 calories and no added\nsugar, which is amazing, and also this costs 83 cents. So guess how many calories this\nis, at the mall or whatever? It's about 360, so it's\nnot that many calories off, but the sugars, those\nare all sugars added, all kinds of crazy stuff\nthat you don't even know. And those are like 899, if you're lucky. So you're saving a ton of money, and you're eating all natural ingredients. So, are you ready for this taste test? Can wait to eat this, and\na banana right on top. Okay, this is the moment of truth. (lively music) Oh, my goodness guys, that was\nso crazy, it was so amazing. Can you believe three of these crepes. Three of these crepes are\n260 calories altogether. No added sugar, 83 cents. I don't even understand right now. You need to go make this for your mommy. You need to go make this for your daddy and make it for everybody in your family because no one will believe\nyou that this is so clean, it's so healthy, and so cheap. Guys, let me know in the comments below, what you want to see me, healthify next. And the one with the most thumbs up, will be the recipe that will be chosen. All right, until then eat\nwell, because I'm watching you. Bye.

social media platforms on my ig as well as my facebook into the next video see you soon", "NHkPY56tyKQ": "hey guys I got a lot of requests to make a video explaining how Florida's milligram allowance works for their medical marijuana program and I wanted to try to tackle that in this video with as much information as I could and try to answer some common questions that I see throughout the reddit as well as on YouTube comments and stuff like that for out-of-state patients who are transferring their records to a Florida doctor the fees are a lot more expensive here and unfortunately we don't have as much access as a lot of the other states do that being said our program has grown and continues to grow and as we pass certain milestones for how many patients are on the registry we'll have more access to new dispensaries new grow houses and hopefully opportunities for new cannabis products if you move from a state where they didn't have the milligram limit before this might all be new to you so I want to try to explain it when you get your recommendation the doctor sets the allowance for your REC at the time of entering you into the registry so they could choose it based off of your condition any number of factors I wouldn't worry about this too much as places like doc MJ give you the full 14,000 milligram allowance without making you jump through hoops some doctors recommend milligrams based on your condition though so do a little research before you go in and pay your fees and everything try to see which doctor you're going to so some general questions that I see a lot throughout the forum patients who've gotten less than a 6,000 milligram allowance that wish to increase it you just have to call your doctor most of them don't charge for this but unfortunately some will and this is what I mean about doing research before you go in doc MJ as far as I understand doesn't charge to increase your recommendation so if you call them up they'll just go into their computer and increase your rec at any time supposedly for free other doctors do charge for this and I have seen kind of what I'd say like horror posts of patients who have to then pay to transfer documents to a new doctor have that new doctor give them a higher rec it's ridiculous that holds how many milligrams is each product deduct so each product truly dispensaries will have the milligrams right on the top or somewhere on the box the unfortunate thing now is that these little 250 milligram vapes or even the six hundreds they deduct the full six hundred or full 250 even though we all know these are cut with MCT oil extra terpenes and it's not a full two hundred and fifty milligrams of say active ingredient so that's a little confusing as far as I'm concerned I'd like to see them accurately tally it out on this true flower cup it says seven hundred and forty five point five milligrams of THC and I have other ones that have said larger and even less amounts so that actually does vary based on the batch amount I guess I'd like to see maybe just more accuracy in the smaller cartridges I don't know I'm just frustrated with those concentrate distill it can be dispensed as oral or inhalation yes distill it can be dispenses oral if you have like say a really large inhalation purchase if you're getting a lot of true flower or something like that you can ask them to dispense that under oral and they can do the math for you at the dispensary to let you know how much it's gonna deduct from your account if you are on an allowance budget through the state you know some miscellaneous questions and answers the best cart storage method for cartridges you have to keep them upright that's the that's pretty much the most important if you have the little Mystica battery vape that's pretty easy because it has a flat bottom just keep it upright at all times whenever you can pens just try to lean them up against something or even keep the cartridge in the box I've also heard Weis tales that if you screw and unscrew the cartridges too much it'll start to leak product something like that so be a little cautious if you have enough batteries try to keep the cartridge on the battery as long as you can so you don't unscrew it and screw it back on so much also keep them out of the Sun I think that's a pretty easy one as well they don't need to get too hot you don't want them to get too cold though so don't keep them like you know in the fridge or something we yeah so that's pretty much it for this video I wanted to give you guys a little sneak peek for what's coming next but I don't have it filmed yet I'll just tell you I'm gonna be doing some cooking videos so if you guys want to see me get my baked on come back and stay tuned hit the subscribe button if you want to see me try abs and all these different kinds of devices I have one of those videos and the works as well I'm trying to get as many devices as I can from all the different kinds of dispensaries to show you guys what they all do and how they all work just kind of stay tuned keep up and I'll have some more stuff coming out for you soon leave more questions in the comments below

investments we make in program and service development we also serve the regulatory community with whom we have a unique and important relationship those relationships have helped us create meaningful new products and modern technology solutions like the openidl platform for regulatory reporting and advances in machine learning and ai to improve the compliance process on occasion we are asked by regulators to solve a particular problem for an emerging risk like the growing cannabis market whether you are for or against the legalization of cannabis more and more state legislatures are legalizing medical and recreational use creating a whole new industry with unique risks and exposures in 2018 we were approached by the california department of insurance to develop policy language for qualifying cannabis companies so we did in fact our cannibal policy form is the first of its kind in the market and we're proud to now have our program approved in california colorado and nevada and we're seeking approval in numerous other states as the laws and risks evolve it's important for carriers to stay current on the issues in this market as they develop that's why we've assembled a terrific panel of leading experts to join us today to discuss the growing cannabis market and the insurance industry's response in our next session you'll hear from randy elias a partner in the global law firm of porter wright morris and arthur and chair of the excess surplus lines and reinsurance committee of the american bar association she'll be joined by rich goals a lead risk consultant in aeon's cannabis and hemp resource group and our own phil skaggs assistant council and one of the architects of cannaba so now i'd like to hand over the reins to our moderator joe jonas commercial alliance product manager at aais who will take us into the weeds of the cannabis market joe john thanks for the introduction and i want to reiterate that we really are privileged to have such strong panelists here that that truly represent a cross section of the industry but before we can dive into the subject matter i'm of course obligated to provide uh our legal disclaimer so cannabis is a sticky subject which is why the opinions expressed during this presentation are for informational purposes only and solely those of the presenters they should not be construed as legal or professional advice or the official position of aais its members partners or sponsors so now that the formalities are out of the way um i'd love to jump right in because we we really have a lot of content to cover so i'd actually like to start the panel discussion off with two pressing issues right now politics and the pandemics i promise i won't hit the trifecta with a question on on religion but seriously taking aside any personal political leanings where are we now in terms of legislation at the federal level and if we are potentially looking at a regime change you know what does that mean for for cannabis and i'd love to start with one of our guests uh first randy if if you could kick us off sure um i'm happy to and thanks for having me um so in terms of a regime change right now based on what we're seeing out of the democratic platform i don't know that we're going to see a sea change in what the legislation looks like um right now what biotin hara seems to be supporting is a decriminalization of marijuana which is different from a legalization of marijuana in terms of decree decriminalization usually relates to personal use personal possession those types of things doesn't remove cannabis from schedule one of the controlled substances act so all of the anti-money laundering stats statutes that you know prohibit unlawful act you know financial transactions relating to unlawful activity would still apply and all of the same so all the same federal statutes relating to banking relating to the insurance industry really wouldn't be impacted at least not with what uh the platform currently stands rich any any thoughts absolutely i think that's a great point randy um you know any federal action that either legalizes cannabis or specifically protect protects financial institutions uh serving the cannabis industry i i think would certainly make a a big difference in terms of access to banking participation and insurance i'm not sure we're seeing anything like that in the current democratic platform uh you know the one caveat that i'd add there is that any sort of action would need to be very very clear uh in terms of how it relates to state law for really for a strong impact on the insurance industry to be felt uh if we look at kind of the u.s hemp and cbd industry at the moment there is still a an enormous lack of capacity and participation by the largest admitted insurers uh really as a result of the incongruity between uh federal guidance and state law around cbd so despite the farm bill making it legal uh really still not seeing a lot of participation so any sort of action uh in order for it to have a you know a a large impact on the insurance industry i think would need to be very very clear phil you know any any further thoughts that you know kind of round out the the answers here or yeah i i will know that we do we're looking at four kind of major contenders uh bills that are kind of winding their way through committees and uh from the house and the senate um the safe banking act uh the states act the claim act and the more act of those i think the claim act would have the most impact on on the insurance industry it specifically provides some safe harbor for insurers looking to participate in this space um but again yeah to echo randy and rich's comments you know there's not a lot of hope that either one of these will be championed by either of the uh current platforms of the of the presidential candidates um we're really looking at you know whether or not there's going to be a a a change in leadership in the senate uh and and a continued um democratic lead in the in the house for their need to be considered um you know discussion on the senate floor and a vote and actually i could just pick up on something that phil just said um you know i think a few weeks ago there has been in places you guys know um an amendment to the federal budget since 2013 that you know prohibits the doj from spen you know spending federal funding to prosecute um medical marijuana transactions that are in compliance with the state law in the states in which you know those businesses are operating a couple of weeks ago and the house and last year as well you know the house passed a bill that expanded that to include all legal marijuana transactions you know both both medical and recreational so you know to pick up on phil's point if you if we see a change in congress um you know you may you may see something more along those lines like a half measure and then whether or not um a prohibition against spending federal funding to prosecute uh transactions involving recreational marijuana may or may not depend on whether or not the congress has sufficient votes to override a veto yeah good point so you know i i think uh uh certainly a political shift is gonna impact cannabis at the federal level but but what are we seeing now and what will we be saying in in the near future at at the state level i can i can lead off on that so um there's two two paths to state legalization there's ballot initiatives and then legislation um and this refresher there's only 23 states that allow citizen initiated ballot um initiatives so the majority of states require action legislative action in order to create a ballot question or legalize cannabis um leading in to 2020 we there were over a dozen states that were considering ballot initiatives and now we're looking at less than half that about five states that could legalize this this november um five adult use and three medical um yeah i realize that that's that's more than seven i'll explain in a minute so arizona uh is considering an adult use option uh mississippi has two medical ballot questions um montana has two recreational ballot questions new jersey has an adult use question and then south dakota has um competing medical and adult use ballot questions which is actually the first state to consider both lines of legalization at the same time but thanks to covid or not thanks to kova there's we've seen suspended or failed ballot initiatives in florida idaho north dakota uh missouri oklahoma nebraska and arkansas nebraska actually just recently there was a supreme court decision that took the ballot that the approved ballot initiative off the ballot um due to some some technicalities and then on the other side of that with the there's the actual legislative approach in 20 in 2020 there were dozens of cannabis policy reform bills that were introduced um even in states that had previously been vehemently opposed to legalization or decriminalization and a large number of those bills seemed really you know primed for passage that is of course until coveted hit um and many uh legislators were forced to convene early and the bills were postponed or effectively killed so um alabama and kentucky had two medical cannabis bills that were looked like they were going to pass but then they were they were derailed um and connecticut also had a governor sponsored bill that was uh eventually killed because of the premature legislative adjournment there are a handful that did manage to squeeze by including most notably virginia which which decriminalized cannabis this past may a big step for a previously red state um and then vermont there were two separate bills passed by the state senate and house to finally legalize and regulate sales which is notable because vermont actually legalized canada's use two years ago so it took them that long to actually create a cannabis market to piggybac back off that phil um i think any sort of initiative being considered or or much less passing is uh is obviously you know very strong progress uh in terms of the uh sort of journey towards you know 50 state legalization but i think it's really important to consider what the actual bills are doing in any given state because it drastically drastically affects the market size so for example illinois only had about 100 000 medical cannabis patients uh prior to the adult use bill taking effect on jan 1 of this year which is obviously a far cry from the millions of adults that can now walk into a dispensary legally um you know at the same time the licensing structure in illinois is very limited compared to other states for example oklahoma which has some of the the more liberal uh licensing and what that does is constrain supply it increases prices uh and if we're you know determining how big the market is and how large the resulting insurance opportunity is i think it's really important to take a look at the exact uh proposals in each effort because they they could absolutely drastically affect the size of the industry interesting randy any any any thoughts yeah i mean i think phil emerich covered it i mean just from a you know 10 000 foot view i think what's going to be interesting is to see how these states implement if if any of them if any of them any of the ballot initiatives are successful how they how they implement uh the statutes and the regulations i mean i think there's obviously here in illinois a an intersection between um between the legalization and the racial justice component the social justice component of the statutes and you know given everything that's happened in the news this summer around that it's going to be interesting to see whether other states pick that up and how that plays into the licensing requirements yeah for sure i think we'll uh i'll be keeping an eye on that and i think we also could all agree it's definitely going to be an interesting next few months uh probably even more interesting next four years but but shifting our focus to the reason where we're conducting this webinar over over over zoom uh let me ask about the the pandemic effect whether perceived or real on on the cannabis industry i'm hearing conflicting reports about the impact of cobit 19 on cannabis businesses some sources are predicting massive losses um others are reporting record-breaking consumer-demanded sales you know each of you has a unique perspective so what are you seeing um and how do you reconcile the the inconsistent reporting i'd be happy to kick that off again i think my outlook for the campus industry remains very positive despite the scattered reports and predictions of the contrary i think the numbers are largely in at this point and evidence suggests that the market is is resilient and worthy of that essential business designation bestowed upon it by many states in the early months of the pandemic i think some of the early concerns and reasons for negative predictions were based primarily on you know uncertainty of for what for cover 19 and the pandemic in general but then also predictions that americans would some for somehow switch from a legal market to the illicit market as budgets tightened but i think what we saw actually was um that that analysis failed to account for one you know the trust that um many consumers now have in the cannabis market um there's a lot of regulation and a lot of quality assurance in legalized cannabis um and so that you know they're smaller still scattered reports of tainted products or you know blood tenders uh licking joints that kind of thing there is still a very solid consistency with the cannabis products being produced where not so much on the illicit market also excuse me i think large groups of americans um just don't have access to the illicit market like like it might be uh anticipated um so that's it's kind of a leap to just assume that everyone's going to switch as soon as um their budgets dry up also there have been reports of people switching from recreational to medical to avoid the higher taxes and receive priority for purchases as supply was was an issue in the early days of of cannabis um of the chronovirus and then also there was some a little bit there's a little bit of hoarding behavior cannabis was seen as this essential commodity to have similar toilet paper uh for for many americans so i think um the early predictions just failed to account for all of that um i can jump in too i i think that maybe some uh some of what the disparity relates to is a little bit of a capital crunch and so and smaller businesses are getting caught in the federal illegality versus being named essential businesses by the states and so what you're seeing i think of some of those smaller entities who are having financial difficulties and that's making it um you know easier for some of the larger players to come in maybe and take them over or for those smaller entities to go out of business so i think maybe you're seeing you are seeing a contraction of the market in some respects interesting rich yeah no i agree with everything that's been said that i mean i think we're we're certainly seeing uh the uncertainty take effect in terms of uh you know a bit of a slowdown in investment uh but overall i don't think the cannabis industry has been harmed nearly as much as other businesses uh and you know uh speaking out on the insurance side you know one implication that we're seeing uh businesses may be a little bit less protected going forward in terms of their business income uh seeing a couple markets that are specific to cannabis uh pair back or remove that offering altogether uh others are adding you know very specific covet 19 or disease exclusions uh so that that could be a sort of residual effect going forward uh but there hasn't been a a total withdrawal of insurance capacity from uh that coverage so i i think the uh you know the the damage will be fairly minimal as long as uh brokers and their clients take a proactive approach yeah actually that's a that's a nice transition there mentioning insurance um one of our favorite topics at aeis um it's really been well established or at least i i think so that there is is no silver bullet when it comes down to structuring cannabis insurance programs can each of you speak to what you think is is often overlooked with respect to insurance coverage of course and how the different types of cannabis operations um in in the distribution chain lends itself to one coverage word or another and rich i'll i'll kind of let you kick that one off absolutely well i think in the cannabis industry the insurance products very very clearly follow uh sort of the pattern of you get what you pay for uh and i think many cannabis businesses uh you know unless you have a dedicated risk manager with experience in other industries uh you're in growth mode and insurance is a box that you need back to make sure you can uh move on to what are more considered more pressing activities uh so when that happens and you're really trying to check the box uh for you know the the minimal premium amount i think there are a lot of pitfalls you can run into and some of the the most common that i'd mention are uh your health hazard or specified disease exclusion on your products liability policy uh you certainly pay a lot more to have a policy that has a less restrictive uh endorsement like that uh you know certain other coverages that that just are really difficult to obtain uh spoilage for your products product contamination uh cyber uh you know related to the the collection of customer data and the dispensary you know all of these things uh may be available in the marketplace but i i think are are often overlooked uh when insurance is you know sort of taking a back seat to other items to focus on during rapid expansion um there's two items i think that i've been um thinking about recently one is blood tender liability or more specifically you know professional liability versus general liability your typical general liability policy provides coverage for all company operations including the non-professional negligent acts of company employees but there's no coverage for the rendering of or failure to render a professional service and there are you know decades of litigation concerning the scope of what is considered a professional service smaller generally doesn't mean product instruction warnings there's at least some argument it includes specific recommendations or related to the treatment of a medical condition so i think the question remains you know where is that line between being a store clerk and being a can of pharmacist um i'm aware of at least one case in every one in a case but an issue in colorado from 2018 where there's some concern over blood tenders making recommendations to consumers regarding the applications of cannabis to treat pregnancy-related morning sickness and you can just see how that would snowball into all kinds of um liability issues um the other the other issue that i that i i've been thinking about again to echo rich is that is the cyber and data security risks i just want to uh underscore that you know the campus industry is without a doubt just very profitable and flush with new and inexperienced businesses and it's also a treasure trove of private data so for these reasons it's kind of a target for cyber crime and i think the one place where i'm seeing a coverage gap is really on the hemp side um and not the marijuana side and on the grower cultivator side so hemp is legal um but you know they sort of still haven't gotten their arms entirely around how to regulate it and the usda is regulating it now you know there is a there is an accepted level of thc or 8.3 by dry weight um it is hard for a grower or cultivator to grow their crop and be able to guarantee that it's going to meet be under that threshold level and if it exceeds the threshold crop has to be destroyed and as far as i am aware there really is no coverage for that right now nobody's taking that off yeah and interesting and and i and i've heard professional liability mentioned uh a bud tender in in insurance so to speak you know one thing i've been hearing in the marketplace um from from a variety of sources whether it's insureds um or or brokers like rich dno um directors and officers is increasingly hard to procure you know randy did do you have any any any feelings on on why that's the case um i think of the emerging claims that you're seeing in this uh industry is on the dno side um you're seeing you know revenue productions um you're seeing sales productions and i think shareholders are are seizing on those comments um and saying well you didn't you didn't make what you said you were going to make so you know that's a dno claim right there um you know and it's just um you know it's kind of a new place for uh plaintiff's council to play in that in that space and so it's making it hard to get dno coverage and i think that's making it hard to get deals done to some extent sure rich you know i know being on the consulting side that's a that's an issue that you're facing um when trying to to offer a complete risk management solution for for insureds any any thoughts on on the dno issue no i don't know that dno is necessarily overlooked i i just think that uh you know most clients look at the price of it and it it's just uh it is not stomachable um there are so few markets that are writing dno coverage for cannabis risks uh and and again you know like all the other coverages very much follow the pattern if you get what you pay for uh and to get you know any sort of decent coverage it costs an arm and a leg uh unless you're a you know a publicly traded company or maybe a large private with a lot of investors i i think you you know you probably look at the price once and say okay i'll you know try again in a couple of years unless my exposures change yeah you mentioned a a limited pool of of carriers uh playing in in the dno market uh or at least right now um but there's a relatively limited pool of carriers in in the industry or offering any type of cannabis coverage for that matter we see a lot of excessive surplus lines participants frankly 95 probably but the market some of the projections i've seen um upwards of 30 billion dollars by 2025. why isn't there as much enthusiasm given the market share um is it is it the stigma is it traditionally uh you know insurance is a conservative industry is it just frankly an educational shortcoming um you know randy i'll i'll i'll go back to you on that question i mean from my perspective i think i think a lot of it has to do with just the continued federal illegality and the inability to predict where that's gonna go um i think if you talk to a lot of the pricing actuaries they say well i could price it you know we're getting to a point in the market where i kind of have a sense of i can i can price it i know what the exposures are you can't really price for you know the political outcome so i think people are kind of in a wait and see mode uh absolutely to to echo that uh the number one reason that uh that i hear uh from the the larger admitted markets in the us is the federal status um and you know i think many of them are are absolutely aware of the opportunity and the potential for rapid growth uh but may not be seeing you know enough of it now or consider it a large enough opportunity uh to risk running afoul of federal law um so i you know i do think uh as we we mentioned in the first question uh something like like safe banking uh something that specifically names the insurance industry uh as being protected in serving cannabis risks i think that'll go a very long way and of course then there you know there are the challenges of raiding etc uh when everything is accessing surplus now and there's not really uh much available uh publicly uh however i i do see the the federal laws as by far the primary driver of the lack of participation so we we a lot in in this space i mean do you have any any thoughts yeah i think i'd echo a lot of what randy and richard said just maybe stated differently you know it's all kind of interrelated and all stems from that federal um prohibition uh there's you know there's a fear of reputational risks there's you know the the the yes there is rapid growth but sometimes that can even you know just very um you know by itself there's the lack of public loss data and then also a lack of you know specialized knowledge even within the insurance industry about as we've discussed there's these gaps and the things that that we didn't consider early on or maybe missing now um as as we create policies or try to adapt current policies to the market um and of course uh there's also the lack of reinsurance participation which it all flows from from the top so to speak uh when when reinsurers don't want to get into a space that means that carriers are kind of constrained with with their capacity yeah you know appetite and capacity um certainly certainly an issue um you know rich i i know that you you dabble in in reinsurance and and work closely with with some of your colleagues at aeon can you provide something on on the landscape of of the reinsurance market yeah absolutely absolutely so you know following the primary side it is very very limited um i i'd say there are about five reinsurance companies that that will actively entertain cannabis risks uh and again the the primary driver there is the uh the the federal law um i do think when you get to the reinsurance side as well there is a a little bit more reputational risk uh being considered than on the primary side with you know much smaller pool of reinsurers uh so i think that's that's a major driver as well uh but really just an extremely limited landscape from top to bottom uh and i i think you know to just to add to sort of uh the the previous comment i i think one thing i find really interesting is that markets that have gotten past the uh the federal law uh it seems that they're you know not really concerned with the underlying exposure of cannabis uh as much you know for example there are markets out there who do write cannabis risks but not hemp risks uh and they actually say because they like the increased regulatory scrutiny around the cannabis industry and if we look at the operations of the cannabis industry you know i don't think they're inherently that risky compared to you know many of the other industries these markets actively write insurance for um so it just continues to be the uh the federal law kind of driving from top to bottom uh the lack of carrier participation both on the reinsurance primary side yeah you know i i've heard that you know reinsurers when when you know some of these these entities or carriers are approaching re-insurers reinsurers want to see well call me in five years when when i've got a better handle on on pricing and and uh and claims you know with with two lawyers on on the panel you know can you talk to some of the the issues around claims is it is it just the fact that there's not enough litigation to to really start establishing trends or is is the industry just not mature enough and um phil thoughts yeah i think both of those things um you know the claims we have been seeing uh the the litigation surrounds you know nuisance issues and and in fighting between campus businesses we're not seeing the the the large number of personal injury actions that we were initially anticipating seeing when cannabis was in its its early legalization stages um and yeah it's just uh yeah i'll also i'll leave it there right randy yeah i mean i i think that's right i think you know any time anytime you get into a new industry right it takes a certain amount of time for people to even understand what types of claims are going to come out of that industry and i think you know and when cannabis industries sort of first got going like you know you kind of had it in your head okay there's going to be products liability claims clearly um you know there's going to be there's going to be crime there's going to be cyber but like for example the dna claims that we've been talking about i don't think anybody really anticipated those um to the extent that they have begun to emerge um the professional liability claims that you know phil was talking about with the bud candors and oh like if i recommend this particular product to you you know what kind of a representation am i making and in what capacity am i making that representation i think these are things that people probably didn't think about initially and so you're seeing the reinsurers kind of wait to have that be more developed before they stick their toes in a little deeper yeah no i i i certainly agree and i see where we're approaching uh the the conclusion of of of our segment and and of course we'll be we'll be engaging with our attendees um you know hopefully they'll uh there'll be some some some good questions because i know there was a lot of really good uh really good content here but before i i conclude you know i'd i'd love you know each of you to to talk about maybe high level something that we didn't cover um or what it what is your individual organization doing in the industry um that might be different um from some of your competitors rich sure sure uh so i i think uh that aion is certainly one of the the largest global brokerages that is actively serving cannabis clients in the us uh certainly a lot of competitors out there but uh tends to be smaller more localized and i think that uh you know is is an effect of the cannabis industry being smaller and more localized there you know obviously interstate commerce is is highly restricted uh there's not a lot of economy of scale you know expanding across states et cetera uh so i i think that's what really differentiates aeon is just the uh the amount of resources that we have available uh and can bring to the industry uh but you know at the same time i think we are going to uh like every other brokerage out there uh sort of you know leave the clients wanting more uh because all of the products you know as you mentioned at the beginning joe there uh there's really not a silver bullet available to the industry uh there's such a lack of capacity placement is very very difficult uh and i think that that's pretty true no matter where you are in the industry and what your operations look like or even your size and scope um and you know just a closing thought to kind of leave with the audience here is uh the landscape is so limited that you know if you're an insurance carrier and considering getting into this space uh there's definitely a niche for you to play it um there uh there really is is just a need for capacity on on nearly every single product line and uh and even at you know rates that are significantly higher than other industries completely agree randy coming from uh a legal perspective any any any parting thoughts and you know is is your firm um you know doing or differentiating itself in in the market space yeah i mean corduroy um we we have a cannabis practice it's really obviously a multi-disciplinary practice there are a lot of different areas of the law that come into interplay and i think we've got a good group of people together to kind of give a holistic view of you know the risks and and that kind of stuff um i would say you know from an insurance perspective i work i obviously work a lot in the with the insurance industry and you know what what i think clients need to be mindful of is we've talked a lot about the federal law and the uncertainty of federal law and i talked a lot about the fact that even in the states where cannabis is legal the regulatory regimes are constantly evolving at this point and so you know when you're looking at it um from an operational perspective i think you know you sort of never want to enter into an area that you operationally can't handle um and right now i would say there is a lot of space to play like we're just saying but you also want to make sure you don't get your systems and your processes so entrenched that you can't adjust to to what's happening in in the states or at the federal level yeah and i'll and i'll echo i don't want to you know steal phil's thunder but i will echo um that that there is plenty of place to spend plenty of space to play um and if carriers are considering um delving into the market there's there's some unique opportunities but you know phil um yeah i just want to understand in space states will the states are going to continue to push forward with legalization and regulation regardless of what the federal government does um you can't unexplode the cannabis industry at this point um i think the fact that that fact you know taken together with the fact that the canvas industry has not been as negatively impacted by the pandemic as we initially anticipated and most gates actually appear to be booming and also the fact that the insurance industry has and will continue to be itself negatively impacted by the pandemic it seems like cannabis is really shaping up to be an attractive opportunity or a lifeline really for some carriers um you know as we continue to move past potentially the phobias reputational risk and federal uncertainty and complexities of state-specific um regs i think campus insurance is an underrated niche and is particularly ripe maybe now more than ever for increased carrier participation totally agree phil it's it's a rare growth opportunity in in today's marketplace yeah i i i think al all four of us can can certainly agree on that point and with that with that being said um you know thank you to the to the panel uh we're sticking around to to answer any any questions so looking forward to uh to some dialogue with our attendees [Music] i'm happy to welcome back our panel of experts for uh for a q a session hello again everyone and i would like to just remind the audience to submit your questions using the form just below the screen and we'll post them to our panel live and we have we already have some some great questions and randy i'll i'll start off with you the question being posed is what is either being done or it needs to be done regarding the black market undermining the owners who are conducting all the necessary testing etc it seems that the illegal operations get away with murder and the legal operations are are getting hit by laws and regulations yeah this is a great question and this is obviously a problem that they've been having out in california too which was the first admitted market um you know i think i think a couple things need to be done i think that the insurance departments need to recognize that this is an issue for for admitting markets for enos markets who are writing in the space and they need to give those markets the flexibility to address their ratings um and i think honestly i think the carriers who want to who want to get into the space have to think about dealing not just with the department of insurance but sort of um interdisciplinary with the governments to to see what they can do to resolve the problem and that and to and to work together excellent rich yeah i totally agree uh and i you know i think the the black market is is a huge challenge because there's economic incentive to participate in the black market spill uh california is a great example where they're you know very very high taxes on recreational or medical legal marijuana uh and and very high regulations so as long as there's sort of that incentive for consumers to continue accessing the black market uh i think they're going to so you know unfortunately i don't really think it's on the legal market at the moment uh to really do anything to become competitive with the black market uh it's the lack of competition in many states that's sort of driven uh by the the state regulations themselves uh and until we see you know some of those loosen you know less taxes less regulation that makes things expensive and burdensome uh i think we'll consider continue to see a black market um and that being said you know there is a lot of enforcement action you know in all legal states the uh the police are out there taking down illegal grows we see it every year in uh uh in mendo in california um i know also weed maps for example was pressured by the state a bit to remove some of the unlicensed countries from their platform uh so there is enforcement action but i i don't think that's ever really going to uh to tackle the issue uh which is you know sort of the uncompetitiveness in many states of the legal market phil yeah i know that uh you've spoken to this point and certainly it's you know part of the kanab rules and regulations and abiding by um those rules and regs what what what are your thoughts yeah this is one of those those growing pains that we talk about all the time in the cannabis industry there's so many things that you know need to be worked out as every state you know begins to create a legalized market and you know one of the things we see time and time again in a newly legalized market is a sudden rise and then a gradual fall of the illicit products and sales as law enforcement is able to reprioritize and re-strategize and consumers become also more comfortable with the market so i think you know there's there's no one answer to what's going to make the listed market go away or diminish to a point that is not a problem to the the legal market it's a lot of different things it's consumer trust in this the particular market it's eventually open commerce allowing states to ship cannabis across state lines to meet you know market demands and so forth um access to dispensaries and product in states that have legalized there's still plenty of counties within those states that that say they don't want to participate or in some states that i mentioned earlier vermont um you know legalized but then didn't have a market a legalized market and then of course you know law enforcement prioritization i think as as as all of those things come and and meet each other um you'll start to see the illicit market go away as the market matures and so forth and the consumer base increases and so on so the second question actually really interesting because um we are seeing a lot of non-traditional insurance vehicles enter the enter the market space captives but this this question is specifically um do you see any risk retention groups being formed to deal with some of the capacity issues uh randy are you seeing some of these non-traditional um insurance vehicles being being formed other than i have not other than captives i think that's the way that a lot of people have decided to go but i don't know if maybe rich has seen anything uh i'm familiar with one that i believe was established uh in march clic risk retention group i know it's aimed at the cannabis industry i believe general and products liability um i you know i have not spoken personally to to any clients who subscribed to it or have accessed it uh so i'm not really sure exactly what the the underlying mechanics look like um but i i would expect to see more of those as well as alternative risk transfer uh mechanisms developing over the next couple of years as the industry grows and matures right yeah uh phil god oh i was gonna say yeah we're yeah we've we've spoken with a couple of uh potential aas members who um and and one who became a member who were they're interested in starting up or establishing risk retention groups um i think it's i think it's a great idea for you know niche markets within the campus insurance space yeah just to include on that question i i mean we have spoken really with a variety of of different entity types um because of the capacity issue people are looking to get creative um in order to to start writing insurance policies for for the industry so moving along here um if cannabis becomes legalized at the federal level uh will standard policy forms and endorsements be adequate to to provide coverage phil i'll let you speak to that well it's still going to be a niche market uh we've said i've said that a couple of times so far in the presentation it's you know it it's got unique considerations to it and some unique risks it does mirror a lot of the the the markets that um the the specialty markets that we currently have in the insurance industry um so i think there's still going to be a need for specialized forms at least specialized endorsements to address some of these issues and you know speak to compliance with state regulations and so forth what really catches my attention about about this issue is potential for regulators become more uh selective or at least scrutinize cannabis exclusion filings um if candice becomes legalized at a federal level um i think there's still room for those exclusions absolutely but there need to be more tailored to the actual coverages being provided not just kind of blanket exclusions on cannabis property or cannabis activities very much like i think it will look a lot like liquor liability um if if if legalized randy or rich any any any commentary yeah i i totally agree phil i think that's exactly right um you know that the one thing i'd say is i do think many of the uh you know the the specialized coverages so to speak and not really coverages more exclusions uh that we're seeing in the politic that you know the the reason these policies are so complex is because of all of these exclusions that are tacked on uh not seeing a lot of enhancements or uh you know anything that is is really you know specifically designed to provide a coverage for the cannabis industry that that's unique you know i think some of the examples the the exceptions there would be like the tenders liability that you referred to um but i would expect at least the policies to get a bit more simpler uh with some of those exclusions removed as as things become federally legal carriers more comfortable uh but completely agree that there there is going to remain sort of a unique exposure in the cannabis industry yeah for sure so this is a question um that we get often times so we talk about entering the market space or insurers entering the the market space you know i think people are looking for maybe a softer point of entrance randy would would cbd or underwriting cbd or hemp exposures um be a good starting point well i think this point in the presentation i think amp and cbd um is almost more difficult to some extent um just because of the the nature of the regulations and the usda is regulating it and you know and for growers and cultivators it's it's rough in terms of what the product's going to look like i almost think cannabis is in some respects easier to deal with because you sort of know what it looks like going in based on the federal illegality i don't know if rich and phil have uh more to add on that uh yeah i i would i would echo that absolutely i think you know it depends on the market which state you're talking about um but you know what we've seen uh over the past few years you know is a lack of direction from the fda with respect to dvd um it's you know really tricky market uh there's lots of questions that still need to be answered there and and hemp as well whereas you know cannabis depending on the market again is remarkably secure and interested by robust uh regulations and barriers to entry to ensure that companies remain stable and compliant and risk aware and so i i would argue that a cannabis company a licensed cannabis company is a much better insured than an unlicensed cbd company so this is this is a good question to to conclude with um is federal prosecution a legitimate concern for those that want to participate in the marketplace phil i i i know you have a few thoughts on on this issue sure yeah we get this question a lot um talking about our cannabis uh with with uh potential parties um is is it a legitimate concern yes but is it realistic i'd say not so much um you know there have been carriers serving the cannabis space in one form or another for over a decade and not one of them that i'm aware of has been prosecuted by the federal government or order to stop issuing policies i think there's some opinion that cannabis insurance actually protects consumers um you know insurance actually you know provide that backstop for product liability bodily injury lawsuits so it's it's a it's a plus um to the industry and the federal government isn't isn't death to that they're they're not going to come after the insurers they're going to kind of come after people that aren't following the state guidelines randy is the other attorney on the panel i'll leave you with uh your your your final thoughts on on that question yeah i mean i'd like phil says is it a legitimate concern it absolutely is a legitimate concern and unless and until there's legalization you're um it's gonna remain a legitimate concern um you know i think that the appetite for enforcement or at least what doj says is their appetite for enforcement has sort of fluctuated over over a period of time depending on who's in office um but right now it looks like you know the doj is maybe focusing a little bit more on the cannabis industry but not from an insurance perspective i mean the enforcement has taken place in the antitrust um capacity more right now so you know so i think i would echo what what phil said i mean you're not you're not seeing it what they say and what they have done are kind of two different things yeah absolutely and and uh it looks like we're we're approaching time here so you know great great conversations uh being had here and and great questions thank you to uh to the audience for for tuning in um so with that uh thank you all and it looks like at the top of the hour uh we'll explore another growing exposure particularly as we cope with cobit 19 cybercrime uh our own linda janzik will welcome a panel of leading experts from berkeley reed and cyberscout if you're working at home you'll certainly want to listen in so thanks thanks everyone", "Zmtfwa6_bFY": "alright let me share my screen I'll play a quick video and then we go live hi welcome everyone to the kangertech webinar series this week was speaking with Matthew Anderson from Vanguard scientific and joel sherlock from Vitalis two of the leading extract companies in the cannabis space and we're talking everything extraction what is extraction what to do how to do it how to make money from it and some of the pitfalls better involved and if you could just mention where you're from in the chat just so we get an idea of who's joining us and we'll jump straight in so let's start with Joel you're the founder and chairman of Vitalis tell us how you got into the cannabis space and specifically extraction and the towers yeah so I came in through you know non-traditional methods I guess you could say I was on the finance side you know with a big focus in real estate and very early on in the Canadian legal program I had some guys approached me and they wanted to lease my building and they had a license to grow cannabis you know I laughed and didn't really believe that to be a factual statement at the time so you know learned about it at that time but that was back in 2001 so became the landlord to a cannabis company and then you know invested in a plant food business and a lighting business we'd kind of always been in the ancillary side of things and then you know transit into financing extraction machines back in great science teams and they were all buying machines and we really went out to standardize to one platform so wanted some customization wasn't able to get it in the market and went to some oil and gas engineers and and then created the first vitalis system you know got five and a half years ago Matt from Vanguard you're having Oregon how did you come to the cannabis extract space troubled youths all first first entrepreneurial endeavor was building a distillery in my garage I spent seven years in regulated products in the US alcohol industry we built the liquor brand and lightened grain spirits and grew that nationally funny enough for a wine and food event I used Hindukush which is a Portland Oregon judge genetic it's it's an Oregon purple cush and blended it with what chanterelle mushrooms for a food and wine dinner and and and and had the euphoria and the exposure to alcohol and a number of chefs and people experience at the same time they loved it I thought I'd hung the moon that kind of crossed me into cannabis and alcohol my dreams were quickly dashed but regulations in Florida for Senate bill 1030 came along and I had the opportunity to work with a group that ultimately was awarded one of the first five licenses for processing a full vertical license which was incredible fast-forwarding till today I've had the opportunity to participate in the industry much like Joel has from the private equity side through MacArthur Capital we raised and deployed to funds into the space touching the plant and not touching the plant Vanguard scientific was the first investment in our first fund and then the first investment in our second fund and I've been running the company now as CEO for about two and a half years amazing so Matt let's start with extraction efficiency bang for buck what is gonna get you the most product and then afterwards Joel you're jumping to what people actually want from product but extraction pricing and bang for buck out of systems yeah sure I'll step back and make the headline statement not all oils are created equal so it's important to understand that depending on what type of extraction technologies you're using and methods you're deploying you're gonna get different resulting oils and kind of where Joel is probably going to touch on the buyer the question is who's going to be procuring the oil you make so so when you talk around efficiencies you need to think about throughput traditionally high flow throughput higher flow throughput co2 cryo ethanol solutions as well as hydrocarbons have had the greatest extraction efficiency but that being said it depends on what you're doing in post-processing whether you're looking to get to full spectrum or broad spectrum oils straight into a distilled or four leaf are the more concentrated product you begin to make different choices about extraction efficiency so I apologize the convoluted answer Joel oh yeah okay salt but it really is dependent upon what type of oil you're trying to make so I guess Joel that's a perfect spot to go into different products how do you choose your extraction system yeah what comes first I guess you choose your product set and you build your extraction to match yeah I mean what comes first or what should come first sometimes are different statements but what shouldn't come first is really understanding you know what biomass are you bringing in you know hemp or cannabis is one of the biggest you know first decisions to make or both potency and then ultimately the best extraction method is really going to be determined by the jurisdiction and the resulting product you're looking to make and and one thing we always tell customers is you know be very careful because the only thing that's guaranteed for us is is change so you know half the products you'll be making in a year from now you know there's some amazing entrepreneurs just thinking of them so making sure you have flexibility in that product ecosystem is really important so you can bring different strains different types of product different potencies product in and then make different types of product out I mean if you're going to a distillate or a broad-spectrum oil that takes different extraction parameters and and different post-processing equipment as Matt was talking about so it really really does vary but understanding those variables and then going out and figuring out what's the best is the best recommendation we usually have and sometimes you might find that you need to extraction methodologies right you might want to use co2 to take off the terpenes and get your higher quality product through here and then ethanol is very efficient and fast you know for for one type of extraction so let's I guess talk about the various products that are on the market and how you get them difference you've mentioned isolate distillate we know butters shadows crumbles what are the processes that are getting these final products and then how to integrate that into your your facility design map you can go on to that afterwards sure so I think that will keep the conversation to actually commercial production you know cannabis and hemp extraction or concentrations have been going on for hundreds of years so there are certainly craft methodologies that can get to different product types but not in any sort of techno economic efficiency so kind of inability to produce these to make them saleable as retail products you know I think the focus initially is is a full spectrum or broad spectrum oil and that and that is an extraction process that utilizes predominantly co2 as a main extraction method and that captures the widest range of cannabinoids that can have captures THC CBD and the rest of the minor cannabinoids including phyto metabolites which are things like flavonoids and terpenes that are all really important as you start talking around the entourage effect and or ensemble effect so the ability to access the endocannabinoid system with more than an isolated ingredient so what you're seeing is these full-spectrum extraction technologies co2 is being used not only to capture the flavor profile and the euphoric elements that are inside of these plants but also being used in a medical setting to be able to then further concentrate fracture distill into isolated compounds that's a kind of a starting point for conversation Joel no I mean it's a good base for sure and ultimately it's important to remember that you know the extraction methodology is one step it's a very important step but there are also post processing technologies which are really really important so when you talk about broad spectrum oil it really requires all of those steps right in some recreational markets in in the u.s. hydrocarbon which is a great solvent operates very cooled it gets a broad spectrum oil but then you've got solvents and oil together and then you have to take it into the lab and separate those two so you you have to look at not just the extraction step but the post-processing steps when you're looking at cost when you're looking at throughput in time and when you're looking at what does that output product look like and that's where you know going back to what Matt was saying you know traditionally co2 has been it's a very selectable solvent so different pressure and temperature combinations will get different things out of the plant you know in perfume industries you know it's it's been used for decades and and it really is quite gentle on those terpenes and monoterpenes and and some of those things that you really want in you know in broad spectrum oils or higher quality products and so I guess let's talk about the the difference between mass extraction you know large companies like I guess select some of the bigger producers versus the craft extractor what what is the market telling Joel where is the market I mean you know we've seen a big consolidation right I mean one thing for us is we specialized and are the largest in the world for industrial scale equipment in the space so you know our machines are big really big and then you know both facilities so when you look at someone like like select you know they they have a wide variety right if they're buying trim it's going into an ethanol process and going out into a distillate you know whereas they also have broad-spectrum products you know they've they've got a wide variety of products right they've got their THC lines their CBD lines so ultimately you know they're at a sophistication level and they had the budget to go out and make different processes for each of the product lines to really maximize efficiencies that come through there and you know that's a gross generalization to a lot of the bigger players that are in the marketplace right so well a co2 setup is going to be your most flexible for varied outputs you know when you get to a point of making a lot of distillate you may want to look at co2 for the first hour and then finish it and ethanol and there's a lot of combinations that we can put in to really refine efficiencies in insight but again that comes with you know the capex to make the the operational you know efficiencies to get that price down at scale yeah I think you bring up a really interesting point Joel and and solve the reality of it is is what we're seeing here is if you look at the beverage industry as kind of a parallel you've got the distiller right the person that's making the oils and then you've also got the brand house kind of living is one company right so so as Joel's explained trim coming in using ethanol that's creating a standardized product so companies probably have standard formulations added terpene ratios and our branding and marketing those effects to specific buyers and then you have this regional that the fact that the cannabis is like grapes or wine it grows in terroir and regionality affects strains that can be grown and that's a different extraction process and that's this broad-spectrum co2 where someone wants to taste the hillside you know that that the actual cannabis was grown on so you're getting luxury preference on both sides I like to say one is an ultra premium like the best Russian vodka you know up right that's so smooth you can't even taste it but watch out how many you have and then the other is that really good vintage of wine that you there's scarcity around so those conversations are really unique as they evolved and really important you know to look at how markets evolve you know medical products and pharmaceutical api's is is that consistent product right didn't numbers need less than a 6% variation where as like craft products like we'd see in some of the recreational markets you know that's where you want to accentuate what was naturally grown in the flower whereas in some pharmaceutical sides we want to get consistency coming out so it really can totally change the parameters you run the equipment you need you know it's a totally different lab yeah and so essentially we're gonna see a bifurcation of the industry to Pharma which is GMP isolate driven and wellness craft recreational which will be driven by what the consumer demands or products that we don't even know exist today absolutely I fully believe that I mean you know we're gonna see you know novel foods and pharmaceuticals really and in different jurisdictions they'll have different names but you know there'll be different barriers to entry to get into those facilities different licenses to have and and then very different operating manuals SOPs you know cleanliness procedures everything you know absolutely I mean I think if you look at just the ability to patent or protect a formulaic definition you have to have isolated or specific ingredient sets that are replicable and consistent on the other side in this novel food or therapeutics wellness conversation what you're talking about is the stewardship of the plant through its process and in a representation of in its natural form the interesting thing that's going to happen as this conversation devolves is you look at different buyers the eastern medicine or the non single drug narcotic convention kind of theorists that say the sum is equal in more than its parts are really going to continue to champion that you want to bring in these different minor cannabinoids and that that naturally is creating more benefit in a therapeutic and all potential medicinal statement but that is kind of the underlying controversy I guess that might exist around botanics in general for sure and actually my I had a question it's important to talk about right I mean when we talk about what some product is coming in and and how product is going out and what the best efficiencies are I mean if you're going if you just want the CBD or you just want the THC you can turn the pressures and temperatures way up and you can get through the material a lot faster but you're gonna burn off a lot of those terpenes monoterpenes flavonoids you know you're gonna burn off a lot of value that Mother Nature has put in that plant and that might be what you want but if you run cold low you know be a cold ethanol cold co2 you know a colder process is gonna keep a lot of those lighter volatiles so you know just because it says extracted with co2 or extracted with ethanol doesn't really tell you what temperature what parameters they were using and that's gonna vary the output greatly yeah Joe 100% and Maya to follow on with your question do you think that reassembling compounds after co2 extraction after winterization and distillation really respect Entourage I think the terminology at least the one I like is an ensemble effect you certainly don't have the full spectrum of all the minor cannabinoids like Joel just walk through a lot of those are adulterated and changed but you are getting a more than singular ingredient set and I think that again since there's no formalized lexicon it's really on us as we communicate with each other and our clients to kind of begin to harmonize these words okay so let's talk about the startup costs involved in extraction Joel I guess you should take this since you do the financing behind behind the equipment as well but you know what does it take to get an extraction facility up and running and then you know we're going to some of the licensing that might be required yeah I mean cost is it's you know it's such a how long is a piece of string right I mean it the first thing you need to start with his scale you know if you need a lab that's gonna do two kilograms a day or if you need a lab that's gonna do two tonnes a day both can be made very very different price points you know if you need a lab that can make just Hisle it as an output versus I want to be able to make distillate isolate broad-spectrum oil you know soft gels gummy bears everything of course those are all a whole bunch of different lines so all of that's possible really really important to know what are you putting in what are you what are you making out of that lab also really incredible and important to think about capex versus op axe right I mean to buy a machine that gives you full automation will be more expensive than you know in your dissolution process or in some of those pieces but again you're gonna pay for that upfront and then you'll save over time versus spending less upfront and paying more labor you know solvent costs all of these things are you know as as people start their businesses they start to understand really what that looks like if you buy an ethanol system that reclaims 60% of your solvent or you buy an ethanol system that reclaims 80% of your solvent you know that makes a huge difference in your monthly costs you know as our sales manager says co2 is expensive ones and the wrong ethanol system can be expensive forever but you know and then as we were talking about earlier it really the last couple of months has really shown that we have to look at what else is going on in the globe right I mean the demand on hand sanitiser recently has skyrocketed the cost of ethanol so if you had a giant ethanol plant outside forces have caused the the costs of your solvent which is your largest operational cost so if you were in the growing space it would be like if power went up 400% you know that would really affect your numbers so truly understanding what you what you're bringing it how much you're bringing in and what you're looking to to put out and then also taking a look at that affects capex trade-off but you know I mean the facilities can go from the low millions to you know at 2030 if you're really building a whole facility and north of that if you want to go you know tons and tons per day at scale to four different outputs some mad yet into facility design you know following Joel's comments how how do you begin design and implementation even you know before you've chosen what your product set isn't what your extraction equipment is gonna be sure first off Joel I love your statement how long is a piece of string and I'm now stolen that and we using it but you know it's kind of a similar conversation so we have to sit down with the customer and what you have to establish is voice of customer right so it's all about aligning success metrics what does success look like and and you really start on product description so specifically we talk around what end products are you trying to make and walk backwards with the client into their oil set and ultimately their initial their final ingredient set and that equipment set is based upon what products you want to make and then what your throughput needs are the interesting thing that kind of Joel touched on is what the throughput today is and what it's going to be in a year and a half is going to be different most business operators perform a markedly different right and we're here and we're going to here and and and walking the client through that this isn't a widget right we're not building an app and putting it on the app store you are creating a running manufacturing facility that's gonna be operating inside of different degrees of controlled environment rigor so when you say we're gonna the machines always gonna work right better always work and my employees are always gonna show up on time and and the input products always gonna have the same potency and can I've never you start to get estimations of what they can do and most often what happens is clients are in this capital raised stage or maybe it brought in their first rounds of dollars and you kind of have to not play the adult in the room but become a trusted adviser and say look you've got two shifts in a swing shift you know do you have anybody that knows how to run this equipment yeah right and and then start looking and breaking down those unit economics like Joel mentioned right so I've got costs for capex for my equipment but should you have a spike in a solving cost what's really affected there is your unit economics or your ability to meet the market other competitors are going to provide supplies of oil and you're not going to be able to compete it'll be expensive forever so all as all that's kind of coming together what you have to also kind of get an understanding of is where the client's mindset is around facility requirements so what level of understanding or what expertise do they already have around the table that can help unpack engineering electrical plumbing HMIS or hazardous hazardous material quantities and then what level of GMP or quality control understanding do they have and each one of those things are really important and upfront fact-finding or needs analysis because it prevents rework and oftentimes it prevents our clients are having to spend additional monies with architects or engineers that may be experts in their own right but have never built a controlled environment for the manufacturing of a pharmaceutical API so I think that there's just a lot around why each rooms built and the why of each final finished product that goes a national facility build-out for sure and you know it's probably important at this point to note the difference you know like finding an equipment provider be it Vanguard vitalis or some of the others who who really is gonna help you through this in a consultative process and not just try and sell you some kit right because truly understanding all of these variables can be the difference between success and failure you know even understanding when we're talking about industrial scale facilities you know what are you doing with the waste the raffinate that comes out of there because if it's soaked in ethanol it's different destruction protocols than if it's just dried hemp that could be you know composted so understanding all of the steps from start to finish even the ones that they you know someone's trying to sell you equipment may not want to talk about but for your business it's essential to understand every step and every cost let's go into the difference between the hemp market and the cannabis market what are some of the glaring differences that you're seeing because you're you're having intimate Gale agriculture side with the hemp and on the pharmaceutical side so you can both so I mean on the hem side a big thing to consider is where you're actually you know located right genetics that exist in that area are gonna vary potencies so you know the register genetics in China are very very different than the register genetics in Switzerland with 1% THC you could see 18 20 % CBD so that's that potency is gonna really vary what equipment is in there so if you're if you're extracting four or five percent C's you know him or if extracting sort of eighteen or twenty percent that's gonna be very very different so scale in the hemp side very different and then also we're starting to see outputs right I mean you've got some registered extractors now of pharmaceutical level or API level CBD you know those labs have completely different needs than you know a Colorado isolate manufacturer so really understanding the jurisdiction you're in both now and where you want to be in a few years from now extremely important and and that's gonna have a huge discrepancy in the equipment you choose the team you pick and and the needs that are associated with that yeah I absolutely I mean I think we were talking a little bit earlier you're gonna see a real bifurcation in the market there are those that are gonna go out and follow the path of GW Pharmaceuticals that it's really created an API out of CBD in the United States and now internationally through their public fund but what we're gonna see is these groups that are going through clinical trials that are looking to define medications for specific cause and then build a business around that those supply chains from cultivation all the way through to final chronic retail and sale are gonna look a lot different than those that are looking to produce hemp derived oils and extracts that are going to be used in cosmetics or non ingested products we could unpack the international regulations versus the US but I think just kind of keeping it like that and really saying there are an apple and oranges conversation while they might look the same the requirements to be able to actually man you extra process and effectively cell is only going to continue to be upregulated globally as this moves into a mainstream market and that's going to off take you know you've got to sell your product at the end of the day so what's moving what's what what is the marketplace look like at this point and how is it evolving mm-hmm you know ultimately as Alan Gartner had said previously right you know and when coffee came onto the market like good coffee was strong coffee how strong is that coffee and you know and then it quickly evolves into you know this is organic over here and I'm willing to pay for it this is you know consistency you know all of those things now over top of client preference and what the market demand is we also have regulatory change so you know looking at what's happening right now in the UK where there was a big push to just isolate it had to be THC free but now it has to be novel foods approved so you know the bar was just raised so like understanding again as Matt was talking about where you are excuse me and then also understanding where the regulations are going and they're they're only going in one direction and that's really gonna vary price demand has really shifted away from isolate or I guess Supply has come up on isolate price has come way down and a lot of markets and so broad spectrum oil has become really in demand THC free broad-spectrum oil on the CBD front which is kind of a bit of an you know an oxymoron but we don't want to go down that rabbit hole but you know it's something with more terpenes and still THC free and then when you look at an API level which very very few people have you know GW or brings by o suta coals you know it that's a again another leap in both price and and sort of difficulty to manufacture yes so stepping back from the product and just you know how do you sell I'll kind of address that I'll use two parallels again let's use Minute Maid and ocean spray as comparisons and and the kind of the thesis is in this industry the processor the centralized processor sends its a new industry and there's an undefined market has to have a sailing organization they have to go find the buyer so the centralized processor in order to create minute made that sold globally has to produce a uniform formula that tastes the same 365 days a year on all the continents and how do they do it and its supply chain management right so they're beginning to source from different farms 14 different types of oranges all around the world in order to formulate it inside of their lab and deliver this consistent product same thing for Ocean Spray they have centralized processing and they use what are called Power Purchase Agreements Power Purchase Agreements reach upstream into the fields they provide uniform genetics to the farmers those farmers are growing under contract that are going to produce a like ingredient under like standards and then feed that supply chain so as you look to be able to find offtake at least from our experience for deep bids for long reoccurring bids the sophisticated buyer doesn't want to carry any of the risk they wanted to hit their dot on time every time within a tolerance and consistency and depending on how big the buyer is and depending on whether they're from consumer packaged goods or otherwise they're gonna expect you to be bringing the insurance for that supply chain so you'll find yourself at depending on the scale your business after you've built out your your out your processing facility and you have the client they're gonna ask you to sign something and you're gonna have to have that gut check moment that really is are you willing to be responsible upstream and do you have this supply chain in place to your growers gonna follow the right practice they're gonna grow the right genetics so you can process the expected potency as Joel mentioned because the engineering team from either vitalis or Vanguard have come in and worked with your team because you've had expectations around what the starting biomass is and you've worked on label formulas now they're gonna match that and that degree of consistency and how tight that package is that Good Manufacturing Practices the Quality Assurance is the qualifications that have gone into your equipment and the final certificates of analysis that make that oil what you've got then is a differentiated product amongst the sea of commodity and those are the transactions that we see moving and it takes a lot of discipline around the operators of the processing company to understand that it's not just a standard oil business they have to handle other parts of this supply chain and so that pushes back the conversation towards the craft over the the mass and again it's not binary it's not one or the other the mass is gonna end up with CBD in coca-cola and the craft is is the craft beer craft wine industry that you mentioned before so is there a difference in the CBD hemp side with that as well or it's going be regulation big product cpgs or do you feel the hip market is moving to full-spectrum craft oil as well in the States I'll go first in the states there's definitely both you've got California USDA Organic you know you organ tilt certified organic you have buyers that are like from this life science of health and sustainability demographic they care where it comes from they turn the label over on old foods they care about the farmer that's a luxury marketplace in the craft sector internationally Joel you know I've got an opinion but I'd love you to give your opinion here yeah I mean you know we touched on wine we've touched on coffee there's gonna be a lot of parallels there right I mean you know there's general consumer shifts you know people going and looking at more of the future and reading the ingredients and and voting with their dollar we're seeing that just generally and you know be it grain to milk to vegetables whatever and we're seeing the same thing here so I think ultimately there's going to be the suppliers of consistent output at a reasonable price and that's going to the Coca Cola's and then there's also going to be I think they'll forever be that sort of craft where was it grown what what is the strain you know that strain specific broad spectrum oil I think both will and there's absolutely you know an exciting business model in in both for sure amazing good connection from dr. Resnick he's a specialist in cannabinoid medicine and as a physician he wants to know the extent in which the extracted content is correlated with the whole flower cannabinoid if you're taking I guess he's asking a strain how do you ensure that the final product has that therapeutic value and how does the doctor know that it has that therapeutic value dr. yeah I got what I would say is this I think for a processing for our clients the way in which we control that GMP the GLP process is is all about material handling and intake so you have material comes into a facility you're held into a quality release you quarantine a batch that goes for a certificate of analysis that can be done in-house if you already have an incoming CoA from the farmer you match like product to sure the apples are apples you can do a multitude of batch testing if you're in pharma you're gonna do multiple batches per lot from there as you go through extracts during each phase or state change the oil you'll pull a sample continuing to trace it if you're using crypto or blockchain enabled traceability technology that'll all be audible and then you move into a formulated product that formulated product we'll have a number of sub identifiers those self identify hours will actually tie all the way through custody to what's called real world evidence for that incoming coa and in that way it's turned into a product binder at the pharmaceutical level and the doctors label has to match and that's called true to label so the label will match the the standing certificates of authenticity and validation behind it mm-hmm an important you know I mean physicians we typically see you know two camps and I I definitely I understand both right there's physicians who want double-blind clinical trials that need a consistent product going in and that traditionally requires a different extraction set a different processing set to get you know a product that's going to be the same output even when there's a variance of input right then there's you know the the physicians who are looking for a broad spectrum oil and and you know they we don't know exactly how that entourage effect works but we know it exists so you know that becomes more difficult to put into a double-blind clinical because you know you you've got variants in that product so there's usually two camps you know in the in the broad spectrum it's traditionally you know take a look at the extraction parameters and the extraction methodology and and the coa is right to see what other cannabinoids are there and that's really gonna gonna dictate you know what did they put in and then what's the the makeup of the oil that came out and then of course when we go to the you know the more pharmaceutical route they'll have all documentation to make sure the product has you know little to no variance an api level a question from casey in the audience what means broad-spectrum THC free product from a legal point of view and the EU is it a product that has no THC or a below allowable quantities I'll just provide a quick answer there the allowable quantity metric is you know 0.3 depending on where you are internationally or nationally 0% THC or THC free as Joel mentioned is an actual product where th sees either been converted or flipped into CBN or remediated and taken out the most capable technology that we've seen on unit economics efficiency is a technology called harmonic distillation Vanguard has a product that we offer that offers this service but also super fluid chromatography has been seen as the ability to actually fraction a tour separate minor cannabinoids it's just important to mention it's a very highly cost for each because of the actual column costs and it takes a high level of expertise to actually operate the technology and what would that add to the cost so I've extracted a full spectrum oil obviously contains some THC post-process cost to remove the THC is what in unit economics per gram I saw I'll tell you we can produce from biomass all the way through to a THC free oil you know using good process engineering you can deliver that for under a buck if you built the equipment that built the processing line the right way yeah there are some some scale issues there you know a lot of that right now you know to be able to do that at a you know at barrels per day is not quite that science is still being developed to keep the consistency to it but yeah absolutely I would agree with the price estimates there but again quantities gonna vary that quite a bit yep absolutely and the THC that you're pulling off you're able to collect and sell it as an ISIL it depends on what license you have and what jurisdiction you're in you know if you're in if you're in an area that does not have a medical cannabis license or if you only have an agricultural hemp license some areas you have to extract it and then destroy it and you have to trackway destruction protocols and prove it if you have both in an area like like Denmark for instance if you if you had both licenses you would be able to extract it off and sell that as a product as well one would go under your hemp license the other would go into your medical cannabis license and typically him and kind of decisons can operate on the same facility are dealing they can't yeah so in a lot of US states no in a lot of EU jurisdictions it's looking more and more like you will be able to but again until those regulations are printed and on paper that's a pretty big gamble to look at so definitely another thing people need to consider and then another I guess barrier is certain states require that you extract on-site that means putting in extraction equipment essentially for one season a year how are people getting around that sure one of the things that we've done with clients has helped them develop a GMP like not GMP certified mobile processing solution that can actually pass seismic using ISO certified shipping containers that are outfitted with the appropriate extraction post-processing and remediation technologies and we've had success for those deployed internationally and that's usually a lower cost seen entrepreneurial folks take those and put them on large trailers and then drive them from site to site so there are options in infield processing Joel yeah I mean you know talking about scale again right if you're taking a crop down which is you know two tons and you want to get through it in a month that's a much larger lab that then may sit idle for 11 months of the year or do you build you know if you're taking down a hundred tons do you want to extract that over a period of six or eight months then we have to look at storage you know refrigerated storage you know drying capabilities there's a lot of different pieces so again it really boils down to how quickly you want to get through that volume you know if you want to harvest and extract all of it in two weeks and you have a large harvest that's a very large lab and then you want to think about what am I gonna do with the slab for the 11 or they you know the other the other 50 52 weeks of the year and which is often not thought of by the way so that that point did Joel mentions is very real and THC extracted from hemp in the US if your crop is under 0.3 that THC is theoretically and legally derived cannabinoid any comments around that waste handling procedures in your quality management system you gotta move it completes quickly into your waste stream after your quality check and then handle it appropriately as your work instructions that's the guidance but really important as well to look at you know has the jurisdiction that's ruled out a license thought about that because we have seen - not to pick on any of the regulators so I won't tell you definitely look into it or reach out you know that had protocols and they've handed out extraction licenses but you know with the caveat that at no point ever can you go over that point three even during the extraction process which extraction is concentration of everything that's there so you know without looking at it designing an extractor which is in an enclosed case which separates out the THC and then dilutes it down so you're pulling out like TC and the solution you know it would be impossible not to contravene those regulations so definitely look at how those regs and and how that jurisdiction is going to work with your business model yeah Joel just for anyone that's dealing with your own jurisdiction it's it's a it's a state change conversation in the way the regs are written so you want to look for allowable biochemistry which says exactly that so everything that happens during the extraction process is called working process and there's no like just kind of like a gray zone and then as it comes out post biochemistry or a formulated product that's what it's tested at with its allowable levels of THC so you'll be able to see or not see that language that Joel's mentioning there and you mentioned before the ongoing cost so the initial setup costs the lights and senior GMP everyone sort of understands that but then what are your ongoing extraction costs that are deal-breakers and how can you get them yeah so definitely I mean at scale all of these costs you know again they're they're linear so automation which can be a double-edged sword right I mean because of that variance of product coming in and the variance of product going out you may want less automation on your extractor but in your post processing lab you may want more automation so definitely I mean we could dive into that but so that's gonna be one solvent costs that's going to be a huge one so you know how much cotr you're going through usually not a big cost but ethanol can be very expensive in an EU GMP environment if you don't have the proper cleaning and testing parameters you may not be able to reuse that solvent that gets extremely expensive and then we have seen in some jurisdictions where your ethanol soaked biomass as a waste can be a hazardous waste and so now all of a sudden you have to pay for your biomass to bring it in the lab and you have to pay to take it away so in those jurisdictions you may want to look at co2 which would be higher cost upfront but you know less operating costs all the way through yeah those are those those are all really good points the the solvent cost overall right because it's a commodity product and it's the value is gonna continue to drop until it plateaus what that floor is is going to be determined by the producers that can sustain so you know really thinking about that ongoing cost per gram not only as your waste stream in your solvents but automation is Joel touched on I think process engineering is a big piece here anyone that's done material handling material balance or time and motion studies they understand this is how do I use my labor the wisest what's automated what's manual and the ability to have technologies actually be running while your employees are doing other functions inside of your lab is something that we really deploy inside of the facilities we build the the Midas co2 system is fully automated for instance you can actually get push notification to your cell phone but what it enables an operator to do is do an ax CF co2 extraction of terpenes the system automatically moves to a full spectrum of broad-spectrum co2 extraction cycle allowing the operator in Joel's example and the way that we deploy systems to then move that biomass into an ethanol stream for greater extraction efficiency and the whole thing you're trying to do is get that unit economic cost down by driving processing efficiency and yeah I guess you know the the probably the most important is is looking at the extraction efficiency itself so of the cannabinoids you're looking for in the biomass that you've bought or grown and put into your lab how much are you extracting out because ultimately the science dictates that then and there's you know you gotta sift through of the sales speak that some of the manufacturers will put out where they say you know two hours 100% extraction no winterization needed you know that's there might be some magical commas in there where you know they've it can do it to our extraction it can get a hundred percent and this parameter may not need winterization but all of those together you know the science traditionally doesn't allow that to happen so you know looking at there's a diminishing yield curve on on extraction so really understanding do you want to get 70% 80% 90% or you know 99.9 percent of the available cannabinoids but understanding what that may do - throughput takes more time how much solvent can be reclaimed in the systems I mean there was a question about that earlier again it's gonna very much depend on the jurisdiction you're in in any you GMP environment you know there's risk variances so you know batch to batch are you reusing solvents if so you're you know how are you filtering it how are you making sure that there's no contamination going from one batch to the other so you know you may not be able to reuse it there you know co2 traditionally is going to in a closed-loop extractor you know in a single batch you should be alright replacing that you know then that's less cost and taking all of your ethanol throwing it out and then buying new equipment but it's gonna be jurisdictionally based and it's gonna be in your QMS or SOPs so in your quality management system or your standard operating procedures would dictate what you do batch to batch when you change your solvents your cleaning parameters and that's what the regulators are gonna review and approve so it is really gonna change every jurisdiction you know and so it's important to understand also the joel mentioned you know the solvent reusability in an EU GMP environment the regulator's themselves don't have experience around this so there's not only a documentation requirement but there's a lacking domain expertise so you have to provide without reasonable doubt I mean you have to go to the nth degree to prove that there are no contaminants in this reused solvent and again as Joel mentioned jurisdiction by jurisdiction the same work instructions SOPs and QMS that provide cleaning instructions that me you GMP rigger might not be accepted so it's really important as you move into these conversations to have these upfront communications with the notified bodies or auditors that may come later and say that's great but that $350,000 piece of equipment you purchased you can't use it and that's on the small scale so it was a really important consideration very valid point and and you know just saw as we have seen this in labs that have approached us to help you know they've built something but they weren't able to get it approved until they could fix some of these challenges well if it's a large ethanol lab and the challenges you know we need to be able to reuse solvent or economically this doesn't make sense you know you almost have to build another still purification and lab business next to it so you can move your ethanol over there bring it back to a solvent grade certify it and then test it and then bring it back over you know that could be an additional couple million dollars which is always you know never happy surprised and then if you're looking at novel cannabinoids and acidic compounds what would your extraction recommendations be as cold as possible and it's that ethanol only or are there other systems that Bethel extract as cities sure well shameless plug our Midas co2 system has had some extraction COAS that carried some acids still post extraction and are in our monoterpene coals but honestly to keep acids it really is a solvent list process in which there's no heat exchanged and or a very cold process you see ice has successfully preserving acids and or a cryo ethanol process yeah and when you get to co2 I mean to operate with co2 in a liquid phase like that most systems that exist are by a compressor some systems again you know like a Vitalis has a you've got a piston powered pump on it so we're actually able to move the liquid form of co2 and keep it much much colder so ultimately I mean temperature is the leading piece on that I mean a nice water hash or some of those you're not gonna get a hundred percent of the available but you do get a really beautiful craft product so again looking at the extraction method determined by where you're looking to to sell that product and you see acidic products hitting the market I've seen a few from Europe that are coming about but it hasn't been a big focus today it has not been a marketed focus you know we do know some science teams who are very excited about it I'm really you know watching those results but but again when we go back to what the customer is demanding and and ultimately those colder processes take more expensive equipment and traditionally more time so you know once the customer starts to demand them more and vote with their dollar then you know then they'll go ahead and make more but yeah there's a lot of really exciting science that's being done right now and I think that's what makes me kick jump on a bed every morning and the companies out there how do you reach your target audience what what is your ideal company profile that you would like to work with Matt yeah sure ideal company profile one of the things we said last year we service 24 clients across six continents our goal was to decrease the number of clients we serve this year given the pandemic I don't think we'll have an issue with that but the intent upon that is a lot of this stuff if you can't tell from this conversation is dependent upon the clients ability to perform our customer fitness so these are long lead-time projects from facility build all the way through to final operation and it's our teams that show up Vitalis and Vanguard and the other suppliers are in Raiders that show up they'd have to deploy a ton of know-how so there's a ton of tech transfer and ton of knowledge transfer and to get halfway through a project with a client who's not understanding what the final 50 yards are gonna take is incredibly damaging to the business so qualifying the customer is something that we do upfront as they qualify Vanguard we think it's really important just to be transparent and understanding again what success looks like and defining this ain't gonna work clearly up front and I think it's important when you know these entrepreneurs were listening now are building your team's you know there is a variance or varied expertise required to really make a successful team I mean you have to understand the financial side but that doesn't exist without you know if you're in an EU GMP environment someone who understands documentation you know the the paperwork side of a queue amass all of that detail and then also you know if you've got a pharmaceutical team who's never touched cannabis before it's a very very different extraction process than say getting lavender oil out of lavender single volatile extraction versus you know all of the beautiful pieces that Mother Nature has put into this plant and and the very parameters you need to be able to reach in and get different pieces you know that needs a very experienced for a wide variety of skill sets on the team and then once you tick all those boxes those are traditionally the groups that we've seen succeed short term and and win long term and I do think the current crisis were in right now is going to test you know a lot of the equipment manufacturers and and also a lot of the extractors that exist you know some of our clients are having some of their best years ever best months ever because everybody's stucked up on wine weed and toilet paper whereas you know other other groups are having challenges I mean same thing with some manufacturers who are debt-free and you know we've we've had to change some of our manufacturing parameters but we've been able to keep going we're an essential service whereas I think some of the manufacturers that exist may not make it through this which is an unfortunate reality but a real nonetheless amazing I know Matt has a hard stop you've guys have brought a world of information I know a little bit about extraction and and didn't really get everything that you've said but people from the community we are launching our digital communications app through Hoover we'll send everyone who registered a link so that you can ask questions and continue the conversation after this and I'll make available introductions for anyone that's looking to get in touch with Vitalis or vanguard scientific for equipment and obviously knowledge and transfer thank you guys so much for joining us very much appreciated that you give your time for educating the the public as to what we can do with cannabis extraction thanks for all think yeah thank you for having us and thanks for taking the time to put these together it's yeah very appreciative then we continue educating in the new digital reality yeah we can't see an Israel or Cape Town but we'll visit you and the rest of the canna tech team here it's awesome thanks for having us let hi and have a good one guys", "1saIAuiPztk": "hello everybody and welcome back to the lo show my name is Robin and today I'm extra excited because we have a special guest in studio we're welcoming Tim powers to come in and talk to us about his experience as an ACM PR grower as well as a expert in cannabis flour extractions so we'll be talking about some concentrates I'm really looking forward to that as well as I have a personal challenge I'm going to show you how fast I can grow a beard and a moustache so seriously I've I could feel a growing so stay tuned and we'll see where it what happens in the near future [Music] you hey everybody thank you for joining us at the Lowe show this is episode eight my name is Robin and I'm here with Tim Tim thank you so much for joining us we're here today to talk about the cannabis industry and where it's come to where it's been and where we feel it might be going so just to get things started may I ask Tim what is your relationship with cannabis I've had a long relationship with cannabis medical patient as well as a I guess you say a recreational user yes yes yeah I've been using cannabis for I think 26 years is the actual number 26 years so in your experience with various types of concentrates whether it be a hash product or a hydrocarbon or even let's say like a flower rosin what would be the main differences as far as say a pricing desired effect and kind of like if you were trying to show off a little bit what's what's all the difference between these these forms of concentrates well let's see I guess we could kind of split things into a few different groups I would say so are you more traditional like hashes and Rosen's which are not utilizing any other compounds to extract it such as co2 or right right so you keep kind of like how that off on the side I would say and say you have solvent 'less products as it's been coined by so that could be dry sift that can be bubble hash yes so solving this I would say could be a charas which would be just from rubbing the plant the live plant itself and then gathering the resins on your hands and then collecting all those resins to water extraction which would be taking those live plants freezing them yeah washing them like in a washing machine is and humbling them with ice and water yeah and then collecting the resin that falls a sift dry sift would be similar except in the water you'd be tumbling it using a screen to sift out the heads so all of those would be like fairly natural fairly easy to obtain a lot of equipment needed right and more traditional methods like these sort of methods have been in practice for hundreds if not thousands of years and when people say yo turn that into rosin what are they talking about so when people rosin something generally it just means they're applying heat and pressure using some sort of a filter so they would put their flour or hash one of these different hash products in one of these filter bags and then apply heat and pressure so essentially just between like two hot plates right and then the rosin as it's been coins essentially just purifying your removing contaminant yep for sure removing plant body and and so obviously rosin can come in different forms as well whether it's flour rosin press straight from the flowers or if it's coming from hash yep we can get it that way from dry sift as well let's get into more of the hydrocarbons in so yeah hydrocarbon I would say as a it's a pretty broad I think is the biggest component of our current market right it has the most product lines I would say you kind of highlighted the three main solving this as sift yeah bubble hash and kind of Raw's and hydrocarbons have a ton of names right shatter yeah shatter relax yeah wax like people just call it dabs they'll call it slabs call it yeah yeah so I think hydrocarbon has more quote-unquote different forms but essentially there's still all the same yeah exactly hdfs II yeah you know GE yeah so most of these things are just trying to describe say the ratio between THC a cannabinoids and turbines and an essential that's just a visual expression right what they would call these things when you do a hydrocarbon extract and you purge it in a vacuum perjurer what are what do we talk about when we say that so you're you're essentially just removing the contain propane that was used in the extraction mm-hmm so we put the the extract which is still chock-full of certain parts per million of yes actually be like a liquid liquid yet and so the cam annoyed zat Europeans are held in solution we reverse pressure it's yes we want to lower the atmospheric pressure which helps purge all fringe office away use t heat and lowering pressure and then that's generally how people will get rid of the gas and then when we don't vacuum purge it we're trying to attempt to make diamonds possibly is that yeah I mean I guess the different techniques I don't know think I'll probably go into too much debate on there's a lot of people will have different for sure theories on different things but essentially they're all just physically different physical forms yeah of this of cannabis because some people they just want diamonds yeah so a diamond would essentially mean a very pure form of THC a so again like whether it's in shatter or a diamond or a wax it essentially all just boils down to this to the same thing which I think all concentrates do which is the purity right meaning how many like what is the percentage of cameras and terpenes compared comparatively to undesirables or ranked Hamid non-psychoactive or non beneficial cannabinoids and particles yeah yeah so hydrocarbons could be called a ton of different things generally speaking though they're all just physical forms yeah there isn't a law difference chemically speaking between say shatter and a wax there yeah so we were talking about how you know before legalization happened October 17 2018 the gray market was fairly established you know with the experience that people in Vancouver at least were able to expect you know we're quite lucky to be living in Vancouver for when it's the most beautiful city in Canada but also as a enthusiasts it was probably the widest range of access for high quality cannabis with reasonable pricing you know is that something that we're never gonna see again in the legal markets or it's hard to say I guess I think you're right though I think the market was well developed it was I think it were reasonable expectations on the part of the consumer as well as the businesses engaged in providing those products there were over a hundred locations in our city kid access those products so yeah I think there was a very good system working with small businesses working with one another to provide a good service for the consumer themselves where they could get education where they could get a lot of things that they're not actually able to get in the current retail setting so I think yeah the gray market was well established I think it was a big fail on the government's part to not just to build off of that instead of tearing it all down and trying to start from scratch hmm so yeah I think here in Vancouver it was maybe not the norm and saying in terms of across Canada I think we were definitely more developed than some of the areas and I think that development comes just through I don't I guess just good business practices yeah you know most definitely yeah there's well I love that a lot of companies that were able to operate previous to legalization are given a chance to become licensed and operational legally obviously that changes their sourcing of product and their ability to control pricing on their shelves so the experience that we have in the legal store versus the gray market there's a clear difference oh for sure I think it's gonna be years before we see again that diversity of products the diversity of price points and accountability the yeah the accountability most of these companies you could just go on Instagram or whatever and send them a message and they would fix the problem right I've read countless horror stories of people trying to engage the new legal system and just the company actually being handcuffed by the regular horses himself being able to just send them out a free free replacement yes some things don't like that able to write so I think on the the business side of it there's loss to develop in terms of the relationships between gardens and extractors right the relationships between those companies producing the products and the retailer and the relationship between the retailer and the consumer I think it's years before we'll see that I agree if if I were to ask you what separates the black market from the gray market how would you answer that I think it's all the same like I think it's it's just how some people choose to use certain terminology framing legacy or write legacy brands I mean that's I like how that sounds yeah I mean to me it's simple like there's legal and easy legal that's how the the feds would define that for sure aside from that I would I would just put like the that there's some people would would try to say there's like a moral component of that I mean I I don't look at it like that I just look at it like if you have a tax stamp from the government you're legal and if you don't you're easy so that's by definition absolutely correct yeah but I think there's a culture of especially Vancouverites that recognize this gray market being you know unregulated unlicensed but still a certain ethical kind of yeah it's kind of living world yeah conservative it there's actors nobody's being harmed there's no that's right there's no foul play that's right doesn't have a tax down the average Canadian does have a budget that they're able to spend on cannabis and if that budget doesn't fit into the current legal kind of price point expectations what do we think they're going to do well I think these things have already been established Canadians have been consuming cannabis for decades right people being smoking concentrates for up to a decade so these habits these budgets the these norms have already been set in place so yeah if the new retail regime doesn't fulfill those expectations expectations then yeah then they're just gonna continue on with what they've been doing which is probably you know losing money yeah I think most of the programs across Canada are losing money yeah interesting the provincial framework that they have put in place is more expensive than revenue they're earning that's right yeah exactly in British Columbia is that the part they've all put the cart before the horse for sure yeah I don't know exact numbers but I recall British Columbia had some of the lowest out of all provinces for cannabis sales for 2018 19 yeah and I think that's a cultural thing you know I think that people in BC especially have a lot of friends who either grow for personal or agro for medical yes but either way it's going to be kind of a stretch for you know everyone just to flip the switch and start going to stores when it does come down to dollars and cents more than more so than what a safe access expectation as well right like those those norms have already been established yeah so price is one of them quality access you know these these will all play into it and because we're dealing with such a developed consumer they are do have expectations yes exactly and they let us know it yeah and I think if we can kind of compare and just kind of look across the border into Washington you can get some amazing quality products that's for sure really good price points yeah we're talking things I've seen are like really high-end hash oil that's maybe $70 American a gram whereas you and I actually got cheaper or even cheaper exactly that's a bit on the higher end you know there's some really top-end companies that are coming in around that price may be a bit bit more a bit less but you and I got to sit down a few days ago and experience some Canadian legal live Roz and from Whistler cannabis and it was a full spectrum gram that we were able to look at and it didn't cost about $200 just over $200 after-tax in the the legal system so mmm interesting note so I had in the conversation in DM and Instagram I mentioned to someone that I tried that product yeah this person was an actually an owner of a retail store okay so he said what did you what did you pay I said I think my friend paid a hundred and sixty five bucks before taxi for tax and he said well we got it on the Shelf at 135 so there's that you know I noticed uh-oh and that actually triggers another point so store it to store I don't think there's a lot of you know well they can't really advertise that you can't how do they just go sign up front of your store saying we have this product at this price true so when it comes to your selecting a cannabis for the evening what makes you determine a concentrate or a flower well that's evening or morning it doesn't matter what why do you choose concentrates in general I think initially it was the strength okay the potency yes you know you can have one dab and that's like the same as consuming a whole joint yeah and one one breath so I think at a certain point it was the the potency have the experience of flavor ranks as concentrates got better that became one of the primary factors most definitely the true essence of the plant the flavor of the plant the the high the everything that it was seem to just be better and more concentrated exactly concentrates and so then that became kind of the experience that I was that I was chasing right yeah and I think now I think you talked about this before I'm I've got a young son and a couple of businesses they keep me pretty busy and so now it's time so it's it's the it's all of those things you know the strength the experience of flavor etc but now it's also even more so it's time yes to don't have 20 minutes a lot of times to sit and roll a joint smoke it I got two minutes yeah exactly so a job like really fills out the concentrates really fulfil that one toke I've got a really nice experience of the flavors right what did you think of the the the live rosin that we tried from Whistler cannabis yeah I thought it was I think it was a good start like in terms of a coin store great product say I don't think it's there and I think price point was it's it's even not the lower quoted price from a competitor retailer it's still too expensive for what I could buy on the gray and/or black market and generally speaking I can get a more diverse experience on that gray or black market that was one product it wasn't strange specific no we didn't know what we were consumed and where there are no other options no so it's a pretty bland experience yeah that's okay spirit sure any positives yeah I think I thought the product was was you know it was clean and smooth I have confidence in the system that good point there aren't contaminants you know there aren't pesticides for sure which are some things that if your producers of gray market stuff aren't engaged in testing then you can't have ultimate confidence right so I think that confidence factor was for me the biggest thing of saying look this is undoubtedly gonna be a safe product to consume yeah I think that's a great factor but in terms of pricing you know the overall of the quality of like the flavor experience and though I'd say that was was lacking yeah I agree with you there for sure I think it's a good starting point being an activist that fought long and hard yeah let's start government to get this sort of product into the position that it's in I'm happy to see that that's the case no doubt yeah you've you've had skin in the game for quite some time and you kind of have donated some hours to a couple causes that you yeah or would you care to tell us a bit about that um yeah we did a lot of work to help with the MMR coalition against repeal was the name of the organization essentially it was our government trying to take away our right to grow legal cannabis for ourselves and in around the same timeframe there was another court case where a baker from the Victoria compassion or Victoria cannabis buyers club was busted and so again this kind of was more to do with concentrates where that specific defense of that case was was them arguing that other forms of cannabis aside from dried flower yeah were important for medical patients and so I agreed with that being my actual license my my prescription as it is is to eat hash like that is what's actually been prescribed that sounds so healthy to me so that it just made sense that the what my doctor suggested me doing yeah it wasn't available and the government's arguing isn't even legal right well I put a lot of work into some fundraising for that case as well and ultimately both were were successful the Baker's charges were dismissed on grounds that excellent he should be able to turn his cannabis into edibles or hash or whatever he chooses to and ultimately our right to grow our own cannabis rate was cemented as well in hindsight it's interesting when laws changed forward legally where do we see there being a happy medium between pricing auctions in types of concentrates and quality well I think I think ultimately we will get to that place where there was a hundred retail spaces selling ten or twenty different choices of concentrates I think we'll get back to that spot it's going to take a while pricing I think we're you know we're a bit of a disconnect right now yes that could be because of just inflated cost to produce because of the legal market yeah they could be gouging it could be gouging now there's more people in California than all of Canada you know so maybe the also the the demands of the people need to be loud or need to be heard and you know nothing speaks louder than to see that play out if the consumer isn't spending yeah that's and there's money in the gray area yeah then ultimately those businesses will have to lower the prices if they want to get any sales that's right there's still a couple things a balance of what the you know public corporations want in terms of billions of revenue mm-hmm and what that consumer is used to paying and wants to pay I think will violence hope I hear that and I think these producers will be forced to diversify products would be forced to improve their products to compete just like those companies did in the gray area do you think it'll just be a legacy brand takeover once do you think they're we so let me rephrase the question do you think that the micro aspect of cultivation and extract making is going to improve competition improve prices and basically save the industry yeah I think I think we're I'm excited about concentrates is is in the craft as it were yes you know the small producers the really passionate people who are doing small-scale projects right with purpose as opposed to just like mass agriculture and mass production of hash so to me I don't think I'm ever gonna get excited about our largest corporations products that they're putting out simply because of the nature of business that they're doing and the decisions that lead up to that yeah and the end result of commercial exactly rowing versus a craft and I'm not even that excited about buying large scale anything no no I understand that and I think most of our generation and like our consumers nowadays are coming along with all these sorts of things I think cannabis is no different right I think that a small and middle level you know our small mid-level businesses being integral to it I think is definitely the case yeah so we're finding that there are some brands are being purchased by several LPS and why do you think that there so motivated to do that mmm I think a lot of it has to do with their inability to obtain any sort of brand equity with the consumer both because of the nature of the product that they're putting out income in competition with those gray area black market whatever you want to call it right but also too because of the regulatory framework that they have to operate in it's gonna be tough and expensive for them to acquire true customers so the easiest way to do that will be to tap into a brand that has already built that and they lost on that brand equity they'll have to be very careful with how they release those products because I feel as though the consumer generally will give one chance to a company to release a product and give it a try and you know I've got my my preferred legacy companies that I can't wait to see hit the market and if they were to have kind of like that hydrocarbon ethanol cartridge end results you know that would be fairly disappointing the other burn will burn the value of they'll burn the value of the brand so that's something that should be looked at and that's where I have confidence that a lot of these craft operators will say hey there you know the buck stops here if you want to buy me I need some control over the end result because in a lot of cases this is their their life's working their pride and joy you know and if they were to sell it and not be a part of it then that's one thing but to become a legacy brand and be involved and hopefully you know really dictate the quality and have it true to where it was previously that's exacting most of these producers and now are doing it because they really want to obviously business and economics are a factor probably most of them though could run another business and with way less risk right you know do reasonably okay financially you know so I think they want to be in it they're excited about producing these products mm-hmm I don't think that's the same at the other level at the other side of things no way I mean like the you know say the chain of employees working at XYZ corporation where they're launching line of hash like the passion is not the same I have to agree with you there for sure and and the decision-making that drives all of these things isn't the same either agreed so so I mean so much has happened in the last couple years based on what we've been able to observe so far if if I were a person who wanted to become a micro LP or a concentrate producer what is the the main thorn in my side when it comes to getting this all set up mm-hmm I think investment like finance is definitely one need lots of money right now yeah you need but it's craft it should be small yeah I mean there's there's certain thresholds in terms of land use and ownership being able to show that you that you have possession of the property that you're going to be doing your application on a recent change that makes it which I actually think this recent change is good and reduces the amount of speculative speculators but you have to build your building now so you have to have a purpose-built building on land that you have lease long-term lease or ownership Wow and then you can submit so the cost of doing that is a lot so one can assume we'll need well over a million bucks to get this thing from ground up I would say so yeah you know just throwing that out there okay so money is a huge obviously an objective for a person starting at a micro LP and there's not just the cost it's the ability to obtain capital a bank isn't gonna make this sort of a they're not going to lend it so it almost has to be from a private investor essentially yeah I think a lot of the more institutional forms of finance that other industries would be able to enjoy or not necessarily open to cameras yeah as well as with the very poor performance of cannabis stocks true it has a lot of people opera hands available making that sort of investment absolutely so I think yeah the the the cannabis investor that you're looking for is a as a singular person as it were someone that an angel investor yeah that knows the industry and can can deal with some of the risks and right and and you don't just find those people know definitely I'll just pick up a typically they'll find you if you have you know some value yeah so I think that that is the problem is being able to acquire the capital mm-hmm do you even get their vision off the ground and then once they have engaged that I think the government could do a better job of getting these people through regulatory processes and into operating businesses so there's a lot of red tape involved definitely yeah how about on the municipal government level is there I think it's at all levels right municipal e provincially and federally there are a lot of barriers that are probably not needed or at least not needed to the degree right that they're in place but a lot of this has been done I think we all have to understand that the guise of regulation we need to listen to what the the government that rolled it out said this was done to protect kids and to to thwart gangsters hey isn't that yeah this wasn't put out rolled out to say give consumers a great experience okay yeah that's a fantastic point for good business so I think the objective of which a lot of these programs have set up were not meant for the things that we're talking yeah have success they were meant so that the government can say or we stop kids from getting cannabis so I don't think it'll change it now so I think when they understand that the success of that program isn't about that that is a separate societal issue that if you want cannabis consumers to enjoy what they're doing and businesses to be able to survive providing that service then you might have to approach it from that perspective makes sense to me and at a certain point if the objective is to take away sales from the black market and control the age of people purchasing cannabis we've got to you know get these dispensaries and these micro LPS some support you know you've got to have their voice be heard so hopefully people can hear it on our program here and if we were to say anything to the regulatory bodies if we had any sort of message to them what would we want them to hear from us for me I mean my view is probably not shared by average soccer-mom of Canada say okay yeah I think cannabis is a fairly harmless plant so I think the barriers need to be completely reduced my idea of legal is this ceramic cop yeah they can be bought sold traded yeah there's no regulatory burden on it so if the government wants real success in an actual market I think that they need to reduce all or as many of these regulatory burdens as possible and just do what all consumers would want which is to help satisfy their mmm you know uncertainty of about a clean and safe product to me that is the only point of what the government should be involved in right and and then making that as simple as poss mandatory testing etc yeah that's it yeah test you read before you sell it and then you know if you're not you're liable for hurting people absolutely just like the food industry oh yeah cheers to that well that's a really healthy discussion I really appreciate you coming here and giving me some of your

in our state is moving forward it passed a key committee today newsChannel 5's Kyle here and joins us in Kyle this is the farthest a bill like this has never made it yeah I'm actually this bill passed with a vote of nine to do two two in committee today and despite that both law enforcement and health officials came out in opposition to it I fear this disorder but the one thing that I don't fear is cannabis this meeting is running over from last week when it was cut off due to lack of time in your opinion in those 40 years of experience will it mean more fatalities on our roadways I have no doubt that it will time that is needed for a topic with such a variety of opinions we were very frustrated with the lack of progress however we don't believe the answer is to just not to give up on the system which has really served our country very well but to take some of the restrictions off and allow the scientists the Medical Sciences to actually get the information that we need well the State Department of Health says there may be medical benefits from marijuana they say they can't support this bill and then there are those who say their lives depend on it there was a time period from 2006 to 2010 where I didn't have any seizures at all how you asked because of cannabis I felt normal again it gave me my life back but I also didn't want to break the law so I stopped using it but when I stopped my seizures came back with a vengeance so that tells me that cannabis does work this year's battle is significant dads have it 9 to 2 bill passes out with the bill's passage through the criminal justice committee it's the farthest one of its type that is gone right now it allows people with certain medical conditions to be in possession of medical cannabis and oil cream or pill form but that could change as I understand that the Senate might do something we might do something but at the end of the day we have advanced medical marijuana with the THC in it farther than it's ever happened so far yeah and that bill will still have to pass muster in both the House Health Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee reporting live in Nashville Cal Grant News Channel five", "NV0fwSiu27k": "flirt Biolabs I found that in 2005 and today we are you know I was myself and then I six months later hired an employee today we have 14 employees we do a whole bunch of different things we have laboratory tests that were to credit ISO 17025 Laboratories we also have a field application side of it where we go out and do a lot of testing and so Craig was mentioning throughout investigations about commercial buildings residential industrial manufacturing all kinds of stuff anyplace there's and microbial problem indoors which we call the built environment we deal with it so we ended up getting into cannabis it was cannabis first and that was I guess about five years ago four or five years ago where we got some calls from out west in illegal states and one of the companies was Gaza may have heard of him live well they're a really big company out in Colorado and they had set up two new facilities and they're all indoor grows out there so most of the field work we've done has been with indoor grows they couldn't be more problematic for certain microbial issues but anyways so we started working with them and we can method for monitoring uses some more technology things like that you obviously can't send any material back there but they have a really good staff they have a lot of PhDs on the staff when it's really high quality operation and so we taught them how to be able to do an extract for test for mold off of plant material and send it back to make sure was clean there wasn't any plant material in there and we talked a couple of different things and DNA extractions things like that they could send so we do a lot of DNA testing - from the DNA standpoint we test for microbes so we can tell them without having to have actual with just DNA extract from a material we'd be telling what microbes are present different things we do and something we've gotten into on the hemp side so we see message before the thing - cannabis so you look at the plant you can't tell difference this is a lewd Wells facility in Colorado this is a gloominess facility in Knoxville so obviously this is canvas and this is hemp right here these planters look the same yeah most people I think have confusion about that but uh that's one of the things that you can look at the stuff that's why I think a lot of the law enforcement is having a big issue with flowers right now it's like well is it him or is it as a cannabis they don't know so some of these groups are trying to get things out log of being able to have flower which i think is a big issue they didn't come up with some test so they can actually major these things in the field so the services in the server side we have facilities sanitation reviews so this is a lot of stuff we do out west where these hidden to regret facilities you know there's a lot of things with high genes how things are functioning you you know a big hydroponic operation like Live Well where they have 66,000 plants in the building there's a lot of water moving around a lot of nutrients a lot of other things going on a lot of air movement a lot of these things you know that can if it's not balanced correctly you have a lot of microbial issues and since all the plants on the cannabis side it's mandated in those states by the state that they have to be tested for mold yeast and bacterias and different pathogens obviously they have to make sure that they're not having contamination on their flowers it's contaminated if it doesn't make it just it's above the threshold after the test you know you have to destroy the whole batch which is a lot of money for these days and also in from the whole standpoint of it it's not just the product that product you have workers who are working with all these things so when you go into these locations you know you have you have grow rooms big grow rooms but then you have the processing of the material where you have you know you have you know in their innards but there's people in there who are putting the taking the flowers and they so they have machines that grind it up put it in a cigarettes so they're doing all this stuff and then you have a lot of dust generation and things like that and all this stuff it's airborne so go in there you're looking at 50,000 spores of mole per cubic meter of air it's just massive nobody wants to breathe in that so there's a lot of health and safety concerns also but you don't want your workers get another become a topic or sets the size of this stuff you can have a lot of issues so the whole hygiene thing health and safety the what come there's a lot to it but a facility Boulder bacteria monitoring so we do monthly monitoring several East facilities out west we're actually capturing air samples out of the air and we look at we look at several different things we look at different types of molds that are important for contamination purposes so they don't fail and also a couple of pathogens but the primary one is powdery mildew it's a big problem on indoor grow facilities so these facilities will monitor throughout the look at their locations and if they get any hot and said monthly things if we get any hot spots area would go back in okay what's going on let's look at this and readjust our SOPs and things like that to make sure was this is happening so from the sanitation side we wouldn't maintain a facility that minimizes microbial contamination and that requires you know identifying sources in the facility we need to know which genus level genus or species level what different differentiation to assess risk some things are more greater issues for like health Aspergillus and Penicillium mid species of mold or more of a health concern small spores getting it along as they produce toxins all those things and also you know they're they're prolific so from that standpoint it's like I know something they can just produce a massive amount of spores really quick that can obviously cause problems for my employees but also cause problems for my end product so we work with them to develop a facility hygiene plan and that will include you know all these different things that we find during the investigation and also includes things about their health and safety plans also so you work on both sides of that and we also do the chemical side for facilities that have the that do extractions within like live live was a lot of extractions inside in their own facilities so they have chemistry rooms and they're using a lot of different solvents so we're not letting those products for solvents but we test the air so there's their standards out by OSHA and we're we do to15 canisters and things like that and we're going to make sure that they're protecting their workers or not having leaks out of their hoods and stuff like that about monitoring and then we do a new audits on these things and do updates were needed since we have all the data the look of things and help them get better enhance their quality over the years so let's talk about microbial testing in general now this is for like all the states I said have medical marijuana or legal cannabis recreation they all have these things tested and go on the bacterial side we have Eagle Eye and Salmonella bacteria this is how I think it's a subtle Colorado right here and then we have to east and mold and the different concentrations there and you notice it's off but across the variety of things flowers retail products concentrate something you know that's pricing a lot of these different things they have for me it's just a massive variety of different types of products so for Hampel we're gonna set up a run these already been run across the samples I guess for about two months now in the lab for both side we have substandard panels that your basic boat and the bacterial concentrations knees actually expand expand panels these things mimic what we see out west the basic thing here to do and then also like a field in California while the city state of California always takes things to the level and so you they're kind of like the don't have like the greatest number of tests that's man didn't do anything so we have we've cut across the gamut of those things that you can do in the laboratory different types of South samples matrices will be hammering out flowers extracts oils lotions and other bulk samples we're not doing any gummies or anything like that yet those matrices are difficult for microbiology we just have moved into that we don't there's we cook we are going to move into then but there's just not the need yet so some of the basic things here which is total bacteria which would be aerobic bacteria count we have the analysis incubation times and our levels here so you see it's based on a weight basis so we're like aerobic bacteria which peep toe bacteria hey stop it takes 48 hours before we have a results since do have to grow when we call true and you have to be under a hundred thousand see if you use for gram coliform x' these are things that are you know in the BCS things like that that we don't really want any of those in our sample but we see different levels of that it's a much lower threshold with about to see a piece per gram mole count at ten thousand see a few Z's or call me forming units per gram and then when you get into the nasty things like e.coli Salmonella you know there's equal is a coliform but it's a pathogenic coliform and you see that it has to be less than the CFU so you can't have any they have to be basically a non detect so you have you know sample size three gram sample five-day turnaround on one like east of all that's five days back here you're coming out sooner but and then that's peace this standard panel here's a $50 panel we also do foreign matter it's all the samples come in we look at foreign matter and that's incorporated into this and see we see different things like spider spider pacing their muscles different fibers the next look that an SP under five percent in the sample it has to be a foreign matter which is usually not a problem unless you're I don't think we've seen anything that over that percentage I don't leave a vision and happening if you're like if you're doing your processing and there's somebody doing machining or something else and there's material getting in there some kind of other manufacturing going on in the same facility additional tests we have the the o157 this is the flushing equal eye and we can do that for sample and then we also do the powder ability which is this encompasses all powered motors you can tuck that in effect camp and that is a 75% for sample and this is actually a teammate that's here are the powder motive things that we have returned we're working some other packages and as we see them in the field they become issues so this is a needed work right here and working fluid and they send sentimental things along they're a big company German company was set up in Knoxville they do extractions they have two state-of-the-art facilities to do these type of things they're also going their own grows so they're weird to want some of the third one indoor grows in Knoxville so on the hemp sites that we're working with them on sanitation and storage storage is a big issue you gotta keep banking things and storage get dry stuff down you through this certain moisture levels so you're gonna have a bunch of mold and bacterial growth from your project and raids and they I mean they all kind of products over in that company these are some sprucing up episode your examples the key is they were processing making all their own stuff there here's something different Isis products is talking about this is out of Colorado and you see this is I think that's a bunch of little wealth stuff here all kinds of interesting things that we get we deal with on that side they have to deal with testing so you know like I said it's not mandated for him yet for mold and bacteria on these products but we recommend that you do tests obviously we're lab you say yeah recommend you do test but the thing is I think consumers are going to are going to demand that type of testing even if it doesn't get to the regulation point because nobody wants to be smoking moldy flowers you save all the mycotoxin issues and health issues and you know you just look at something that you open up it's moldy it's just a bad product it's going to smell bad it's not gonna have the quality of a really clean product and you don't want to breathe bulb in your home you don't breathe it in when you're smoking this product you're consuming it sometimes on sanitation sites and the things that we've seen you go to these st. Grove facilities indoors these simple things you know you have water condensation out of the from the drip feed system some PVC pipe anything to have water free water like that it's biofilms we're going to form we have a bunch of moles bacteria growing on that that's gonna get on your product one of the big things we see is that all of the detritus all the leaves are falling down this mat the mat sweat well I mean excess massive amounts of motile girl in there so a lot of stuff is like we get into a facility that hasn't had sanitation done before on it it's okay you just need to go to your SOP it so you can get a big fix right away it's like well we can work this really easy because we have people walking through these things every single day well they're gonna pick up the leaves that fall on the ground they're going to do that as part of their process when they're looking at stuff it's it's not much extra work but it's a huge improvement in indoor air quality and reduction in mold in these locations these are spies films are forming on the pipe it doesn't look much but when you get down to that you know an area like this can have a million sports on it very easily so you know two things that you don't see very they aren't really evident they can get you on on this side one cuz the microbiology you see biofilms are growing on the pipe so they're all yeah moisture rolls down inside the pipe and the forms here and can be tricks and things like that so you have a lot of biofilm formation so simple things like wrapping these pipes it was an easy fix stuff you stopped the condensation some more pipes and on the mats yeah bye-bye human detritus just clean this up when we come through every day it's not a big deal it's just like anything in paint industry working whether it's healthcare it's cosmetic manufacturing a lot of times it comes down to the you know the cleaning side of it if you clean your mop after you're done with if you throw in a corner let's sit there and firm it overnight and use the next day to just move all the microbes around again you know it's like just some of the basic things you need to think about when it comes to hygiene would kind of take out all the wood and you don't want wood on your near your mats it's been sucking moisture and grow bunch of types of mold again detritus I mean she never seen this on a mat this season this should have picked up days ago before he had a chance to decay and rot there there's some more detritus and when I want to keep water off so one of the things with a lot of these mats when they were installed they weren't balanced right so the moisture the water runs off they have three systems and everything but it just wasn't they weren't to set up correctly so we had the engineers come back through and set everything up so we're pulling all the water off I mean it's just a mess this is a this is an early beige ring and it's really hard to take photographs in these rooms because you know they have all these LED arrays different like different spectrum these these types of rooms and the mother plant rooms are different but anyway this is all this is so this is these plants were out here and they're pulling they move to another room they just you know just covered with detritus all over here and you know that doesn't happen anywhere in this facility cleaned all this up and they're their concentration of issues and contamination and the amount of batches a loss because of mold and bacteria just dropped we significant dropped like it was an 80% drop in their loss a lot of the testing you do is for Bible so we're most of the time survivalist some people think different things and master jealous mister Penicillium here classroom those are the these three are the big general that we're usually looking for there's a schedules Penicillium under an airplay you know kind of colonies in an area that has a lot of detritus in the on them on the mats and a lot of score ulation going on air moving systems one of the big things for these big grow facilities that move a lot of air this facility was moving had to move so they have they had on top of the building art to use if they had 64 art to use on top this building moves so a massive amount of air so much air that they were having when they when they first put it up they had to they there was doors that were closed because the air movement and they could not open them physically open so they actually cut the this thing's a tube to level building so on that between the two buildings and cement floors they actually cut the cement floors to get the air flow to circulate because they can open their doors up there getting some major vacuums and locations so ventilation is pretty important on the ventilator side you need to have air movement this can t get sick and this is where a lot of disease develops down in this bottom part of the canopy so they move a lot to air they have fan systems in obviously with a lot of lights got a lot of moisture left things going on here you want to keep that air movement helps to evaporate it get it out and they can move it out of the air scrubbers in the air are PU system so you need to keep that antler canopy have some air coming through it or they're gonna have a lot of powdery mildew and other mold issues weeds and we have some products that we we developed the technology that's really has high at capture efficiency these sprayed on piece of filters so a lot of these these guys were using a bunch of these systems we have these HEPA filter units throughout the building they capture the mold and bacteria HEPA filters are very expensive so we're able to use this solution called molecular trattman and you can buy a cheap filter and put that on there and you'll get a dust cap ship you're getting all the micro go captioners a special protein in there that is really good at capturing mold and bacteria and different viruses the pathogen monitoring there's a pattern builder fishy right here on this leaf lower canopy problems not a lot of a lot of air movement through there and again you have a lot of moisture issues in here there's more powdery mildew powdery mildew won't how are you kill your plant and powdery mildew is what they call an obligate bio trove which means it has to have a host you can't grow it in media so when you say it when you have your stuff go to the testing lab they will never be able to tell you if there is powdery mildew if they're going to a viable analysis on it because it won't grow it has to have a host to grow but from the standpoint of yield I mean you have all these big families covered with powdery mildew well they're all my photosynthetic areas just keep them knocked out so they start to grow a lot slower they don't have as much energy and then they're more susceptible to nutrient deficiencies and a whole bunch of other things they can do that he'll pretty quick on the back side that's saw the top of leaves where it's powdery but if you look at on the side this is a how to go to own the others underside they produce these little things called paisa theisha and this is where you have on the top side that's a sex reproduction producing a bunch of scores and spray it on the other side illegally produces twice efficient this is all sexual reproduction so you get new genetic variants here so it's one of those things that gets in there mutates obviously everything we face every time and you get some really nasty strains of powdery mildew that just caused the mess in your crop they're really cool you know on the standpoint of what we do so we actually get it grow this year in our laboratory outside grow so we got our permits from the state and one of the things is I been working for the last couple years of the group up in Massachusetts we developed a it's a parasite of powdery mildew so we wanted to be able to this is the first year of our project I've been sending off material of them to test it on and do trials but since we're actually can grow it's you know it's the same darn plant hemp versus cannabis you know just the THC concentration so we were able to set up crowds and this the first year was just to see if we could actually grow the plants and said we have just a small I think we had 47 plants and so we got all work went through all the paperwork learn how to do all this stuff and dealt with the state which is a different quality for us in Tennessee on how it is here but you have to have a GPS location give some the coordinates of the photograph so this is our this is our laboratory here and this is our grow area here we use air pots it's made by these are made by Swedish company they're really cool pots and that they have these holes in them and what happens is the roots migrate to the holes they're prune this root needs to have you know pretty much a low oxygen when it gets high oxygen it'll actually kill the root and then when I kills the roof the tip root tip it proves it and it splits so you get massive awesome the roots are just amazing on these things so these are air puffs no any what's it about that company we need information on it but we use these air pots we use some other ones also to see the bags to grow man Feuer our journalist back in May got me started we had two strains you know the strain to have all kinds of names one was one is special sauce and the other ones Hawaiian haze those are constraints so here's of some of our plants in the mid mid season we had you know I was surprising that good growth we it worked out pretty good you know I didn't know what to expect but they we water them daily we fed them liquid nutrients we use the just a simple basic soil it actually it's a California it's real quick there's all kinds of soils you can buy this is just a really cheap basic soil in California and did a great job well well it was really for well-drained soil they could be wants that information so you know throughout the season this is the first year we didn't do any trials with the pair of the powdery mildew parasite this year we want to see if we can grow these things and so we thought few minutes a bunch of other stuff like we have stink bugs here on our plants which is you don't want stink bugs on your plants now but we also have found beneficial bugs like ladybugs and assassin bugs and this guy was one of our favorites we hung out he really tore up all day that's the insects of payment I'd say green links fighter so we talked about some that just our experience my experience with testing and what we had to do for the process so we talked to Lou I think Steve talked earlier about testing we had obviously we wanted to see the loop our work we were with our samples with our plants you know as we were part of like in the third week of flowering wanted to see okay where are we what's our concentrations and one of the things we do is we have five second scoops in the lab so we take these off and look at the trichomes you can see when the trichomes mark milky they start to clear up you can probably do with a little I loop two but when they try going feet clear you know you're getting closer and closer to the mid rate for harvests and that's on that standpoint that's just some visual observation you do it doesn't tell you THC or CBD concentration but it's telling you that and it's something that's been done for canvas for years and years are my trifling Trek guns is that liquid in there milky or is it clear when it gets clear you're getting there you're about ready and you know I want to know basically what is what's the concentration so you hear people taking pieces from here in here and have leaked material what we want to know what the but material is that's really important for us and so we actually trimmed in everything this this was a trim pod that we could send in for analysis so we wanted like to offer him the specimen and we did this from several different plants in several different locations this one here in back we had a delta nine of THC a 0.1 no delta nine i guess if we're CBD CBD is a 2.53 on that that was from the special sauce strain our hawaiian haze is right on the edge see on the 22 nine from the delta nine with higher CBD concentration so this is probably out four weeks ago three or four weeks ago so the brain now is actually when I relieve your singing and head back and we're going to harvest all these plants and they even hang him and everything updating tomorrow did their due so what we did was two weeks ago we sent our we had this state inspector come out take samples see some heat our results well Tennessee from why I said now they have massive backup on these things and so it's he said we would know within two weeks what we did it's been two weeks and we didn't know so we cut recall on the state I mean we're at the point where think we're going to start degrading now so we call the state two days ago they give us a verbal say okay you can cut him they don't know our concentration you can cut them but you can't sell them at least we can cut them and so I had one of my guys today call and specifically asked the inspectors send the email to say that we can cut them you", "1BwDGcus5gA": "so today we'll be making a cashew shrimp stir-fry with shirataki noodles if you want to know how to make this an easy delicious recipe stay tuned you'll need 1 or 2 cups of fresh raw tiger shrimp a lime or lemon about 2 tablespoons of coconut oil and of course the shirataki noodles you can find beans at your local supermarket in the great section where the vegetarian food is located also of course you're gonna need cashews some seasoning any spices you'd like I used fish sauce to start you're gonna squeeze half of that lime juice on all over your freshly washed shrimp XE then a bunch of favorite seasonings I use a home blend which is kind of garlicky and I love it I also added some fish sauce to the mix and I started mixing it three of coconut oil into the bowl and mix again now you may notice that there's a bit of liquid in the pool that's just the lime juice so don't worry about it it just adds to the flavor and you'll also notice that if you leave this out long enough the coconut shrimp turns into this curdled sort of PC thing it's just the oil no worries now let's get cooking you're gonna set your stove to a high or medium high and then you're gonna need to heat up your griddle until it's really really hot here's the fun part make sure your griddle or your skillet is really really hot then you add your shrimp all of it to this riddle or let's give it and cook it for about one or two minutes on each side or until it turns this orange shrimpy color okay so another thing is make sure that you do not overcook your shrimp there is honestly nothing as gross as rubbery overcooked shrimp you don't want to be that person your shrimp should be done by now just remove the griddle or the skillet from the stove and set it aside so halfway through the cook I decided that I wanted some garlic in my stir-fry so I went ahead and chop some garlic you could do this thing if you like okay so next put your frozen vegetables and some coconut oil or oil of your choosing in a hot griddle and stir-fry them away and again remember not to overcook I added my garlic and then now added my cashews to it and then I tossed my shrimp right over it I tossed ngoc mix of course topped it up with my shirataki noodles I do not stir fry them after this I just toss it so that we don't overcook and here you have it looks delicious doesn't it so there you have it guys an easy five minute recipe that is sure to taste so young one last thing if you're not already

another\nepisode of Cheap Clean Eats. I've been reading through\nyour YouTube comments and it seems apparent that what you want is for me\nto healthify a donut. So today we're making donut fonuts. This is what you're\ngonna need, it's so easy. Go ahead and grab one and one fourth cup of almond flour that's\ngonna be about $1.25. A quarter teaspoon of salt, a penny. A quarter teaspoon of\nbaking soda, a penny. Three eggs 45 cents. Two tablespoons of honey for 10 cents. A quarter cup of coconut oil for 18 cents and a half teaspoon of\nvanilla extract five cents. Totaling $2 and five cents\nfor the complete recipe. So today I have my little baby\ncakes donut maker right here. See, it makes tiny little baby\ndonuts and you can also get a regular donut pan at your\nlocal store like Target. It's about $8 and you actually\nget the regular sized donuts but I want you actually guess how much I bought this baby cakes for. No, keep guessing. No, lower, lower. I actually went to bed\nbath and beyond yesterday and got this for $5. I went to the cash\nregister and I was like, \"oh, well, he must have made a mistake.\" So I was like, \"okay,\npay and I'm gonna go.\" So actually no, it was totally on sale. I don't know why but I'm so happy I got this mini baby donut maker. So grab your bowl, we're gonna mix all these ingredients together. It's super easy. So you're gonna pour your\nalmond flour right in here. Bam!\n(baby crying) Okay. And then let's add a little bit of that. Baking soda and then a little\nbit of salt coconut oil. (meows) On a drizzle. (banjo music) And remember, you have to\nsay it with a country accent. It's half a teaspoon of vanilla extract. Ah, smells like birthday cake. And finally we're gonna crack three eggs. Yeah, there we go. Oh, fail. Okay, so I know I'm not\nsupposed to use a spoon but this is a really long\nspoon that he just bought at World Market and I'm in love with it. I know it's a barista spoon but whatever, we're gonna use it to mix\nthe ingredient today, okay? This is my kitchen, so I\ncan do whatever I want. The spoon made me really\nhappy when I found it at world market so that is\nbasically the reason why we're using it and you know what,\nI really believe in buying tools and utensils that are pretty because the more aesthetic the things\nyou're using or around are, the happier you're gonna be. And I'm telling you, that's\nwhy girls like fashion. That's why we like shoes. We like decorating because\nthe more positive your environment is, the\nhappier you're gonna feel and to me, life's ultimate\nsuccess is feeling happy. So I encourage you to buy\npretty spoons and pretty bowls and dress all nice all the time. This is the butter that we have now. I cannot wait to put this\nin our little donut maker. So this has been heating up for a while and whew, that's hot. Little bit on the bottom,\nlittle bit on the top. Let's go ahead and bring these in. (positive music) So we're just gonna close\nit up and pray for the best. Bye little guys, I'll see you soon. And now we wait. (upbeat music) Whew, that was some good dance cardio. Oh, looks like they're done. See dance cardio makes it pass by so fast. Ooh, ah, yes my little babies are done, now I got my pitchfork. I'm going to (with deep\nvoice) puncture them. Let's see. (shrieking) Come on. Okay, looks like we can make\nmore so I'm gonna fill this up again and let's see how many\ndonuts we can get out of this. (popping) Wow, we just made 12 mini baby donuts, aren't they cute? Look. (baby laughter) So each one of these\ndonuts is 128 calories. It may seem like a lot, but\nthese are made of all natural healthy ingredients with\nonly five grams of carbs and three grams of sugar. in normal Krispy Kreme\ndonut, it's gonna be 22 grams of carbs and 10 grams of sugar and about 200 calories. So this is completely\noptional but who doesn't like a donut without some glaze. So what I did here was\nmix half a banana that was microwaved for about one minute with a quarter cup of almond milk. Basically whatever it takes you to get to this type of consistency. Now this is the exciting\npart because who doesn't like a donut without glaze? So once you have this\nlittle bugger right here, you take your mini baby donut,\nand tip its head in there, give it a little twist\nand then you get to pick. Should I do coconut or\nshould I do walnuts? Oh, looks like it's a coconut,\nso I'm gonna do coconut. So, bam, here he goes. Let's get all that goodness on there. And voila, coconut topped\nalmond flour donut. Let's see how our walnut\ncrusted one will taste. This I ground up in my magic bullet. Look at that baby. Oh yeah, you sexy. Okay, now we're gonna\nfinish up all of them and then we're gonna have a feast. Okay, so let me do this. (cheery music) You guys, look at our tower of donuts. Oh my goodness, don't\nthey look scrumptious and so ready to be eaten. Okay, so I'm gonna take\nthis queen right on top. Are you ready? Come heather. (dramatic music) Oh my goodness. That was insane in the\nmembrane that was so good guys, you have to try this mini\nbaby donut recipe at home, made with just almond flour\nand all natural ingredients. This is amazing. Please make it for your\nfriends, your mom, your dad, your husband, your daughter,\nyour baby, everybody. This is amazing. So let me know in the comments below, what you want me to healthify\nnext and I will see you for another workout on Monday\nand another recipe next week on Thursday on cheap clean eats. I love you so much and I'll see you later. Bye. (dramatic music)", "7ToVjMC-FlU": "what's going on guys welcome back to my very first video and first review today we're going to be reviewing the new roach pocket vapes these are pretty new from my understanding these are pretty new to the market especially out here in california so i thought we might as well make a video about it um i went ahead and pulled up the page of these new pocket vapes these roach vapes now i have not tried them yet so it's gonna be a first for me designed by tma labs in california tma lapse is a full service vape cartridge manufacturer from concept to manufacturing we control the entire process and ensure results for every client now this is the world's smallest fully disposable vape cartridge as you guys can see now this thing should have a battery and everything i shouldn't mean nothing with this thing so let's go ahead and turn back on the camera here it seems we've got some hybrid sour cherry pie and my addition is up there as you guys can see is two thousand two thousand eight hundred fifty one out of four thousand eighty eight so these are exclusive to an extent there's only about a certain amount per stream that they'll produce so let's go ahead and figure out how to open this up okay it looks like we got a pamphlet here love it toke it fill it pass it plug it sneak it rip it hit it roach it then recycle it okay i'm liking it presentation is good now in california it's not a standard to have a whole box beautiful set up like this but for the disposables i believe they do require it you can't just throw these in a bag now let's go ahead and open this up so as we can see we're going to go ahead and slice that open let's use using a little nail for this all right it's a little difficult to open up i'll say that all right all right now i gotta say that the name kind of throwing me off a little bit you know what i mean like some raid roach sprayer type of vibram you know what i'm saying but wow this thing really is small wow jesus and i mean that is some dark juice right there now i am going to take pictures of this for you guys as well and i'll display them in the video all right that looks pretty cool as you guys can see it's not that dark but it is pretty dark let's see if we can add some light on there wow that is badass and i mean that's battery included okay so we put some light up to the juice yeah it's pretty dark it's not the clearest but that does not matter let's go ahead and give her a taste all right so i guess we just hit it this now you guys may have not seen the hit come out but it definitely felt it definitely felt the peak when they hit flavor wise i can taste the sheer cherry it does take tastes a bit dark though like like an indica kind of heavy which ain't bad but you definitely have that indica taste with it now it is a hybrid we will take another hit for the video's sake but you know give me a minute there boys wow so far i mean i packed a punch in that hit if i'm not mistaken okay yeah this is sour cherry pie all right all right let's get real here one more fire now you guys are probably asking yourself how much i paid for this now these do go for 40 and i believe says 380 milligrams so i think we're looking at a half honestly but who knows how much wax is in this it does seem like quite a bit i will post in the comments how long it lasted me i'm not gonna go ahead and straight smoke this for the next couple days because i mean i plan on doing a ton of reviews for you guys i got a bunch of new stuff i got some i haven't smoked this one yet either bloom imperial extracts i have tried one of their cards pretty damn fire um i got cure pods for days you know we'll give them bad boys a shot it's all right and i'm gonna be honest with you guys if i don't recommend something i'll let you know none of this stuff is sponsored i do get 25 discounts to most of the dispensaries i go to because that's because i have a chronic health issue but needless to say forty dollars this packed punch now is it worth 40 dollars half a gram i'd say yes you know you don't have to have a battery it is portable now i'm not sure if you guys can charge these that's the only reason i never buy these is because you can usually run in the chance of them dying out on you now it is not common but i've had bad luck before but yeah needless to say this is the roach cartridge i appreciate all of you for tuning in to this video leave it a like for me guys and leave a comment down below if you tried this or plan to try it and subscribe to channel if you haven't

cart to you guys if you need something quick on the go if you don't have a battery pick up a roach cart i mean you ain't gonna lose 40 bucks half a gram that is a bit steep but then again you got you guys got to think about it it has its own battery and it's the smallest bit we vape cartridge in the world right now come on i mean i say it's worth it let me know what you guys think down in the comments below i appreciate you for checking out this video give me your time and i'll see you in the next one signing out", "1ygBrGb9mwc": "what's going on are pretty Tom here with cute Alexa and is with great pride today that I bring you a keto noodle recipe now I'm not talking about zucchini noodles I'm not talking about konjac noodles I'm talking real legitimate pasta like you can see with this fettuccine alfredo that I made right here I'm gonna throw this up on the screen but hang tight to the end for a taste testing this is gonna be awesome but I'm gonna show you guys how to make it the first thing you're going to want to do is clean off your countertop we are going to be pouring everything directly on the counter so make sure it's nice and clean once that's done add one cup of finely ground almond flour to your counter top to that pile of almond flour we're going to add two teaspoons of xanthan gum xanthan gum is a keto thickening agent and it's gonna help the pasta actually achieve the consistence we want without it falling apart next up is psyllium husk powder now psyllium husk butter is what's going to give the dough that kind of stretchy elasticity that we need for pasta now the measurement for that is going to be two tablespoons plus a half a teaspoon the reason for that extra half a teaspoon is I found that at two tablespoons it still falls apart just a little bit too easily and if I go with an extra teaspoon it becomes a little too thick now you will have to play with this a little bit depending on how large your eggs are because they all differ and the last dry ingredient going into this is 1/2 teaspoon of salt now I'm just using table salt because I have a whole box of it feel free to use whatever type of salt you feel like using today once all your dry ingredients are in a pile on the counter use a fork to mix it and break up all clumps now the clumps are really bad but so is not having it thoroughly mixed because you need that xanthan gum and psyllium husk butter be evenly distributed if you get a pocket that doesn't have either of those ingredients what's gonna happen is your pasta is going to have holes in it and fall apart once it's well combined create a well in the middle to which we are going to add two large eggs [Applause] now it is time to mix what I like to do is take a fork and whisk the eggs in the center of the well initially and slowly bring in more flour from the outside of the well at some point the dough will become too fixed to continue mixing with a fork at that point I like to cut over using my hands you will notice at first the dough does not like to stick together very well but the more you knead it it will continue to stick together I also like to kind of Pat the dough around to pick up any loose pieces of flour or dough chunks that I've missed once you're convinced that the egg is sufficiently mixed in just make a ball out of it and set it on the counter for about two minutes just to allow the psyllium husk powder to absorb some moisture you'll see here that I'm cutting the dough ball into quarters this is because I do not have a pasta machine so I'm going to be rolling it by hand my rolling pin isn't that large and neither of my sheets of parchment paper so this is the most efficient way that I can do it believe me if you have a pasta machine you really are gonna want to use it but since I don't I'm gonna make do with what I have [Music] as to not bore you with minutes and me rolling pasta dough I'm gonna go ahead and skip forward here after my dough's reached between a sixteenth and an eighth of an inch I like to kind of trim off the edges to make it more square you don't have to if you don't mind uneven looking pasta but this is the internet and everything has to look pretty and once again since I don't have a pasta maker I'm just using a pizza cutter to cut thin strips of noodles they are g''l click fettuccine noodles and that's perfectly okay to me I don't really care what shape my needles are if you have a special machine to make spaghetti noodles or whatever feel free to use it but honestly this is just the easiest thing that I can do once I've gotten as many noodles as I think I can out of a sheet I'm just gonna sprinkle a little bit of psyllium husk butter so they don't stick together once I'm completely done I'm gonna add the whole pile of noodles to a pot of boiling water for one to two minutes and then strain all the water out don't let it sit in there too long or your pasta can stick together and now that you guys have seen how to make it it is time for the taste test now what I have right here is the noodles that we just made and then I took the keto alfredo sauce recipe that I made in the video that I'm gonna put in the car right now no fair warning it's an old video of mine I'll just get my feet wet on YouTube and it's kind of cringing but the recipe is still really good so I took that sauce made it with these noodles and now it is time to taste it so as you guys can see we have some noodles we have some legit lengths of these I'm gonna go and taste it that is fantastic guys and kind of linear a good comparison is a softer noodle like if you've ever had fresh pasta it kind of reminds me that it's not going to be economically but I like al dente that you'll get from dried pasta but it tastes like fresh pasta the sauce is killer and is like the perfect substitute also the macker in this are amazing check it out if you guys have not the recipe is gonna be down below now not anything else guys I'm gonna close to the video if you liked the video leave it a like if you have any questions or comments leave in the comment sections and if you have not subscribed yet do me a huge favor subscribe to my channel helps me out a lot and encourages me to make more videos like this and since this is so awesome you didn't want to share this all your friends right do that for me and I'll catch you guys in the next one",

"-1YVK6MlgHY": "um so i am taking the time to record a workshop or re-record a workshop that i recently did um with the temple of anu in regards to the comedic practitioners box and specifically talking about candles so um the time went really really fast and then um i got to thinking based on the feedback hey why don't i re-record this put it out there so that other people can kind of utilize the information so here we go all right so um again as i mentioned the um name of this workshop is the practitioners toolbox and actually this is a series that i would like to do where i highlight various tools that cometic practitioners or contemporary comment to you utilize in their everyday spiritual practice so um let's get started so first things first if you are new to my youtube channel to my instagram to pretty much me in general um my name is mignette um i am an initiate as i said earlier um of the temple of anu and i have been uh with the temple avenue for a i believe 11 years now so um back in 2012 i was i did go and um complete my initiation into the temple and i received my name uh my name is mignet ankh and ma'at menta and that means she who finds pleasure living in balance and harmony or ma'at um established on earth and i was given this name by nisitbiti rasanku kever um so after i got my initiation and you know still took some classes and things like that part of being a contemporary practitioner is constantly trying to find new ways to apply the ancient ancestral wisdom to apply um the various thought processes to our lives in the 21st century so i really really try to concentrate on reading on researching and learning about the ancient way of doing things and essentially what does that look like and updated if you will and if it even needs updating so uh let's go ahead so my objective or my objectives for today's presentation or workshop is to know what is the difference between egyptology and cometicism um so we're going to go over like just some basic little history stuff nothing too deep um the purpose of candles and ritual work working with various natura and their energy and basically like because you can work with the various natural um with candles and without candles so i'm just going over the part that has to do with the candles obviously um different ways candles can be used in ritual and spiritual practice various classes of candles and different ways that you can prepare care and dispose of these ritual candles once you have used them so um this actually doesn't really pertain right now simply because this was a live workshop so this was just going over the etiquette and expectations of the audience so uh the part that is still relevant is this section so as the presentation continues you will see in the bottom right hand corner a little pdf icon and even though you are watching this um days months weeks possibly even years after this workshop you can still have access to the free materials i am offering um within this workshop all right so let's get started so first um when i did do the live session i wanted to take the temperature of the room and i really um at this time want to encourage you all to think about in your life what experiences have you already had uh using candles um this can be in general this can be secularly this can be within your religious or spiritual upbringing either one so the way that we went about this we used what's called a padlet where multiple people can essentially share their thoughts with each other simultaneously in lifetime so that ended up looking like this so some of the uh responses were you know birthdays romantic occasions um baths when the power goes out camping and different experiences like that so um i am hopeful that you all have similar uh answers for that section too um before we go very very quickly i really wanted to take the time to kind of just go over basic vocabulary when it comes to um schematic living and just being commit to you we we do have certain vocabulary that we use and sometimes we kind of forget that people who are new don't necessarily know or aren't as familiar with these terms so i wanted to go over these terms before i kind of continue and just assume that you already know what these things are and as you see there is a pdf at the bottom so if you would like a pdf that kind of goes in a little more detail about these vocabulary words or more vocabulary and and like sayings and things like that feel free to fill out the form at the end so chem it you can see it sometimes with vowels sometimes without vowels um this is the ara area in africa that we can temporarily now call uh egypt kameti that is a person of chemic or a contemporary practitioner if we wanted to be plural we would say come to you nature this is the written language contemporarily we call this now hieroglyphics when we say we are talking about the double king um so that is the uh if you're familiar the united crown of lower and upper chemet the red and the white crown um so this pharaoh as we may have learned in high school or grade school king or monarch um but it is represented by the crown that is being worn um bce before the common era simply because bc pertains to christian canon history and because we are not utilizing that timeline we do not need to subscribe to those labels of time so bce before the common era um that means words of power nature or netir neter i've heard it pronounced different ways similar to just like in english we have various dialects and pronunciations for words tomato tomato same thing so this is the almighty unseen creative force of the universe it is the creator of all things netaru again tomato zamato different people pronounce it on different ways for various reasons uh the various specific manifestations of natter and then finally we have the yitmo natir this is the mother father creator so there is no um in other religious belief like that there is one deity um that is male there is no one deity that is female the all the creator of all is both male and female this does not mean i know in 21st century where um you know trans and lgbtq plus and it doesn't have anything to do with that it is this it is the very idea that each one of us has both uh gendered uh qualities you can um be assertive you can be um aggressive you can be very outgoing like these are considered masculine principles whereas being more reserved being quiet being um that type of way is considered to be feminine and again it doesn't have to do with body parts it doesn't have to do with patriarchy or anything like that this is pre those systems um if you need or would like more information i would recommend you possibly look into reading um the kabillion where it it kind of gets into gendered principles like that um all right so normandy ellis um in her book awakening osiris which that is like really one of my pet peeves utilizing um utilizing greek terminology it is not uh authentic therefore i usually do not use it but because that is what she named her book i don't want to you know kind of confuse people so her book is called awakening osiris the egyptian book of the dead again super not accurate but again that's what she named it um so if you are familiar with the part m hero the predam hero is a somewhat i don't even say somewhat it is an advanced text it is not for beginners it has very many layers and this isn't to um offend anyone or insult anyone it just is what it is um you have to be very familiar with the customs the culture the history um to get context and you know even not being a practitioner and reading the book you will miss certain things simply because that is not your belief system so you know certain dots will not get connected so if you do want to read that book i definitely recommend reading uh normandy alice's book just because it kind of gives you a little bit of context and understanding and so then you know when you read the original text it just kind of makes a little more sense um and it helps you kind of sort through it it just makes it a little easier but um even then i would definitely recommend like that's a book you have to read a little bit put it down read it come back and things like that but um anywho in her book uh one of the quotations that she um kind of she tries to like update it and put it into contemporary language so that's one of like i said why i like that book my body is but wax and wick for flame when the candle burns out the light shines elsewhere so um it's this idea that um it is not necessarily about a physical candle but again it's what the candle represents which i will get into so throughout different spiritual systems we see a multitude of um religions and groups of people that utilize candles for very different and similar reasons so we have jewish people we have muslim people we have hindu people we have buddhist people we have people who practice santeria we have many different kinds of people and kamites are just like other spiritual systems where we use candles um so symbolically um as you all saw with you know just that opening question um the symbolism and meaning we related to candles we will learn we related i'm sorry we related to birthdays we relate it to romance we relate it to relaxation we relate it to memorial service when people pass away and memor and memorializing people so um we have very many different uses for candles specifically within um spiritual systems usually candles are used to remind us of divine light to remind us of the light that we have within um it is very conducive for prayer and meditation and healing anyone who has taken a ritual or spiritual bath or even just a bath after a long day at work like those candles just kind of set a different tone and put you at a different vibration so to ensure that we are paying more attention to the comedic application i wanted to take a moment to just talk about the sash madu nature when it comes to candles we know that this is something that existed back then because there were words and there were texts that talked about it like if it didn't exist it wouldn't be in the vocabulary or lexicon so um these are just five um words that i found there are others but these are the ones that i chose to present so the first uh word is um gemhet the next one is the one at the bottom kabu and on the other side we have i'm like i got to prepare myself so um if you're familiar with uh what we would call middle eastern they have that like kind of sound um i'm not a linguist so i don't know the technical term for it but it that's what you're doing for that kh sound so um so they both pronounced differently i mean i'm sorry they're both pronounced the same way but they are spelled differently um and we have things like that in english where we use the same pronunciation but you spell it differently all right so further uh when it comes to the commentty and candle specifically because it is ancient history candles didn't look the same candles did not look the same at all like to have wax and a glass thing and this i thought you know like that's technology so um what the original candles did look like were similar to like rush lights where it was a molded um like out of clay and they would put oil or animal fat and inside with some um something that smelled good because he wants to burn some animal fat anybody trying to smell that all day is nasty or tasty you know whatever if you're hungry so you put it in there they put the wick and then they use that to light do their rituals etc they also um would use incense which is very well known so i mean unfortunately i'm sticking to candles but i kind of like layered that in there so incense is part of that too so here is more evidence of again candles incense and just again this use of fire for spiritual purposes or um controlled fire for spiritual purposes so we can um specifically look into the pert and so um and i know like i know some people are gonna kill me for rolling my arse with that but the perdum peru has to um it was a very individualized text there was no one pert and herrera there was this canon of text and then it was specifically applied to the person as they needed therefore this specific pert and hero is not the usual one that is thought of which is the papress of annie this is the papres of uh nebsony so um this paparas is from the bronze age which is the 18th dynasty specifically the first dynasty within the new kingdom and this is approximately the 15th century bce so when we focus in on um chapter 137 b we see the um picture there we also see obviously all of the sash manufacturer around it so this specifically is like the whole papres is talking about again using light using fire in a controlled way um as well in as incense to give protection and setting light to a vessel um for ritualistic purposes once someone passes away which i will kind of like get into that a little more later so again we're referring to the text where like this was a thing that they did so the reason why this is very very important is because there are a lot of people whether it be on youtube facebook instagram that um call themselves canites but they um don't necessarily practice the spiritual system they research they read they appreciate this is an egyptologist this you know this is uh an academic or intellectual movement so if a person is um being academic and intellectualizing and not necessarily talking about the spiritual metaphysical applications to everyday life that is how you can tell the difference between an egyptologist and a uh a practitioner i don't know i had like a little space in there like what okay so um egyptology was i don't even want to say it was started in in europe like it technically wasn't because even within ancient chemet um as time because it was thousands of years as time went on they would go back and study their own past so it's not like this is just something europeans came along and did um but you know they did it within their time period then the greeks were trying to study then you know other um western asian cultures came in and conquered and you know and studied and things like that so um but egyptology in its incarnation the way we know it today does come out of europe specifically the late 1800s so again as i said this is much different than um cometicism or current command to you because uh these are people who study the academics they they study the metaphysics and then they again try to apply it and use the ancient wisdom to guide their everyday life in an effort to uphold the 42 tepras so um this is the major difference if a person is not talking about ritual if they are not if they are just talking about book knowledge that's cool that's respectable i appreciate you because lord knows i can't read all the books in the world so i mean you know it's a help but um you know it is very important to understand that distinction so when we're talking about religion and spirituality in ancient chemists specifically um it's a popular view simply because of the texts that are kind of put out there that oh like you know there was all about death it was all about the afterlife blasey blah i'm sure all of you know that that is not the case there were medical paparas that are out there there are um astrological um calendars i'm sorry not astrological um astronomy not astrology sorry um so there are many other uh like architecture medicine there are there's just so many different other types of paparas out there but the ones that mostly get talked about are the ones that have to do with the afterlife um but again this idea of going to the west and transitioning it was just another uh life it was not like you're going up like going up somewhere it's like yes you had to traverse and and go through different tests and things like that but again it's reflective of what kind of life are you living here and now were you trying to uphold my and you know if you're doing what you need to do and you're living life as a decent person you get to live again later as a decent ancestor like it's just a continuation like so at this point if this was live i would say you know if you have any questions put them in the chat if you have any questions you know unmute yourself let's talk but this is pre-recorded so i'm gonna go ahead so when we're thinking about candles for um the 21st century we want to think about our candle quality um there are many many many different types of wax that um is out there to use for your candle so the most popular is paraffin wax it's very versatile um you know but it does come from crude oil so personally i'm not gonna lie i still use paraffin wax candles like i'm not all like who knew that's beneath me like no like it that's what i can afford so that's what i you know but i try to do the best i can get the best quality i can because again this is for ritual so my intention is to give the best that i can um since it is something that does come from crude oil i do try to make sure that when i do burn the candle so you see them burning back there and that's the tall ones they are paraffin um i do have a window open so i'm just not sitting in a room with it burning burning burning the other um wax that's out there that is like ah maybe that might not be the super most natural would be gel wax so any candle that you see that like looks clear or looks like water or gel gel wax and it um it's made from a combination of resin and mineral oil which again same thing i would recommend just keeping your windows open um just in case because it's not like there have been extensive studies on on that type of thing but just as a progression so the more natural waxes we have beeswax which we know um lit in the later uh dynasties that beeswax was used after the rush lights um so that was the first kind of wax that was used as an actual candle and something to be burned and things like that we have palm wax um which again it's a natural oil comes from palm oil uh we got bay berry wax that actually didn't become popular until like you know 13 colonies ye oldes establishment of america sorry my energy my inner history teacher wanted to come out and play real quick all right and then finally soy wax which um again if you look behind me like the shorter glass candles those are soy wax candles made from soy um you do want to be mindful of the soy wax candles just because a lot of times they are blended with other waxes so um you might want to ask or just read the labels when you're buying them um because sometimes they are mixed with paraffin wax blend so just be careful so the next thing we want to talk about is wick quality so again it's all about your budget it's all about you know what's out there and i fully believe in trying to be as educated as possible and again we i would like to think that as we do ritual we want to give our best put our best foot forward and we don't want to do things out of ignorance so that's why we're doing this part right now so the first thing is a zinc core um used to be a lead core so you know this when you see a wick and it stands straight up and technically if you look like down at it you'll see like a little gray dot in the middle that's how you know it is a zinc core um wick same thing as as i said with the paraffin wax because it comes from crude oil so because it's burning zinc leave a window open you know again no judgment if that's what you can afford if that's what you want if that's what you like um you know i would just recommend maybe having a window open or just being well ventilated uh the next that we have is the cotton core so that's the bottom all the way to the left next followed by a paper core a hemp core then core less and then a wooden wick which seems to be very popular i'm not gonna lie i personally don't really care for wooden wicks just because i feel like they don't burn and um they don't burn all the way down to the bottom not that they don't burn they do but they don't burn all the way to the bottom it always kind of like ends early and then i have like this little pool of wax that can never be used because the wick doesn't go all the way down so i do want to make mention that uh when you do have the coreless and i'm like let me see if i can um show this real quick stop presenting to see if i can try to all right so this is um an offset candle this is one of the soy ones um you could tell i use candles a lot and for people who are into candle stuff you see that soot so doing work but anyway my point in that is that you can kind of see right there that um can you see it on this side so you see how it kind of like curls over itself please make sure that you um before you light the candle like so if you use it you cover it you never blow out a candle when you're using it for ritual purposes like this is totally not like birthdays um the idea is when you light a candle and you light that wick and you put that intention and you're doing all of that you don't want to blow it out because it's it's like you're getting rid of the energy so you always want to cover it and smother it and to let it go out if you are lighting incense it's the same thing you don't just and let it go like no if you want to wave it if you want to just let it sit it eventually burns out um but anywho so my point is when you have that coreless wick please make sure that you trim it because that's another contributing factor to all that uh you know black soot on the top um i know that people you know say it has different spiritual meanings and then how thick it is and all that other stuff which i'm not saying isn't you know true but i definitely noticed that when i don't cut the wick that that happens way more often just saying all right back to the presentation y'all okay okay so we have gone over wix let me put that down so again if this was live i'll be like hey y'all y'all got any questions for me what you know backwards so um if you do have some questions you can put them in the comments section um i like i said i'm gonna be uploading this to youtube so if you're watching this on youtube um you can put it in the comments section and i will definitely answer and get back to you alright so next choosing your candle so before you even get started before your ritual work is a twinkle in your eye you want to sit and think about it you may want to take a day two an hour to what have you to pray and meditate on the following questions so think about or identify who needs assistance maybe you need assistance maybe you need guidance maybe you need clarity or something like that but who start with the who um you can think like oh you know what my mom is you know just got diagnosed with such and such or my father just lost his job or you know my grandparent just passed away or you know like who are you thinking of needs this prayer meditative uh ritual and spiritual work next what is the need what is the want what is the desire so this you really want to try to connect with that vibration you really want to think like do i need to cultivate something do i need to connect with something do i need to embody a whole energy because all of those are very different things um or do you just need direct assistance like you know how people say take the wheel like do you need the netaroo to come through and drive for the next couple miles um to help you get to your destination safely like do you need that because sometimes we do and sometimes we just need the nectar to be in the back seat and sometimes we need the natural on the phone so that they can be like yeah turn make that next left so what is the need what is the desire then next why is this a need or a desire because we all want things we all say we need things we all desire things but that don't mean that's really what's for us so um and i know this is like kind of trivial but it's not like like you know i need chocolate cake i want chocolate cake i desire chocolate cake the scale says i don't need no chocolate cake so i mean i'm using a little bit of humor but you're not going to go and do ritual for chocolate cake but um you know is this something that you truly need is it is it going to lead to your positive positive evolution is it going to help another person is it within ma'at and literally read down all those 42 and see if what your intention is and what you want to do this work around fits in with the 42 if it is go go for it get started keep watching the video if not stop sit maybe you got to do some eft maybe you gotta you know pray some more for you know something else or what like for things to shift maybe you need some kepler in your life like need to move this over here move over there we gotta transform um and then finally how do i intend to use this candle what is its specific function some people especially depending on what your um religious and spiritual background was before this point um you don't think about the function you just kind of do it you just kind of oh you feel it you this you that and sometimes especially when something is new understanding like what that function is helps bring you another level of clarity and connection which is very important all right so there are many different types of candles and many different applications and how you use them um but i am only going over four basics like this is supposed to be like a basic overview uh so you have your invocation candle this represents the nectar natural and their specific energy you have an astral uh candle that represents you personally or if you're if you're if the work is for someone else it represents the other person personal wishes desires all of that it you'll see when i get there offertory so if you got a new job and you like do i need to like let me light this candle let me pour some live agents let me give some stuff on my altar to say thank you because like i've been doing my work and you came through and i appreciate you and i love you so you know get that give back that reciprocity all right and then finally memorial this is uh around ancestor work this can be recently departed ancestors as well as lineage ancestors or even societal ancestors i'll get to that so invocation and vacation candles um they're traditionally used um like so if you have an altar and you've set up an altar or you wish to set up an altar this is usually like your focal point to your whole altar it's like what everything is centering around um specifically like i personally prefer statues and not for nothing i'm a very very visual person some like so what my needs are may not necessarily be um your needs or maybe you don't identify with that and that's cool that's fine um but i usually like a a statue and and um an invocation candle i kind of like it's like ma to me like it's that balance um so again the purpose can range um it can be to petition and specifically ask for something call upon on that natural or the netarus energy connect with them um but generally speaking uh that is your focal point that is what you're focusing your work on excuse me so uh comedic invocation candles so um primarily uh there are some etsy stores that do offer some candles out there um there are different shrines and temples that um offer some candles so i would definitely say check out your local um shrine or temple uh or perhaps even etsy like i personally get my candles through temple of anu just because that's where i go uh so the candles that they have look like this so you have the image which is made by um one of the initiates um he does the visuals and the artwork for uh all of the natural candles so you have the name of the um and well this is a female so nathert um you have a picture because again i'm visual i like pictures some people don't that's fine um and then it also has at the bottom down here what the actual energy is so for hat hero love healing harmony abundance um you can do this for self love work you can do this if you're working on your self-esteem you can use it if you're uh needing to heal your inner child if you need to heal uh relationships between you and your parents your brothers and sisters if you're trying to heal old traumas and stuff that's happened to you like with any hero come in clutch so um and then what's nice about this also is that it has like a blurb so again if your brand spanking new you don't know that much you're not super familiar with the natural um it does have something like a little explanation on there for you and then obviously never leave burning candles unattended i have been super guilty of that and shamefully so because i have literally in my life set my house on fire three times do not be like me this is one of the reasons why i actually really like these because they're always in glass like i'm very very wary of burning candles that are not surrounded by glass and um outside of this like i have those glass things that you get at dollar tree and i put all my candles on top of it just in case so um please practice fire safety especially depending on what energy you're using and what you know sometimes you might be praying and you pray a little hard and i'm not gonna lie that's literally how one time i caught my house on fire i was talking the second man second it's like word be careful i'm just saying so that's had her room uh then there's also this one so i just wanted to kind of illustrate the fact that there are both male and female um natural candles so again we got her the name up here we got the imagery and then we have like the energy uh so strength willpower victory success um trying to cultivate your highest self um i get you know how sometimes i mean sometimes i will use this so like in in a masculine fashion like ascending my throne um establishing you know that piece of me although i somewhat feel like that might be a little bit of a nassar a little bit of like an assassin you know so anyway and to who so same thing you got the description on the back and again don't leave it burning if you're not there if you leave even if you're just going down to move the cars around or you're running down to the corner store like please just cover it up and then re-light it when you come back like please don't leave them so the other ones that temple of anu does have and this is simply because after a while i got tired of like like i burn resin i burn incense um but sometimes i don't want to burn and have the smoke so um there are also these these are the scented candles um they are very very strong like literally you do not need a whole lot you can burn this and your whole house like i mean i know i have two but legit that's just for y'all like i literally only burned one scented candle at a time just because they are so strong like i could walk to the other side of my apartment and i will smell it like it they're very very strong so same thing where um you don't necessarily have the imagery but you do have the seche medu nature they do have like the energy on there um these candles if i'm not mistaken will last to me i want to say if i'm using them sparingly um i have been able to stretch them for two months if i'm not being sparing about a week and a half of almost constant burn um the tall um candles i want to say similar where um don't break them now um that if you burn the tall candles almost consistently you'll get maybe like a week and a day a week and two days out of it if you use it on and off then it'll obviously go longer so the other type of candle and i didn't want to show the other one i have well this person comes has different sizes um so there i in general i love scented candles um but this one is not scented this one comes from uh free spirit uh delicacies uh she is out of kentucky it's a woman-owned um business and she creates these candles um so if you are into um what is it that if i'm not mistaken i don't remember if shoppers are hindu or buddhist i know i know it's like an asian um thing but um so anyways um i'm like going over on tangent come back magnet come back so the reason why i like this candle specifically is that um if you are trying to work on your whole self um and she does have ones that just specifically concentrate on one chakra or i know as some committee say if you are working on that specific energy you will get a candle that is all that one color um but the reason why i like her and unfortunately these are not scented but um they're hand poured um i do believe it is soy if i'm not mistaken but the thing that i really like about it is she grows her own herbs and then she uses the herbs that associate with that specific arit or chakra she uses crystal like this one's like kind of big so yikes i'm like i don't want to drop it too bad so like you see that right there so she puts like crystals in it she puts um sage in it like a smudge so as it burns you got the herbal magic you got the whole you know little mix thing going on there so um these are smaller so just in comparison so y'all can see they are smaller um but again it's a different function so depending on your intention what it is you're trying to do um yeah she does also have like smaller ones that are like that big um so you don't necessarily have to get all big candles she does have smaller ones too um so yeah spiritual candles so when it comes to your invocation candles these are the most popular natural um that people usually work with so you got empu amun asar a set um boss or some people say bastets best jehudi some people say hootie my arts montu min nebbet hat nefertum neck bets neath uh newt noon pata satesh sekhmet which again like i said if you're trying to work with with segment you better be careful because like legit help like house caught on fire be careful um shashat sebak spadet or sukdet um and wadjets or ujjat people would say you know like that so um you'll see that there is a pdf there so if you uh need or would like more information as far as like the different net to rules what their different energies are um you know so you can kind of help determine like okay well what kind of netaroo do i need to be trying to um invite into my space so that's the purpose of that specific pdf all right so next we have astral candles um so astral candles are all about you or if your work is centered on someone else it's all about them so it can be a candle that is their favorite color if it's a scented candle it could be their favorite smell it can be what if they're really into astrology it could be something based on their astrology um if you are close to that person as a comedic practitioner so um i can't speak for all temples because all temples are a little bit different so just like other religions that um have different denominations if you will so um so does the um do kinetic practitioners and community like we're not all exactly the same we all believe generally this the same core but how we practice and what it looks like and how we pronounce things and how we practice how it like celebrate holidays and traditions like it'll vary depending on what temple and shrine that you're part of so um some if you'll notice that some like asara sets if you're familiar with sacred woman if you're familiar with raseki temple of anu new asset temple like everybody some temples will say no these colors are for this netaru and other colors you'll go to another temple and it'll be a totally different color so um but anyways my point in saying all of this is that um in at least my experience if a person gets a reading and it says like what netaru is they're kind of like guiding um deity if you will through this life maybe you might want to consider getting a candle so um that energy like you're making that connection so like me i have a reading i have three specific netaru um that guide my life my destiny and things like that and then i have a different deity that kind or natural or nature sorry that um kind of governs my name um so these are all the different energies that kind of surround me so if someone was trying to um i guess pray for me they might want to get those specific natural or one of those natural to say hey yo your girl need help so i'ma burn this candle for her so um and like i said colors and scents like the best thing is intuition so if a smell like if suddenly like i mean i don't know if y'all could tell my favorite color is pink you saw how short that was like so this ain't nothing there anyway i'm a focus man yet um um so if it was again using myself as an example i would get pink candles i would my second favorite color is red um i prefer gold over silver i put you know like so if i was just thinking like that or there are certain smells like i like musk smells or very very flowery smells um so you know that might be you know like all of that will be taken into account so the next colors in their meaning so we want to be mindful of like if i want to pray for healing for my uncle i may not necessarily get a red candle for him if that's my intention like if it's a specific thing like i want healing for that person this person is really having a hard time i need them to have peace like don't get them no re don't get no right candle for them like be very mindful and again the more you know the better choices you'll make the more powerful uh the connection and ritual will be so again you see that pdf so if you want any um information on that you can reach out on that so next we have offertory like i said operatory candles are all about um really really um trying to connect with very very specific requests or um being thankful for something that has already happened or if you're doing like manifestation work you're already thinking like do you wanna do ajahudi for helping me today uh do this presentation like i felt like blah blah blah and you really helped me get the right words and speak with a wise mind to the audience so i'ma like this candle and i hope that you you accept my prayers and yada yada like that's how it would kind of go so um if you are asking for something um you want to choose a time period so 24 hours three three days five days seven days a month six months three months like pick a specific time that you want to do this work with excuse me that you want to do this work and um give yourself a time every day during that time period to sit light that candle pray meditate like pray on what it is you're looking for pray on that clarity if you need clarity pray on please open the way and poo like i i you know i'm not happy with my job i know it's covered but i need to find a new job you know i just i feel so stressed yada yada please help open the way and then after you say your prayers you pour your libations you give your like i said you light the candle you offer it you sit and you meditate and you receive like what is example gonna say back to you you know so again it's that reciprocity back and forth and then next we have memorial candles so it was so important to remember your ancestors um like that was a huge thing and even throughout africa like um in various cultures that's a really really big thing being remembered it's this idea if you are living a miotic life you are able to transition and go to the happy place and you can come back and see your family and stuff like that and visit with them and commune with them and they will still remember you and they will still call your name and um so that's this idea of like that's how you live life eternal because your family members remember you we remember our family members so they never die it is only when we stop calling their names that they they go through that second death so if you've ever seen the movie coco um that's kind of like a very similar um way of looking at it and that's like a contemporary illustration so um i personally um have had it put on my heart that i want to start creating memorial candles uh for myself um again because i'm visual like usually when you're doing memorial candles usually memorial candles are just plain white candles um you can get the pull out candles if you wish or just a plain white in the glass it's up to you how you want but again i want to remember my ancestors like um so i am creating a line of memorial candles um for my own um purposes but um it is my hope hopefully in the next couple of months that i am able to offer um to others being able to have personalized memorial candles so like if you're getting married and you want to remember your mother or father or grandparents or whomever um you can have a candle it'll have the prayer directly on it'll have the seshmedia right on there like it would be saged it would be um like anointed and prayed over and you know infused with positive energy um so just because it's so incredibly important the more that i learn about taking care of our ancestors and feeding them and talking to them um it's just very very very important so um if you are ever i guess interested in something like that or somebody recently passes away and you know people usually get them shirts um but if you want to get like personalized memorial candles or something like that that is a project that um i am hoping to launch within the next um few months so um you can always go to my uh my blog or my instagram and you'll see any updates there all right so again if we were live and in person i'd be like hey y'all y'all got any questions but we not so again if you got any questions put them in the chat i'm not in the chat i'm so sorry in the comments so spiritual candle care and we are like starting to round and come to the um close of the presentation so spiritual candle um care you have to cleanse your candle like no lie when i bought this candle and i'm not because i haven't used it yet like you see it's new so when i bought this uh i i actually like i buy like a bunch of candles at once so um but i don't clean them until i'm getting ready to use them so the idea is who was holding that box of candles before you got them who stopped it on the shelf like what was their energy looking like or you know like maybe he was having a bad day or maybe they just you know got got yelled at or reprimanded at work or you know maybe somebody just passed away so their energy is connected like everything that's why they say you'd be very careful of who touches you or who does your hair and things like that because of that energy transference i mean um we learned that in science class in high school about energy energy never dies it just transfers so you know it's the same thing like my energy if my if i have poo poo energy i'm gonna put my poo poo energy on your candle and now you just you can't just throw it up on the altar because now you're putting poo-poo energy on your altar like you don't want to do that that's no bueno all right so um you might want to um say he's the can i'm like i keep putting it down i might as well just keep it so when you have the candle if you got some sage you can you know like the sage and just hold it like that do the sides i usually like to do things in fours so i usually sage one two like go back and forth four times front and back four times and hold it and then before i even light the candle before i even do anything i hold it upside down and i'll let the smoke cleared out so sage clears all energy good bad whatever so this it's like a energetic reset for the candle so uh if you don't have sage um you can also use florida water um you might want to be careful with this because it does have alcohol in it so if you put it up here please make sure that you wait like you don't just pour it in there oh my god what if that was open i would have been so upset anyway you'll just pour it on there because there's alcohol in there and then you're gonna have a pool of alcohol and then then you really gonna have some segment fireworks don't do that but um i would say like you know put a little bit like pour a little bit in your hands rub it together like you know you can kind of if you want to like kind of say a prayer or something like that um over it while it's in your hand if you want to like sprinkle it like that you could do that um and then finally also like temple of anu has this liquid altar so you can just spray it all over so any of those are pretty good if you want to bury it in salt salts you know takes out impurities you could do that uh any of those things are very helpful um intention setting so again um if i am okay i'm like let me i'm gonna i'm gonna just go ahead and use the hero candle so if i am intention setting me personally i literally sit and i look at the imagery i think about the name i might sing a hesi or say heka um words of power um sing like a a sacred chant or something to just kind of connect with her energy um and then say like well what is it i'm looking for what help do i really need with her like you know how would you say you could pray you've already cleaned it off i'm lighting this candle i really need you to help me i need to work with my inner child i need to do some shadow work and i'm scared and i need you to help show me how um to utilize divine love and really you know move myself through this process i want to overcome i would whatever like well you know stuff like that so that's how you you know put your intentions on there there is no wrong or right way to do that uh you just kind of you know speak from your heart you know talk to the natural like i want to say don't talk to them like your best friend because sometimes we cuss out our best friends and sometimes our best friends ain't even really our best friends like people be toxic so don't say that your ideal best friend your most respectable and loving best friend let me be specific that's how you want to talk to the natural be real keep it real with them you can if you can't keep it real with anybody else you know they always say keep it real with yourself keep it real with the net to root can just it is what it is you ain't hiding you can't hide all right so again before you use it you can also do what's called inscribing so like i said before i usually just have glass candles but um sometimes if i do have a certain intention or a person i will kind of take a pen and write their name in in the wax um or i can write like symbol like i might put an ankh in there or you know any kind of symbols that just kind of help me connect again more to what it is i'm working on so again the candle will go out if you are working on the energy the candle goes out but you're not done with that energy that's okay you start all over again and you light a new candle but what do you do with the old ones so this is one of the old ones it is thoroughly done actually no wait i got another one that's thoroughly thoroughly yeah this one's thoroughly thoroughly done but um so the most important thing before disposing of your candle is you want to say like this one was another hat candle and i already did it i just i already released my energy off of it but um i wanted to save it so that i could show you all um so you know do i never had you know i really been trying to work on that energy of self mastery you know you really helped me kind of master my my physical space i got such and such done and i am so thankful for your assistance in that and your guidance in that and making sure that i was diligent and disciplined to do that okay so i'll you know i say you know say whatever comes to your heart thanks you know thank and so you know like so i now release you um and thank you for all that you've done i removed the labels simply because like to me it's just disrespectful to throw the natural out in the garbage like bro no um but again it's most important that you release the energy first then remove the labels i go so far as i put them in a plastic bag and i actually break the glass so that that to me symbolically again because i'm visual i just break it and totally release it and let it go um so um and again take off the front take off the back if you have one of those candles where it's like painted on um if there's a way for you to kind of just uh get that off if you can't just breaking the candle breaking the glass is fine um yeah for that um and then if you're using the candle where there is no glass please you can bury the wax if you like um i know people who have done that please do not flush the wax you are going to get a bill do not do that like that is not good for plumbing don't do that so um yes if you just are using one a candle that has no glass to it you can bury it you can break it into smaller pieces to release it and then um dispose of it i also don't like to throw candles directly into my regular dagula garbage just because i'm like oh you know like that's a natural like i'm trying to have more respect more reverence for the energy and my spiritual work so i want to just throw it so i always put it in his own bag and then dispose of it versus just throwing it in my regular trash all right so again like i said if we was in person would this would be a stop point so um any final discussion

well respected and well-known cannabis extraction expert she flies all over the country and all over the world to help commercial cannabis growers put in extraction technology what's really cool about murphy's story is she's completely self-taught she came from the business and growing side of the cannabis industry taught herself tons of chemistry and biotechnology and now that's her main thing is she's consulting and and uh helping train and implement extraction technologies at large scales for uh for canada for the cannabis industry and she's very impressive and i really enjoy talking with her she she you'll notice in the podcast she had her son with her he's going to be quite the social media expert because he wanted to get in on the conversation several times but i mean i can't think of another person more knowledgeable about cannabis and that's a field that i don't know a lot about but not only does she know a lot about every aspect of that business but she also knows a lot about the chemistry and underlying science foreign for example i didn't know really what terpenes were there's lots of cannabinoids but just little things like can you really determine the quality of cannabis just by looking at it what about those percentages that the dispensers dispensaries put on the cannabis does that actually mean anything we talked a lot about that and we also talked about the where the cannabis industry is going in the next five years and how the cannabis growers are today are adapting by looking at the psychedelics market and potentially looking at how they can transition into this new market opportunity that it's emerging so if you're at all interested in the science and technology side of cannabis and cannabis extraction this is a real treat and i'm very thankful for mary uh murphy's time and uh without further ado murphy bird all right murphy thank you for joining the the podcast uh very happy to have you thank you for having me interested to talk uh with someone who doesn't also live in the cannabis world i'm interested to see what kind of questions you've got i know when i first found out about you actually i think you followed me from a thin layer chromatography video that i did when i was first like getting into learning biotech stuff and then i started following your updates and i noticed that you were doing i didn't understand what it was actually to be honest with you i saw you with lots of stainless steel equipment and lots of like cool pics of what i guess are purified or extracted cannabinoids but maybe you could just start with telling everybody what it is that you do yeah i i do a lot of things um but especially uh now in my career i've been working with canvas since 2009. um so like my entire adult life basically and um i started out on the retail end i have worked uh i've owned gardens and owned dispensaries but my primary focus now is the extraction world and that's been my focus since about 2011. i got to that really quickly and the lab life is a really exciting part of the cannabis industry for a couple of different reasons and i think one of the funnest ones is um that when you compare it to the laboratory environment of almost any other industry cannabis kind of does everything their own way and so some of that is good and some of that is crazy uh but that's kind of the fun part about science i think is that we all get to disagree pretty often and um so what i do now is design equipment and optimize equipment for use extracting and purifying cannabis and cannabinoids and um and that takes me all over the country all over the world and like the the job varies every single time that i go in there you know when you're doing your thin layer chromatography you already know what the product is that you're looking for most of my chromatography is categories of stuff i have no idea how to quantify or identify and can't have in their words and so most of my job is like chasing those mystery compounds without the tools to actually do it which is really fun um but it's also kind of hard to describe because it doesn't follow that same pathway that traditional chemistry does to a individual singular identifiable product um almost no cannabis products get anywhere close to 99 purity so um so it's chemistry procedures without a chemistry outcome wow that's really interesting so how did you go from you said before this your background was in canada you were in the cannabis industry for a while yeah you know and the things you were doing running dispensaries and gardens those aren't necessarily i wouldn't think of as having a lot of overlap with what you do now other than it's the same industry but what you're actually doing is to completely different do you have a chemistry background or a biology background how did you learn this not at all um i started i went to school for marketing that's my that's my academic background um and uh and then i got into retail kind of by accident and i was 21. so like i did a lot of things uh you know i worked in a salon for a couple of months you know like that it was a um it was kind of a transitional job originally and just the nature of cannabis is so adaptive and a little bit against the grain you know it's kind of a rebellious industry in and of itself which means that if there is a standard procedure or a normal um you know sort of like means of growing through an industry that doesn't apply to us either because it can't or because we resist it and so there aren't the barriers to entry to get into cannabis that there is to research or um you know pharmaceuticals uh you know or any of these other types of um you know chemistry industries you don't have to be a chemist to go buy an hplc and try to add up thc you know you uh it helps but you know there's not any of that requirement necessarily and um and a lot of that just comes from you know that black market transition so um you know for the first 100 years of cannabis uh existing as a monetary uh trade product in america it was just the gross right and they're communicating directly with the consumer essentially or the person who's selling it to them and so that was our authority on the product and so all of our research and development about cannabis has largely come from growing cannabis or israel and that's it pretty much you know like we owe almost everything we know about cannabis to the research teams in israel and a lot of that just has to do with the fact that they could do whatever they want they don't have to deal with american laws so traditional researchers and traditional research methods didn't exist so we don't have any of that protocol for developing these products so if you want to sell cannabis all you have to do is have some cannabis you can sell it and if you want to have some cannabis all you have to do is grow it so you could just go grow it and so anybody can get involved really easily it's very easy to fail um so there's that barrier for entry that you have to have money to waste and product to lose in order to learn those lessons which is exactly how i learned everything that i know is by repeated failures and good notes um and so i was able to get into it just through the natural progression of the industry that if i needed hash for my dispensary and i couldn't get it then i need to go make it um it's you know it's a very self-starter type of industry of if you can do it i can do it and so a lot of people in a lot of businesses do everything they um it's called vertical integration and so they'll grow it they'll process it and they'll sell it and uh it's hard to be really good at any one of those things and all of the others you know like most people are either the social marketing person who's going to run a dispensary well or they're like the intuitive plant person that works best alone or they're the lab guy who you know lives for cleanliness and procedure and um so i i've done a little bit of all of it and it's not where i expected to be but the lab is where i have had the most fun and it's also the only part that's been um challenging in a rewarding way like i really love the time that i spend in the lab it's a lot of fun so that's really cool i see a lot of overlap between what you do and amateur mushroom growers because there's a there's a huge community online of people that are helping each other get started sharing texts and tools and with an emphasis on making things low cost and easy and it sort of sounds like because of your you already were in the industry and around it you had a network to tap into and also just had some ancillary experiences you said you needed hash so you had to go and figure out how to get it and um that's really really cool and so now that you that's like i guess the company i don't know if it's your company or the company you work for but that's their only thing right now is they do but consulting for for companies that want to start doing extraction cannabis experience yeah so um so it's my uh consulting and um and so i've got uh fabricators who can build and um i've also got some people that help out with you know training and um implementation but essentially i take on one client at a time and we uh and uh more often than not that problem is that they have too much weed not enough hash how do we get from point a to point b um faster and so um a lot of times i'm going in and taking someone who's processing you know maybe 20 to 50 pounds a day and trying to get them over 200 pounds a day um or i'll be going in and talking to someone who is you know not hitting the purity and quality goals that they've set out for themselves and we'll be figuring out where and why and then resolving that either through process uh changes or through equipment changes yeah yeah and i gotta admit and we should probably like orient people more because um there's a lot probably that people listen to including myself that don't know a lot about cannabis extracts and what they are and why you would want them and exactly so i'm familiar with regular weed that you smoke you know but beyond that you know i've never been into like dabbing but i couldn't even tell you a lot about it could you maybe to help like orient newbies to the industry and and i say this part of the reason why i wanted to add this conversation because biotech sort of touches every industry and the everyman bible podcast is really about shining a light on self-taught diy bio people like yourself whether or not you see yourself that way you sort of are because you're using biology you're growing this amazing plant that has a lot of demand and medicinal value and you're using these self-taught skills that you've learned along the way and you're using chemistry and you're tying that all together into a really like burgeoning market that's probably only going to continue to grow in the next decade so like extracts what's the 101 high level what are they why are growers like into extracts how are they used sure so um we'll start with the basics uh the cannabis plant or marijuana um same same thing different names uh it's a resinous plant and so what that means is that like literal resin sticky stuff uh develops on the outside of the cannabis plant and that part is really interesting and really important because there are a lot of things that we can extract from plants um and where that thing is in the plant matters a lot when it comes to our extraction with cannabis almost everything we want is on the outside and it grows in these trichomes uh which are just kind of like a waxy little container full of that resin and that resin is going to contain your cannabinoids which are the uh the things that have medical benefits for your body as well as the um you know the starting components to what's going to get you high later and have that psychoactive effect inside those trichomes you also have some other fatty acids some other compounds you also have the plant uh basically sweating terpenes the way that flowers emit smells um you're also going to see things like flavonoids and esters that are going to contribute to flavor in that resin and so it's a really complicated resin and the word resin um and specifically resin from cannabis or hash is kind of all just this like lump term for the sticky goo that we get off of this plant but ultimately that's the goods everything else on the plant all the leaf the bed itself is is nothing that's carbon raw plant material that um is just the carrier for you to get that sticky stuff into your body so when you're smoking cannabis you are burning leaves and vaporizing resin at the same time is the idea um and so that's where it gets really complicated is that you know each of these plants can produce different amounts of resin the resin can have different primary ingredients in it depending on what you feed it or what was happening to that plant at the time that you harvested it a plant that's like currently under attack from mites is going to emit different terpenes than one that is like chilling isolated in a sterile environment so um so the resin itself could be hundreds of active compounds and that's why extraction is so important is that we don't know what all of those are we know what some of them are and we don't know what those some of them all do and we certainly don't know what they all do together with each other in different combinations and so extraction allows us first to break that apart into large categories of compounds as well as just breaking it all the way down into individually what is this molecule versus that one and that's a very long process that we have barely touched the surface of there's 400 terpenes that we've identified that cannabis can produce your weed doesn't have 400 terpenes but which ones does it have is takes us some time to get into and break apart and so extraction helps speed up that identification process by first of all just isolating these compounds so that it's easier to test for them it's much easier to look at a map of two places than twenty so we wanna um we wanna break it down just for that analytical value and then from there um what we can also do in that process is remove things we don't want remove things that are known to be harmful or known to be toxic or that don't contribute in a meaningful way to your experience so in the same way that like the leaves are not helping you get high they're just stuff you're catching on fire and inhaling the smoke and tar from um there's lots of stuff in that resin that we don't need either um and that all depends on you know how you consume it that's where the bio part of our tech gets real complicated because we have to deal with the biology of the plant and then mix that up with the biology of individual humans and so the possibilities are endless that's that equation we'll never get to the end of uh but it's a really fun one because there is so much to break apart and so when um when we're studying it and identifying these compounds that level of extraction very high end a lot of precision involved in that the other half of extraction is all about delivering you that resin in a consistency that you can consume and so that part of extraction gets very loose because i can just touch weed get that sticky stuff on my fingers follow it up and now i have hash because it's just the resin that we started with and i haven't done anything so hash is just hash is just the the outside yeah is there any truth i'm so glad i get to speak to a cannabis expert here when you go into a dispensary and they show you the product is there really any way of gauging the quality or how good of a product it is just by looking at its physical characteristics well you have to start by defining quality right so you know in that regard um like this is where chemistry is easier because chemistry would be like what did you want thc well then whichever one has the most thc wins right but it's not that simple because a lot of thc plus cbd is not the same effect as a lot of thc by itself or a lot of cbd by itself and so you have all those different um you know qualities to consider and the way they work together and all of those make up your personal definition of good um and then you have all the other compounds to consider so terpenes are your aroma so they'll make it smell a certain way so is that why they they have you smell it and that's more like i guess a personal preference totally absolutely the um the inhalation of certain terpenes certainly has studied value um it can you know influence your body in important ways and some of the terpenes like mercy and we know um interact with thc and uh you know have have relevant impact in your body when you consume them um but that's only valid if you are smoking it right not if it's in food because your stomach acid will destroy terpenes so there's that that's a that's a marketing gimmick um your stomach can't smell so that one doesn't help but the terpenes again are just aroma and so um if you care about like medical value and effect the things like the terpenes and the cannabinoids are obvious uh priorities but the actual flavor that you taste in your mouth that comes from like esters and flavonoids um terpenes taste disgusting they're bitter they're awful um you don't taste the terpenes if you do you wouldn't want to smoke weed so you've got things like flavonoids that are really important it can afflict um and uh that one gives you um some also noted uh effects that have you know demonstrated some value in your consumption some of these um flavonoids and esters are important for when you eat cannabis because of the way that they can protect other compounds in your stomach acid oh interesting um and so you know it's like you have all these different applications you have all these different priorities so the type of concentrate i would want if i'm going to go home and dab it versus the kind of concentrate i want if i'm going to go home and put it in food and even then the type of concentrate i want if i smoke only a little bit late at night versus something that i want to smoke all day long like these are all different products you know um it's kind of like saying well which pain reliever is best like what kind of pain do you have what is the i'm curious to know like what is the underlying chemical difference between like a cannabis and sativa you know because they're they're marketed as having different and even hybrids your market is having different effects right but is that just a variation on thc and cbd or is it more complex than that so sativa and indica are classifications of phenotypes [Music] all plants and um and so it's a it's a physical characteristic of that plant so a sativa grows very tall has long skinny leaves um you know generally flowers for longer and that's because those sativas came from areas in the world where those features are important to survival you know if there's a lot of other vegetation i need to grow taller if there's a lot of pests i need to have narrower leaves less food for my enemies right um whereas an indica would come from a totally opposite landscape where they have a shorter growing season so they can't spend all of their time growing tall and they have less sunlight so they have to have wider leaves to absorb that to gain enough energy to move on to the next phase of their life which is produce seeds reproduce and die um so you know these plants uh as far as sativas and indicas go these are physical attributes to help them in their environment you know so that's like short people versus tall people you know like redheads and you know blondes like it's a physical description now if we're talking about a plant that is a sativa and is growing in that like rainforest environment right now that life experience of that plant is um going to influence the type of chemicals it is going to produce in its lifespan so like i mentioned earlier if it's being attacked by bugs it's producing the types of terpenes that are designed to deter those bugs if i'm this cush plant growing up in the top of the mountains and there's not a bumblebee for two miles let alone aphids or anything that i have to worry about then i'm going to smell as good as i possibly can to attract that one bumble bee and i don't have to worry about the pests right so those plants have a predisposition to produce slightly different chemicals based on their lived experience and if i take those two plants and i put them both in a sterile room and grow them next to each other i can almost make them mimic each other in that chemical output because i'm going to feed them the same things they're going to have the same lived experience as far as temperature humidity wind nutrients uh you know lack of pests things like that and so there is that genetic predisposition where some strains are just going to produce more cbd they're going to produce more tacv um you know we're going to smell like lemons you know like there's some genetic aspects to that you know in the same way that like not all tall people have heart disease but some of them might you know and it's not because they're tall but like maybe a lot of tall people have heart disease you know it's really hard to say uh you know what is the cause versus what is just like two similar facts so when they say like indica has a more a sedative type experience with it it how much of that is true no because the leaves were fat and the leaves don't have the resin that you're smoking it's um so you could get a sativa and that could have a that could have exactly the same as chloroplasts i can have a sativa or an indica that produces a lot of cbd and so what might be sedative is having two percent cbd in there you know what might be sedative is having more mercy as the dominant terpene versus like lemony which is a stimulant you know um and so like the you know and a lot of people want we want to classify everything you know we want to be able to progress and this is what's going to happen but you know if you look at something like alcohol for example right so ethanol is ethanol in all of the different alcohols ultimately that's the same thing getting you drunk yeah and i could put the same amount of ethanol in two different alcohols um but whiskey and tequila don't feel the same and depending on who you are risky might be for you and tequila might not or opposite and now we can say well the whiskey has a lot of gluten um or the you know tequila has a lot of sugar you know we can start saying this is why it's this one other thing that's such a good never that simple it's never that simple you know and sometimes it's not the whiskey or the tequila it's the you sometimes you're the one who just shouldn't have margaritas you know so like it's hard to it's hard to classify your experience with a plant like that you're both so complicated that it's really hard to predict that and so you can say i've tried lemon kush and it made me very tired and now when you buy more lemon push it'll probably still make you tired that doesn't mean i don't have that experience it doesn't mean your friend will have that experience because your friends might like tequila and you might not you know like it's just it's there's too many variables to break it down but the indica and sativa part kind of comes from that uh you know that history of cannabis where all the information we've ever gotten is from the growers so you know who cares a lot about indica and sativa is a grower who has eight foot ceilings versus 14 foot ceilings i don't have time for your sativas if my ceilings don't go up to 14 feet i wouldn't have room for those sativas you know um and you know similarly uh if i have an overly humid environment and i can't maintain that humidity well i don't want to be growing those indicates because they're too dense and they're gonna mold you know so like you end up making really important choices in the garden based on phenotype because it's about the plants um it's not about the chemotype and the chemotype is what category of chemicals it's producing and so chemotype if we had fun words like sativa and indica for it would give you more information but chemotype is a very very very long list so i would have to have every letter in the alphabet represented to give you you know uh an even kind of spread and so you know like a nutritional facts for for example right and the nutritional facts uh that would still really tell you like here's the compounds in it and then you would have to go and find out what are they what do they do how does that affect you um you know and that information is as deep and dark as google itself so there's a lot to get into so when you go to dispensary because i'm in california and i've been to a dispensary and it shows you thc levels as a percentage and cbd levels how does that work are they sending the is the grower sending it off to a lab that's sort of doing the testing probably doing very similar work that as what you're doing which is actually extracting that out and measuring it and certifying it and sending it back it sounds like though and i'll let you answer that question but it sounds like those two numbers are really just a small piece of the puzzle of the effects that it that it could potentially have yeah so in most uh states especially anywhere where you see recreational cannabis they are going to have third testing requirements so you can always test it yourself but that's not what goes on the package what goes on the package has to be certified by a third-party lab and usually those labs are held at iso standards and are you know similar to like a urine analysis lab or any other type of lab where you're just bringing in samples and testing for a specific panel of active ingredients and um and depending on what you're testing for there's different methods used for that potency for thc cbd etc that's usually going to be an hplc test and uh you know there is some that are going to use gas chromatography instead but generally that's not preferred for this application because of the decarboxylation that can occur um you can do the math backwards but who wants to do math you know um so hplc is kind of the standard for that but then you also have these labs testing for like terpenes and residual solvents and a lot of that is going to be your gas chromatography to quantify those um you're going to have pesticide testing um which is going to be you know a column and mass spec um you know and you're gonna have heavy metal testing which is you know as a digestion there's a whole bunch of different methods um but this individual sample that represents however many pounds of actual oil or weed um actually you know represents that that number gets very um you know spread out and it's almost always just based on what is required there's very little voluntary extras going on and um and so all that's you know required uh to be certified by a third party that goes on the label and then that goes to you uh and so now you're getting you know that let's say you know let's say your weed says that it's 20 thc right um so it's 80 not and uh if they detect more heavy metals and more pesticide and no molds you know you know like they've gone through all that other list then we're still at 80 percent what uh and there's no effort to close the gap right like a mass balance of everything that's in there is not accounted for and that's i think the strangest thing about cannabis is that it is very common for someone to buy a concentrate an extract and it'll be 70 candidates and 30 i don't know you know 30 of no one has checked and so that's the part that i think is the most important for consumers to care about because what we know is great that's information we can use and work with what we don't know is the biggest variance and so that's where the same amount of ethanol in whiskey versus tequila isn't the right amount of information what else is in there you know if that's 70 by weight then what's bit of a 30 because that's what's going to give you different experiences because the thc is the same you know the cbd is the same no matter where i get it from no matter what strain i get from no matter what plant or field whatever at its isolated molecule they're identical um so it's the other stuff that really is important to us and if a grower is getting sending off a small sample and getting interested how much of that varies between plants of the same all of it there's no it's not even that particularly like it's not accurate like say say your your go-to is pineapple express i'm just going to name one you could you could have wildly different profile chemical profiles not only between geographic areas but growers and and even within the same grower individual plants and even on the plant itself so the buds at the top that are closest to the light are going to have a different chemical uh you know profile than the ones at the bottom that are in the shape and there's often a very large price difference between some of the more i don't know higher quality or that's at least how they're marketed right but you could maybe get a cheaper weed but still have an amazing experience with it exactly and that's why i answered your other question with like how do you define quality because you know if you're going into it for thc content and avoiding lemon flavors because you know you haven't had good experiences with those but you want to get high you know like you can set your own rules as a shopper um then you know these exotic strains what makes them more expensive is not the amount of thc or whether or not it smells like lemon it's um the exclusivity of the genetic right um and so it would be uh the fact that it's a new genetic or that it's in a rap song or that it's grown by a grower with incredible branding and really nice jars it is marketed to you in the same way that you know you have 14 different options of mid-shelf vodka that are the same and like half of them will come from the same distillery and it's just a different bottle and the one with the wax on the lid is four dollars more and you're a sucker so you fall for that same thing with cannabis that's the marketing part you know which is that if you will pay more for it that will be fine we will we will take more money for it that will be okay we'll uh give you another excuse so the chemical content is not really a factor in that purchase a lot of it is how can i market it because a bread that is extremely resinous and has a really high ratio of relevant chemical compounds would be loose and kind of leafy it would be ugly an ounce would take up a whole freezer bag um it would not you know it would not have the appeal of like this beautiful purplish with pink hairs frosty buds like these cool you know interesting plant features are totally aesthetic and [Music] since you're buying it based on appearance we push the aesthetic you know but like the cheeseburger on the menu is not the cheeseburger in your bag always so you've got to keep that in mind and then you just really got to think about what what matters to you as a consumer you know if i'm making you know cheap cheap margaritas for a party i'm going to get the cheaper tequila because it's fine you know if i want to celebrate a fancy night out it might buy a higher end you know like there's there's all these different reasons why i might make this one purchase or another it's very rarely the chemical purity sometimes just to feel like how do you feel about it right a placebo kind of thing some of the buds they're marketed as smelling it particularly you use lemon as your example but i've i've heard and re seen other ones and some of them are so strong in one particular smell like strawberry or they go beyond lemon and it always crossed my mind that it doesn't seem real because they almost don't smell like regular weed but are is it real are there any growers that are actually like putting some sort of you know smell enhancer on like like it's not like spraying on a perfume where the smell is coming from somewhere else but um we can control plants quite a bit and so if you think of it this way like if you eat asparagus your body makes certain smells right like certain diets make certain people's body odor smell a certain way we can influence a plant based on how we feed it and we can also influence that plant based on its lived experience so you know it starts with making sure it doesn't produce the stinky terpenes that are designed to deter pests right because they're gonna smell bad i don't need those anywhere near my my product it's gonna you know it only takes a little bit of bad to ruin the rest of the good um and then there's certain terpenes that are just in cannabis no matter what based on the type of plant that it is so mercy is a good example of that merchants and hops as well as cannabis they're in the same family and cannabis produces a lot of mercen and that's a pretty strong smell it's not necessarily one that people gravitate towards like some people love that you know hops kind of smell um but you know that's usually the one that like your mom is complaining about when you smell like weed right is that like kind of lingering musky sort of um smell um then we have a whole bunch of others that are just kind of from the genetic regions that these plants originally came from so you're going to see uh you know this strong citrus from areas where there was a lot of pests because these strong citrus are natural insecticides so those plants just kind of have the genes to produce that certain smell um you know and you know just like that other plant with no bumblebees around it's going to go out of its way to smell incredible and so it's also going to produce those smells based on the competing vegetation and so if there's a lot of stuff that smells like citrus i'm going to smell like strawberries you know because that's going to get the bumblebees over here where i want them you know and so um so some of it is genetic predisposition and some of it is just kind of feeding and stressing the plants out one thing that's really interesting about cannabis is that a lot of those smells and the complexity of that flavor is the result of us growing it if that plant was growing in the wild it would have smelled good for a week gotten pollinated and then it would have gone into a mother mode and started protecting those seeds from pests and environment again and so you know a green fresh young cannabis plant does not smell like gingerbread or you know strawberry uh blueberry or muffins or whatever you know it smells like a green plant because that is the smell that keeps gnats away and aphids off your leaves and so if if cannabis was allowed to go back into seed production we would see a lot more of those flavors but because we prevent it from ever producing seeds we kill it at the peak of it trying to be as attractive as it possibly can all of that incredible smell is to attract pollinators that we are prohibiting from getting there so that creates a ton of stress on that plant which makes it open up new ways you know to try and attract those pollinators so like that's a very human impact you know like we do that to cannabis cannabis doesn't do that for us it does that to fight us and we're just tricking it um because we like it so that's where a lot of breeders will select plants that happen to have those notes cross-breed them back with other plants that are um you know have physical attributes that they want or similar flavors that they want or you know other you know resin features that they're looking for and we've created you know like all cannabis is is genetically modified through selective breeding in that sense that we've decided what we want cannabis to look and smell and taste like so it's as real uh as the plant producing it but it is not through natural evolution that's that's the result of us growing indoors yeah really cool so i think most people when they think about like what are the active ingredients we talked a little bit about this thc and cbd those are sort of the main ones but with extraction you're basically i guess it sounds like the first step is you're taking away the plant matter from the resin are you then extracting out the resin into like separation of that you talk a little bit about that are you separating that like terpenes which i think you said control the smell of it right and then and then there's the actual uh cannabinoids which are like that has the psychoactive components as well as like i think there's hundreds of cannabinoids as well but and you said that i think you said when you do the interac extraction 70 of it is known but then there's always this remaining 30 percent i mean yeah that's where the type of extraction um starts to become really relevant because you know if we use my first example of like the weed of sticky i touch it now the sticky is on me i've got an extract here um that's going to have a little bit of plant material still remaining it's going to have all of the like you know fats and waxes that were containing that resin um it's also going to have degradation products because as soon as i've burst that little trichome now everything in there is exposed to oxygen and what's a trichome just so um trichomes are those little noodly guys that you see uh pictures of they're sticking off of the end of the leaf okay so there's the leaf and then there's the crystals on the leaf which is yes they look like crystals but that's it's actually gooey resin yeah okay so that's a resin and then there's also these little what do you i don't know what you call them you had it like not stems but these little orange fuzzy holes yeah little hairs that stick out and what's is there a difference in what the little hairs have versus the rest yeah for sure so the resin is is where your cannabinoids are all of the hairs and all that kind of structure is um you know these are these are differences for the plant that um you know have a lot to do with like attracting pollen and trapping pollen versus um you know making the buds inaccessible um it also uh you know has a lot to do with like the growing environment and so you know you're gonna see plants with really wide leaves and not a lot of small sugar leaf um and then you're gonna see the exact opposite where they have a lot of little sugar leaves and so it's just you know it's kind of um you know it's just the diversities in the plant you know like all of these different roses have kind of different features but they all kind of smell like roses too um so you know the the resin itself within that trichome that's the most relevant um there is going to be some uh other content throughout the plant material that's valuable for reasons um we have things like you know like certain compounds within that leaf material that may very well help protect cannabinoids in your stomach when you consume it for example but they don't really play into anything that i'm gonna smoke and so when it comes down to vaporizing or smoking it i want as few ingredients in there as possible and uh you know because anything extra is just something i'm catching on fire right anything extra could be potentially leading to more degree degradation and um you know it's going to contribute to flavors that start out smelling grounding and smelling herbs so in that way you know the different types of extraction are going to either target compounds that they want or directly target removing compounds that we don't and so depending on the quality of the material that we're extracting and depending on the product that we want to make at the end of it we might focus on a method of extraction where i'm going straight to isolate i want 99 i want just the cbd um or i might be looking for a product that has as much of that flavor as i can preserve and preserving some of that flavor does call for preserving some of those other compounds because terpenes are unstable by themselves and you know esters and things like that can can denature and get old so we we want to not just expose them and leave them all by themselves you know and like think of uh mushroom extraction for that reason like some of these compounds you get for a minute and then you know you you can destroy it easier than you can make it and so some of our extraction processes are preservation oriented some of them are about removing contaminants and a lot of them are about trying to compromise those two goals for the least amount of money so what are some of the main products that come out of the extraction process and what are the difference uh different extraction techniques that are used to create those main products so i mean i think the first category is concentrates that you're going to dab for smoke and those tend to be the 70 to 80 to 90 purity range they're rarely up in the 99s um of just cannabinoids yeah just cannabinoids and that's um that's in part because we want a lot of that flavor to stay in there and because a lot of that extra uh content can help influence the texture and the appearance um so you know if i have thc a and it's 99 pure that's a white powder and you can touch it if i have thc and it's 99 pure as a sticky gooey liquid and you can't get it into or out of a jar without heating up so depending on how you want to smoke that if you want to sprinkle it on your joint you don't want 99 thc that's going to be a nightmare right um but uh you know joey diaz level or if you know who that is but yeah it's you know it's so part aesthetic and part kind of function in that way where um you know having delta nine that's you know only part of it and having a whole bunch of thc a instead and not allowing it to decarb can give me a product that's more tangible or it'll give me a product that looks like a diamond and so you'll pay more for it you know um oh wow okay you know we have you know we have these different physical structures because the acidic form um of thc that thca uh is a crystalline solid whereas delta 9 is a you know very sticky liquid and that's just their natural state what's the wax that's the only thing uh that's one of those situations where um the name is just to describe what it looks like so think of shatter shadow is not like a noun that's a verb right but we call shatter shatter because you could break it and it would shatter like glass um so when people call that um that smoking concentrate wax it's not because of actual wax content necessarily it's because it looks like wax and so um and it has more th uh c a it will have more thc a then um than anything else to have that solid structure but so does shatter so shatter and wax are basically the same product um the difference between shatter and wax is that with shatter i have taken my oil but it still has solvent in it um not very much just a little bit and i put it really thin and so when it when all that solvent is evaporated i'm gonna have this um translucent solid because it's that thca which is still crystallizing essentially to form that structure um but it's doing so in a pretty homogeneous way because it isn't pure and uh and so then with wax i have the same oil but i rip it up and so i introduce all this air into it so it's not that it's actually different than the shatter it's clear like the shatter if tiny air bubbles that are reflecting light that's what makes it opaque to you like that's a that's an illusion right that's just aesthetic so that's like scrambled eggs versus just frying your mayonnaise it's just how i prepared it to hand to you and so um the same product that can make wax and shatter i can just crystallize it with a little bit more solvent in the solution and grow diamonds and then i could take that pure thco right out of there and all the liquid that's in there would represent the other part that's making up you know the wax and the shatter so the wax and the shatter are homogeneous whereas the crystallized stuff the sauce is those homogeneous compounds but broken up into little pieces before you combine them again anyway to some of them so you know it's very much about like how i'm giving it to you it's like do you want you know alphagata you want that espresso you know on top instead on the bottom or whatever you're asking for um you know a lot of that is presentation aesthetic and you know a little bit just a function of how you want to smoke it um and then you know besides that uh presentation which we can affect literally manually just by how i pour it out how i heat it up how i handle it you also have the differences with different solvent choices and so you know this is where chemistry should play a really important day doesn't always um but what do you mean by that what do you mean by that it sounds like it sounds just like nothing but chemistry well it isn't it isn't so if i again if i were looking at a 99 pure product what i would do is i would choose the best solvent for extracting that compound or i would choose a solvent that's very good for that compound but also simultaneously very bad at extracting the things i don't want i see and there's a lot of methods of extraction and fluid in cannabis that are catch-offs and so like ethanol for example as an extraction solvent gives me a little bit of the water solubles a little bit of the non-polars which means i have a really complicated problem in that bucket when i'm done getting all of that solution out and so you know if i start with something you know like hexane which is going to extract a very specific list of things then i have an easier job cleaning that up and purifying it but i don't have a very specific list of things i want out of that cannabis because i don't know what's in it before i run it most of the time except for like the assumption that there's thc in there or quantification of the thc in there which still is going to tell me how much thc i can get out you know so it's it's still not enough information um so you know we have the opportunity to use really selective solvents or less selective solvents um but what we generally do is just use the solvent that gives us a little bit of both based on what we think is going to be there and then we and then we deal with whatever comes out you know there's a lot of people using co2 in the cannabis industry and co2 is capable of any any type of you know solubility almost if you control it um but what people do is not control it at all and they just say anything that comes out at 2000 psi is what i will have thank you very much and we don't target our extraction um and part of it's because you the consumer doesn't ask us what that other 30 is so we don't have to answer oh that's interesting so what is the main motivator for a grower to get into the extraction side is it to capture more of the market because there's obviously a demand for these products there's also obviously a demand for extraction based products is that the main driver um so there's definitely a you know value in those products but you also can take advantage of attracting [Music] started by trying to get something useful out of the trim the parts of the bed that you don't buy and so the trim is covered in resin anyone who's had to turn before is going to be familiar with that and so there's a lot of resin that is lost um through that trimming process that can be recaptured and so the first reason would be to not throw that away or pay someone else to monetize it you can take your own garbage and turn it into money yeah um extraction is also a get out of jail free card if something goes wrong in the growth and um i've i've run gross before i don't do that now growing is hard and the consequences of things going wrong in the group take time and you still have to finish investing money in it you know um like i i can stop an extraction part way through and say this isn't gonna work and start over again uh there are no do-overs in the grip you know like you grow that plant whatever happens happens you grow that plant perfectly for three and a half months and then you know have a power outage or an employee quit and suddenly it's ruined you know so the um the very uncertain nature of trying to you know grow an agricultural product like cannabis that is so heavily regulated the way that it is um it gives you very little margin for losses and so extraction helps you recover from those losses because even if i do have a pest issue i can extract that product get the useful part out and leave the pest part behind um so you know that it's kind of like insurance against your crop if you can always extract it anyway yeah that's interesting yeah the bigger your crop the more risk you take you know the more potential profit but like all things the more risk you take and especially with growing something like mushrooms or or like uh marijuana it takes a long time it's a long time like a big time investment and uh everything has to sort of go right till the very end for you to reap those rewards so that's that's interesting so what is like if someone wants to get into extraction are people doing this on an individual level or is it mainly just businesses that are doing it um it's it's both absolutely so certain methods of extraction aren't appropriate to try at home because they um are explosive or hexagonal with certain methods of extraction that don't make it appropriate for home um but then there's a lot of methods that are very easy to do at home you know a simple ethanol extraction is relatively easy to do at home equipment to recover that ethanol safely is similar to what you would do if you were home brewing or home distilling um so you know there's that level of chemical extraction that's absolutely happening at a home level and then there's a lot of very simple hash making which is where we're using like dry ice or literally water and ice and instead of dissolving any of that resin we're just separating it from the plant material so we're not getting that really really high purity but we are getting rid of most of the plant that is unnecessary and um and that being you know water and ice it's a little bit cold it may be slippery but very accessible for anyone to try at home it is also just manual labor which is more effort on the commercial side are they are they like what's the investment is it tens of thousands is it hundreds of thousands for i would imagine some of the really large growers it's it's probably quite a bit i've seen some of the equipment you know i don't know does it you have to have a clean room when you do these things it's so yes and no um so because of the nature of the regulatory environment for cannabis it's state by state and it's often municipality by municipality so the county land might have one set of rules and the town within that county might have a different set of rules it gets very nuanced um as far as what's uh required in one place or another that's where analytical labs being iso is standardized like that's you can book up the standard and you can say okay this is what that requires so no carpet over here guys and just you know keep um keep things really consistent but within canvas labs what you'll hear is a lot of weird abbreviations and names and classifications of these labs they're totally made up they're totally fabricated for cannabis and so like a type 7 license in california versus a type 6 license is just whether or not you use flammable solvents but whether or not you have carpet in that lab is like not you know necessarily outlined um so a lot of these rules just come down to who wrote them um ideally you would want uh you know certain safety protocols no matter what and there's a lot of national codes that you know are either written into the laws or that we as an industry elect to impose upon ourselves and uh there's also um you know a lot of like manufacturing processes that we try to mimic but you know it's it's pretty common for someone in cannabis to say we have a gmp facility but they don't because they have floor drains and they have you know like open you know exposed raptors and things like that but what they mean is like i record every single batch of solvent that i get in and i store the coa for it and i can tell you which solvents that uh you know which products use solvent from that batch and so we'll have a piece of gmp but not all of it or i might have you know clean air exchange before i enter one part of my building but not another so it's uh it's never consistent anywhere from one lab to another it's definitely a lot of buzzwords i think when it comes down to that but a lot of us are operating as though national um safety and you know sanitation codes will be imposed because if the federal government legalizes it and the licensing goes out of the hands of the state then it will be fda osha gmp it will be very standard you know consistent rules everywhere and then it'll get to the point where like a dairy is the same almost anywhere that you go um but right now it's crazy every single lab is completely different some labs will require a hair net some labs you can like eat a cheeseburger while you're standing there like people there's a huge difference no matter where you go now you mentioned genetic engineering earlier and that's an interest in mine and something i'm learning and studying right now and you know genetic engineering for a lot of agricultural products really is mainly selective breeding it's something we've been doing for thousands of years and it works really well but in canada the cannabis industry there's definitely been some some cutting edge research going on in things like engineering yeast to produce cannabinoids and fermenting lots of yeast to produce these do you follow any of that at all do what do you think about some of those i do and it's all fascinating especially for the analytical applications because if i want to study a novel cannabinoid like thcv right so there's like two or three genetics that produce whole numbers of percentage points of thcb at all right and then to go in and extract those and isolate that thcb down would be costly and so then that makes researching what is this thcv and what does it do really difficult because we also don't have standard academic grants and so this is all private funding and um i can't tell you if you can monetize this information about this novel can of annoying until i look at it and learn some things so um being able to just make it is clearly the superior answer for that type of analytical environment because i have so much cost that is just sunk on isolating that from elsewhere um that's also where you see a lot of these cannabinoids get a little bit of hype and fame that's why you heard a lot about cbg this last year is because cbd was hot before that and um you know and so now if i want to make more money i want to promote a different cannabinoid and so the fact that there was less cbg available made it more valuable um you know and so we're going to keep seeing that with the discovery of new cannabinoids and and so being able to just grow them to be able to study them is huge um but it doesn't compete with just growing in the field yet and it only produces that candle and so the medical market has insisted on you know this full spectrum broad spectrum type of definition for a really long time because the medical market grew out of black market the medical market grew out of we don't have a it's a bag from a guy it's weak you know there was a name um you know the medical market grew from people who were handling it themselves so you know they didn't want someone else to grow it and analyze it for them they said this is my weed that i grew and that made it the best and so um you know so the medical market has never really demanded that type of product they've always demanded the diversity that comes from just growing whatever and the recreational market has come with a lot of compromises and the recreational market definitely has led to more of that you know cbd isolate type of product because it's easy and economical to produce it makes it widely available to everyone but it's not complex and so now that marketing problem comes into play of like how do i sell another cbd you know like do i get a different shaped bottle a revolutionary dropper you know like it starts to not become about cannabinoid anymore and so the agricultural product will always have that advantage over growing it in a dish because nature does whatever it wants we are very preventable even if you try to have unique ideas with the same ideas a lot whereas nature will just do crazy things you know like you can wear clones and still have a variegated one for no reason out of nowhere and uh that's nature so we can't really compete with that and so far the consumer has not requested the type of sterile product that you know um massive pharmaceutical production of cannabinoids would really call for yeah i do wonder if in the future we're gonna see you know because there's been so much hype with cbd in the last several years and all there's all these new products that have come to market i wonder if in the future we're going to start just seeing that line of products that cannabinoid products continue to grow and uh enter into the public sphere one of the things i wanted to touch on before we close out here was it you mentioned uh you sort of talk about chemistry as is like it's not it's real chemistry but there's there's something like holding it back from its real possibilities i wonder if you could talk a little bit about that you know i think we're we're probably in the next five years i would guess it's going to be federally legalized i think everybody sort of feels that way and i think it's even going to be voted on in the next week or two potentially if it makes it to the floor um how does that impact like the people that are in the industry and also just how it operates in general one of the things you mentioned was there's all these differences between the standards and the codes and the regulations clearly there's got to be some advantages for that to be consolidated and and being standardized across the board there's also something to be said i guess about the flexibility at the local level um like when this thing gets legalized how do you think that's going to impact what it is that you do the extraction part of it and how how it's operated and how it's run it's um it's going to be really interesting it depends on which direction that legalization goes for starters um the type of rules i'm going to have to deal with if i'm governed by the atf is very different than who i would deal with if i'm governed by the fda for example right like the fda isn't telling you know joule what kind of mango to use in their paws they're coming out later and saying hey that mango stuff is full pesticide stop you know so it's a different um type of industrial experience uh depending on who's in charge and it could really go a lot of different directions but i think that in either of those cases one thing that we'll see probably no matter what will be a change to that you know entrance barrier to the industry so right now it's very easy to get an entry level job anywhere and just walk in and learn how to extract um kind of apprentice style meaning that you're just trained by someone else who knows the thing uh and so there's not really there's not a degree that's required there's not um you know any kind of traditional trajectory for that type of education there's no onboarding you might fill out your w-4 the first day and maybe not you know like there's uh there's not consistency in that um experience for employees and so on the positive it means it's very easy for you to walk in with no experience and work your way up um in a company and get to the top which is you know something i'm a huge fan of because it's how i got involved in this industry but at the same time it means that i can walk in get an entry-level job in a scary dungeon of mystery combustibles and very dangerous work environments and i could be trained by someone with limited experience and they can put me in an unsafe situation and at the end of it i won't know any better and maybe i'll be stuck repeating that process you know if you're multiple companies and being treated poorly because if i'm used to work somewhere for six months get a pay raise that's not how you know these mom and pop startups work you know um if i'm used to someone always training me to use a cash register before asking me to bring up a sale that's not how the lab works if someone says can you write all that down and you've never used a rollo and you say yes good luck uh there's so there's so much opportunity which goes and uh you know that that is going to be a big change with federal legalization as well you know so it will get safer for employees to operate um but that will also mean that uh it will become more expensive for business owners to uh start their business it's already gotten so expensive yeah that's gonna change the type of business owners that you have yeah um so you're not gonna be able to say you know i'm murphy and i would love to just make live resin because it's my favorite and go and meet people who want to do that and start a business you know with everyone pooling their savings that's what we can do now that's not going to be the case when we have the type of uh infrastructure that osha and federal regulation will impose on now we're a fighter now you know yeah the barrier entry will be so high that it only lends itself to these big corporations with deep pockets and yeah um and also that kind of eliminates the entrepreneurial aspect which is kind of a big way that so many people got started in the cannabis industry and a big big believer in small business and just supporting entrepreneurs and and piggybacking on to that question we are seeing a wave of ex cultural acceptance and in legalization that appears to be happening much quicker than medical marijuana in psychedelics in the psychedelic space have you are any of your growers looking at this space and thinking about like hey this might be a new market we need to start thinking about this right now yeah so i think that that um that wave of popularity is directly a result of the corporate shift in cannabis because as many of the entrepreneurial growers who were making money in cannabis are getting pushed out of the legal framework especially in places like say california and on the west coast where that barrier ventures getting very high and the profits involved are not non-existent we're seeing these entrepreneurial growers take their skills and apply them elsewhere and so it's the same people who are fighting for medical and recreational cannabis that are saying yeah mushrooms too let's have it all you know um it's the same people who are um you know behind a lot of that and i think that we're going to continue to see it grow because you know i i i used to say this started with gay marriage right but like states that have gay marriage get medical marijuana first um and so there's just a point where people decide that like what you do is fine whether i do it or not you know it's kind of this like general acceptance of freedom um more so than anything about the product you know you don't have to be gay or married to support gay marriage you don't have to use cannabis to support medical marijuana um you want to eat mushrooms to be fine with josh growing mushrooms you know like i think that there's this change in um people just being comfortable with like letting their neighbors live their lives and not criminalizing our behavior um and so you know we're gonna see a lot more things be more widely accepted uh things like you know the mushroom development is really exciting because it brings that entrepreneurial um aspect back into it but then we look at you know like therapy options for mdma which is also very exciting but that goes back to our pharmaceutical world and a little bit different type of environment with you know different barriers for entries so there's another company that i know that's also doing mescaline which is cactus based so there's like all this whole class of psychedelics many of them come from the various plants that are already around so if i were a cannabis business owner i definitely would be looking at psychedelics and me thinking thinking ahead because probably in five years if you go to extraction equipment sites right now um you will see mushrooms floor kits for sale as well oh yeah the crossover is right there it's the same people and they are all down there's people turning those um storage containers that were for uh little portable growers and they're just flipping that into a mushroom room because it's obviously the same requirements um just different settings you know absolutely that's really really interesting murphy this was awesome i've learned a ton about cannabis that i had no idea about it so it's kind of really there's like a little kid in me that's just happy i get to talk to someone who's so knowledgeable knowledgeable about the field plus it's so cool to meet another diy person i say diy you're kind of self-taught i'm a huge advocate for project-based hands-on learning which it sounds like you're also an advocate of and uh so it's really cool it sounds like you've been incredibly successful in this field so it's uh it's it's very cool to get a chance to talk to you so thank you thank you for having me on oh thanks thanks for having good questions i loved it yeah yeah for sure so people want to get a hold of you if someone wants to hire you to come build out their extraction plan how do they how do they get ahold of you um so uh my private consulting um the easiest way to access me is through the links on my instagram at murphy murray or at moore faster which is my consulting um you can also uh find me at a lot of the different cannabis industry pages and then also through the good life gang which is uh you know kind of a diy open source community um it's good light uh good food uh good hash and good people is our our motto and um through the go back gang our goal is to just promote that entrepreneurial um you know community base for this plant because we are afraid to lose it and um the quebec gang is just a whole bunch of vetted consultants and vendors for our industry that are committed to um being you know open with our technology and our processes uh as well as just supporting each other and being cool people very cool very cool so everybody go check that out check out her instagram because it's full of really cool scientific scientific stuff and uh really like amazing equipment that i've never seen before but also all those things that we're talking about the terpenes and the crystals and you show that stuff i had no idea that so many different things can be extracted into different formats from cannabis so it's really really interesting well murphy thank you again and uh i really look forward to chatting with you again soon have a good one bye", "8V3K78hXu24": "hi i'm moscow from Moscow's kitchen I'm going to show you how to cook shirataki noodles shirataki is made from young potato gel so i basically made from almost water and a tiny bit of starch so open the package and then let's drain a water but it has the smell it's basically Japanese cuisine we use really really delicate flavor into the food so that's why we prepare to remove the smell of the konnyaku or Shirataki but it's basically quite simple way to remove some smell just bring bring the water to the boil and put some salt into the boiling water and put the shiitake to cook 3 minutes you can remove the smell the reason why we do this processes are removing some smell and then also cooking the shirataki to draw some water away from from it and then put some seasonings onto the ingredients that's them that's how it works so now it's ready to use for the cooking so shirataki doesn't have flavor so you have to put some flavors on using soy sauce or some japanese products or any kind of time never anything but it's really really a nice texture and I really am a chewy in texture and they're quite enjoyable kind of noodle so typically we use shirataki for stewed dishes is called nikujaga or some other thing is sukiyaki it's really popular hot pot dish or you can just stir fry and many with many different ideas to use it so that's how to cook shirataki noodles you you you", "mKGwL7_o7xU": "good afternoon everyone and welcome to a tech moment on cannabis tech I'm your host Cristina etter in this podcast we take just a few minutes to talk about some of the exciting innovations in technology and science within the cannabis and hemp industries in this cannabis industries providing quality cannabis is absolutely critical and often entire crops might be contaminated or need to be destroyed because of microbials or other toxins and contaminants in the flower however thanks to technology there may be a new way to combat this problem and save those valuable crops today I am speaking with Jill Ellsworth who is the founder and CEO of willow industries and she's here to talk to us about willow cure which is really the Brita filter for cannabis cultivators welcome to the show Jill thank you for having me so talk to me a little bit about willow industries tell me how the company came to be and what kind of led you down this path to create willow pure of course so I'm an entrepreneur at heart and I come from the food and beverage industry the natural food and beverage industry I owned a cold-pressed juice company and natural beverage distribution business as I was leaving those businesses I started looking at cannabis and what I was finding was that there were no regulations that I was used to seeing in the beverage world for instance there was no requirement for essentially kill stuff which for the beverage world was we had to put our juices through a process to make sure that there was no contaminants on the back end when consumers purchased it so I you know I had a lightbulb moment and found that I wanted to start a company that was going to focus on consumer safety and it was going to be a solution to cultivators to get rid of these contaminants that they were seeing in the flower and that they were required to be tested for there's no way to get rid of them and so the light bulb moment occurred and that was the impetus for starting willow fantastic and you know these crops are so valuable in the first place obviously farmers the last thing they want to do is learn that their product has been contaminated and that there's that they can't do anything with it so obviously having the solution on the back end to kind of help with that is it's very valuable to the cultivator so let's talk a little more specifically about the technology behind willow pure how does the system actually work and what kind of contaminants can it help prevent so we use ozone gas as the medium in which to degrade microbial contamination so we developed a proprietary chamber that pulls in oxygen it concentrates that it converts it to ozone and then ozone floods the chamber and now ozone acts as the oxidant for the microbial contaminants so it will break down contaminants that were used to seeing be and also being tested for so mold yeast bacteria mildew ecoli Salmonella and Listeria and those are the tests that are being tested at the state level so the ozone oxidizes those contaminants on the flower once a treatment time is done you have clean cannabis but most importantly and this is what our Rd was really meant to do in the very beginning was make sure that there's no degradation to the efficacies of the flower so we don't change the color in the structure but most importantly we do not change the terpenes or potency well that's absolutely good to know I know just through my own interaction in the industry and through social media outlets and one thing and another that is a big concern customers have a lot of times when you are dealing with different processes to to help make sure that the product is clean is does it then lose any potency so it's nice to hear that it doesn't actually affect that product at all now let's talk a little bit about scalability so is this technology just mainly intended for the larger grows or do you have a scalable option that will help this grow with the with the cultivator we do have scaleable options so we have currently three models we have a five pound model for the craft cultivator we have a 20 pound model which is essentially our workhorse one of our most popular models and then we have a 40-pound for the large you know large scale operators and we ship our 20 pound machine all over the country so you you don't have to be in our home state of Colorado to give our tech a try you can rent our technology and we'll ship it to you you use it right in the house it's a mobile system so it's on wheels it moves your standard doors really easy to use you simply just plug it in load up the trays with fresh flour and press Start we've helped we've designed everything else on the back end so that the treatment times and everything else is baked right into the system that's fantastic it sounds like it's fairly easy to use now you mentioned just briefly there about shipping all over the United States talk a little bit about those on-site services that you offer you said that there's rentals or leasing capabilities can you talk a little bit about the the business side of Willow industries of course we are currently operating in ten states and if you're not in Colorado which in Colorado we have an on-site service business where we show up at your cultivation and we clean all the flour for you but in other states clearly that's not feasible right now as we're growing the company so we ship you the machine it's a weak rental the the prices vary but typically a one-week rental is $5,000 and then a lot of our rental clients move into our long-term leases and so you know you get to try it before you buy it and then to have it on-site for your use all the time so you could be using this type of technology preventative ly rather than reactive ly if you know by chance fail a test gosh yeah well that's really good to know what else is on the horizon for willow industries here in the future and I guess one of the questions I would have been if you're in ten states here are you looking at all into branching maybe into Canada or into other markets as the as the cannabis market continues to flourish we are definitely looking to move into the international markets especially Canada that's kind of like the close the closest neighbor that we're working on right now but we just closed a rather large fundraising round and that's going to give us the horsepower to to really increase our sales and marketing and to keep innovating around the tech you know what we have right now is great and it works but we are continuing to innovate within our system make it a little more user friendly in terms of the software back-end fitting into the entire supply chain and then continuing to grow the company and a lot of the bigger market so California we're going to have a lot of presents there and and just keep pushing this forward and keep letting people understand that you know we are focused on consumer safety and look to be the cannabis safety brand that's fabulous Jill last thing I'm going to ask you to provide for our audience is how can they get ahold of willow industries or how can they contact you if they want to be if they want more information of course go to willow industries comm we have a plethora of information on our website we have data we have lots of information and you know feel free to reach out to me my email is Jill at Willow industries dot-com I'm always happy to answer questions and you know talk to anybody passionate about tack in the industry fantastic thanks so much for your time and joining us here on a tech moment today Jill I really appreciate it thank you for having me [Music] you", "1zj99GFuNOY": "here to give an overview of hem production as mentioned I've been working with him for a while at the University of Kentucky I started up the last February at Central State and so really trying to get this established as a crop for the state of Ohio and so we're just gonna cover a little bit about what the crop is it's got a lot of unique things with it that's very different than any other crop that you're gonna encounter out in Ohio or anywhere for that matter it's a very unique plant and so with that comes a lot of challenges but it also makes it very interesting to work with so this is a hemp plant a lot of people see it and they think of marijuana plants and there's a reason for that they're actually both cannabis sativa plants taxon amidst differ on how many types of cannabis there are but legally there's just one and so they can look identical we used to be thought that okay you can tell grain and fiber type hemp plants from marijuana plants just by how they were being produced how they're being grown and there's some accuracy in that but a lot of what we're actually people are growing for in the u.s. at the moment is for the cannabinoids and those are medicinal compounds produced in the flowers and those are produced in the same way the in fashion as THC or tetrahydrocannabinol the intoxicating component of cannabis and so we'll talk more about that as we go along and how you actually determine the differences between the two but just a quick overview of the plant itself it's what we call a summer annual meaning it's an annual plant it grows up during the summer versus being in the fall the spring or the fall most of his active growth is during the summer it could get anywhere from 3 to 15 plus feet tall depending on the variety you're using I mean that comes down to really the type of application you're looking at for growing the plant for it is only distinguished from marijuana by the level of the THC in it its closest relative is actually hops there and that's kind of a distant somewhat distant relative and there are those two there's nothing really even close to them so it's a very unique plant and it has a long history of use by humans it's we've got a heart of facts made with him that date back over 10,000 years from Europe and in China and places in Asia so it's had a long history of use but it's a had a very complex history in the u.s. in colonial times a hemp production was real common it was a central commodity during the what we call the age of exploration when countries were sending out ships to colonize new areas and start essentially starting new colonies leading to new countries and that was because it was a critical opponent of the ship rigging as well as the fibers were used so the fibers were used in that rope for the rigging as well as the canvas on the sails and so it was an essential commodity and a key commodity during that point in time and so most colonies actually were established with hemp production in mind it was produced until the mid 1950s in the the US and in the 1970s the Controlled Substances Act came around and it included a provision while it exempts hemp fiber and non viable seeds for grain it includes viable seeds in all leaf material under the definition of marijuana and so that makes it very difficult to grow a plant if you don't have a part of a plant or a seed to start with and so that was effectively a prohibition against the crop even though it wasn't necessarily it's a direct intent say with that other countries kept growing him there were some countries that had banned him and they were coming back to it such as Canada and Europe and in 2014 there were states that we're really looking at okay why are we not growing him when we're importing all this material from foreign countries we could be growing this in the u.s. giving American farmers another crop opportunity instead of just having to rely on international sources for this kind of material and so there was a research program that began in 2014 with that farm bill distinguishing hemp from marijuana and so with that able to do research into him he didn't remove it from the controlled substance act it just made an exemption for him in a research context and that was essentially when I got involved with him production in Kentucky in 2018 though the farm bill because of the success of the 2014 farm bills hemp research program removed officially removed hemp from the list of controlled substances and so now it's illegal at a federal level Ohio still had a little bit of work to do though we had states have duplicates regulations for their controlled substance act so it was listed both at a federal level for marijuana but also at the state level and so we needed to remove that from the state definition to be able to take place that in Ohio and so that was done the end of her the end of July this past year in that there was a statement allowing universities that have had approval from the Ohio Department of Ag which is who was given control over the hemp program we could ask for approval from them to work and start researching him before they got the full licensing program commercial licensing program up and available so we are able to we started that and planted last August and we're able to get a little bit of data and do some educational awareness for the crop in Ohio State I know was able to do so as well at the end of December Ohio State or Ohio went from being one of the last States to have a hemp program to being one of them to be the of the first three approved for the in relation to the federal rules that are out there call them interim federal rules those are set to be finalized later down the line but they're trying to gather information from all the state programs to operate the national program and so the Ohio rules match what have been proposed for the federal program and so at the end of January or middle of January Ohio finalized its rules as they were submitted to the federal government and as of today they were actually oh the licenses are open for applications people have been waiting for that for awhile and so this has actually been the Ohio Department of Ag is actually done a very good job I've seen states that have taken far longer to get commercial licenses up and running so they've done quite a good job even though there's been a number of setbacks for them along the way so this is looking at how we differentiate hemp from marijuana and so I mentioned at the very beginning that it's due to this the content of the THC and so anything with less than 0.3 percent THC classifies legally as hemp both out of state and federal level anything more than that still classifies as marijuana and so this is a just the question to see everybody's input which of these plants is hemp and which of these is marijuana in here anybody have an idea now nobody could tell the difference those are actually all hemp plants you can see the differences in how they look there's no way to sit there and look at the plants say this is a hemp plant that it's a marijuana plant so the only way commit to differentiate him from marijuana is looking at that THC level having samples collected and analyzed by a laboratory and so that's something that's a little actually quite unique for this crop you have to have the plants sampled to make sure they're compliant with the regulations and so you know most people don't like chemistry but this is a plant that if you're gonna get in to working with it you need to at least understand some basic chemistry and so one of the things we have here is the plant itself makes this compound called Delta nine tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid or THC a for short and when you heat that so that's what the plant makes what we're regulating is this THC over here so what happens is particularly during the heating process but some storage and other factors play a role as well you get this loss of this carbon dioxide group and it goes from a relatively non-intoxicating cannabinoid into an intoxicating cannabinoid and so it has this potential thus THCA has this potential to be an intoxicating component and so when the state of Ohio was setting up its regulations and following the new federal guidelines it went with what we call a total THC approach which means you do take the amount of THC plus the amount of THC a in the plant because the plants naturally producing you only have very trace levels of this oftentimes in fresh plant material because the Steve are decarboxylation is not happening in the plant most often most of the time and so but we want to know the intoxicating potential of that plant so we know we know if it's him or marijuana and other states do calculate this differently this has caused a lot of headache and confusion within the industry space but this is Ohio's definition it does match the federal definition at least at this point in time and so there is this conversion factor here and that's just a simply a weight conversion between these two compounds for the loss of that carbon dioxide so that's where that multiplier in front of it comes from so essentially you're adding these two components together now the plant produces over 120 different cannabinoids including all these or these three down here again they're producing a Neve what we call the acidic form or the acid form which then upon decarboxylation go to these neutral forms and so that's where we get these compounds like cannabidiol or CBD or can a bigger raw CBG that you'll hear for these different types of plants that are out on the market to grow for these particular compounds so when we're quantifying this there's the definition seems relatively straightforward you know there's less than 0.3 percent THC okay so if we're looking at total THC we do THC e plus the THC a but we know there's an inherent variability within the analytical process of testing for metabolites and this goes for any plant metabolites not just THC theirs margins of errors from the machine from handling samples and just all throughout the process or slight variations that even if two people are trying to do the exact same process identically there's just going to be inherent a little bit of variability within that and so if you go over that point three percent limit the grower has to destroy the crop and that's going to be a complete loss to them there is no compensation for that and so this is something that nobody really takes lightly because we realize there's the regulators realize there's this serious financial impact on the grower if their crop test hot and so to address this if you have one lab test the sample it may test 0.29 and be compliant if it has another lab test it you may be point three one and it may be in compliant and so that is because of that inherent variability and so what the USDA and its new regulations has put forth and what Ohio's adopt is what we call this acceptable THC level and basically this accounts for the measurement of variability within the machine during the process and so a little straight that so if you have example one here your crop hemp crop comes back and it's tested at 0.25 percent THC well here you have no problem you're under 0.3 nothing to be worried about okay an example to if you have your crop comes back and test 0.33 on the THC under this acceptable THC level definition now we look at the inherit margin of error for the machine and the equipment and all the testing process and we see that be 0.04 in this hypothetical case so in this case we have 0.33 minus 0.04 and you get point two nine is the low end of what that margin of error may be for that machine on that on that reading okay and so since this spans that point three value this is now considered an acceptable level of THC because it that just from the margin the reason that sample may be over the legal limit is because of the machine in just this testing process so the in this case that sample would be deemed compliant even though it's technically over that point three that point three limit but it's because that margin of error it becomes acceptable in contrast if you have your crop comes back and test point three six and the margin of there is 0.04 you wind up with 0.32 is the low value it doesn't span that point three percent limit and so that is over the limit that legally classifies as a marijuana and that crop must be destroyed okay so this is something a little new not all this was until the USDA issued the federal regulations this really wasn't in anybody's picture on the state's doing hemp research and so this was kind of a new concept for everybody you'll hear I know we have Jim coming up to talk after the break so I'm not going to belabor too much of the details on the requirements but there are requirements for a licensing application basically you're looking at your address GPS coordinates for where it's going to be grown the number of acres or square foot if it's indoors as well as there's a thousand plant minimum from either of those types of locations in Ohio and so that thousand plant minimum is a little unique to Ohio it's not something other states necessarily excuse me do there is no there's a couple restrictions no planning within a hundred feet of a residence no fine planting 500 feet of a park or a school or within a half mile of a medical marijuana cultivator the medical marijuana cultivators are all indoors but they were concerned about pollination of their material which would run the value of their medical marijuana products the residency these are requirements that people like where do these come from and wondering where were they why we deal with them within the residences because some states have a number of issues with people trying to grow a few hemp plants in their house and they don't want to have to have the state agents going into people's homes to test things and also it really becomes difficult to tell hemp plants if when sampling if you're gonna have plants that look like marijuana growing inside so they wanted to keep it out of people's houses so the a number of states have adopted a minimum distance and then hemp has a number of pests but one of the premier pests is a very two-legged kind and people walking off with hemp growers plants thinking it's something else or even not thinking it's something else and just stealing these high-value plants and so if you're near a park or school you tend to have a lot of high school middle school students that really don't know the difference between the two and just asking for a whole bunch of problems so there's a distance away from them to avoid that issue so that that's really for everybody's benefit to have that minimum distance there a general timeline for hemp production this is a very general timeline for the on the regulatory side but usually the applications are going to be open November 1st to March 31st this year because of the late start of the program I believe the email said they were extending them to May 1st this year because of the delays and not getting them open till today 15 days prior to the harvest so there will be a planting report submitted saying that you planted X number of acres or square feet in number of plants there's other reporting requirements that go along with that but 15 days prior to the intended harvest you're gonna submit and intent the harvest report to the ODA they're gonna come and say ok we need to collect samples to make sure this crop is compliant they'll come out collect those samples at which point you can either harvest or wait til it comes back to harvest they'll give you and okay if it's an acceptable level hunt then that crop could be sold if it doesn't come and for some reason it fails a secondary test could be ordered although that cost additional money because they have to send people back out to really collect samples and stuff again but that is an option if that second test failed than that crop will be destroyed so we're looking at all this and you're probably wondering why are we going to all this headache and the reason for that is there's a lot of uses for him well there's three major crops there's it could be grown for fiber which is what a lot of people think of when they hear hemp could also be grown for grain it's got a very nutritious seed and it also could be grown for the non intoxicating metabolites so the CBD or the CBG within the plant that have potential medicinal values or other value and so overall there's an estimated twenty five-plus thousand uses for the plant and so there's a lot of options that could be potentially done with this crop it's viewed as very quite sustainable crop and so with a movement towards sustainability this is a really a key interest and so there is an inherent value associated with having hemp in the product with the flowers this is just a little bit about the three major crops so for metabolites you're looking at the flowers this is a male flower this is actually one individual female flower people typically within the industry they call the whole thing the flower but that's actually an inflorescence one individual flower is this little Brak and they have these little two little pistols coming out of this and you notice all these little white dots on the outside of that brac and those are what we call trichomes and that's where those cannabinoids and terpenoids really what we're after so the highest level of those is on female flowers and them to maximize production of that you try to avoid pollination with the male plants so is the maximize the continued growth of those female flowers and the swelling of those trichomes instead of shifting that toward seed development seeds if you pipe the crop gets pollinated you get seeds these are very nutrient dense or high and a lot of vitamins they've got a very balanced fatty acid profile of omega-3s omega-6s so they're very healthy seed on a fat content a lot of our antioxidants in them it's an easily digestible high-quality protein so overall it makes an excellent food source almost all the grain at this point in time really goes into food products and so you'd be handling it like you would be handling a food grade crop so there's gonna be a little more you're gonna want to make sure everything's handled a lot more cleanly and you would just say with your corn and soybeans that's gonna more likely wind up an animal feed uh and then the longest and oldest use for the hemp crop or hemp plant is for the fibers and so this is what we call a bast fiber plant this is where the foot that means the fibers come from the stem and here you can see the long fibers pulled away from the inside of this woody pore which we call the herd so the herds got a composition fairly similar to a very light woody stick it's very light material but it has a composition that's just similar to wood with this fiber on the outside is very high cellulosic content which in very high purity 75 85 percent cellulose and so you're getting something that's a very strong fiber and that's really what the interest for industrial applications is and so one of the common uses for the fiber is in car parts is actually using them in card panels because it could provide that cellulose fiber could provide that strength similar to you would with a fiber glass but a fraction of the weight and so you could keep that higher fuel efficiency while reducing while maintaining that structural integrity of the vehicle so not so many American cars at this point but foreign cars and particularly use a fair bit of hemp I during their production so again so that was the overview like three major crops a fiber or the grain and the metabolites we do have what I call supporting crops for this and this is either certified seed non certified seed production or clones and so this would be people growing material that would support the hemp farmer so like your being growing seed for greater I'm not grating sorry the seed would be for planting the clones would be for planting metabolite crops I'm not gonna cover those in a bunch of detail those are a little more specific examples when we're talking about temps there's some differences in terminology you'll hear what we call cultivars or varieties and what we call strains and sprains is not really typically a botanical term but it's widely used within the cannabis space cultivars and varieties those are like what you think of for any plant where they've been traditionally bred to a high level of genetic uniformity so you know what you're gonna get when you plant that that seed out in the field strains on the other hand or genetically very unstable they're just somebody's crossed something they like that plant so they're gonna sell it to you as is typically these are all going to be from metabolites whereas your cultivars are gonna be either grain or fiber types and so that strain terminology comes actually out of the marijuana industry and that's because all the genetics for this essentially derived from marijuana so with fiber production we have we have grain or we have sorry we have fiber and what we call dual purpose varieties which are grain or fiber you're typically planting these at very high densities you're looking at 30 to 35 plants per square foot you want to very tightly packed so they force to get as tall as possible no branches thin stem so that maximizes the fiber production on the outside and minimizes that inner woody herd and you really want that height because that's where you're getting that biomass is gonna be why you're paid off of for the yield so really you want plants in excess of 10 feet tall the closer to 15 14 15 feet you could get this the better these are gonna be harvested around mid-august typically when the male plants are in the middle or finished flowering which were Ohio is gonna be around mid-august here because it's a very photos responsive plant it says it's very easy straightforward to predict when it's actually going to flower once that fiber stock has been cut they're gonna usually that's with a sickle bar or some type of cutting implement similar to that it's gonna be left to rot in the field for two to six weeks or more really depends on the moisture for a process we call reading which is essentially a controlled rotting where we allow bacteria and fungi from the soil and the air to land on the plants and decay that partially decayed that stem to loosen those fibers from that inner woody inner woody herd and so that makes it easier for the decor decatur to process so that'd be the processor for it currently there's low demands and low returns for fiber because there's a lack of infrastructure that's our big problem with fiber at the moment is there's not enough companies processing it it takes a lot of money to get it involved in fiber processing and it takes a long time to pay that equipment off for this type of crop we don't have the best variety suited to u.s. production at the moment but again our biggest issues with infrastructure for grain here he could use grain or these dual purpose varieties again the could be used for fiber or grain most of those are coming out of Europe I'm although some come from Canada this is where you're actually actively trying to get the grain so you're gonna have males and female plants in the field you're gonna plant about half the density you would for fiber so about 10 to 15 plants per square foot this is and you don't want the plants to get as tall you still don't really want bushy but you just don't want them to get as tall and have as much competition so they could develop that full flower head really you want plants about 5 to 6 feet tall anybody got an idea why you don't want to go over about 6 feet tall with a grain plant yes that's exactly the problem it found Kentucky found out very early on the first year tried doing grain production there was at least two different combines caught fire and literally burnt up because they tried to cut it at the stalks at the base of the plant and run the whole material through well even though this is being grown for grain it is still a fiber plant those fibers wrap around gears of combines and will literally stop them it's a hit you know you have to get in with razor blades to cut those off it get wrapped up around things so the best way to harvest for grain is to actually go right below that grain head and you have to be able to get that the grain head on the combine up high enough to get right under that grain head so you can minimize that amount of grain running minimize the amount of stock material running through to avoid those tying up issues you also have to go very slowly even with that because the plants are susceptible to shattering the seed and so the plants are gonna to avoid that problem you don't harvest when the plants fully mature it's only partially mature at that point in time the rough value people throw out is about 70% a lot of debate on whether that's the best recommendation or not and what 70% actually means but that means you're gonna have green matru fresh green material going through there look at this grain heads gonna look very similar to this when it's actually going through the combine it's going to be very green and leafy and wet the grain itself is gonna be anywhere from 12 to 20 plus percent moisture on it and so you have to go very slow just because of all that wet material as well one of the tricks with the grain is it's a little different than other grain crops is because of its high polyunsaturated fats in it those omega-3s omega-6s it could go over an sit real quickly and so it needs to be even though it starts out very wet and needs to be dried down consistently not necessarily fast but it needs to be dried down and consistently and put into a drying system right away and we're looking at a drain system that's not one of those that propane furnaces that you feed it in one end and it comes out of you our later dry out the other end those shad those will split the seeds and run the seeds in in a separate different may different way so they need to be put under forced air with some heat but it's gonna be a slow heat to just dry it in the grain bin lots of agitation to keep from developing hot spots within that bin it's pretty strong demands and good returns at this point for it the grains one of the more successful markets at the moment that's pretty much what we were buying we're still buying a lot of material from Canada to fill that particular market in a good yield for grain production really shooting around that thousand pounds an acre mark it's not uncommon to go less than that particularly the first year so trying to grow grain crop some places further north where it's a little drier have gotten in excess of that the main challenge with grain is the shattering issue you could lose a lot of grain very quickly and by quickly I mean you could lose tends to fit these a pounds of seed per acre per day if it's caught at the wrong time so you could lose a lot of grain very quickly off the plant so if it gets too dry and you get a strong rainstorm or a windstorm come through it will dislodge a huge amount of grain and it'll just wind up on the ground there's nothing you could do about it you'll have a nice stand of volunteer hemp the next year which you'll have to control but that's about all those will come out of that the last category is typically the one the most popular at the moment because this is where people had been seeing dollar signs and I say had been because at the moment the market is very saturated and people are having a hard time even selling the biomass that they produced this past year but this has mostly grown for CBD although there is CBG plants that came out on the market this last year and so they'll probably be a lot more prevalent this year these are all derived from marijuana genetics so they're all susceptible to testing hot part of that's because you try to push the CBD levels up as high as you can as a grower because you're being paid by percentage point of CBD per pound of material and so to get the most CBD there you 10 THC levels slowly track along with that and so the higher the CBD levels go up the higher the THC levels go up and the more likely your to test non-compliant so when growing this crop it's you have to do monitoring very closely to with sending samples in for THC testing just to make sure okay you know what the THC level is at this point in time and you can get an idea of when you we need to harvest that plant too so it's still compliant crop these are either started from clones or seeds the clones of the seeds would be started in a greenhouse and then transpired out clones are directly transplanted into the field after rooting in a greenhouse anywhere on a six by six spacings common although you're really anywhere from a thousand to 2,500 plants per acre people do less if people do more than that so there's really no standard rate on that at this point in time each clones about two to five dollars per clone it's probably gonna be on the lower end of that this coming here likely it's hard telling nobody ever knows with the market on this stuff it is a high labour cost with few exceptions it is mostly hand done crop it's very similar to tobacco in most systems I'm where you're gonna have to go in once you transplant it you're gonna have to do weed control of some form either with plastic but really that's the straightforward part if you have plastic it's the hand cutting every plant and hand hanging the plant to dry or cutting off those flowers to run through a dryer there's a whole bunch of different ways this could be handled but they're all very labor-intensive and people tend to have a hard time keeping a consistent labor supply doing this because after the first several days their labors like this is too much work we're not doing this so having a consistent labor supply is important this shouldn't be there has been a high demand for it but the returns at this point or questionable last I knew was about a dollar a pound per percentage point so to give you an idea where that started out about four years ago that was about four dollars a percentage point so it's drop to that munch and it was about two dollars last fall when people are harvesting so it's dropped quite a bit since then so there's all been a lot of value lost in that crop whether those prices how and when they're gonna stabilize really don't know so it's not the best market time to be jumping in that so one of our previous speakers was talking about you know you have this curve where technology's coming along for the drones then it's there's a peak interest and now then there's a valley at the bottom where everybody's like oh this has got lots of problems yeah we're in that phase right now couple of years just a couple years ago was like right nice at the top of that peak and everybody's like all excited the market it's not all that great at the moment problems with the metabolite crops are the THC levels and testing hot although some of the CBG plants should avoid some of that problem but then the issue with those is that doesn't necessarily have the same market as CBD does labor supplies concerns about nearby hemp pollen that's a common one people growing these metabolite crops don't want their flowers pollinated so if there's any other hemp around in the area there that's a cause of concern and how to store dry large volumes of that material and store those flowers without getting any degradation of any form is also a a challenge there's mechanical equipment being developed but it's not widely deployed at this point in time and it's expensive since this is a tillage conference and a conservation tillage conference I want to put in a slide about this this is not necessarily the best crop for conservation tillage some people have tried it in Kentucky I don't think they went back to try it again it did that well it like it's a very weak seedling it likes a very fine firm seat and so it really likes soils that have been deeply tilled and are very light very fluffy that they get good contact with the scene when the planter runs through and come over top of them the metabolite crops also or usually plants into very till well tilled soils because they're gonna be shaping beds a lot of times and laying down plastic mulch so it's not exactly at this time conducive for conservation type tillage practices although there's definitely research that needs to be done looking at that because a lot of that we just really haven't looked at in any depth if you're thinking about growing hemp these are some points that you really need to consider first off and then rod this is a rough order about how you want to think about them start off by thinking about what type of hemp you're interested in growing be that grain fiber or metabolites figure out where you would put it simplex good ground doesn't like wet feet likes well-drained soils it's a good soil for other crops it's gonna be likely a good soil for him evaluate what kind of facilities and equipment you may have because those are gonna dictate how much you need to plant you don't want to plant more than you can handle otherwise you could lose money very quickly and a lot of people have run into that problem not realizing how much space and plants could take one large hemp plant for metabolite production for drying can take up to 16 plus square feet cubic feet of space for drying you don't get a lot of plants in an area with that much space you may even want to go wider than that because you need good ventilation to keep those plants from getting mold and stuff while drying determine the type of the amount you want to plant I'm going back to those what facilities and equipment you have and the labor you have access to find somebody to an establish a contract with for that crop it's going to be hard to get contracts particularly this coming year but those contracts solve a number of issues one you know you're going to have a buyer for that material the other part is you also know what that particular buyer wants not every processor wants their plants the same way they'll dry them differently they'll process them how they process them the difference so they're they want specific varieties they want specific harvest dates there's a lot of things that will be specified by a particular processor and that'll be unique to them so it's also very useful in that regard to know what they specifically want from from you figure out some of that will help figure out what strain a variety you want expect challenges everybody has challenges the first year with this plant nobody is an exception to that rule everybody's still learning about this plant there's a lot we don't know it's very plastic to its environment and so it does a lot of things that you would not necessarily think of plants going to do develop a financial plan this is really comes down to everybody's particular operation there's no necessarily set guidelines for this the University of Kentucky has a good website if you go to the University of Kentucky hemp just type that in they'll take you to the main their hemp web page and I'm down at the bottom of that page there's a place where he could have accessed some Excel forms to plug in numbers for what you think you can make off the crop and how what your different types of expenses are go do that because you're the only one that's gonna be able to figure out whether this is going to be right for your operation or not pens on the processor if you're selling for grain they're gonna be selling just the grain if you're selling for fiber they're gonna buy bales of that rented fiber they're buying for floral material it could be just the flower it could be the whole plant it could be whole plant without the stalks this is where those contracts come in because every processor has different things they're going to buy and what one processor wants is not necessarily what the other one wants so that's a good question once you've figured all that out and you still think okay I want to try growing some hemp go get a license and you're gonna have to have a license report all those coordinates those coordinates I should mention it's not because the government just wants to control everything you're doing those coordinates are actually used by the or collected by the ODA so they know where the fields are and then they can give those numb are those locations to the State Police so when they fly over in their unmarked helicopters they don't land on your property thinking you have and ten acres of weed growing out in there in your back property that's not a good day for anybody those GPS coordinates are for your benefits that those are being reported they're giving them to the people that need to know that information or are gonna find out otherwise on their own in a less pleasant manner and that that happens so that's what there's a lot of things with that and I'm sure you'll hear more about that from the next speaker there's some final things if you're doing when you do a contract have a lawyer somebody with experience evaluate that there's all sorts of different variations and they're not all good and a lot of them still have that will get drafted have lots of problems so I have somebody with legal experience actually look over and help you with it it's worth the investment start small take some effort to figure out all the what scrapp likes it's a very fun and rewarding plant but it is very unique and so I do recommend start small usually an acre for metabolite material or maybe 510 acres of grain or fiber or something along that lines once you get that done your first growing season feel comfortable with it then you could scale up as you have that experience good at stand establishing is needed to avoid weed problems if you don't get that it will be a weed there will be weed problems and hemp does have some pest problems and disease problems and I need to change this as of about a month ago there is some very very few pesticides labeled for hemp they're not what a lot of people would consider the most effective type of pesticides so essentially a lot of its going to be grown very organic type system just by the nature of not having sufficient pesticides for the for the crop and none of those are herbicides there's still some issues with banks and financing being worked out although this is getting better and there was always this chance of a crop failure a year like this past year which was real wet wood is awful for him it does not like that standing water so that will kill it very quickly and then there's a lot of charlatans within the space selling seeds and clones and so you really need to vet who you're working with so you know you're getting good quality material to start with we are gonna Central States gonna host an event next week for anybody interested we have a flyer dr. Cindy Faulk back there as I'm on the table we're having a networking event where we're getting some processors together they'll have some tables and then perspective growers to come in and network with them and try to develop those contracts and those agreements for for producing the crop so let one of us know if you want more information about that if you want more information in detail about the production side we have an extension bulletin we just put out then we also have an extension bulletin we just put out about those getting started with the crop so those things I was listing through about how to go about getting started with hemp production that goes in a more detail there so with that I think I might have a little time for a few questions yeah so what that does anybody have any questions yes so whether it's grain fiber or metabolize it all has to be e to be hemp it has to be less than that point 3 percent THC now I will say if you're using cultivar grain and fiber cultivars that have been bred as traditional hemp varieties in other countries not in the you those aren't coming from the US at this point in time it'll come from countries that have had hemp production longer than we have generally those are not going to be a concern because they've been selectively bred to meet that requirement that's not saying they couldn't be an issue generally they're not gonna be an issue the real concern are the metabolite crops where you're pushing that CBD content in that THC content Falls yeah well so yeah if it if it test hot moving it over to a new use yeah there's been people pushing on that and there is some progress being made on that with USDA regulations I don't know necessarily how I'll handle that but they just the USDA just said okay they're gonna approve a few more methods for disposal of hot crops but they're all going to be in corporate so they're basically if they're not gonna be burnt they're gonna be buried in the soil somehow until back in is a green manure crop so they're still not making it to like people would like to see into those fiber or other applications like people would want to see but part of that is fiber a good fiber plant is very different than a metabolite plant you don't have those long fibers in those metabolite plants because you have all those branches interfering with that from the bushiness of the plant that disrupts those fiber bundles so there is some logistical issues with that as well [Music] harvest do some of these yes no so each as the plants maturing the this the metabolite consonant is ease increasing generally may fluctuate a little bit but the general trend is the plant ages the flower ages that's going up yes the THC level parallels that because the enzyme responsible for making that tea or CBD is leaky and make some THC in the process so that's why they track together so the only way to get it is to cut that THC level off and that's yes yes so that's why when you're doing the metabolite crop you want to monitor you know start several weeks after flowering and monitor or at least weekly sand samples off say okay what's the THC content what's the THC content there's no on-farm test you could do at this point so it's sending those samples for lab [Music] not directly now it's not making any more new metabolites once it's cut there's some conversion issues but that's more of the where that THC a convert starts to convert to that THC itself so you get that kind of chemistry going on but there's a lot we don't know on that part o this last year I think they had about 1200 licensed and they had I think in the end they had upwards of 50,000 acres approved I don't know how much actually got planted and how much got harvested five embassy for what like the number of people growing it oh yeah for production it's much more for the grain the markets most states have about 80 plus percent for the metabolites about 5% for the fire were and the rest is kind of grain no the fiber at the moments the lowest value and it's also got the most the least number of people that can process it because there's not that infrastructure yeah we're gonna find out very shortly because the licenses for those also open today and so if I'm correct yeah so you'll be able to see that you'll be able to see that going forward at the moment though nobody's been licensed yet because it just started so that's why the event were hosting was people that I've been working with I know we're gonna apply for those licenses they don't have a license yet because nobody does but they're they're companies working on getting well established in that space so we do know there will be processors how how many and where don't know at this point that's a good question I don't know what the last count was I've heard last I knew they had over 120 I think they might be up to close to 200 down although they did have one very big processor just go bankrupt so that put a put a big damper on the industry because that company had contracted I think about ten thousand acres worth of material so yeah just the contract doesn't necessarily mean people are safe yeah no that would be the easy way [Music] somebody from the ODA is gonna have to come out and witness that destruction to validate that it was destroyed in an appropriate manner so I'm sure Jim could give you more details on that but yeah for the longest time the irony there was you know the only way to destroy it was to burn it and test it it tested hot classifies it of marijuana so let's burn it love the irony in that one I always have yeah yeah yeah yeah inevitable get that question so that was just a recently found molecule in some marijuana genetics in Italy um and I it was not at a very high level in the plant it just seems to be very super potent I can speculate about the origin of that but we don't know it's unlikely to be prevalent in a lot of cannabis at this point though [Music]", "Q7-RgJSvioM": "[Music] well guys welcome to CCC I'm Shannon coming through for a little solo concentrate review today I actually checking out some live resins from bear labs pretty sure bear actually used two BCE solutions so if you've been smoking oil in the in the California market for a couple of years you're probably familiar with Cee maybe wondering where they went they are now bear labs this particular flavor I've got my hands on here is called lemon meringue so I think we might have some some pipes in here go ahead and crack this baby open maybe the nose on this one is loud I'll definitely give it that super super citrusy definitely some skunk enos in there so lemon meringue if this is the lemon meringue that I think it is it's the exotic genetics lemon meringue which is cookies and cream and I want to say lemon skunk cookies and cream definitely a super fire cookie cut it's you know definitely one of the more finicky ones to grow not always a huge yield er but the buds that you get from it are really really nice I've always liked cookies and cream lemon skunk definitely one of my least favorite lemon Terp strains all the you know typical strains that have kind of that st. herb profile the [ __ ] tan geez and the clementines and the kaleo's and all that same old [ __ ] lemon skunk was one of the first ones I remember seeing with that turf profile but it's usually not quite as sweet as some of the other ones like the Clementine or the tangi and for that reason it's usually not one of my favorite Andy chirps but I do have to admit those that I'm getting off this one it's really really nice fire up the ship here and good [Music] oh definitely a fan of that flavor though I definitely got the the citrusy thing that I was expecting based on the smell but another layer in there almost like almost like a sweet kind of like a vanilla almost like a vanilla extract taste or something like it's kind of it's weird cuz it's just like a hint of that vanilla but it's like that very distinct and it's not like vanilla ice cream it's more of like a I don't know like I say like a cooking vanilla type type smell and flavor and taste I one was actually really interesting I'm probably gonna have to go back just to do another test to get a little bit more conclusive results on the flavor there so bear with me there one thing that's always kind of confused me about some of these citrusy strains is like the Clementine and you know all these other like orangie citrusy tasting strains there's a lot of people refer to that Terp isn't lemon like the lemon G is a good example it's called lemon tea to me it tastes nothing like lemon at all it's very like citrusy for me it's not the the more sour flavor it's more like the sweet just citrusy orangie I feel like a lot of these these uh like where they're calling this one lemon meringue I'm seeing a lot of these called lemon this and lemon that and maybe it's just my palate in the way I interpret it but all these lemon strains are very much orange to me like I said I actually really like the flavor that I got at that last one but it definitely didn't remind me of a lemon meringue pie that's one thing I do have to say about it maybe this one will a little more we'll find out [Music] [Music] oh say I definitely got the job done I don't know if you guys can see it on camera here but I'm [ __ ] sweating bullets I'm definitely feeling it right behind the eyes I'll get that you know forehead feeling's fuzzy type thing going on I like the flavor on this I like the buzz I like the smell I know like I said it's just hitting me so hard because those first two dabs of the day but I'm definitely feeling this stuff looking at the label who looks like it comes in at ninety three point one six total cannabinoids seventy eight point eight four percent THC zero percent CBD so definitely this stuff is gonna give you that nice nice heady high with these genetics I'm definitely expecting it to be you know definitely sativa leaning probably not too racy because you got the cookies in there to kind of mellow it out another thing about those lemon strains at least for me personally is they tend to be strands that I'll just smoke for the flavor because they don't really they don't really give me high there's there's none of that like indica body effect influence in there and for a sativa like if I'm gonna I'm more of an indica guy generally I used to smoke a lot more sativas but even then if I'm gonna smoke this Teva I want something that's gonna really get the gears turn it up here get me in that kind of creative introspective just you know sometimes I want to be all in my head for certain things and that's usually when I you know try to find a really good sativa the women's trains unfortunately just never quite get me there they just don't give you a tiny head change sometimes but they just don't get you over the hump I think they're good strands like I said for the flavor obviously it's hard to you know match the the potent flavor of some of these like lemon and citrusy strains but this one surprisingly actually got me pretty high that first day I took was mostly all rocks and just a little bit of Terps that last stab I took was way more terms and the Terps one was definitely a little bit you know harsher going down but I think by the time I exhaled that one I'm you know there was no doubt alright I'm high alright think that about wraps it up for this one thank you guys for watching another video here on the CCC go ahead real quick down there in the comments let me know what you guys are smoking on right now and let me know what kind of video you guys would like to see next whether I feel a way can make Wednesday strain review glass review bond-athon or if you guys have a new idea for a video go ahead and drop that down there in the comments give this video a like hit the bell and we'll see you guys on the next one I'm Shane for the CCC [Music] [Music]", "01fQEsUZ1j4": "[Music] what's up everybody Robert Sykes Quito savage calm calm [Music] anyways I pretty much lost my voice completely somewhat and heard a lot of talking today oh yeah congratulations also we have no idea if this recipes gonna work all these miracle recipes it for making this month our total process so we'll see what happens it might be his soup by the end of business that have done pizza that we're playing it for but it's supposed to be a miracle pizza and you need and we're only counting the crust here we're gonna put whatever toppings you want onto it but the crust is gonna be one ounce of cream cheese one whole egg 100 grams of mozzarella and miracle rice and I'm using one of those big bulk package sleeves you could use several of the smaller ones we're gonna see how that works but these ingredients you have these macros 35 grams of fat 33 grams of protein 5 grams of carbs which breaks down to 68 percent fat 28% protein and 4% carps boom all right now another quick little caveat I see what you're getting it in the cooking so catch you on a little bit alright y'all this is the big sleeve of miracle right and this is the big question with this recipe right now we've we've got one of these we've strained it and we've put it single layer onto a baking sheet got it in the oven right now yeah we didn't feel myself doing that it's pretty self-explanatory basically strain this in a strainer a sieve and stick in the oven at 450 425 to let it dry out these things hold water just like this like 97% water by weight the idea is to take a lot of moisture out by putting in the oven so this crust holds up so that's what we're doing right now alright gel so we had our miracle rice in the oven for like 40 minutes at 425 was a wonderful thing 25 for 25 and this is what it looks like it's still a little moist but I mean a lot of the moisture has been taken out of it so we're gonna just use this as our base and we're gonna make this into the crust so get ready all right so you got the cream cheese in there we're going to put the cheese in there and then we're going to melt it in the microwave this is the point where I like to add in whatever seasonings you like in there we're just gonna add in a little bit of Italian and add some salt whatever you like you might be probably won't read the whole sleeve we're not counting the macros on that anyways since they're basically zero calorie I kind of just squish it in there alright that's all mixed in you might have to reheat the cheese if it didn't blend very well or mix very well I think and add the egg on top and mix it all up alright guys so now that we got all of that mixed together you should be able to kind of like be able to grab it in a ball and flop it on there and then all we're gonna do is spread it out if it's a little bit hard for you to spread out then you can use parchment paper to just use it to smooth out all right shell so now that we have our crust on our tray we're gonna stick this in the oven at 425 that kind of hardened up song alright so it has been in the oven at 425 for 20 minutes starting to brown on top that's what we're looking for let's take it out and doctor it up all right now is the fun part and how we gonna adopt this up with whatever we want I'm gonna put some cheese some pesto this is really good pesto and I'm gonna put some anchovies on there I don't know if y'all gonna like anchovies or not but put whatever you want I'm a fan of anchovies and for the moment [Music] all right children stick it back in for another 5-10 minutes or so little holes ingredients milk on top all right show the miracle rice pizza is done it's not really like it's kind of flimsy and then like it's not really a crunchy thin stiff crust it's kind of weird it's like a it's like a spongy it's like not a crunchy crisp crust it's kind of a spongy crust yeah I'd make it longer for sure with the miracle rested is so much moisture in there so you got just bacon longer I kind of confidence it for that yeah you look at more full you know it's like there's not a whole lot of creativity that went into this actually Teresa died my client that had the podcast she's the one that sent me the recipe for shout out the threesome but it's basically like a fat head crust without the almond flour I think she actually use almonds about her I just wanted to see what without homeless power this would be good like when you're in a contest prep when you're trying to watch your macros or you can't have almonds on it's like yeah there's like other things I'm kind of drying up to it like psyllium husk powder or like a black seed or something like that if you can't have nuts and you still want to make it a little bit more they simply add a powder to it to make it more crunchy but it smells not mad you get like the flavor of pizza obviously and so yeah I'm better now to eat this whole thing because the macros on the lunette but I can do that cuz it's a miracle it's a miracle scheduled later", "Qe25ikI_MWU": "hey guys Cassey here and welcome to food fights today we're going to make the easiest cookie in the world you just need two ingredients you need one banana and one cup of rolled oats if you want to get real fancy on me go ahead and add some craisins or raisins and you're good to go if you don't have an oven you can even

Maggs mmm I have ten more mmm so good and you're probably wondering how the microwave cookie compare I actually have no idea I really clean out my food bites videos so let's see I came out in one piece so it's totally legit already it looks like a cookie it feels like a cookie how does it taste like a cookie hmm you guys this is like a revolution I mean bananas are 19 cents at Trader Joe's oatmeal's totally cheap raisins are totally cheap and make this for your friends your family everybody share this recipe right now this is crazy this is crazy oh my goodness how many more who knew you

love you I love goodbyes videos", "Ka3Y7hPYUPk": "okay cool so today we've got some cush mountains from antibiotics i started seeing this brand pop up a few months ago and they just basically were everywhere all of a sudden i've heard this is one of their best drains so i figured might as well cop it and see what's good so let's check out these mountains together zoom in on that beautiful waterfall all right so here we are of course the front's got these i guess the cush mountains with their waterfall on lake and beautiful pine trees and whatnot hybrid 80 indica 20 sativa already uh and then we're coming around here there's the ticket and their instagram oh high times world high times world all right high times world first place best hybrid flower all right cool so here is the testing panel let's see what's going on here let me zoom out a little bit uh so it looks like we're coming in at 30.88 percent thc and a little bit of cbd in there at 0.05 percent and total cannabinoids at 36.34 and terps at two point four six percent i've seen terps listed on a few uh testing panels but i really haven't paid too much attention so i think that's pretty good though chime in the comments tell me what's good um in any case all right uh this was cultivated back on 6 11 best buy july of next year i guess and packaged at the beginning of july so we're about midway through august now so yeah not too old at all it was i've been sitting on this one a little bit so that might be my bad in any case there's the government warning and let's see what's on top here cbx antibiotics so all right let's crack this seal and see what's up with these cush mountains oh sealed far protection all right everybody get ready whatever protective gear you have pull it out because we're about to go in to the cush mountains i hope you got your bear spray all right here we go looking pretty awesome so far that looks like a pretty good representation of the jar so i'm gonna grab this guy here excuse my ugly thumb all right so yeah these are about the size of the buds that are in there let me go ahead and get in on this you know what i'm gonna grab the lid it's gonna be a little bit better of a showcase than my ugly unsteady hand boom there you go sweet so yeah oh i can smell it too smells great mmm it's got like a really fresh scent there's uh you know like sweetness there's mint in there uh a little bit of fruitiness maybe but yeah definitely sugary candy sweetness with some mint in there it's beautiful it's uh i could see maybe you know it uh bring it to mine kind of like york peppermint patty kind of vibes not exactly like that kind of minty but just like a really fresh smell we're like ooh you know so kush mountains is probably a good good name for this train i would say just due to that factor it feels like you're out in the woods you're running around smelling those fresh pine trees the freshness of the wood but yeah there's this sugary sweetness there as well so definitely smelling delicious so yeah and it's looking great as you guys can see here so pretty good entry from antibiotics i'd say so let's see how it smokes", "Wv-K38IyVvQ": "[Music] and to listen them to understand here about cannabis marijuana that we like to call it the enemas and my story and why I feel compelled to go to senior retirement communities and centers to talk about the benefits of cannabis for sleep pain anxiety and appetite issues as Steven said my name is Peggy Anderson and I founded can I help you a year ago after I did a pilot presentation at the Mirabella and we had 90 residents that came to the presentation and we had nice doctors dr. David and dr. Rachel never leave it and David's wife dr. Janice is a retired anesthesiologist dr. David is an emergency room doctor at Providence Milwaukee and his daughter dr. Rachel Knox is with the American cannabinoid clinic which is a clinic as you can imagine it's a medical clinic but they also encourage maybe using cannabis as an alternative medicine to some of the prescriptions right you all are taking so people saying why are you doing this so my story is I broke my back when I was 17 with water skiing accident and the doctors were very generous in their opiate painkillers to get me through this time of my life and move it fast forward I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 1982 and found that the only thing to alleviate the pain was 16 advil a day I knew I had to walk every day to keep my body moving good sleeping patterns and food my diet was very at that time in as I found out that night vegetables or something that I shouldn't be eating tomatoes good for people that fibromyalgia so I really took upon myself to learn as much as I could about the myalgia and then in 2014 I woke up and I couldn't move my legs and by the end of the week I couldn't move my hands to my mouth went to the doctors they gave me prednisone cortisone flexural and a triple een oxycodone and they said we don't know what you had but this will make you feel better well it had dumped me up so I really took my health my own hands and I learned more about cannabis than I ever thought I would ever learn and I knew there's cannabis has THC in it which we'll be talking about today and CBD and CBD is an anti-inflammatory that comes in with cannabis and so I used close to 100 milligrams of CBD during the day and then to help me sleep at night I would use CBD and THC this leak probably almost seven eight hours straight which was important for me because I could if I moved when I was sleeping I'd wake up from excruciating pain after seven months my physical therapist said you're a hundred percent disabled Peggy and I don't know what to do for you you've gotta have a goal out there you were very active a year ago and so what was that gonna look like so I sent up to a half marathon on the walk a half marathon in a year by the end of 2015 and she said that's quite aggressive but you know I'm here to help you so for the next eight months we were to work to work and I came through and we never I was never diagnosed but I didn't have marathon and I was working at the Chamber of Commerce at the time and recreational animus became legal on October 31st 2015 and the owner of the dispensary asked a little bit about my background and I told him what I had just been through and he said okay you've got to become a cannabis medical advocate and you need to get out the talk to seniors because I'm 65 years old and I want to live for the next 20 years he was pretty good and I don't want to be high but I know how important CBD is to me and my body and how I go about my daily routines so two years ago I met with onyx doctors and as I said we did a pilot project of Mirabella last year and with me we aren't here to sell products we are here to inform you and educate you the knocks doctors work with doctors all across the United States to help educate them as using cannabis as not the last alternative but one of the first things to consider in improving your health so with that I'd like to introduce dr. David Knox and his daughter okay dr. David not I've been doing emergency medicine for 40 years some of you may have had the misfortune of meeting me and there at Providence Milwaukee for 38 years and retiring in about four and a half years ago that got introduced to cannabis medicine you know there's pretty much cannabis and I need medical cannabis has been around since 1999 and you know you hear about it to see patients come in sir cannabis is a a lying you know what are you here for now but once we got into it and started seeing patients primarily for medical authorization it was really eye-opening and wait for the doctor Janice could tell you the same story you were just amazing the patients that you expected to see we're not the ones you're seeing we were saying you know all kinds of age groups lots of older folks just like you guys history of medical problems you know team complex medical histories and I never saw an emergency room but they were finding good success with cannabis for treating their conditions and as an emergency room physician the the biggest deal to me was the number of folks who kept telling me you know I was able to get off my opiates I was you know able to cut down my opiates i Function a whole lot better and so that was the start of my learning experience about cannabis since then we've all taken upon ourselves really to get educated about you know the science behind cannabis you know how it works how it can be used efficaciously so yeah that that kind of you know let us down this line here as my daughter's went to medical school and residency we were becoming educated and you know help guide em a little bit get educated about cannabis medicine as well so they you know decided adjoint so we formed the American cannabinoid clinics and basically until we'd become severe students and educators about the endocannabinoid system and that's why we call ourselves the canoe clinics we're really focused on your endocannabinoid system the question is how many of you who are aware that you have an endocannabinoid system that's that's a pretty good response okay and you know in comparison dr. Janice gave a time to the residency program in pediatric oncology at OHSU and we have more response to people know about endocannabinoids system here it's still something that is not taught in medical school barely touched on a residency if at all Rachel can speak to you so but you know it said I feel it's a new science in a minute there's so high opening what we're learning about it here okay old science new field of medicine mm-hmm actually so for some context I graduated from Medical School in 2012 month finish family medicine residency in 2015 and no cannabinoid system was discovered in its entirety in 1990 all the receptors the wiggins and everything else that works in that system 1993 so you can see there was a huge time period where they could have started integrating the information about the new cannabinoid system all the things that had done and to medical education and they did not so yes my parents encouraged both my sister and I dr. Jessica lives in California so she can't be here with us today encouraged us to learn about the bad news and like my dad mentioned we were pretty fascinated by it you know I I went to Family Medicine wanting to have a broad fund of knowledge that I can help people heal what I quickly learned in medical school and then again it was reinforced and residency is that I was just being trained to scribe drugs and to referral procedures I wasn't equipped with tools to know covered through cost of disease help you will reverse diseases our leading causes of death in this country are number one heart disease so heart attack and heart related issues cancer and number three death by prescription drug okay as a family medicine doctor Brenda my mother was heart disease and diabetes complications of which land you with a heart attack or stroke diabetes as as closely related to Alzheimer's is closely related to the development of cancers and they look what we do we prescribe an efficient drug so right there family medicine setting where I'm treating people that are likely going to die from one of those top three causes of death that are preventable really infuriated me so when my sister and I left our respected residency programs and family medicines or better than medicine it made sense to us to do something that we felt could really help people reverse disease improve their quality of life and we don't like to say the c-word it's a nasty word in the world of pharmacology and pharmacy and that's cure right if you've seen people reverse their diseases into remission dare I say cure their conditions with cannabis therapy so together we have to be founded the American cannabinoid clinics we consider ourselves and know cannabinol urgent so kind of like endocrinology cardiology we are doctors in science it's really an of the endocannabinoid system we study the function and dysfunction of endocannabinoids system and apply things like cannabis to that system to improve health and encourage feeling certificate right Villa and Okinawa doing system is really the largest you know physiologic system in the body you've heard about all the other neurotransmitters serotonin dopamine norepinephrine the endocannabinoid system really is a feedback mechanism for all of those more than that it's involved with your immune function which is it well with so many disease processes have some effect virtually in every organ and tissue in the body and the complexity is really kind of fascinating you know people wonder well how could it be so effective for so many different things it just comes down to because your endocannabinoid system is involved in virtually all of those systems symptoms so you sort of get into that direction we are we are doctors of that system right we do specialize in cannabis we're not cannabis doctors for doctors of the endocannabinoid system because that's the system that we want to manipulate modely and supplement so that you're the condition is that most people have that are related to that that that system can improve so we also like to talk about the history and as brief as you can because understanding the historical timeline of cannabis and prohibition and the legalization really brings I think a lot of rich content and context to what we do and why what we do is so important so I'll just read a few of these things brief so and in the Chinese texts a very ancient Chinese text called the channel pintuck been couching we found the first literary reference to cannabis as a medicine that was in 2737 BC from that point in time all the way to the 1800's ad you can't race cannabis so the cultivation of cannabis and the use of cannabis for medical purposes throughout the world starting in the Himalayas we went we came West to Europe deeper AJ is of India Africa and is finally wound back and the United States Pharmacopeia where's my fav up here 1854 to 1941 cannabis made a 50% of the preparations doctors American doctors prescribe to their patients my summary on prohibition and is a policy that was founded in racism perpetrated by big money and politicians who saw hemp and cannabis as a competition were able to get it past the fools in Congress and then subsequently even Nixon disregards his own commission in order that he could continue to use as a tool to suppress the hippies and minorities that he put into place at the time there was a doctor / lawyer / politician representative of the AMA American Medical Association who did testify to Congress that cannabis not the marijuana which is what of the term that they were using in the marihuana Tax Act that doctors didn't agree with that it was a very effective medicine and that actually studied not prohibited and they were not as are very aiming because they were throwing around this word marijuana they had no idea until this tax act when it went into place that marijuana was the same thing as cannabis so there was a lot of treachery on that and in 1970 the Controlled Substances Act Nixon signed into law basically final nail on the coffin that cannabis is a Schedule one drug has no accepted medical use is highly addictive in in dangerous and easily abused and and obviously that's what we're fighting against to this day we have up here oh very important to note while all this was going on so even before 1970 where cannabis found itself as a Schedule one drive CBD and THC which Peggy mentioned were isolated 1963 in nineteen sixty four to be exact so the United States actually funded an Israeli side biochemist excuse me organic chemist named Rafael Mishima and makes Monday I think it was to the tune of $100,000 a year for him to study cannabis the plant and how it worked on people very interestingly because they were able to isolate these molecules that could synthesize them so in 1985 Marin all you guys are familiar with Marinol anybody here familiar with Marin all the synthetic THC in 1985 was when the FDA approved it it was initially scheduled to moved to schedule 3 but basically doctors could prescribe it and it was prescribed for anorexia so poor appetite and wasting conditions and the to wasting conditions that were cited by the FDA was cancer and chemotherapy related nausea vomiting and poor appetite from cancer as well as eight so the wasting syndrome that we saw in aids you'll have people to use I find interesting about that is it you know there's still a lot of criticism about cannabis so we don't know enough about it on the other hand the FDA approves Marinol before they even knew how it worked you know the difference is you know the environment you know was able to produce it 1985 was one way our dollars were proved we used synthetic THC Maranatha radio label to discover the endocannabinoid system so in that sense THC molecule was tagged in third with radioactive substance let loose in the human body and what scientists discovered was a system a very intricate system throughout the brain most of the nervous system all of our enema organs that THC sort of paint and that uncovered endocannabinoids system so by between 1988 and 1995 finally all of those components of endocannabinoids system were described and it became known as the system that controls family or the physiologic system of our body we like to describe a system as like the conductor of a maestro of an orchestra and its principal function is to keep your body in balance perfect health okay the legalization very interestingly Oregon was the first state to decriminalize in 1973 in 1996 California legalized the medical use of cannabis the first state the new self in 1998 Alaska Oregon and Washington all legalized unfortunately in 2016 DEA maintained cannabis as a Schedule one substance despite all the evidence to the contrary however in 2018 just a few months ago the FDA did approve the PD elects the first whole plant dried cannabis medicine and they scheduled a what was it five five right says that's worth at least to be fair right yeah darn you're all in the counter but that does not mean that cannabis preparation you have any other sort have been moved from Scott going they have not and so what's next well we are what's next so they mentioned the east yes endocannabinoid system is a machine inside your body its network of receptor this legions of things that work on those receptors to create downstream effects and enzymes that create those those three gunas those molecules and break them down yeah I think that you know what kind of keep it simpler speak you know which we have to have in Physiology you get your receptors you have the agents that work on those receptors and then you have the enzyme to break it down what's interesting is that CP one or the CP took over the cannabinoid receptors first discovered by that radio tagging at all but then you start looking at the the next flame the the trip receptors PP a RGB on our 55 there are so many membrane receptors throughout the body you know in all kinds of cells that the cannabinoids that I work on and you know we talk about CBD and THC is a major cannabinoids but there's a hundred twenty minor cannabinoids as 420 tertius other molecules that affect all these receptors in the body and so they can all have a physiologic effect it's it's kind of like the more we learn the more we don't know the complexity is pretty amazing this is a as a starting point kind of simple okay so in Okinawa no system ever mentioned it keeps us imbalance in perfect health when this machine breaks what we have dysfunction so common deficient there common diseases of ECS deficiency or migraines fibromyalgia IBS obesity and schizophrenia diseases an endocannabinoid system overactivity are inflammatory and autoimmune diseases type 2 diabetes gram\u00e1tica ZZZ which would go up and up in that first camp cancer and fibrosis okay so machine breaks what we do we fix things so this endocannabinoid system is now a target for research we want to know what is causing the dysfunction in a system what's causing the efficiency is what's causing over activity and what we do we focus on dysfunction rehearsal and that that's where we like to talk about precision medicine you know every single one of you and as has our own endocannabinoid system that is is sort of tuned to a different frequency we all have different states and no cannabinoid functioning and any given time during the day right you can talk about having different disease processes going on inside of us but from minute to minute that and new cannabinoid system in your bodies is going like this trying very hard to keep it's off into balance to keep itself in balance and correct things that are that are going wrong one of the principal therapeutic products to correct this function is cannabis so that's why we're here today to talk to you guys now refer to the end of analysis of all the things that affect it you know I'm still kind of coming down the final category kind of biggest tool in the box but other things we focus on everything from diet nutrition exercise all these other things that affect your in the cannabinoid system you can find out some of the you know common therapeutics like tylenol where's have benefit since it works on the endocannabinoid system but acupuncture works on the endocannabinoid system massages can work on so many other things that affect it as well so we're trying to incorporate all those tools into it but of course this be a requirement you know the cannabinoids the final could happen like says plant-based so just very simply if you have an efficiency in your endo cannabinoid system you might not be making enough of the cannabinoids that your body makes on its own you might not have as rich of a receptor expression or you might not have enough of the enzymes that create those molecules or break them down so why is cannabis work so on the left are the cannot an endogenous cannabinoids that we call NOP atta boy that's what your body makes locally you know Shan Hampshire is there a flu claim they break down all the way you have an and the ninth year to ng here THC and CBD here they look pretty different there's some similarities but essentially this guy right here mimics the activity of these two here Stevie Dean doesn't act the same way that THC that sort of acts synergistically with it and the cannabinoids I don't ever they've never guess what I just mentioned the molecules inside the cannabis plant mimic kamala fuels that our bodies are supposed to make okay a great illustration of how THC might work to treat pain and can be happen at an overactive synapse that's shooting out glutamate say goodnight that's a pain signal to a post synaptic receptor so he's the presynaptic I'm the poster synaptic receptor and he's shooting that food away from me under the check so if any of you guys have neuropathic pain that doesn't get better day in and day out it's this single that's not dampening it's not turning off that keeps on throwing itself at me what your body is supposed to do is form an animai on its own from my side chocolate laughter is called retrograde to the priest in apps and shut off so that signal goes away when we have an efficiency and we don't make an anime it doesn't get shut off and that pain signal keeps on going so when we take a puff of you know some honma THC in it that THC comes directly to that priest in apps and shuts down that glutamate I'm shooting over to me so we have an integrated voluntary but then we also talk about full spectrum cannabis medicine that's full plant medicine you guys are really you know functional nutritionist we like to talk a lot about full this whole plant pull everything because the whole in nature is better than those isolates in cannabis beyond the 500 cannabinoids is THC in the CBD and all the minor cannabinoids that we talked a lot about there's other things like Turkey know are you guys family understand like defusing essential oils or using essential oils well those essential oils are chock-full of something called turkey ins terpenes give all botanicals there their flavor and their hero max when you smell a rose you're inhaling a little molecules called terpenes they're very medicinal that's why a lot of essential essential oils work medicinally lavender is a great example you take away from lavender some people like that but if you do and it relaxes you that's because illimitable which was a turkey or lavender calls you well a little wool is one of the one of the dominant turkeys in cannabis so Peggy mentioned that she used some THC to get to sleep at night here's some little oil in that pan that had that formulation all and only helped achieve relaxation and calm and help them do sleep so there's other molecules in that plant outside of this will th the thing that scares people that provide a medical benefit and so in our clinics we are talking to people a lot about yes different methods of consumption you do not have to inhale but we're talking about full plant medicine because there's other things besides the CBD and THC in some cases that are more important in treating certain conditions so this is this is a lot of stuff that we don't have to get into the rather spend more time talking to you guys and you know your questions but something that we do have to deal with in just the landscape of legal cannabis in Oregon is the difference between strains was what Lego was called cannabis plants where we call them cultivars or chemo bars we didn't dive too deeply into chemical profiles like how much th there how much DVD or how many terpenes are all the other things that are in a particular strain or product but all of that is super important we call it a chemical profile and when we're talking about strands we can we can't find extremes with specific or predetermined profiles but we call those chemical varieties we don't call them strains we also deal a lot with a sativa indica how many of you guys are familiar with sativa is our indicas that means nothing I mean nothing chemically it's nothing scientifically at all we may be in really only to describe how Stacy would feel right this energizes me it activates me it alerts me that's a sativa this is the dates me it relaxed me puts me to sleep that's an indica but does that tell us anything about how to teach me how much CBD how many turkeys are in that product no not a thing so when patients come to us talking about sativa and indica it's really something that I guess that means nothing we're trying to make a lot more scientific you've really got to look at what we call the profile that is your CBD content ing contact the radio plus the decarboxylated versus carboxylated forms and then you got all your turf you can add exactly the same CBD and THC you put limonene and pining in there you're going to be stimulated you put some nourishing in there they're gonna sleep on the couch that's that's how they interact so much you know so we really want to know the whole profile of what you're getting and strange can be different from one girl to another one side of the plant the Sun the other in the shade to make us like they would really like to have the testing where you kind of know what yeah he actually just had a meeting with through a really cool company that's develop this map of a lot of the chemical varieties available in United State it was very interesting too see that you know like a blueberry muffin strain in Nevada is very different chemically than the blueberry muffin strain in Oregon and that sort of illustrates where you were just describing that different growing conditions any whether you play music over your point what type of music people on the planet impacting the other thing that I want to just highlight is the difference between brain and strength so all the products that are sold legally in medical or adult use shots have have past boring and standards of testing they're not medical grade though they're not medical grade because they have not been tested for heavy metals they have not been tested for mycotoxins which are actually very important and we have immunocompromised patients using those products mycotoxins can absolutely wreak havoc on an on an immune compromised person and heavy metals a lot of people unbeknownst to themselves are already you know burdened by a heavy metal level you know part of functional medicine is getting in there and testing people for heavy metals because those things actually do significantly set people up for autoimmune conditions fibromyalgia as well so if any of you guys have amalgam fillings those things going to mercury and mercury is heavily implicated and then it's in strength right you talk about medical strength and for purposes of cannabis you know you can have a very potent product in THC that is the appropriate strength for you or your condition or that's high in CBD and almost see that is appropriate for you in your condition so medical strength that's actually highly variable we care most about the grade because we'll get into potency and the chemical profile that's necessary for the individual based on lots of variables you know in conversation with that person but grade matters and I hope to see heavy metals and mycotoxin testing in the future University okay quickly quickly so it's important to us and this was the presentation that we gave to industry people so cultivators dispensary owners etc because there's a huge disconnect between industry in medicine he's unfortunate disconnect on which we're also trying to trying to bring that gap closer closer what's very important is that products are high qualities of high grade there are companies who do take it upon themselves to go above and beyond they do test for everything which is really great because I'm a consistent quality right if you're using a product that works well for you're paying the baby you want to make sure it works well for your pain tomorrow too that's continuously available for the same reasons that's consistently effective and that's affordable because right now insurance does not cover an aside again okay broad range of the products are necessary we encourage covering all routes of administration and this is because everybody has different needs right so we have our pulmonary varieties we call the pulmonary today's are smoking and making products or inhalable we have our ingestible capsules what else in tinctures change capsules teachers and oils can all be ingested edibles if they're gonna grade do not contain refined grain dairy sugar artificial sweeteners industrial oils preservatives artificial diets or food colorings now this is important because we get diabetics in our clinic all the time that tell us their pain is really well controlled on a canvas product in the form of a gummy or a lollipop or cook that's full of all these things that actually make their diabetes worse right so it's important not to compromise or compromise over your goal that's right your goal is to heal their goal is to feel better but if you're if you're doing something that's you know opposed what you're doing we don't get very far very fast it'll chase your tail next we have transmute Coastal's James nikohl those are things that are gonna get absorbed into your coastal membranes so the nasal septum your people know cosine as your cheeks sublingually under the tongue and also vaginally in rectally which will actually come down here suppositories but they are trans people solos and then we have our transdermal or topical lotion scream status in patches so there's so many varieties to choose from and there are a couple of factors that go into it we might recommend because patient preferences matter I mean I've had patients who they only get reduced by smoking and I don't deny them that and then I patients who only get relieved by juicing and that works for them not going to dare say actually you should do something else when that's working well for you right our dogs to listen to our patients yeah there's sometimes variability I see two patients in a row one will say you know I never do that well I can't they don't ever do anything for me that's all they rely on everybody's head looking to have the motor system a little different and everybody's preference a little different you know so leave Melvin that town use all the weight you know we got bad joints peripheral neuropathy start with the topical the topicals not doing it then go to a mucosal root under the tongue teach for oil and that's really an or statement Thank You absolutely you can find you can go into the oral route just over the physiologic when we handle it a little differently the suppositories it particularly give you one of the highest bioavailability of the product and probably in all across the nation fifty four seven medical uses filtered for smoking big reason it worked very quickly it's very time trainable you know where you're on we can responds very quickly and you know that's what goes in all of that decision-making or the following so onset of action people who want really quick relief inhaling is the way to go duration of action how long do you want your relief right inhaling also has a short duration of action two hours whereas you know a capsule or an edible or adjustable to give you up to eight hours of relief therapeutic blood levels that we want to see are very very important we're dealing with things like cancer where we need a lot of cannabinoids in that body to help fight that cancer directly THD tolerance there are some people who need a lot of THC because of the condition that they happen don't tolerate the the unwanted effects of THC and awesome you have to talk about how to increase that concentrations slowly to one the minimum effective dose and on that so we talked about bringing in of their options like suppositories so team C dominant suppositories because we know there's a lot has to do about the lower third of the rectum enters the systemic blood circulation and whereas the upper two-thirds enter the the hepatic and in through the hepatic system THC becomes way more potent so we can sort of avoid that from happening by by a rectal suppository so we get creative depending on TT tolerance and then lastly whether their lifestyle means you're coming a little bit about the oral route the burning room and that's still the patients that we do see occasionally what people have misused and oral preparation usually but the physiology is when you eat intentional hours really forward to get absorbed bioavailability is so variable and that depends on the permeability of again what else you've eaten the caliper goings are fat soluble so if you have a fatty meal along with it you're going to get more absorption but it takes a while I mean on set to can be anywhere from like 45 minutes out to three hours and everything gets eaten in the intestinal tract go to the liver first the liver is responsible for metabolizing all of the cannabinoids just if you inhale it you know the to deliver but if you eat it everything goes to the liver first the first metabolic by-product of Delta 9 THC is called 11 hydroxy THC just a modification of the sidechain the 11 hydroxy though is about five times or more psychoactive that is it attaches to the brain receptors much more much more affinity and when you eat it everything go to the liver first for your serum levels about 5 times higher a lot of time time chills with that delaying people thoughts are doing nothing so they have some more and then 3 or 4 hours they are a big trouble because now you get all those unwanted side-effects it we can't see with real high THC those is your heart's racing you're anxious you're paranoid you're hallucinating very unfortunate time with it so that you've got to be really conscious of your THC doses you can be very patient when we deal with the oral route but what you have experienced in the last longer it can add last 8 hours even more sometimes so if you got chronic pain you know titrate down dough so you get much more sustained relief that's part of what we do which is help guide people you know how to use it avoid those problems and get to your house well the definition of motor it's really it's it's it's like after the apartment because it's chewer turns overdosing it's pretty simple we understand with any overage of f your dose so can you overdose on nganimate yeah you can house there have been a documented death by overdose on cannabis nope there has not the principal reason is because your brain stem that controls your heart your lungs doesn't contain any cannabinoid receptors right contains a lot of opiate receptors and that's why when you overdosed on opiates your heart can stop your respiratory drive can stop so you don't breathe anymore well cannabis that can't hide it so that's why we've seen no deaths from and it's overdosed and and when we talk about overdose we're really talking about that unwanted effects of THC some people don't mind those headaches right so it's a really unfortunate that we demonize THC and demonize cannabis for its it's a euphoria genic and intoxicating properties when we have tons of agents out there that are legal that do that and do it in deadly fashion [Music] you", "ejefY8Je5S0": "hi this is a video we're gonna be using MZ 12 the new organic product I've been using butane for a while and I find that this is a way cleaner way safer way to do an extraction of essential oils or for your cannabis so we're gonna go ahead and start and tell you how to use this today what you want to do is take a screen ground up your stuff your your product you're using whatever your product you're using is going to matter in the quality of the product that you get this is some good trim we broke it down you want to take most of stems out of it most of the ones you can see what you're gonna do then is take a glass tube or if you have a circular loop machine you can use this this solvent in a circular loop machine so what we're gonna do now is start like lightly putting this in here you want to fill up too much you want to give it a light pack not too hard but give it a nice little little firmness in there keep filling up the tube and I recommend using about a 1 foot tube for two cans to get your biggest extraction possible go ahead and fill this off you pack this with your fingers the rest of the way and you're going to take two coffee filters wrap it use a hose clamp make sure you set your drill to a low torque so you don't break the glass clean off any of debris that's left on because you don't want that falling into your area and then we're gonna take the pyrex dish and two cans of solvent outside now remember this product is flammable but not combustible like butane butane will actually combust this is more of a methane it will not you can light it on fire but it's not gonna sit to where it'll actually explode all right hold on a second gotta grab a glove make sure you put a glove on this stuff is really really cold all right make sure we have no more debris take your can with a little shake go ahead begin your extraction I like to swirl it around as I'm going down just to make sure I get all the sides and here we will have beautiful yellow liquid coming out and then I normally wipe off the top nipple and blow out of it blowing it so that you can get the rest of the solvent out of it all right we're gonna run another tube we'll see you back here in a minute that's four cans total I grabbed this tray here and I'm going to put semi warm water in it and I have an oscillating fan over here to my left so that I could blow the stuff I'm going to set that right there and then warm water and let it start to evaporate hit up with a couple particles of stuff in here so I'm gonna take a tool with a point on it and pop these right out okay now after you get all these little particles out and if you're lucky you won't get any particles at all we're gonna take this inside and begin to scrape it and we'll be back to you in a second all the product out of the Pyrex and put it on the parchment paper we're going to take this parchment paper put it in a vacuum chamber I highly recommend vacuum with everything except the new product zho that will be coming out soon that we will have which does not do much in a vacuum it's almost ready to do right on the house when you pull it out all you have to do is basically whip it and it's ready to go well for this product we will put it on a vacuum all right you'll see it starts to do its movement and then it's going to blow up then I would recommend purging it from anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour we have just sent off two samples to CW testing and our product came back with zero flammable in the top metals or solvent on it at all the only thing that I had in it was a little bit of water which is easily curable you just let it sit out or put a fan on it or pull it this stuff actually is has a consistency of silly putty or Laffy Taffy it's you can pull on it it has a golden hue to it it's really easy to handle at higher temps unlike BHO products so this to me is the real deal folks purging tank then collapsed it it was a huge dome this is the product it's a little tacky it can sit out but as you can see see and it doesn't it sticks to you a little bit not bad nothing like BHO product and look how golden this is this is pure trichomes extracted look at that and that pretty folks alright enjoy this video and enjoy yourselves and we'll see you later", "QdS-MQ_lMK0": "welcome to the Kido connect kitchen we just got done cooking up a masterpiece in here and we're just gonna turn around and make it into a video ASAP here it is guys we just created this this is a little bit of a soba noodle bowl here obviously not actual soba noodles we're using miracle noodles now there's also shirataki noodles you can use but to get them to be delicious and flavorful like they are in this dish you got to take some extraordinary measures we're actually gonna marinate the noodles for about 4 hours 4 hours is ideal you can probably get by with doing it for like an hour so a lot of you may have tried these before and maybe haven't liked them so you got to start by straining them then give them a rinse now what we want to do is really get a lot of the pre-existing water out of the noodles so we're gonna Pat them dry with paper towels doesn't have to be perfect just do your best to get some water out now once you got these pretty well dry we are going to put them in a little Tupperware container here and we are going to marinate them you can really come up with any marinade you like I'm gonna do 1/4 cup of soy sauce and the marinade is not all gonna make it into the final dish so you know quarter cups kind of a lot of soy sauce but we're not going to be actually consuming all of that just giving it enough liquid so it really gets soaked up and if you don't want to use soy sauce you can use Liquid aminos coconut aminos tamari there's a bunch of different options I know like a lot of you guys like to stay away from soy dump that in there we're gonna do 1/2 a tbsp of sriracha and if you don't have sriracha if you don't want to use sriracha you can use any hot sauce you can even use red pepper flakes instead this adds a good spice to it though and then we're gonna add a full tablespoon of rice wine vinegar you can even use like lime juice just any kind of acidic flavor and basically just mix everything around in there spread it out flat and give it about an hour to 4 hours somewhere in there to suck up all of the marinade so I'm just gonna pop this in the fridge while the noodles are marinating I have a pot of water here I'm gonna get it boiling we're gonna get some soft-boiled eggs going in here for this dish we are going to do a crispy chicken thigh which is one of my favorite things on planet Earth well we got here is a skin on bone in chicken thigh and I'm going to remove the bone but we're gonna keep the skin on removing the bone lets you flatten it out more giving the chicken skin a flat surface area touching the pan so you can really get the skin crispy which is the way I like to do it now to get your chicken skin to crisp up in a pan what I like to do is just separate the skin from the chicken Pat it dry because keeping the skin super dry is the best way to get it to crisp up in the pan and then all I'm gonna do is put a liberal coating of salt on the skin that also helps it crisp up a little and then we have the oven preheating to 350 degrees and this burner right here is at medium heat cook it skin side down for about five minutes on medium heat then we're going to turn it over throw it in the oven for 12 minutes and that will cook it through [Music] [Music] when the six minutes are up just scoop out the eggs quickly get them into an ice bath so they stop cooking I like to put them in the ice bath for about 90 seconds well everything else is going there's a few things we can get ready for the plating so we have some shiitake mushrooms here we're gonna use three big ones for the dish and then we got some green onions so I just like to chop up some green onions we're gonna use this kind of as a garnish but it also adds some good flavor we just like about that much and then for the mushrooms we're actually we're gonna cut the stems off we're gonna cook these in the pan after the chicken is done that'll soak up some of the good flavor and then we're just gonna plate it on the side and then a few other things I'm gonna have ready for plating is sesame oil and sesame seeds and we can peel our ramen egg let's see how this came out soft-boiled eggs are super hit-or-miss for me like sometimes I nail them but it's pretty tough so don't feel bad if yours comes out and it's like fully cooked or it's completely raw oh I can feel that it's very runny in the middle so I'm gonna set this aside be careful not to break it okay so the chicken is about done but we are now going to let this rest for a good ten minutes okay so here's the noodles they've only been marinating for about an hour you probably want to do it for longer for more flavor but this is okay just kind of loosely drain them you don't need to like Pat them dry or anything because we're gonna cook these down so the flavor concentrates a lot now in the chicken pan you got all the good fat and stuff just kind of scrape it up get the flavor going you got all the fat you don't want that to go to waste add your noodles and just let them cook down let the liquid reduce now you got some really flavorful sir I like to use tongs to do this you can kind of position them in the plate there and the bowl then you still got some flavor in the pan here add the mushrooms you can add a little bit of seasoning to these since they're kind of bland salt and pepper and I like to just get all the flavor out of the pan with the mushrooms I like my mushrooms cooked very lightly but if you want them to be cooked through more you can even add a little water to the pan okay now it's time for the fun part we're gonna plate this up here got everything we need first thing to do is to slice this chicken oh it's perfectly cooked nice and moist add in the mushrooms add in the egg the eggs really the star give it a little home in there you know some scallions I like to do a little sesame seed and then a nice drizzle of sesame oil and there it is guys look at that does it get better than that and that's all Kido this entire dish is like super low-carb I having calculating at the recipe instructions and the nutrition is all in the blogpost length in the description of this video but this is just like a home run if you're missing those Asian flavors so what I really want to try is these noodles unbelievable the flavor is exactly like a ramen noodle is the only difference is the consistency is like a little bit chewier it's not quite like normal noodles but the flavor 100% on point the mushrooms I love some nice meaty mushroom and then you know the chicken is perfect of course eggs perfect it's pretty much all there is to it guys overall guys this is a homerun dish definitely make this if you've been missing Asian food [Music]", "i9YXmqRQsVI": "now that we got it filled about half way we're gonna take your plant and that's gently squeeze the sides a little bit and then you want to push up on the bottom seeing that those little like that that's when you know you can pop it out safely hey it come right out you know the roots that come out there that's what's gonna be careful with [Applause] that there's the taproot [Music] leave that down in there don't hurt it then you want to gently fill the pot with this soil and this is just some regular old plain-jane soil that you can get from anywhere you want to go all the way around the sides make sure get it nice and covered up make sure you be gentle with those roots down in the bottom once they're covered you should be fine just make sure you getting up in there too to get all that old soil covered up and where you know you got plenty dirt in there that way when those roots want to explode they can and there you have it you know this this year you know give it a little bit of water and

done since nineteen forty nine an enormous amount of research that's been done in the last ten and fifteen years and you have too many professional organizations that have stuck their head in the sand on the other hand even in the face of an enormous amount of pressure you've had organizations like the American Nurses Association the American Public Health Association and most recently the American College of Physicians which has 124 thousand members not only saying that they support medical use of marijuana but that it should be rescheduled so it should be used briefly in regards to my background I must say that I'm probably a slower learner than Frank it took me about 20 years from the first time somebody talked to me about medical cannabis and actually the first time that I looked it up in the nineteen twenty seven addition to Remington was textbook privacy to really appreciate that cannabis was medicine now that may be because the first person that told me about cannabis as medicine was my father and one always wants to disagree with their father when you're young man my father was a pharmacist starting in 1928 is one of his assignments that pharmacy school was to make tincture of cannabis and he said you know we had to be very careful because the alcohol was illegal now one of the things that doctors like Frank and I do is we make sure that the people that we're making recommendations to our sick not because we don't believe that it helps people who aren't seriously yell or deathly ill but because we know the Medical Board of California are my opinion in competence and I say that as somebody who has 14 years experience doing Quality Assurance work and who was asked to apply for the position of medical director of the National Committee of quality assurance the most prestigious quality assurance organization in the country the California Medical Board does not know what you're doing anyway to think quick things I want to end with one is I've had a number of patients in the last month that a committed said dr. Berman you changed my life and it's embarrassing because all that I've done all that Frank lucido is done all I Brett Carter's got all our Sunil is done is been doctors we do a history we do a physical we listen to the person we listen to them saying this stuff has made my life different and we have recommended it and we have made them legal we have been able for them to obtaining medicine this should not be an exceptional act this should not be an act of courage and bravery it is but it shouldn't be and all that doctors wonder about this need to do is to see patience and practice medicine I've got about 35 hours worth of material but something tells me I should stop right now and turn it over to questions I'm sure that there's many of us would love to I hear more but more than anything else today for this panel if you're just wondering in these are Medical Marijuana doctors they want to be able to answer your questions about medical cannabis if you're currently using it it's not working for you or it is working for you if you know someone who can benefit we're going to be taking some questions right now and as you can see we've got researchers physicians and and a can of the knowledge is which just ten years ago they would have just called them a pothead but never easy words incredibly fortunate to see that and so let's see some hands go up and see who can who has any questions for our panel I'd like to ask dr. Behrman and doctor lucia what proportion of your practices devoted to cannabis medicine Mike mine is about fifty-fifty I've been doing general family practice in 79 and it was probably about a third cannabis to the two-thirds primary care until about three months ago when we completely went off all insurances because we're losing money on the this weird thing of the insurance business industry so I that's about 5050 my practice said set up as a result of doing expert witness work and covering to practice down in LA for a while and I don't do any advertising I mean if you find my name on somebody's website saying dr. Bierman recommends cannabis it's an unauthorized used by name people know that I understand the cannabis is valuable and most of the patients that I see are looking for a competent position with a good reputation to make recommendations now I used to do general medicine I've done a lot of different things administrative medicine in public health so I will in some instances take care of other conditions that don't require cannabis I certainly will write prescriptions not only for Marinol but also for other medications but i try to refer people back to their primary care physician so the vast majority of my practice deals with rather ill people who get benefit from medical college it's quite something because I think the federal government would make it try and demonize some the doctors are working with patients on this by saying that the patients just seek you out because you'll recommend cannabis and overwhelmingly people who want cannabis can get access to a patient's seek out these doctors because they know and are familiar they're willing to study the available research around the medical uses of cannabis and so I think that's fantastic night everyone other to tell you and regards the question is at least 70 health care professionals in the Santa Barbara area have referred one or more patients to me and what I want to put myself out of business I mean the problem is in California is at the Medical Board of California has scared the hell out of doctors and this precedes medical marijuana they have a reputation for acting in an arbitrary capricious and confronted fashion and they've been on a witch hunt in regards to medical marijuana as a matter of fact I sue the Medical Board of California I got hurt amicus brief supporting my position from the California Medical Association to protect patient privacy and now I my attorney and I are suing them and I say my attorney and I because he's doing this contingent so I we're showing the medical board to get the money across the zoom in the first place because what they tried to do was illegal and they are infringing on doctors civil rights if they stop doing that what you will see is many many more doctors making these recommendations these 70 positions will stop referring them to me and they'll open their mouths and say yeah I think it is good for you you know even the referrals are a nice sign of progress that used to be the doctors just say no and I don't want to hear any more about it at least they're willing to give a name out of someone with some experience oh hi we all know cigarettes cause cancer does marijuana can't cause cancer if not why not yeah dr. Donald task and his a pulmonology at UCLA and he spoke at the last patients at a time conference in this sylmar and he requests his numbers it he's the one that the drug more people were saying see his studies say could cause cancer what he actually said was the lung biopsies of pot smokers and tobacco smokers heavy heavy beach showed some what he actually considered precancerous changes so he wasn't sure he reeked wrenches numbers added more people who studies and came to the adamant conclusion the pot smokers had no more cancer than the non-smokers whereas the cigarette smokers had actually more cancer out obviously and Donald Donald Abrams have gotten to introduce them it was the only one that can ask a question he said looks to me from the numbers the pot smokers have less cancer and he says well it's not statistically significant so basically a time pot smokers and non-smokers had an equal number of cancers there can be some in each but it's like not to do with tobacco it's Tibet goes clearly a cancer causer whether it's the smoke whether it's the attitude we don't know the out the right up to that study the funnel right up he's actually had to pause the fact that kick cannabis and cannabinoids might be having a protective effect on people because the Canada smoking group wasn't developing as as readily as the non-smoking group and I've which is quite something and of course that's in smoking maybe one of you guys can answer the question in non-smokers well wait a minute before before we get off of this we're not just talking about lung cancer there was recently a study that came out from the University of Wisconsin versus where I did my undergraduate work showing the cancer was useful in decreasing the incidence of colorectal cancer there's at least eight studies that demonstrate that that cannabis decreases the incidence of various kinds of cancer and that it is useful in regarding the advance of gliomas which means that mfest should be being celebrated by Senator Kennedy by him smoking a doobie or having some edibles because that will be treating his glioma and I recommend it for Senator Kennedy", "fzVCcJaA2ZQ": "[Music] mirakl noodles

because I decided to take an at home drug test because I've been using full spectrum hat from cue Sciences for about a month now and I use it all the time I have three three little boys four years old and under so my life is very crazy I take the cue cinnamon in the morning I take the whey protein hemp after I workout I take the cue rest at nighttime I sometimes take another dose of my cue fuse before I eat dinner so I mean I am like totally hemp tout and I don't smoke pot so I am like the perfect candidate for you know something like this to take a test and show you my results so I'm gonna go get a drug test and I'm going to let you guys see the entire thing I'm actually really excited about this I want to know for myself I'm telling all my friends and family about this product and they're all using it and I have some skeptic friends that are like oh no I can't fail this because of work I can't take this I'm gonna fail you know and they're CCNA and I'm like no there's not and you know so I'm sure you guys have this going on all of you people that are trying to you don't have people take this hemp anyway so I'm the perfect person and we're gonna see if I pass or fail this add-on jug test for marijuana on THC alright here we go okay so I'm in Walgreens and I am purchasing a drug test to see if there is any THC in my full spectrum hemp I don't even know where to find one of these that this is bad hi you're gonna take your time alright this is it got the talks time to prove to all of the humph users that there is no THC in hi how are you good I'm on a mission to prove that there's no THC in full-spectrum him it's company now I'm good thank you this company claims that there's none so here's my dog test step one I have to pee open the foil pouch remove the test device insert it into the collection cup allows them to remain in the air until the red color appears in the result bready window should take one of five minutes a negative result is in Nikita by two pink bands one in the control and one in the test this result means that the urine screen is negative the single pink band which appears in the control region and no line in the test means that it's positive okay so what's opens okay I'm going to collect my yarn and yes you guys are coming with me to ensure that this is my urine I've never been so excited to like prove a point about this so I'm peeing into a cop about you guys are sitting on the fence kind of kind of weird all right I have to pee got plenty of urine again this is weird but I guess it's like no weirder than if I was in like a straw maxi alright okay it's not that weird okay I have my urine um I need to ante up I look at opening the temperature for my urine 92 degrees I guess that means it's fresh out of my my body okay so max you're in level I'm just gonna hold it what did it say to do it for now until fills up yep there we go tell my my nails I have to repaint them this is so exciting I keep talking about hemp and everyone's like Oh is there a THC and I keep saying no there was no THC and I take a lot of him so we're gonna find out so negative is two lines which I don't see one in the test but I guess it might take some time to show but wait I think I see it shine this is so weird that I just peed into a cup and wine camera this is crazy my life I think I see a test for informing this is exciting no TV CD don't mind my voice is raspy alright so I think I could take it out of the urine since the thing is like filled gonna wait for those lines I'm going to pull my pants back up because I did not get a chance to do that on the phone alright the only time I taken a test the finds is when I was pregnant so this is kind of weird I don't know I don't really see a test line I mean I do but I don't like it's there right yeah definitely there anyway I think when this indicates it's ready like what does that even mean should I believe it in the urine I'm sorry guys I have no idea what I'm doing what the heck the direction so alright it says allowed to remain here until the right oh okay I have to leave it in the urine until the results ready turns red okay so I gotta leave it in the urine okay I gotta leave us in here for like five minutes so we want two lines two lines means that there is no THC I should probably dump some out here now it's time to sit here and hold us I definitely see two lines which I'm pretty confident that this is negative no okay this is cool tells you like a ton of different ways to see oh okay I see the red thing filling up you're saying that's ready it tells you a ton of different ways to see if it's negative so if there's any indication of that pink line that's a negative so these are all positive there's clearly a no indication of any line I have a line there just paint we're gonna wait till the test she's in its entirety apologizing for the length of this video so it's really really all right so we have two lines we have one there which is the control and one in the test and as you can see negative result is indicated by two pink bands of any intensity so it's obviously really faint right here but it's there and that means that this is a negative test as you can see in these pictures this would be positive if there was absolutely nothing there we have a faint line which means that there is no THC traceable in this hemp okay that's like really exciting news All Right see you guys thanks for watching this long video and watching me pee into a cup as you guys saw there was a negative test result from this full spectrum hemp and I just wanted to clarify because I noticed throughout my entire video I said that there is no THC so in cue Sciences full spectrum hemp they have the legal limit of THC which is less than 0.3% so I mean there is THC when I keep saying no THC there's no THC there's no traceable THC so it's so low that it can't even show up on a drug test obviously so and I take a lot of it so it is really exciting and I'm glad you guys watch this video I know it was a really long video but I hope this kind of solves a lot of skeptical mindset that you had it does for me because now I can like with 100% confidence tell everybody know you will not fail a drug test so that's exciting alright thanks guys see ya", "vHXQUmZy-ec": "hey guys we're going back to the motherland today Italia Italy and what we got is something I'm calling fat bomb pasta you guys are probably familiar with fat bombs they're these little treats that people make where it's just like a lot of fat and not a lot of other things protein or carbs so I was thinking like what if I want a fat bomb that's not a little dessert treat thing what if I want a meal fat bomb so then I got to thinking and we came up with fat bomb pasta so in this recipe we're using these shirataki noodles and they're like basically just air they're no calories there's 1 gram of carbs 10 calories per half of this package they really reduce down a lot though so like I can eat this entire package no problem it reduces a lot preparing these so that they're edible and not gross worm consistency is kind of tricky and we'll show you how to do that we have a good method down for how to make these tasty and then we're going to make a little bit of an alfredo sauce with this Italian sausage ground up in there you can also just dome it the sausage if you want to go pure fat bone no protein yeah so it's pretty basic but the tricky part is handling these noodles properly if you've tried these noodles before and didn't like them try them with this method for this totally life-changing these steps were about to show you we'll make tofu shirataki noodles back on the menu boys I think that's from Lord of the Rings all right here we go [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] there it is finished up the fat bomb pasta so this serving size right here has 760 calories seven net carbs 24 grams of protein and 68 grams of fat so not like your traditional fat bomb all fat but it's close as good as you can get for a meal for the most part and look how spectacular this looks this is what if you went to Olive Garden okay not if not Olive Garden a fancy Italian restaurant you can omit the sausage if you want to get it even higher fat lower protein we're using this cast-iron skillet because it's the only thing that works on the cooktop that we have to film videos with so you don't have to use that I recommend using a nonstick pan we also used romano cheese you can use parmesan Asiago either of those substitute pretty well let's give this a try Megas gonna get mad because she wants to eat some of this after OH it's so good the sausage we got is almost like bratwurst this sweet Italian but there is no added sugar and the I really like this with the Romano cheese we made it a couple times before with Parmesan and I think we made it once with Asiago too but this is where it's at it gives it like a nice salty and more sharp flavor I'd recommend getting romano cheese with this if you can we've experimented with all types of these low-calorie zero-calorie noodles these are by far our favorites the shirataki Alfredo style ones the shape ones they also have miracle noodles which we don't like as much they are made out of like a fiber root of some kind like a fibrous root so they're just like pure insoluble fiber these are soybeans and also fiber these just taste a lot better in my opinion the real takeaway is just the method of preparation for the shirataki noodles that's like key and you can make so much stuff with that once you know how to prepare them right we love these we make them all the time now that we got the method down the first few times like when you they're all slimy the sauce doesn't stick to them and everything so definitely prepare them this way it's much better you can use any sauce you want we've used a cream cheese alfredo sauce before which is pretty good I like this one better though that's a shot at mega she made the cream cheese one and yeah just really some chicken alfredo you can also throw this whole thing in the oven and then bake it and that'll be really good like a baked chicken alfredo type of thing but yeah just good stuff check out our other cooking videos if you want more ideas and below comment with things you want to see in the future other dishes you want us to make [Music] [Music]", "2l_B4RwRAfM": "[Music] today is Tuesday which means it's time for another recipe welcome back everybody to another Tommy eats video few weeks ago we make a low-carb / gluten-free cloud bread recipe for you guys and you guys told us that you wanted more so today we're gonna be making shiitake noodles carbonara let's get started the first is ingredients we need 300 grams about 10 ounces of shirataki noodles 2 eggs Cheers regularly you use the pecorino no man but it is very difficult to find here in Japan so today we are using Parmesan Reggiano instead 80 grams about two three ounces of bacon regularly you use guanciale but it is it is super difficult to find here in Japan super significant we try to find these two ingredients for you guys but seriously it's really difficult if you can find these ingredients go for it this pancetta is okay too one packet of William granules black pepper and olive oil that's it first shirataki noodles shirataki noodles very long so first we cut this transfer to a cutting board cut in half like this yes because these new strokes really really love the turkey noodle has a little bit smell so today I will teach you how to remove it damn she's attacking the dough into a pot like this and add water just to cover staticky noodles like this and turn on the heat and bring it to a boil once it comes to a boil turn off the heat and play in the colander and make sure you drain very well that's a no 13 oh okay let me throw this away for you thank you I'll get rid of this surah 30 noodles has almost no taste so we want to add some flavor to it AB 300 meter data over 1 and 1/4 cups of water into pot and add 1 packet of a brilliant granules into the water and bring to a boil here in Japan these packets of burn granules are common but if those blue yon cubes are more common in your country use 1 cube of that the same way so soup is boiling then dump a taquito into the soup and boil for about 2 to 3 minutes well I think it's ready yeah so set aside to let the Muto's absorb the flavor okay what's next mr. Satoshi let's prepare eggs eggs yes we have two eggs here yes like the two eggs into a small bowl add some pepper black pepper and of course you can add as much as you want right yeah it depends on your preference if you like it yes we add more and cheese grate the cheese as much as you want you know we love cheese so we're gonna use a lot of cheese yes okay yeah yep I think that's gonna do a lot more I think this is okay for anything yeah you know here in Japan and I don't know maybe in some other parts of the world you can get carbonara everywhere in various restaurants but a lot of the carbon are that you get is not authentic you know they put cream sometimes they put milk and I never liked carbonara until I tried it the authentic way that's when actually that's what we both fell in love you know it's so different yes so different yeah and next prepared bacon bacon so sad that we don't have Quan Chau you know guanciale has a lot more fat so you get that extra flavor but bacon is a good substitute so let's cut the bacon into small pieces like this so these are about like one-inch one in range okay bacon is ready ready so pour 2 tbsp of olive oil into a frying pan once it's heated add bacon into frying pan I know not so good now if you have guanciale so we have a lot more oil the bacon we have to give kind of quite lean actually actually Jaffee's bacon is lean compared to the one in America so not much oil comes out with a bacon Wow I think it's ready psychology so to look perfect so let's yeah I mean I'm lucky noodles into this frying pan drain she's not a cameo into a colander yes very well completely add into the frying pan and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes in the plank pants yes hmm home is not the color of Jetta canoodle honey to brown it becomes a very tasty you know that you watching you cook this my stomach is actually is one bullying right now my stomach is making really rich down I think it's okay handle to cheat a big mixture into frying pan and mix well do not overcook yeah very important if you overcook it become a scramble elgar just keep mixing over a residual heat until each noodle strand is completely coated with the egg mixture okay I think it's ready I think so any more than we really get scrambled eggs so transfer to a plate [Music] okay mmm yummy oh my god looks so good and sprinkle some cheese Oh more cheese more hay more cheese as we love cheese grate some cheese sprinkle some peppers yes so a la strategy miracle a banana is ready it smells wonderful you know I so wish we had smell-o-vision because then you guys can smell this beautiful beautiful aroma YUM so let's write it yes that's so amazing really appetizing mmm mmm oh this is good hmm I think this is perfect me too me too it's perfect mmm yeah nothing is too overwhelming mmm it's so good once again if you're using shiitake news make sure you follow those tips on getting rid of the smell that's very important yes and the Cunha could have settled later mm-hmm because once again konyaku itself has almost no flavor actually really it has no flavor now when we say konyaku we mean she loves hockey noodles they're pretty much the same thing just to let you guys know we don't want to confuse you guys few weeks ago we made that cloud bread which is you know low-carb and gluten-free now we weren't sure if you guys want to see that but we've got a lot of requests over on my Instagram page you know when I showed it on my Instagram feed and so that's the reason why we made that for you guys this is also one of our favorite low carb recipes so if you guys want to see more of these types of low carb slash gluten-free recipes please let us know in the comments down below we do have a few more healthier two peas in our healthy recipes playlist please click right up there for that one and as always share this video with your friends subscribe if you haven't already done so give this video a thumbs up and until next time have a great week everybody bye bye [Music]", "ed4ilnSCJtw": "Dave santistevan for around Trinidad calm around southern Colorado calm i'm here with Jill Richards Joe can you tell us your title and a little bit about what happened at the age you are sitting I am the town liaison history of clans between the staff here at in Aguilera and the the trustee board here in Aguilar last night we came to a vote on the recreational marijuana which was had to be voted on by the first of October that was step loaded be prohibited from a five by five to one vote of five to 0 vote the recreational marijuana was up for discussion and that came to Mozza to go to the exact are most part of the town do you know why the council voted for the minimum in enough relation well we have to look at the expansion of the ten of Aguilar's a lot of towns and there's been no and Colorado are there dying and we're looking for not only the needs of people two to mr. Richard how long the council have been pondering both of these votes and what does this mean for the city that well the council has been powdering medical marij for quite some time now for the last six months that we've been kicking it around and keep the position last night along with the recreation so we got to make a decision as far as the future regular and where is that there are certain restrictions are imposed on us by the state churches schools that you'll have it within the city limits and who's going to be hell regulate Marshall Olivia town council actually regulating location and the licensing of the medical marijuana facility we have our own town marshal and he will be enforcing any legal obligation Superman the state's kind of mandated what the restrictions are so we'll follow the state protocol send another okay do you know how long it's going to take these regulations anything probably within the next couple of months we should have everything depending on how soon someone may approach us as far as wanting to be licensed in the town of angular okay thank you mr.

can you tell us so we're your vote was on each issue and anything that's important to the town of angular on the medical marijuana I could see that it's a good for some people it helps in life well i think that the board is still studying all the aspects of it but we figured we were okay it and then if somebody submitted an application you know we would consider it and why no wonder that the sale of recreational marijuana but just seems that we I think most of the board just doesn't what that be an Aguilar be noted for having a recreation marijuana verdict use that helps people who we could we could see that right now but we would have to decide that anyway and what are some of the economic advantages you think they might at the ten amigo might get from Sally medical marijuana welcome

products like talk to you today about is our ortho joint excess the great thing about this product instead of having to take ten different pills for your joints and bones and cartilage this product has that all in one has your glucosamine chondroitin your curcumin boswellia and it has a new product that a lot of people never even heard of called psych flex and all sigh flex and all is a natural bone morphogen which will actually reproduce cartilage and repair bone and bone strength my father was told they had to get both knees replaced at the Mayo Clinic and before he went I said dad would 40 you make that trip and get those knees replaced coming down to the clinic and try a couple products and after being on this product for three months my dad who has been 13 different balls through marathons who's been running his whole life could run again and now he runs five miles a day and he consistently takes his product and knows without a doubt that this product was what did it because he went from not being able to hardly walk to running five miles a day within about three months but you need to take the product consistently every day for at least a month and a half before you start noticing results because this census is a natural product you're actually changing and rebuilding the bone and cartilage as opposed just masking the symptoms and masking the pain you're actually rebuilding and regenerating so you're going to get long-term results as opposed to short-term symptoms of Russian", "6v5C6ddO4vM": "this is Jonathan Karp welcome to miracle little TV we're here in West Hollywood California at M cafe M Cafe features miracle noodle on the menu so we're gonna walk inside talk to the chef and see how they cook up some miracle I am with you des president of M Cafe so I wanted to talk a little bit about the restaurant the philosophy of the restaurant how you got into the restaurant business as well restaurant business now that's a great question and actually my family has been operating restaurant for over 400 years original restaurant it's called kaga chaiyya chaiyya mise teahouse that's how he started 20 years ago and still runs as a restaurant in Japan Wow what part of Japan it's a city kochiyama it's about I want to have south of Tokyo it's almost you know beach city it's almost like Carmel okay do you grew up in Japan or yeah I did I was born and raised until I was 14 years old this new concept M Cafe is macrobiotic base but it's very similar okay and so for some of the people who are listening we don't really have a background in knowing what exactly what macrobiotic is could you give a little background on that of course macrobiotic is very difficult to you know explain in one short sentence but if I can it is really a balanced diet based on grains and well all the food has a you know plus and minus energy and you're supposed to balance those out as long as you're well balanced you okay with the health then you you know your daily life so to speak so that's pretty much macrobiotic and so tell me how you I know you know you're familiar of course growing up in Japan about kwan yahoo and using using a product which is basically a very traditional product of course we made it into a fettuccine change fettuccine shape so how did that come about in terms of you know did you it was there a customer request or yes so of course you know I usually go to a health expo as well and I have a lot of information and connections from a lot of healthy products and we ran into your product and this was exactly like our philosophy in our store we wanted to provide there's a lot of things in life that it's already exist and we know it's for healthy but we discover and we kind of reform it to the public so that they can easily access them or mentally or visually and most importantly flavor and I think your product really came out of nowhere because it just made it so much easier for American people to accept it the packaging whatever it is or the name of the product because if Japanese stores will carry as shirataki and no one you know no local people go in and buy it that's yes but I think you changed it to you know fit a Cheaney like I meant much more easier to eat and it's like our store macrobiotic is very scary words but we thought if we you know make our food very tasteful flavorful they don't have to think second what it is that they're eating they want to come back so it's I think it's just all about presentation and I love your product because a people just jump on and buy them like certainly appreciate that yes and you know one of the things that we do in the company is we we keep it as traditional as we possibly can is a lot of there are some other companies that add a lot of different ingredients to the to the Shirataki and so we try to keep it as you know basically the same way they've made it for forever and and it's great for us to see because at a restaurant like this because in addition to kind of matching the philosophy world of our own company it introduces you know the product to a whole different group of people who never write who never would have ever come across you know this particular incredibly healthy traditional Japanese product I completely agree the best thing again is shirataki and cognac was only utilize or or introduced in Japanese restaurants but now I mean we were much more wide range and pop you know range with the customer clientele base and I think it's it's great what you have done well thank you very much so we're going to go into the kitchen and try to see how it will see how its prepared here hi today I'm going to make a spicy using miso broth a miracle noodle so from here this is the yuzu juice from Japan and chopped the box joy and sliced zucchini and bean sprouts and the shredded carrot money marinated shiitake in soy sauce and the sesame oil chili pepper and which is seven spices from Japan and shiso and daikon sprouts and the tofu and the dreaded feeling I wanted to do it and we are going to draw the family heating up the miso soup which is Shoji data-based the least of which is shiitake and kelp noodle broth and the usage juice and the shichimi pepper to make a spicy and the city now open that when you have to do it all the mirakuru is just the heat up it's very quickly Oh soup and the luxury but surely the fresh law and the bean sprouts and zucchini money did in sesame oil and a little bit of sesame oil tourism see technique and you catalyst and hope tsommo is ready samo is marinated in soy sauce and reduction teriyaki and Cecil and daikon sprouts and the cheating a bit buggy okay so the finally I get to taste this as my cameraman has been setting up this has been the most difficult thing because I've been the aroma is just driving and crazy so well actually the aroma smell is fresh salmon a little bit of the sesame oil which gives an incredible aroma and I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what I'm going to try first but let's go ahead with a little bit of the salmon mmm really tender really good let's get some of the noodles in here it has a very savory broth and you can see that one of the great things about the noodle is that because it's mostly made of water it actually absorbs a lot of the flavors of the broth so the noodles will actually really taste you'll be able to taste the broth really incredible it's a very savory broth the matches really well with the salmon and you get another kind of savory element with the with the shiitake mushrooms pretty much everything here is just incredibly delicious all of the ingredients really match well and just really really delicious we had a great time today at M cafe in West Hollywood California I look forward to seeing you again in our next episode where we'll be visiting another restaurant that cooks with miracle noodles I'm Jonathan Karp thanks for watching"}
