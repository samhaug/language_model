{"Q5ZOdkfcKwo": "all right here we have a new one today I just picked it up from Queen of blood of course it's on 10th Avenue right across from sanella station and this has been a split a hybrid that I tried the other day my cousin bossom and what's awesome and it's definitely the best stuff I've tried from any dispensary so far and for a hybrid it's very energizing generally I only stick with straight sativas four of the energy or straight indica for like sleeping or chilling out but this hybrid is like very energizing I find I don't know the ratio of I wish I put that on here the actual ratio of sativa to indica it just says hybrid THC 13.6 which is also interesting to note because the stuff that I tried from my cousin was like I believe 11 and 11 percent range and I don't really know understand the whole differences between the higher a lower THC rate I go I just figured that the higher the THC rate the higher I would get but maybe that's not necessarily the case but I pre open it so hopefully I can just open this and there you go so yeah didn't the buds are a nice size they're they're not dry I got over I don't like getting super dry stuff to me it makes it feel like it's I don't not it's good quality maybe but as you can see sorry eyes that's the train I live right next to the train line as you can see it gets pretty busy but it's a nice looking bud lots of red hairs on it which is always a good sign it's called banana split but it doesn't smell like bananas at all but it has a small piney strong pungent piney taste smell that I guess all buds have it's one little this one's a little different looking here you can see very lots of red hairs and I picked up some but from that didn't have any at all or very little and it seems to make a difference so this one looks a little different than this one but they're not super dry and as you can see that's an eight and but I don't need to try this to tell you that it's awesome so far it's the best one I've had from any from a dispensary very energetic and no bad side effects like anxiety or whatever it I don't know it's it's really mellow by energetic it's a good social weed you want to take some weed before you go out this would be a good one it'll make you super talkative to the point of your almost annoying yourself because he won't shut up anyways that's my little quick review ish of the banana split hybrid from Aurora how do you recommend this one if you go into a dispensary ask for this one alright I'm out thanks for watching", "wsgH-r4AZzU": "hi everyone welcome back to greenbox the weed unboxing Channel today we've got banana split hybrid by Aurora 11.7% HC ends your CBD may 5th 20 No very Wheaties very dark [Music] kind of dry medium-density that looks for you so this is three and a half grams [Music] oh no knock it down one second rescued the nug that didn't make it and oh my goodness really okay three point two nine grams still technically three-and-a-half for rounding so I just grabbed all the little Scrappy's from around the scale and I managed to get three point three one grams so these knocks are quite dark lots of hairs on them really nice color kind of dry though be interesting to see how it breaks okay [Applause] you can see a lot of the hairs not bad for THC amount foot not tonnes there that's really dry so it's like it ground up really really fine it's a nice strength it gives you a fairly mellow fight and then it's mildly uplifting as well and then the hit kind of has a fruity flavor to it kind of banana like but not like BAM banana in your face this container definitely could have benefited from having one of those humidity packs it did bust up really dry but I mean it might not always be like that anyways thanks for watching like and subscribe and let me know what you think in the comments below and we'll see you next time hey everyone welcome back to green box with", "wIGOizmVpAk": "hey what's up everyone it's ones they love bud review one of the strains I grew this here you know I really liked it looking at banana split from Crockett family farms I sold out here but you can find a lot of other places this is a very [ __ ] good strain tangi cross sunset sherbert and says expect large eels or frosty dense flowers amazing color and a tense aroma and you know what I'll have to only sentences of one of very few strains I've had and that [ __ ] overpowered the diesels you know the [ __ ] oh geez easily and I flaking had like a third of what I had the other [ __ ] and [ __ ] this overpowered the whole room Pierre [ __ ] banana split this beautiful and monthly I'm I'm Howie I have been trying to start working together with ISA working them out because they smelled the same they had the same look and now he has a lot more purple but this is as a little person it's you know not too bad yeah there doesn't look like it's trimmed up beautiful beautiful [ __ ] tasting bud smell is incredible it's fruity fragrant you know I highly [ __ ] recommend this [ __ ] you know for your new beginner especially new growver picked up some [ __ ] bananas player this is very [ __ ] user friendly [ __ ] my god I want to like a pound

a nickel diamond [ __ ] so yeah I'm [ __ ] highly recommend this at about four stars out of five only reason not being a five is it didn't have the amazing quality like you know some of the strains

"bvvog55J6l4": "what's up good morning good afternoon good evening we are back for another wonderful opening video today we have the Aurora's banana split does that sound good it sounds good so of course as always we are doing our 3.5 we are at Junie 17 today and this was packaged on January 31st ok it's been in here for a while hopefully they have a seal over the top ok so before we get going open this guy up turn them on pull out me lovey wait you know the hundred Grammer BAM on the dot like it should be every time unlike that old scale that I had been using but let's just not talk about that all right I'm gonna bring the top up here tear it off and seal sealed let's go alright so right away we have her ears air seal on top of that pulled up really easily I don't think that was fully sealed at least it wasn't see it with good glue anyway so we're seeing a bit of void space in here could be better could be worse in holy smokes that smells just punched me in the face pretty much okay it's a very strong smell for these guys definitely don't open it if you're in an area where well you shouldn't open it you know you'll be busted okay right off the get-go I can tell you that it's time in the jar is it's noticeable with the dryness I can feel it just from pulling this first piece so let's bring them up here looks really decent okay so yeah it's falling apart in my hands we will pinch test and that's starting to just crush I'm gonna pull these pieces off and okay so it's not fully dust but it is very very dry like I can go like to have three fingers and completely bust it up no problem alright so I'm gonna pull it all out man again I just gotta see the smell of this batch is intense not a huge fan of the amount that I'm finding in the bottom here but with that overall dryness is definitely where I came from it just would have fell off this bud just from it being banging around and shipping it's not a huge amount of it but it's enough hmmmm peeking around I definitely didn't drop any none of the buds ran away so this one is definitely only coming out to a 3.3 definitely not the most ideal situation actually I have an idea put that all on there put this guy on here tear it off with that now let's start putting it back in maybe I messed up somehow it's a tiny little piece you go back in and you go back in hmm oh yeah yeah I am not sure how I caused that to screw up last time but apparently it's now registering a 3.5 somewhere the last time I lost point to Beast the hello to me maybe I didn't notice I bumped the tray or something foolish like that I didn't want to turn off oh well back on I like how the scale seems to know if we tear it off or if it's actually it's normal weight anyway yeah I mean yeah this one is that 3.40 getting between three point four three point five it usually tells me it's like three point four five or three point four six and it's having trouble determine because it only has two one spot off the decimal anyway guys that's about it for now until the next time I'm actually I'm just gonna take a quick peek yeah guys that's all I have for you until next time", "5k_6nT2ohyw": "hey everybody welcome back I'm checking out some new in it's called banana split this is what it looks like in the dryer smells real again let's pour some of that out if deep green nice red color nice right eye I put the light on it and now here is that I gotta split look at that nice very nice excuse my driving doors very nice let's go in and get it closed up with those psychos nice very pretty lots of red hairs lots of

glistened like snow very pretty Thanks nice ten snugs so that's banana split very nice banana split it's twenty four point seven six percent THC and point zero six percent CBD so thanks hey everybody I am finally gonna get to smoke some of that for you and do a strain test I can tell you I've been smoking this all weekend and it is now Wednesday and it has been a really productive week it's really a great strain to do that it is called banana split do not get it confused with banana split cush that is an indica this is just banana split it is tangey and banana sherbert and it has mmm it has a citrusy spell and a sweet aftertaste it smells really really citrusy it's really really cool and I really like it I showed you up close with and without the light on it and the trichomes are awesome all in it and it's been really nice smoking it like I said it's a really productive weed it makes you very social very productive very uplifting yeah it's been a really great week as far as I've been trying to deal with my friends passing and I think it's really helped the first couple days I was kind of in a daze and couldn't get myself motivated and this really helped I went to the dispensary I went like you know I have looked it up online I saw what you have so the banana split this is my I think the first time that I had this not usually a huge sativa fan but sometimes when life is getting you down it's good to have a steeper route hey that's another right I'm just wrapping over here yeah I won't go there I'll keep my day job hmm okay okay before I'm not really just picking it mmm it's got that sweet kind of a sure pretty citrus flavor and it's nice and sweet it's really good I really like it I'm gonna do one more and I want to take good news after only three days I started getting sprouts already all the White Widow are up and one of the Harley seal so I think the rest aren't going to come up really soon so that's a really great thing this morning I took a couple pictures and yeah no matter what happens it's gonna always gonna think positive right yeah I think big things are gonna happen for me this year I'm trying to put myself out there to either have my own business or go work for someone else making oil and because the world needs my oil it really does and so many people love it they're like do you need to get this out there you need to get your business going so I am really trying hard and looking at new avenues now for getting that going so wish me luck you look really great it would be awesome to do I don't know what I would do without the oil I was to be walking with a cane so yeah that's pretty awesome [Applause] mmm definitely definite citrus tangi flavored and really guys sure pretty nice fruitiness nice sweet so I like it two thumbs up I like the banana split and it's better like good uplifting buzz and uplifting kind of smoke to have yeah okay so thanks thanks for watching", "sG_YdB2ctW0": "make some noise for DNA genetics show strain we brought out was tangi it kind of took the world by storm I guess for the help of DNA genetics putting it out there and you know that's what kind of what we got famous for is our flagship I'm Crockett from Crockett family farms and I'm from California and we've been breeding seeds now for a few years with the help of some of our friends from DNA genetics even my grandfather you know grew you'd not took not to make a living or anything but you know they've all grown and and I kind of was born into it I have been growing my whole life since I could since I was early teens and I was able to actually do it and I've been fortunate to be able to to take it this far really I guess the first time I can Rhett remember remember remember marijuana would be smelling it as a good smelling it and it reminded me of my parents you know if if I was being they dropped me off for a while or something and I came back home and I smelt it I would know that they were like eight or nine years old like please good the first time I ever smoked marijuana I was 11 or 12 years old and my cousins and and everybody you know we're smoking it and I smoked until I did not I did I did not roll the joint myself but I did hit it and I did feel it some people say you don't feel it on the first time and that was not the case with me I got really really really high and I loved it right off the bat and I've been smoking it ever since no I can't remember what strain it was but it definitely was good it was some stuff that was coming off our mountain it was probably something back in the day in the late 80s that was probably cold like they had weird names back then it was probably called like like it was probably called still the big thing on our Mountain back then was like the stinger mark Haskell Smith the author of a whole bunch of different books one of them being the heart of dankness I met him while he was actually flying to Amsterdam to do research on his book I met him on the plane and I he said that he was going to be meeting up with the guy from DNA genetics and he was nice enough to introduce me my favorite type of strain I guess would be a sativa dominant hybrid I like them for a lot of different reasons I like I'm a terpene guy I like I like flavorful weed I like stuff that you can smell from across the room stuff that you can smoke and then an hour later your friends come in and know what you've been smoking you know tends to be for me sativa dominant hybrids I like the fact that you can grow them big outside and they still bring them in you know on a on a decent you know in a decent time before it gets too late in the fall they yield well inside now it easy to grow I just really dig them I like everything new I like I think it all I think Crockett family farms has a lot to look forward to in the future we have you know a good stable of strains out that are really hitting hard this year I think I'm not exactly sure but I know at least four of the strains that we released in the past year we've only been out to the public for a year and I think four of them four or five of them have already won different awards from different contests from different people all over the place people I don't even know you know and that's it's really cool to look back or to to know that's happening so I'm really excited for the future for the strains that we have out and you know we're working on a lot of really really cool stuff for the future too I've grown a lot of DNA genetics varieties through my life you know I could name off a whole lot I guess one of the biggest producers and this is a true story would be LA woman la woman was a seed some seeds that I had purchased and grown out in California before I even met a DNA and did pretty well with those made me a fan right away the first seeds I ever bought I was a young man and I just got him out of high school and I took the bus up to Vancouver BC British Columbia and went over there to this place called a respectable joint and and I was looking for seeds around there somewhere and I got directed to go find some where to go to purchase these seeds and I I went up there and purchased the seeds and it was Northern Lights number five times Hawaiian indica and Northern Lights number five times blueberry for the two packs I think I bought and I went back it down into this place to smoke a joint and I noticed that there was nobody in there but my friend and there was a guy outside making a speech and so I walked outside and I was just blanking him on his on his right shoulder there right behind him and then I noticed there was tons of cameras and media and people and stuff and he was waving his arms in the air and making this really passionate activist you know pro-marijuana Act of the speech and it was Marc Emery and Ed it was his shop and I was standing right behind him like I was one of his goons or something just fell right into it it was funny but that was the first time I ever bought seeds we've been winning with tangi since 2012 it's been around since before then but that's pretty much been it got released by DNA answer and we thought it was good enough to win a cup and it did when a third place actually but it's furred off this this huge movement with a citrus flavored aroma and taste especially in concentrates in the big view concentrate game it's just really taken a name for itself the the flavor and the smell are hard to duplicate and imitate but it's funny that a lot of people have tried that I've seen a whole gamut of different orange this and and tangi that or this you know all over the board and I really I feel fortunate that that's happening because you know I mean M&S yeah thank you that's exactly what I was going to say you know I mean I I never thought that I would be able to to create and be involved in creating a game changer like this before this sativas were dominated by the haze and and now we've got a little different flavor coming in you know we've got these fruit flavors that we can we can put around and not have a DA haze dominant you know flavor and growth pattern and all that so the other been a lot of people trying to knock it off and and you know it's it's something that that is fine I mean once people buy seeds and they decide to breed with them that's you know it actually makes me feel good and another thing that makes me feel good is now I go to these competitions and I see that that sometimes fifty percent are dominated by by tangi and different especially if me and Aaron are there together or me and Aaron or Don they're together we can look up on the thing and fifty percent of the entries are dominated by DNA and Crocket family farms", "u8eHcQlPC6E": "all righty what is up guys welcome back Chris Kyle's TV this 21 / channel dedicated people of marijuana music sports gaming very much more so today's episode of kids TV you're gonna be doing a strand view of some sherbert so hope you guys are home I was smoking The Bachelor be joining cannabis related parts dog for a long girl 21 or over and as always they hit for a challenge guys up now Bowl loaded up but what a heartache every time you can take it as a merger or not what you guys are home do the same and smoke along with me so it's been a while since we do is we have done a strain review here and I just wanna let you guys know about the 15th or 16th of November we'll get back into our regularly scheduled string reviews will either be doing one a week or will be doing two a month guaranteed so be on the lookout for that like I said we'll get back to it about 15 for 16 but as of right now today like I said when you're starting to hear some sherbert picked it up at the pot chopped 8 bucks for a half gram I should say I was gonna get a gram of some reggae gold but it did not have it so I had to pick up some sherbert here and real quickly before we get into the strand review I just want to read you guys off what it says here on the package like I said it got some sherbert the thca is 32.5% cv DS are 0.1% and thct which is total THC is 29.6% so very high on the TV very low on the CBD it says Tahoma flavors in that this is an indica which is very wrong because by the stats here it looks like it happens to be a sativa dominant hybrid let's see though indica and then there's the stats right there so I don't know just by looking at it it looks like a sativa dominant hybrid but wants to smoke it to find out and like I said this is done by alias true premiums cannabis processor and it also says to Houma flavors then it got all the other [ __ ] on it so if you guys don't know about the pre-roll you don't really judge the smell because you can't really get a small off the pre-roll but we do judge the taste we do the pre lit taste what it tastes like before the before we light it and then we do the after lit taste sit there take about four five bucks see what it tastes like then and also we're gonna be doing the high so there we go guys I'm gonna go ahead and pop this sucker open let's go ahead and right now right now let's go ahead and do the pre lit test see what it tastes like before we get super-strong skunk a good strong taste of sweet time with the skunk Alcon almost overpowers that fine there but a five out of five for the greens taste test very strong on the palate very long-lasting on the palate - I'm very very tasty like it says super strong skunk taste with that super I wouldn't say super storm but a very good powerful taste of some sweet pine but the skunk is definitely a lot stronger than the pine but regardless definitely a good mix and don't be some dank tasting stuff just before the pre-lit so a five out of five for the feet let test and we'll get it back to you guys here in a second with that after greens or the after lit test let's get into that after it was lit taste test so after is lit the taste I get is some sweet skunk and some sweet pine and they're very strong too but they're about the same and also I do get an actually good strong case of some sweet lavender no no I normally I am NOT a big fan of sweet lavender or I should say not a fan of lavender taste but it's like it's not very strong but it is like you could definitely better taste it it's dumping odds of power but the very sweet lavender like I said very strong sweet skunk and sweet pied with a good taste and not a strong but a good taste of sweet lavender it's basically on the aftertaste when you ex help get a little aftertaste of that sweet lavender in there so the after Gries taste n so the after it was lit taste test it 5 out of 5 very strong in the palate and very tasty stuff name's 5 out of 5 very very very potent [ __ ] top 3 most potent should I've ever smoked in my life it really really hit your head hard like just no one else coughing right there that is probably the highest I've been in right now is the highest I've been in a long time I'm talking about northern blueberry blueberry are whoo yeah was it blueberry Northern Lights that's what it is blueberry nor like last time I smoked that that's about as high as I got right now and this [ __ ] here is super super potent a delight and the kabadi high very manageable but definitely a very heady heady in the car hey don't be a mix of some good strong sativa in there too but it's like a power punch of sativa and some indica but my head feels heavy I feel like if I lean a little bit to the left a little bit to the right too much that [ __ ] I'm gonna end up falling over so definitely a 5 out of 5 for the high definitely some [ __ ] strong potent [ __ ] good life in the kabadi high but a very strong indica and sativa wall balanced mix head high I'd say actually I'd say about a 60/40 and it gets a little bit more into control as it's starting to kick more on the ear so five out of five for the high so my official review here of this sherbert as you guys can tell it it got me [ __ ] up it tastes amazing and it gets you stoned like a [ __ ] and that's all you need in some weed and just need some [ __ ] that tastes good and get you stoned and this here does the job especially with just a couple hits so my official review of the sugar here is a 5 out of 5 this is some awesome [ __ ] [ __ ] right here like I said very very potent so if you want to save some money or you know [ __ ] you know get make your dollar stretch or anything like that sound of getting uh you know gram or two of some mid grade or getting the eighth of some mid grade go ahead and just go get you some of this sure bro right here I guarantee you man this [ __ ] right here is very potent you can sit there smoke a bowl and be good for half a day easy two balls be stoned all day all day no problem alright so some super strong [ __ ] here I know you want to smoke this whole Dre this is just a hop grab here and I've spoke just about most of it I say this is about a point was left so a little point for here Gavi feel like I already spoke to one point two maybe even [ __ ] it like a one and a half grab joy I said some super strong [ __ ] I definitely recommend you guys go to your block market your recreational medical where the [ __ ] you get your cannabis at let's go get you some [ __ ] sherbert you guys saw the size if you guys can get the same batch that I got right here I guarantee you you're gonna love this [ __ ] like I said if you're not big head of a lavender this here is actually gonna be good cuz I've told you just has that good aftertaste I've just saw some sweet lavender it's not too strong but it's not too light and [ __ ] it just tastes great it just tastes great especially with that strong [ __ ] skunk and that's strong sweet pine air should say sweet skunk and sweet pine did he finish it off there with that sweet lavender its abduct Lee good [ __ ] definitely a very enjoyable [ __ ] smoking experience with your smoker with some sherbert here so hope you guys enjoyed this [ __ ] if you did go ahead and hit the thumbs up like I said we'll be back with our regular schedule strain reviews about 1516 so if you guys have any suggestions or strain reviews that I've might are you guys want to see any suggestions that are and you know any friend of you guys want to say you know I'm saying then drop down in the comments this [ __ ] here man it get you in throat and it hit you in the head heart it's just a doc out punch to that definitely some stodie [ __ ] smoke at this [ __ ] here every hit I take is like probably like maybe a point for [ __ ] you know of a dab like almost a half gram down I get just really [ __ ] hit you there's somebody who dabs a lot I guarantee if you smoke this flower you'd be able to smoke this [ __ ] straight up and still get [ __ ] up cuz this here I feel stronger than to death you take a point to dab compared to a hit a hit off this joint right here of the sherbert this sherbert [ __ ] way stronger than adapt it's stronger than any dab I've ever took him now took an eighty percent THC Depp's this here is stronger some amazing [ __ ] so I already said hope you guys have a great day or night oh it's pretty far I'm just a eyes didn't get sealants and always do your PC guys next time with couch couch TV with one more sherbert cloud god damn got some dang [ __ ] I'm Duff you're gonna try to see if I could pick up some part of

like in the bong and [ __ ] to see if it holds up also then see what it's like in the bomb but definitely really good in the [ __ ] joint but peace see you guys next time with Chris Kyle's TV", "p_7n-dSdTt8": "[Music] look what I've got here this is a giant bud of something called banana split and it's from 3ce farms and 3ce farms may tahoe gene if you see that if you saw that review you'll see that that thing was so strong it's unbelievably strong so we're all excited to try banana split today and it comes in this jar and these people have a great label and you can see it says it says this is tiba2 indica scale and it's a little bit in the cub but this is really a hybrid almost in the center and it says that this is oh I need my my magnifier it says three seat Kraken and three seat banana oh geez what makes this so today we're gonna try it out of the vapor cup and you can see it's ready it's got a whole straw fill of banana split ready to go let's check it out out of the vapor cup number two this flower is an indica hybrid and the vape is super smooth and when I do this test this is not the test this is just the review of when I used it before this and I would say what made this one is I thought it wasn't doing anything and then it creeped in and then it creeped and it got me very very stoned I went down to hhc dispensary in Van Nuys and they always have heavy-hitting flowers if you go down there also she's try their house brand Ames they have some great flowers under that brand so this flower has 23 percent THC and what do we think we're looking for the best is banana split from 3ce farms the best this flower gets an 85 it's a good flower if you got it you would definitely enjoy it but it's not the best this is a doctor for weed entertainment if you want to see LA's best flowers please go to weed entertainment com it has the top 30 flowers rated in all of LA and it's such a joy you can go right down to the dispensary and if there's any flowers on that list and you see them grab them it's much better than picking blind if you want to see vapor cup you can see it on paper cup com it's the vaporizer champions I'm telling you it changed my life I

all right I'm gonna go so see you later it's time for you be I'm out", "HlLPkDomugY": "hey guys what is going on today we're taking a look at another edible this time we're taking a look at dank nugs um if you like this video i got a ton like it on my channel check it out maybe sub now these are edible chocolate weed nugs it's not weed it's chocolate um [Music] wow they look off of it they do not look like they're off edibles they look like they're off something else but this is the straw nana flavor it's a 1.8 ounce jar with 350 milligrams total thc can read some of the nutrition facts it says one serving is this whole thing i know if i ate this whole thing i would not be able to handle myself but if you're extremely heavy smoker maybe this whole thing would do you um can take pause and take a look at any of that if that interests you three grams of protein three grams of protein wow um got the ingredients the one the thing that just kind of caught my eye we got crispy rice cereal frosted corn puffs um so if we take a look at the nugs themselves you can see that they are made to look like uh bud nugs or weed nuggets whatever whatever you'd like to say they're in the shape of it um if you can see they do they make the seeds or whatever the seeds seeds but i'm guessing that's the corn puffs or one of those things um it's a nice little this will come sealed tamper resistant seal i don't know what that means base it's just it's just tape i don't know what makes it tamper resistant um if you crack this bad [ __ ] open one moment it can take a much better look um to me these kind of looked gross i mean i get it's the whole gimmick that they look like bud that's the whole point but not exactly the most appetizing thing to eat uh just green chocolate um but they look cool from far away when you just like look at the jar like it looks fire it just looks interesting you know but um this is a straw nana flavor i gotta say eating chocolate that is flavored like something that's not chocolate like strawberry banana that's like a fruit flavor eating chocolate uh the texture is definitely a bit off it does not feel right when you're eating it but um [Music] the high itself is definitely there i just have a problem with the the edible itself i wish i wish they just made it like you know chocolate flavored but i get they gotta have mad different flavors and whatnot um smell like it smells like straight like a strawberry banana puff bar like it's so strong and so uh artificial but if you are a very big fan of strawberry banana and textures don't bother you i guess i would say go for it um the only thing i did like is is just the corn puff things inside gave it a nice crunch i guess but it just felt so wrong eating chocolate that tasted like a smoothie you know what i mean um so would i recommend them [Music] i guess if if textures don't bother you but um it feels very very wrong i can't i'm having trouble explaining it with words but it just feels weird um i gave one to my roommate and she made a gagging face like she was about to throw up but about an hour later she was doing just fine um so yeah maybe try these out maybe not maybe try a more chill flavor than this maybe not the straw nana but it is a nice gimmick it's a nice if you if you've never tried them before maybe try them once at least just to you know see it's about the gimmick but the gimmick does wear off extremely quickly after you eat it for the first time so it's a nice little party gift or something you know what i mean but i would not be buying these on the daily for my personal use but i hope you guys enjoyed this little look at dank nugs these guys do not look okay they need help um anyway got a bunch of videos on my channel i got a gaming channel if you're interested in any of that drop a sub or click on my channel and uh yeah stay safe stay uh stay eating the weed yo peace out", "9R58F-Q5YHU": "yo it's hot Portland and it's finally sunny so that fulfilled our let's get out of the Sun for this one there we go so we have a nice one called and bring this around aside we have a nice one called a banana split it's pretty live full terpene range is about 70% with a 4.5 they added terpenes in this it's called banana split shoutout to artifact extracts keeping it pretty stuff is really yellow see if we can get a nice stretch on it from the Sun super yo smells amazing you guys have smoke live resin before it's pretty much what it smells like so super hot out here today so it's probably why it's filling it definitely smells like bananas my flavors banana split so it's definitely coming out with a banana profile that I can smell from parent even that insides dad that I got it's pretty decent-sized app goes hard let's see get a DAB going shout-out to Khalifa I always have the best always wearing their shirt for some reason thank you the girlfriend heating up the rig for me torch illusions shout out to them they were doing live press inside Khalifa the other day we're not in Khalifa northwest cannabis but shout out to them it's hot I am sweating today Portland Oregon doing it alive it's in my backyard way out there on the horizon he's downtown for I can't really see it that well on this camera but Cheers now my friends clean that profile was amazing with the bananas were they coming and super strong definitely made me spit up a little bit good stuff though I definitely give that a nine out of its then yeah shout out to them and then a good good pull on that one banana split amazing [ __ ] surprisingly there is no CBD in this one not at all shout out maybe use on dabs head it up", "iQTSbTIHfus": "hi everyone - I thought Nasir mr. a vice this is second press a banana split things to be 14.1% and this is after the humidity packs not sure if it's going to do anything there's three buttons in here to equal a little over gram and still seem pretty dry we have brought weed back from the dead before so we'll see with this if not I'm gonna send these videos to my producer and say like what the heck humidity packs didn't even help not seeing anything [Music] there we go humidity pack did nothing I think that's what happens I guess in the producing world right you know I'm not gonna hide these results something I show you sometimes those community facts I guess do not work this weed is obviously dried up and dead should be a crime to sell this stuff when it's not worth a dime however good one", "FRx17UU4o_Y": "hi everyone - hi dear mystery voice today we're gonna press some banana split I don't really care for bananas better well I guess I'll try smoking it claims to be 14.1% this is my medical marijuana see it's sealed brand new container no don't know if you guys ever noticed but I always cut these open instead of trying to pull the tabs that's my shoulder injuries I cannot squeeze things as tight as I used to and it's just impossible for me to open and I end up usually peeling the seal off so that's what it looks like it's quite a good container try to find a decent size but for you guys here this stuff seems pretty light and fluffy though same point eight I'm gonna try to do two buds together to do 1.4 grams I'll just skip the step of the pre press that I usually do [Music] then like always I will put a humidity pack in this container and then I'll press some in a couple days again and see it's a better return I'm getting close to the 1 ounce total for the Rose and chips to do my two way honey oil test so hopefully get that going soon here and then it'll be probably 2 or 3 videos to that walls and chip series that's definitely taking a while [Music] I got to say this is actually a weird sight actually not seeing anything coming out so far on my medical marijuana nothing comes out I definitely will have to send a complaint in about how dry their stuff is I'm gonna shut her off and there is nothing well that's very sad and unfortunate and I'll definitely sending in the complaint about that I'm not sure what else to do about it now but anyways have ruined another video and that's two so far that we've had that happen and I guess this is a pretty sad for medical marijuana but like I said I'll put him here to deepak in there try again in a little while anyways usually it's a happy healthy hoots but I ain't got none so uh yeah I guess banana split is banana [ __ ] alright"}
