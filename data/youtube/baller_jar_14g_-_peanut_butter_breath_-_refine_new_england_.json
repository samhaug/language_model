[ __ ] [Applause] nananana there's no peanut butter in it at all it's just the name you know people pick cool little classy names I think it was ingenious the name that they picked and packaging that they chose was just it's just gorgeous I am NOT gonna front it is super strong the amount of amount of flavor that's pouring out of this [ __ ] it's crazy always a hybrid 20% THC nice that's really high actually one out of 10 10 all day probably a 12 for real boom yep out of one to ten I will give peanutbutter breath like a 12 honest to god this year is beautiful this is a gorgeous gorgeous smoke whenever you hear me talk this much about a [ __ ] bud you know I say gotta be real for real no other way to put it Oh higher on the indica see I told you I got to get that indicus like sweetness out of it at their potency yeah I'm not even gonna fir you guys get an opportunity and you see this [ __ ] on your on your dispensary or you know you see it listed on the menu get that peanut butter breath this is no joke I can't wait for wifey to get home and try this [ __ ] she's gonna flip this is nuts I got the cleaning lady cleaning my room right now that's cool so you always does a really good job too you guys get an opportunity to check out Jason Charles on Instagram he makes a lot of my custom pieces that I have a lot of my cool custom pipes that I have definitely came from mr. Jason Charles so check him out on Instagram the dude is [ __ ] bad-ass ooh 28:20 1.58 percent THC that's the nastiness oh man it's lighter but let me find a nice little quiet spot the lake there you go so yeah I'm a nice beautiful sunny day no cold weather today no rain is it better than hogs breath I haven't had hogs breath in like seven years I need the real on that [ __ ] and really really really give it a one-up on it because a lot of new strains are out and even though hogs breath is one of my favorite that's not my favorite I still would have to put it up totally because uh this [ __ ] is beautiful like gorgeous to look at to he ad without it yeah it's almost impossible it's fine to get your hands on hog breath is [ __ ] I think the next time I see that [ __ ] I'm gonna grab a large amount his blue dream and indicate by mistake I think blue jeans are sativa it might be a hybrid too but I think it's a sativa I could be wrong who Arnold without Arnold how's it going man I'm glad you got yourself a glass blunt bro it's [ __ ] that's the king of smoke right there that's some boss [ __ ] oh man I honestly don't even know if I can finish this blood that's real rap yeah I think it's a sativa too right it always has that stringy look to it it's nice and beautiful today today's a day to be outside for sure I wish I had more [ __ ] to do out here but it's a slow day today not too much maybe things will pop up you never know man I am smacked I'm [ __ ] high I'm not even gonna [ __ ] you guys look how much blood I got left sativa bro sativa is always gonna get you less paranoid and it's always gonna be better to smoke when you're outside around people because you're gonna be way more interactive on a sativa but there are special cases there are social TVs out there that are strong as [ __ ] to so you might get yourself a sativa but it might be on a high high level and bend your ass backwards so it ain't about indica sativa it's about take it easy bro hit that [ __ ] slow take two puffs and put it down walk the [ __ ] away realistically for a person that's not a heavy heavy heavy heavy smoker you're realistically supposed to be able to take a puff and put it down have you ever tried that take just one puff put the blunt down walk away I see how it affects you oh look at it everybody got all kinds of different information on the peanut butter breath I guess it's different different depending on where it's grown is gonna be a little slightly different you know they're always changes depending on the climate humidity and what part of the world you oh yeah go go cold banana yeah yeah Golden State a golden some [ __ ] like that yeah I know it's all about gold monkey or some [ __ ] like that I know you talking about I've had it I've had it plenty of times they have a lot of good product Gold State banana yeah that's right let's was car 75 for eight that's wrong I don't know where the [ __ ] well [ __ ] that's crazy I would not pay $75 for a [ __ ] that packaging this was 60 and the packaging was beautiful and the nug was incredible [Music] [Applause] [ __ ] at 30 percent THC I don't know i'ma have to look that [ __ ] up God cush I don't think I've had God cush I have God's gift before and I think that's the only thing I've ever had with the word God in it God's gift I don't think I've ever had God's push I have to keep an eye out for it for sure and eighth is 50 down there it varies over here depends on what you want to buy we could get ace down here $25 and they go all the way up to like [ __ ] 60 $70 - yeah we got $25 ace here though a real good [ __ ] - it's not gonna be this but it's gonna be something to get you by but Lee - it'd have to try it on key [ __ ] I do not have to try donkey [ __ ] yeah some of these names are a bit much donkey [ __ ] just make it crazy chase tell him chase tell him about that donkey [ __ ] we smoked that good [ __ ] girl damn I'm [ __ ] high as [ __ ] I'm using a blue game right now Garcia Vega games I got the blue ones that's what I'm smoking on yeah this is strong as [ __ ] I'm actually struggling to finish it see how many times I let it shut off I let it shut off this [ __ ] hitting

for your high and it just makes it [ __ ] sticky and engrossed to handle but honey does nothing for your high we used to do that as kids and it was a complete waste of [ __ ] time probably makes the blood smoke a little slower but get the [ __ ] out of here with that that's that's back in the day [ __ ] we did that [ __ ] when we was kids don't do that [ __ ] no more I have a funny honey blunt story I told one time life yeah at reset yeah yeah yeah yeah we used to put um we used to put [ __ ] honey I put I put nyquil one time before all over my blunt make it burn slow like man I did all

I'll talk to you guys later peace", "_GKck9Yby94": "what up and welcome to another edition of canopy where we are bringing to you honest and unbiased canvas training reviews so today we are going to be reviewing peanut butter breath by green gene genetics now if you guys are like me and have never tried peanut butter breath let's go ahead and talk about it this strain is a hybrid strain and evenly balanced hybrid strain that is across between one of my oldest favorite strains of all time docido and one of my newest favorite strains mendo breath and if i had known that prior to picking this up i might have picked up a second jar but i'm not going to get ahead of myself you guys let's go ahead i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out and then we will go ahead and jump right into my review okay so what did you think of this peanut butter breath by green gene genetics let me know in the comments below i will tell you that i just picked this stuff up yesterday it has a harvest date of the 2nd of october so today the day i'm filming this is december the 9th so basically two months and a week outside of the harvest date which for me i mean anywhere to get it between a month and and two months from harvest is like a perfect cure in my personal opinion so i think we're gonna get this at just the right time so let's go ahead and get this box open one thing i love they're very transparent hand trimmed they want to brag about that on the jars and i like these little jars you guys i'm not gonna lie they're like these child safety lock jars but the small jars are nice they are not going to let extra air in the jar and get your butt all um you know oxidized so let's go ahead and open this jar up and see what this stuff's about so man there's really hardly any smell i am getting some floral notes from this but like it honestly kind of smells like just grass or like hay but a tiny bit of floral let's take a look at this oh my god is this stuff covered in trichomes and the nug i mean you guys saw the nug that i got it was this and like one like small popcorn nug and then one even smaller nug than that in my eighth that is how an eighth should look and i mean i picked this stuff up on special you guys and this compares with stuff that's literally twice the price covered in trichomes bright orange hairs the trichomes are not only on the outside they are on the inside i'm literally looking at this bud and honestly about to kick myself for not getting more of it because i literally you guys i paid 35 for this eight this looks like bud from connected that is like 65 an eighth so basically twice as much oh my god it's just that light lime green some dark green hair uh excuse me leaves interwoven but these bright orange hairs i mean look at this you guys this stuff is just absolutely beautiful the looks they crushed it the smell though just this subtle floral smell is what i'm getting so before i got started today i did go ahead and throw uh through this peanut butter breath by g3 green gene genetics on the penny pinterest test i wanted to see if i could catch a penny pinching because i wasn't doing the penny pinterest test last time i reviewed a green gene genetic strain it's been a while so let's go ahead and see if there are 3.5 grams like it says in this jar so here it comes now okay so the time has come for the penny bingers test let's see if this peanut butter breath by green jean genetics g3 weighs 3.5 grams like it says there on the package so let's go ahead we'll get our scale turned on here we'll put our dollar bill on here just to make sure that that weighs one gram we'll account for any discrepancy okay so we have a point zero two discrepancy which means anything i put on here is just going to be 0.02 grams heavier than what we're actually seeing so let's get our cup put on here i will tear that out so that's not affecting the weight let me go ahead and get this box opened up here with this green gene genetics the jar is out the top is off let's go ahead and plop these nugs in here oh one big mama and let's see where we land okay so six 3.67 grams for this eight that is definitely a pass they are giving you point one seven grams over way to go green gene genetics boom you guys saw that's how it's done 3.67 you guys so how awesome is this it says 3.5 but they're giving you almost .2 over that is awesome way to go green gene genetics that is a huge huge thumbs up for you guys on that one now i can tell you even though the flavors are pulled back you know and the terpenes aren't really loud i am excited to try this dosie don't mix with mendo breath are you freaking kidding me this is like exciting so i mean it comes in this package nice package it's not just the jar i mean that is nice um the way they've got the bud displayed now today i'm going to be enjoying this peanut butter breath out of my arizer xtreme q desktop vaporizer i've got this bad boy set to 375 degrees fahrenheit as you see right there i have got my whip which is basically just the silicone tube that gets the vapor from the vaporizer to me the end with the screen on it i was just cleaning that out that one's going into the bowl that sits the top of the vaporizer let me smell that bowl since it's been warming up i don't like to be influenced by the name of strains but no joke that smells like warm peanut butter that is just like sitting on the oven warming up oh my god that's crazy that that translates yeah normally i'm not like wooed by that or anything or suede but that really does smell creamy and nutty for sure there's no question about it now this end is going into the bowl that we just smelled it looks just like that that end sits on the heating element the other end is going into my scientific inhalations triple filtered bubbler i'm only using two of the three filtration chambers today i've got some distilled water brand new distilled water in the second i've got a brand new organic cotton filter in the third that'll filter out any potential remaining impurities that did not get purged out in the final stages of growing and flushed at the end of the growing process so if you guys are ready i can tell you i am certainly ready to try out this peanut butter breath by green gene genetics so let's go ahead and get this party started okay so just a very very little bit of light vapor i'm getting a tiny bit of subtle sweetness a nice little bit of floral um coming in but let me go ahead i'm going to probably take three rips on this one just so i get two that have some actual visible vapor wow that was so freaking smooth i didn't even think i was getting a rip and you guys that was a legit legit rip now this is very floral that dosey dough is for sure the predominant flavor that i'm getting just like fresh flowers you guys just very very floral let me dive in for the third rip and see how this flavor develops okay much bigger rip and i gotta tell you it went down yet again so buttery smooth um but just from my take there's a subtle sweetness but this is all about that floral coming from the dosy dough like that is the predominant flavor and it's kind of subdued it's kind of light i mean it's very lightly coating my mouth i mean it's not really too pungent um now that was only really the second rip with visible vapor let's go ahead and i'm going to finish this bowl i want to see how the flavor changes and develops throughout the bowl while i'm doing that i want to bring this stuff up on the screen for you guys to check out under the magnification of a 25 times macro lens so you get a little bit of a better up close and personal view of this peanut butter breath by green gene genetics so here it comes now okay so you are looking at the peanut butter breath by green gene genetics g3 and wowie wow is this some picture perfect bud i think the orange hairs are the star of the show today you guys these are like those neon orange hairs not ultra thick but certainly not thin kind of just that perfect thickness this stuff is so covered in trichomes i mean look at even the leaves on the top of this but they have trichomes on them this bud was absolutely trimmed by hand there is no excess leaf material on this bud the bud is definitely that light color of green but then it has the dark leaves kind of interwoven throughout there that give it this really really pretty pretty coloration variety and honest to god i mean this is just some unbelievable looking dank okay so what did you think of that peanut butter breath under the macro lens pretty freaking nuts right i will tell you that the looks in my personal opinion are where this just shines the absolute most i mean the bottom line is this stuff like when i saw it was just like blown away by how beautiful it was and those trichomes like you can't there's just no hiding like a really great looking bud and this bud um you know it had everything that you want in a good looking bud and the jars i mean i got a freaking pretty much a solitaire in the the jar a solitaire if you don't know is just one single nug eight um you know i don't think they can fit that in these small little jars in all honesty but um i'm really excited to talk about it there's a lot going on with the strain and i can tell that g3 is really putting a lot of effort into creating some um great indoor cannabis there's no question about it so how i do all of my reviews you guys is out of 10 0 being the worst 10 being the absolute best i break that down to four different categories look smell taste and potency for how effective this medicine is i'll sign up to 2.5 points each in each of those respective categories we'll tally up the total at the end anything getting seven or above is going to get our dank thumbs up approval and if it does get seven or above i will tell you if i would go out and buy this strain again um now let's start by talking about the looks or bag or jar appeal in this case of the peanut butter breath by g3 so i'm gonna bring it up on the screen one last time so it's fresh in your mind then we'll go ahead and get into my final review on this peanut butter bread okay so you've seen it multiple times and there is a lot to talk about so let's not waste any more time the look the look the look i don't think i need to harp on the look of this stuff whatsoever because this stuff to me it just looks absolutely unbelievable i mean we've talked about it before but the bottom line is you know as far as bud structure goes you know the trim job on this the amount of trichomes the the color of the bud overall as opposed to the hairs you know how it looks overall i mean to me this is what a 2.5 out of 2.5 looks like it's covered in trichomes it's covered in hairs the hairs offset the buds so nicely you see the light green mixed with the dark green just beautiful beautiful looking stuff here and this is going to be a 2.5 for me it's a no-brainer we're not even close to a 2.0 it's a 2.5 now let's get to the smell for me i'm just gonna be honest here i don't really like the smell out of the jar it's just it's like if you had some merch or like some grassy bud or it was hay that had a little bit of floral flavor um you know i'm going to admit when i ground it up that flavor did improve a lot it was like a nice floral just a sweet floral flavor typically you know when you don't have a good smell out of the jar like the smell has to really knock me out to get a 1.5 um you know after that and i don't think this really knocked me out or wowed me this was like smelled like dosie dough um generic kind of dosey dough too um it's really it's between a one and a one and a half in all honesty but because the smell was pretty good like it was almost there you know a 67 i don't think you know so you guys know a 1.5 out of 2.5 is like a 67 a one would be like a 40 out of a hundred i think this is closer to the 67 in all honesty so i'm gonna hand it to him in the smell department now let's get to the taste the taste of this stuff fell short it really did i mean that that third rip was probably the best rip that i had like the second really full one um it was that subtle floral flavor but boy did it die quick and this flavor fell flat on its face and it just it honestly it just wasn't an enjoyable smoke like going into the vaporizer and getting all of the flavors of this combined like that just hay type flavor came in towards the back end and it just was like wow that was just that was you know it smelled like peanut butters it smelled peanut butter and it was kind of nutty on the end but like that nutty was it did not shine i was at a one and a half but honestly this stuff is closer to a one and so you guys know this stuff was smooth it was unbelievably smooth it was unbelievably smooth i'm not gonna say it wasn't smooth but i think from a taste perspective this stuff is only a one for me it's just it's not a 1.5 it's a one um now let's get it just because it again it wasn't enjoyable for me um there's a lot of work to be done it was closer to that 40 than the 67 so um come to your own conclusions there you guys uh the potency let's talk about the potency first of all this is a creeper there's no question at all i mean i didn't think i was having any effects at all until it's kind of leveled in and i've kind of settled into this a light little pressure on the back of my head i actually do feel okay i don't feel really like good good like ultra medicated or like good medicated but i feel lightly medicated like i had like uh you know they have like bud light and you know uh just bud full you know this is like the light of weed for me um and i i i i don't know it's between a one and a half and a two but in all honesty i i can't give them the two in this department it's a 1.5 it is very minded and focused so like you could do anything you need to do during the day your body will be a little bit chilled out you'll feel a little bit of um you know just like medicated in your mind but no overall like crazy effects from this one and it's only going to get a 1.5 in the potency you guys which for me that was what it needed to get to the level it's going to be a 2.5 for me on the um i'm sorry it's gonna be a 2.5 in the looks a 1.5 in the smell a 1.0 in the taste and a 1.5 in the potency it's going to be a 6.5 for me you guys this is not going to get our recommendation it was so close you know it needed a 7.0 or above so like would i go back and purchase this again i don't need to answer that question even though i paid 35 for this um and it was 15 off truthfully it's probably priced about right where it's at i mean for 35 this is not bad medicine and it's ultra clean medicine that is one thing i will tell you and i'm really excited about g3 because i could tell they're working hard to produce great buds i mean listen you guys you're paying 50 bucks for you know uh a bunch of small little nugs that look like this a potent planet you know other companies that are out there that are giving you small little nugs green gene genetics is given nugs like this you know so i i it's it's a shame that this didn't cut it with green gene genetics but a 6.5 is what this stuff is you guys um let me know have you tried the peanut butter breath by green gene genetics let me know in the comments below do you think i'm being fair and then let me know what you guys want to see me review as well but until the next one you guys take care of yourselves and one another and i look forward to seeing you guys soon peace", "DMN8AXKxiws": "[ __ ] you Thunder you can suck my dick you can't get me thunder cuz he just God's farts welcome to [ __ ] back you two back

is going to be another wax review and I'm gonna be honest with you I actually tried to do this yesterday by his left the lens zoom din so you basically just see like no none of my eyes just my nose down and I don't know it was a good video - off speaking on some [ __ ] [ __ ] since topics and stuff but before I start this video it is December 8th and I'd like to say rest in peace the juice world I wasn't the biggest fan of him by like some of his music and 21 is still very young to go especially with like seizures and [ __ ] so yeah man rest in peace other than that we're gonna start this review video if you couldn't tell from the title it is peanut butter breath and it is from Ursa and I like to mention that the only reason I picked this up is because I have a friend Stevie who's very much into this strange so I've basically got it to make him jealous and to also let him know that there is the selection there that if he chooses to go and get it if he knows I believe there was $24.00 out the door for a gram and it's running at about 74 percent THC I also like to mention that RJ is also his voice is coming through the TV so you might hear like an echo of me or him and also we're gonna be blogging today in SF so it should be a good one and RJ's gonna be vlogging it with this new camera so it's gonna be dope other than that let's start with this video Oh before we start and you just get some tea no I'm going yeah opening this show you what it looks like yeah very very good stuff and you know I've already tried this next scenario in the video but once you open this you can smell it like some waxes you can't really like once you open it doesn't smell like it's like a like a jar of wheat what's your opening you smell it's crazy [Music] let's say anything to the peoples RJ not today we're not uploading it today it's happening today we're filming it today well doesn't mean I'm uploading it today what the hell that mean I have to come home early start editing once I get home which I'm not trying to do right here good stuff and I will be hitting it out of the utili 5 I know some of you expressed some distaste for me always using the utility you got to realize this is the only thing I could hit it out and if I am not using what you like then just click off the video because like there's other we tubers that smoke out of rigs and bonds and stuff you know and if I don't have that kind of content for you don't click it and if it upsets you don't watch you know people seem to get upset when they watch my videos but there's an option to always not watch you know a Smith like I don't know it's up to you and for the most of you guys you don't really care what I'm smoking up you just care about the video in general and what what's being said in it you know I'm saying and you know if I don't have those type of videos for you I mean there's plenty of other we tubers you know when you hit hockey no just mean yourself so he's gonna play a song and mute himself I'm still gonna be continuing on on this review the tastes very similar to that of the og types of raw garden I'm very very much loving the consistency of the wax very proportionate amount of diamonds to sauce which makes it all the more pleasant you know sometimes raw guards and be having like a fat diamond in there and just like some sauce but this is more like evenly proportioned you can tell right here you got some toss toss you got some sauce mixed in with some of that diamonds you just call it boss now huh da sauce but yeah hopefully it's been a alright video so far and uh you know I I'd hate to start it on it on it down no you know like juice world passing away but uh man that sucks rest in peace man let me take it out hit another get fully charged pen for today so and I got two batteries for my camera now so like I have more but like I'm only gonna bring two that's enough so we're definitely gonna have a lot of footage for you guys and honestly the most exciting part is probably using Randy's new camera I want to see what it looks like you know I'm glad I want to say that for those of you who are interested in what camera he is actually using it as a cam it Canon m50 and it was cost a pretty penny I'll tell you that Cheers mother and that the taste is there very very good I would recommend it very very very similar price to that wall garden so if you're tired of raw garden and you want to try another brand check out Ursa definitely another good substitute if raw garden isn't there or any other brands of wax that you haven't sure that you like it but it isn't there try it it's not bad other than that hopefully you guys enjoyed the video [Music] [Music] you", "xU1y9mX6jio": "here we go what's good YouTube welcome to another live stream can already take a few dabs and hang out it's just got done prepping for another hash wash damn it getting cold in here too because of that I might have to go grab my jacket but um yeah got the AC cranked to 62 degrees that the ice-cold water in the reservoir I've got a bag of ice for the washer and I've got six more bags ice out in the freezer I need to get a bigger freezer and all the materials well so later tonight after I get the kids down spend some time with the wife I'm gonna come back out here and knock out that bubble hash run uninterrupted probably gonna do somewhere between six to eight runs on it depending on how it looks and how everything is coming out [Music] anyways let's go ahead and get a - go in here I hope you guys are having a good day [Music] that was not clickbait by the way for those of you this joint this is a 104 grant or 100 Ford's a hundred grams now mixed strain hash frothing some cookies some sweet cream some zukie and what else sweet cream cookie sweet cream zoo keys and orange cookies that's what it is [Music] sorry I had someone from work pop-up I don't look out real quick [Music] all right cool [Music] anyways let's go ahead oh it's so good yeah I need to go ahead and fill up a little bit char with that [Music] this was some 60 micron parabola for edibles [Music] this one still has a cush cake in it and this one has on a fish cake so those that's my head - cooks cake in a jar [Music] earth is [ __ ] cold and her alright so I would like you yet in my day did you imagine dabbing that whole thing just like here we feel [ __ ] half the Banger ease and the easily I wouldn't even try it it'd be a waste and a half that's good enough for me enjoy that for the week [Music] the 160 press was man very little in there so that's what that looks like when I end up putting it in the jar and then a lot of people would ask me how did you get that [ __ ] rossington to stick to the bottom of the jar look so neat [Music] here's I take the glove and you're just going to push it down around the edges towards the center you're doing a cold room that's good rosin a clean glove and just like that now it looks like that [Music] with that's hard to see but yeah that's how that comes out when you end up doing that push it down it comes out real nice and clean looking perfect for grams or so it's upload a bird [Music] all right so I gotta move my dad station over now I'm not pressing it back over here well I like it Kiyo is : grab yeah you can do with parchment - I have a little bit more control with the glove I feel like and it rarely gets sticky but parchment works to a more sticky stuff I will use parchment I'm gonna go grab a hoodie real quick [Music] [Music] whoa [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] whoo my tears my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] oh man the big dads always get my nose my eyes [Music] Oh [Music] about three days away from the harvest yeah we're on day 54 honestly I think I could pull them down tomorrow or the next day I want it probably gonna go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] today's Thursday tomorrow's Friday yep I'm go ahead and harvest them on Monday [Music] five six out of the gate 58 [Music] [Music] I got some pictures of the plants I haven't even posted to Instagram yet pausing to share them with you guys real quick [Music] [Music] turn down the lights already this whole side is just [ __ ] Mileena should be up here these ones dried back a little bit too much almost too much but not too two months still prosti of [ __ ] 12 cars black out there my Spade going over there [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so that's the current status in the Guardian you know just like oh my flesh for usually you're about seven days it's that but you know [Music] I had issues this run just like Ross Leafs his issues because he's in cocoa they're harder to detect early and so he faced the consequences of the buffering that cal-mag provides in coma cocoa I wasn't in at nursery iam so I was able to turn my issues around a little bit faster but you know basically what I'm saying is you know I had issues this run and the crop is still coming out pretty good so next run you know those issues will be corrected I'll make a video covering the issues that I ran into this grow and how I plan to correct them and I'll throw it up on the patreon hopefully you guys can learn from some of my mistakes you know I talked about on the show doing your own research and shape one of the things I researched if I should have used top-down broward rivers and when I talked to mango tech Abadi he told me to use two gallons per hours to avoid clog and that's what each use is but then I ended up getting water channeling that is too fast on the float and I cost a lot of issues I never really fed high enough of an ECE to have the easy build up nor did I ever push the plants that hard to cause them to have any lockouts it was all because my irrigation was wrong from the get-go with the water swim [Music] are you taking off right now that's one of the changes I'm implementing is not only am I going to get rid of the 2 gallon per hour but I'm going to go all the way down to like a point 3 gallon per hour dripper that could eat drawstring and stuff up here so yeah that'll fix a lot of issues right off to that that I believe uh Charles and pastor [Music] that Daffy got me hired balls rolling in on me now [Music] oh my bad I look here looking up and showers my phone [Music] there's no broad my issues going on in here all it is is either a they were different cuts or they were microclimates right he talked about the water channeling so you know phosphorus deficiency can learn to purpling stems and the plants that express themselves differently also has purple stems where I was the ones that didn't have the red bugs didn't have purple stems so I think it was more of a microclimate issue water channeling issue causing different uptake different nutrients and it just got exacerbated due to the lockout because of the water channeling so next one I'm doing is with wedding cake and I should be getting those clones in about two weeks so I have about two weeks to prep get the plants chopped harvested and everything I'll flip them right in the room that they're in right now I'm basically going to push the tables to one side of the room and then I'll go in and use a light rail for this up against the wall and I'll cut down on the one plant out of time and hang it on a trellis hanging from the ceiling and then I'll just hang all the plants from one light all right [Music] when my moustache hairs on the know it wouldn't happen I got trim my mustache geez so yeah basically just go one light at a time right down hole lights worth of plants hang them go to the next one cut those down hang out on a different trailer that's there the next one so I'll have three trellis nets hanging on the side of the room I'll have to retry this netting on that side of the room so after I cut down the whole left side of the room and those plants are hanging up there on that left side I'm going to disassemble the tables and walk them out of the room and then I can push that whole other table completely over to the middle of the room hang up all those buttons on the back side of the room or wherever in the room right and then basically I'll be good to go I'll get everything hung I'll turn off the shaker fan I'll just keep one of them on probably maybe turn it down to low or something and I'll just have to DEET you and AC going in there I'll be able to scrub down the you the four by twelve that's in there now scrub it down and get it reset and start making my adjustments to the room while I wait on my new 4 by 12 American Girl products they're probably they told me it was going to be issued early June like June 8th or 6 but they might be able to get it in sooner so I mean worst case scenario the room will be down for about three weeks while I wait on the new table but I'll just match all the plants on one table while I'm doing that perfect and then when I get my new table in I'll be able to go ahead and transition the plants over throw up my trellis mats and pretty much switch so you know that's the plan and like I said I'll document all the changes to the room it said of everything that I'd be like want to document the changes and yeah my keeper fee no cuts from honest genetics should be here in the next two to three weeks and solved a whole room full of wedding cake in there veg and flour that while I have a child my keeper he knows from our genetics and my new keeper you know caked up cherries wedding cake crossed with cherry something f3 I'm going to do the three-tiered setup but I'm waiting on him to send me the updated invoice for the new poles and as soon as I get those I'll be able to set it up and I'll have pretty much what I was thinking of doing them what happened to rekey poofy nose and I could basically put all of them on their own tier if I wanted and then have clones next to it or I could just put all the moms on one and then since I'm doing two tables at a time I'll just pick you know I'll have two tiers for clothes you know cherry cookies have three thank you thank you thank you I never remember like my keeper he knows from honest I don't remember what I was are either blue hurricane 27 crossed with white sunrise for the blue lion keeper and then scarlet sure is chocolate frosting crossed with something I think [Music] I trust my man on his genetics he tells me yo this is a [ __ ] you should run for a hash let's fire fire fire legs all right now you got it [Music] like I remembered it enough to purchase it and you know that's all that matters now that's all that matters now I need to show up in the garden [Music] so stoked I have I'll have the blue Hawaiian which is gonna have exotic super crazy unique blue Terps it's gonna be highly sativa dominant as far as the high goes and then the truck not the truck cherry but the cakes of cherries that's gonna be my cherry Fino right there so I'll have a blue of a cherry and then I have the gassy out of scarlet shirt so it's gonna be dope [Music] this is real the kind of light that I use for clowns are right behind either the raging raging kales and I actually got sponsored by science LED yeah so I will be getting now raging candle LEDs probably twice a year during two biggest ways that I do and it couldn't be [ __ ] dope it can really know and then every other month or so I'll be giving away a bunch of science LED swag hats ashtrays shirts things like that all be put on there grower spotlight on their homepage pretty shortly here I have some pictures that I have to take for them and type up some some information and what else asked me to leave to help them do research spectrum tuning and hash production so I'll be doing that so and then also the big thing I'll be an authorized reseller for their lights on my webpage as soon as it's up in a few days so as soon as the page is up I'm going to try and get them on there and I'll be able to resell a life through my page so that way you know they don't do they don't do coupon codes like people in the industry you got to use to coupon codes because of for flex and all that but what that does is it makes it so that you can't sell that product in brick-and-mortar stores anymore and in the hydro industry almost need brick-and-mortar stores still surprisingly to you know expand and survive because still a big commercial facilities go through these hydro stores and you know direct to these manufacturers a lot so they don't do coupon codes they're like let's say they offer a 10% discount code here in California right and somebody purchases a light from you know from me and using my promo code but they're in Oregon or something and or somewhere else where they maybe don't charge sales tax and now not only are they getting the 10% off but they're also getting like seven or eight maybe taking even up to 10% off of that because of no sales tax right whereas if they were to purchase it in the store you know the store would be able to make a profit but in order to compete with that price that they would get you know from using the coupon code the brick-and-mortar store would basically have to not turn a profit so it doesn't work out for them to be able to give people who coupon codes stacked as representatives of the brand so instead I'll be able to be a reseller and then just a very very small portion of the profit that they would make from that light will go towards me instead so I'll be an authorized reseller and then basically helping do research and you know passing that information you guys like I have been this whole time so anyways this is what we're working with they bought this is delicious delicious it's called cookie dough and it's amazing [Music] I don't suspect this is gonna last long you won't need a code to let them know who sent you because you're gonna go through my website to purchase they're working on other programs like referral codes and things like that but [Music] yeah I guess I should keep this on camera so people don't think that I'm like lying and I say I got a grandfather drive here we did well today it's real I wouldn't had a couple more but honestly you guys want to get jars of the grape Cosby and literally all I have left of this [Music] that's it but in this drawer it's maybe maybe seven grams six seven grams of the grape Cosby I think the other jars been scraped empty already yeah scraped empty great cause be gone on that one and then the hell a Koosh cake [Music] there's like maybe two to three grams to scrape out of here [Music] and this one I think is scraped completely empty yeah there's maybe like point two in here it's empty so there was 70 72 grams of the La Push cake and 60 grams of the Cosby [Music] but every time you come in here you [ __ ] promotin be real oh no no no who was it last time it wasn't beaver oh it was your boy the other one that's not good Bernhard that's who it was last time [Music] about your ass sorry yo for real alright here's the funny story that's how you guys are quick so the reason this one got called rape Cosby because [Music] my wife and I dabbed it and she got so [ __ ] high off of it it was like she got roofied like straight roofie I could have done anything I wanted to so I was like mother kali shake great cosby it tastes like grapes and knocks you the [ __ ] out like you did this it was between grape Cosby and roofie colada you know think of work 12 but you guys got to make sure you do it right [Music] it's great cause be like that lowercase G Capital are [Music] all right let's get [Music] a little credit given to me I need a label hood [Music] it's not for grams but whatever [Music] you know [Music] so we're gonna get some cookie dough on there a menace [Music] they push tape on there [Music] [Music] [Music] me up a man popular science [Music] my episode 5 right there alone [Music] [Music] there was a five [Music] [ __ ] bones knock out maybe this is episode [Music] all right hold on okay [Music] but right now it is [Music] but few days that idiot that ain't the one all right well [ __ ] it I'll get it uploaded I was trying to do it right now but I'm having a little bit of a hard time finding a you write for [Music] oh here it is [Music] [Music] that's not it either I have like a lot of different files in here that I have to go through [Music] that's three lighting maybe this is the right here number four [Music] okay yeah here it is and as this little my everybody [Music] alright I'll go ahead and get this uploaded to YouTube right you know [Music] I'm kind of done editing these I'm just gonna start uploading the RAW files and if people don't like it they can kiss my ass I don't have time to edit them together anymore that's why I put the PowerPoint how I did you know if I do the PowerPoint I don't have to worry about putting an intro and all that into the video it's just boom okay boss [Music] alright crap dude my science for plant nutrition are a cool description I'll edit that later now don't care playlist crafted science done no it's not made for kids don't have to restrict [Music] monetization please do [Music] public [Music] boom what is instant premiere oh [ __ ] we could watch it together at the same [ __ ] time let's [ __ ] do that right now I did not know we could do that that is really cool we can watch the video together yeah three minutes five all right it's 321 I'm gonna go in at 3:45 and help the wife for the day because that's the way it is [Music] I find on finishing of the loose jars oh that's the one section of illustrator [Music] this is it makes a great Cosby and Kush cake [Music] I don't know what I did mother two minutes [Music] okay a little poison for 30 minutes okay no accident since a wait okay I'll be in by say like 3:45 okay okay [Music] 59 seconds left [Music] very good dogs very good slowly giving them a little bit more freedom and hoping that they don't [ __ ] pee anywhere [Music] green jeans with Superdome [Music] Greenjeans was sooo Oberto 11 seconds 8 seconds that's called your video will premiere what's uploading and processing finished as well as the hundred percent uploaded is 95 percent process I have no idea how this is going to look for you guys I don't know how this works I've never done this before it is [ __ ] top-down so we're gonna check it out oh my god dollars people my DM right now [Music] all right you guys let me know what happens on your end when this is done hopefully I mean it doesn't take forever right now it's an remember you two processes videos one definition at a time so the low definition stuff is going to process and then like for whatever and then 720 and 1080 [Music] my phone right now it's just doing the load F [ __ ] the standard definition version we'll see whatever the [ __ ] back [Music] I'm really curious to see what this does though man that was such a good [ __ ] good [ __ ] episode and then episode 5 I'm glad we took a break because we were really [ __ ] burned out both of us and we needed a skip a week we came back and we didn't even have a PowerPoint or anything but it was still an amazing discussion Garrett jumped online from science at levy and he just [ __ ] to talk about what we wanted to talk about which was great just you know [Music] we just talked about troubleshooting it was [ __ ] awesome you know he get his perspective on things like walking into like a huge commercial facility and how you would troubleshoot their [ __ ] to figure out what's going on why certain part of the crop might not be doing its good versus another part things like that so it was really cool to get his perspective because you know as far as lost leaf goes he's a commercial facility but he's a one-man army and it's a small commercial facility it's the size of a house basically a one-story house and so and that's that's no diss whatsoever [ __ ] it's amazing what he's doing I wish I could be at his level but in the realm of commercial grows it's relatively small so you know his perspective is one and then Maya the home grower is another and then Gary brings a whole different perspective being that he's kind of more on the large large scale commercial and so it was really cool you know and go with it so unfortunately during this whole Cove 8:19 thing all of the HD recordings for webinars are being limited and only being allowed standard definition so this is not going to be best of qualities for the uploads that are going on right now from the webinars and there's nothing that we can do about that so you know [Music] check it on the patreon real quick make sure you guys got your post real quick [Music] are you guys waiting on me to take another dab is that what's going on [Music] I guess [Music] it's not what you guys I feel like a little [ __ ] a dab [ __ ] for you guys it's all you guys wanna take your dad show me his plan it's never hey SB Andy how's your day go what'd you do today need some help no I'm just [ __ ] one shot

__ ] I I guess I Cosby myself whoever said don't cause be yourself I can't be myself go clean it out real easy paper towels to clean [Laughter] [Music] yeah all of the rapidly science episodes go on patreon pretty much the same day or minimum a week earlier than YouTube a minimum and Matt doesn't post on lost leaf as a poster or anything like that out of respect for my patreon supporters he knows he waits again he's a week two to three weeks even suppose I mean it's not that I don't want the information out there for everybody but I wanted to I want to give some [ __ ] love to the people on patreon and economic access all that and they can pick my brain talk about it on live sessions or whatever brain different [ __ ] you know [Music] all right the tip of my II now is 395 and I need to

[Music] so the reclaim catcher works by basically a when you draw on the dab it gets stuck down here because all that reclaimed can't travel back up pretty much so what you end up with really is just tiny tiny pieces of the vapor that condensed back to rosin in here versus a shit-ton of replaying and if you have a really good deep-dish banger and you do low temp doubts your your reclaim actually can look really nice how well that looks but [Music] seeing us a thing FPV not everybody's email setup is the same not all coils are created equal so you got to get you know a good coil setup with

know influences in the world I was repping biscotti so hard I almost named and Scott Storch is my witness the big pescado biscotti like literally almost named to my album biscotti and I rapped about it in so many songs and trust me I really campaigned hard Frodo's and on transe is this without getting into too much detail this doesn't even matter I'm in a good point in my life if I put in all that work and all that effort to hand select to name to blow this [ __ ] up globally everybody knows about biscotti because of me and I'm not no longer participating in that and I can't grow myself and I have it and I can't use the names for anything then why would I [ __ ] with it why would I smoke it and it's nothing personal to the group hey man do you guys do your thing it's just what I mow and people have to respect it because I'm not putting in work to that I don't benefit off I've been I've been grinding for too long in a Wii game is the Wii game and business is business and like I said no disrespect to them boys do your thing mate flex on them as much as you can but I ain't [ __ ] with it now with that being said Gary Payton serial mo yeah chopped liver the floor London cello cheetah piss a whole nother right about to hit the market a whole new flavor profile everything from mints which is you know by sea junkie shot to see junkie from the runts crew yeah from grandiflora some powers up from cookies big menus coming new flavor profiles coming all work is all worked a new work that's the new work so the same way we ran it up you don't run it up again cookies now one more thing purple punch look no disrespect to the breeders a purple punch to the growers of purple punch what's going on in California right now is a bunch of people are growing it they're packaging it on the REC market and then renaming it a hundred different things and after buying 15 different styles of weed named all kind of names and all being a purple punch it was played out to me I said but punches so Blanc you can have it now some of my friends go purple punch some of my friends actually bred purple punch no disrespect to you but do we get got somebody I see Packers up 30 different ways mm-hmm keep it", "1PwwKxUL0AA": "all right welcome back everybody purpose of this video is to try to teach people how to determine female seeds for male seeds okay if you have feminized seeds they're female don't even try this okay so this is this what I learned a long long time ago I wouldn't say it's exactly 100% because it's up to you know your own discretion so there's a lot of human interference in there but it's about 90 95 percent accurate if you actually are really like really a you know quality controlled about I was gonna say anal whatever but you know if you're really anal about it and you really really really only go for strict strict looks then you can pull it off 100% okay but this is what I come up with okay the female seeds look look a lot like this okay and if you see these seeds here see how they have like a little top to them okay now if you were look to look on this top you'll see a perfect circle where's my camera okay you'll see perfect circles it kind of looks like a little volcano maybe something like that oh look what I just found out guys so my cameras over here but when I put things over here it gets blurry when I put things over here they become clear oh you look nice I can work see how blurry though we did just remember that when you guys are trying to show stuff you put it right in front of you camera is blurry if you put it over there look how clear so so that's a perfect circle in there and it's like the volcano shape okay so you want to look for on the top of the seeds you want it to have like a little Ridge it doesn't have to be that defined these are pictures so you completely understand what I'm talking about okay they're a little over exaggerated so you're gonna see a little bit of a climb with in the middle will be a perfect circle okay and that's where actually the seed attaches to the actual button okay so you can see the top of the seeds it's the round piece and then you'll have you know the the sides of the little volcano that you'll be able to see from the top it'll look like you know you know it look like puckering up and then you have a complete perfect circle in the center and then from the side you see will look something like this okay the male seeds have a smaller Ridge or no Ridge at all okay do not confuse male seeds with immature seeds okay these are immature seeds they're super flat on the top but you can tell they have not grown yet okay those are immature seeds okay they have not completely formed do not confuse this with a male seed okay now mind you this probably would have formed into a male seed although it is not fully matured yet but this is how a male seed will look see how it has a kind of slight bump to it okay let's go to a male seed okay see how it's got slightly kind of inclined raised okay see it but it's flat it is flat it looks like a but okay and there is a circle in there but the circle will not be perfect it will not be centered perfectly normally and it will be flat looking and look kind of like you know it'll be like that you have a circle and there will be a weird thing around it and they look like little bloodshot lines spitting out of it and they'll look like these seats here these are 100% sure for sure mail seeds okay no doubt in my mind so this is just the easy way and I went through a whole bunch of different seeds to find males from females but um it's just an easy way if you're going through stuff like this and you want to find female and male seeds okay yeah yeah yeah that's a lot of seeds I got a couple of these okay I'm sure all you do to these right here people these are all skunk baby all skunk you see there's some immature ones in there blah blah blah whatever but yeah that's what these are so I hope this helps you guys you can determine your seeds a lot faster before you ever stick them in the dirt okay so try this technique out you know give me feedback see if it works for you works for me I know mother nature it also does this way works for her that's how we do it you know and like I said it's all up to human discretion you know you might look at you might look at a seed and say on all about by what he was saying that that might be a male but that's a female female seed perfectly round circle with the but you know the volcano look to it okay male seed are me female seed pardon me okay that's how we do it see that male seed see that you can see the volcano to it but look how flat it is okay male seed so I hope this guys this helps you guys I just thought I'd make this real quick while I was doing the harvest I forgot I had told somebody I was gonna make this for them so hopefully they watch this and you know pick up a future a few tricks are just bit my tongue so now I'm gonna get back to harvesting people so have a good evening", "UJMcueXzl4Q": "yo yo yo what's good youtube welcome back to another live stream getting ready to go ahead and press out that mendo breath that i watched the

gorgeous absolutely go just hamburg i can't wait for you to be able to dab bro you guys believe this [ __ ] hambone ain't even going to be able to try this [ __ ] can't have some [ __ ] straight [ __ ] you ask me it's my tradition to get the [ __ ] cultivator high as [ __ ] higher than he's ever been on his stuff before i like to do it i'm not i can't do it to him can't happen but nine to five soon though soon though i'm about to find out right now on the returns did you get my my instagram message right now about the hash return about 120 grams i think we could get another 40 grams out of it on the next run but it's [ __ ] really good high quality [ __ ] like really high i knew from the moment that i pulled it out of the freeze dryer and started sifting it that it was going to be a good yielding press because um the density of the trichome was unreal i had 30 grams in one bag if i ever hit 30 grams in one bag that that right there tells me that those trichomes are dense as [ __ ] because on average i'll hit 20 22 grams right 25 on the high end and then anything over 25 and those trichomes are just [ __ ] solid sand and um you guys want to see a golden vagina i do look at that golden vajayjay a little beat up missing an ovary but you know so um yeah man as soon as i started bagging it and i felt how heavy and dense those trichomes were in my hand in the back i was like yeah this is this is it and then as soon as i weighed the bags out and i saw one of them was 30 and the others were you know 26 and they were only three quarters of the way full um very very easily you could have fit quite a bit more in there so you know let's my early yield without even seeing it just yet altogether i'm gonna guess we're at 100 grams on a return that's just my guess my raw yes at this point in time looking at the jar and just kind of what's here we'll see i haven't had anything yield quite like the runs yet except for the frost factory and the dessert a while ago those things [ __ ] dumped the runts did hit 20 uh 21 percent which was pretty good but back in the day the frost factory and the g6 were getting 25 on the watch which was just [ __ ] ridiculous it was just a big bag of frost it was like i didn't even need to wash it i could have just shook the bag out it was crazy but this [ __ ] quality is great this quality is the same as the runts which is saying a lot you guys because i've never given any collab um that much credit before on their grow to be able to produce a quality as as good as my single source like i'm not arrogant but i do take pride in my work so to be working with another cultivator that's putting out work just as good as my own i don't have to worry about the quality you know what i'm saying it's just crazy crazy awesome to know like i truly don't have to worry about it you know what i'm saying because as a as a processor i kid you not i've run across all types of people in this industry there's very very very few people that can like truly be transparent about everything that they do and still maintain their integrity and you know what i'm saying so it's like he's super transparent with his grows i know what's gone into him i know what hasn't gone into them more importantly and i can trust his word when he says that they haven't been sprayed or they don't have any you know this that or the other whereas other growers i've had tell me that i come back home and i process their [ __ ] you know and lo and behold the hash never lies i don't know if you guys have been into hash long but that's been a saying that i've known since i got into this game the hash never lies all these other vho and all that other [ __ ] it covers up whatever you did wrong during the grow but when you run bubble hash real clean like the truth comes out so it's really nice to not get back here and start processing something to find out that it had been you know covered in [ __ ] oils during the grow and all types of other [ __ ] so let's see [Music] i replaced the filters on my hepa filter from iq air today like 350 bucks to get all three filters i got a pre pre-filter a pre-filter and then the hepa filter i put them all in today brand new and oh my god that [ __ ] is going [ __ ] the air on the ground around it started getting sucked up and it started filtering everything man it was [ __ ] nice see that [ __ ] current so strong on there [Music] oh i got to take a picture of that for handy bone hammer bone oh my god jeez in my bones juice in my pants oh boy you guys are not going to want to miss this if you know how to tap in i suggest you guys tap in now i'm going to go ahead and give this the insta oh my [ __ ] god i just pulled back the top layer on this and eminem y'all aren't gonna want to miss it all right let's get some of that down in there though set this down now we're going to clean the spoon on this side y'all already know we have to i'm going to get everything i can off of this big dab tool real quick on this end using my smaller dab tool and then i'm going to do something that i don't usually do which i don't usually go straight in for the stir but i'm trying something a little different decent amount of little rosin on here we'll be taking a test dab here in a second now i'm gonna see if i can't get my long end all the way down into this to do a little stirring stir [Music] y'all want to see this goody goody gumdrop my [ __ ] goodness holler at your hatch man unreal this won't even last a week guaranteed this won't last 24 hours i am i i'm putting everything on that this is gone gone gone i already know it the heat this is not three weeks worth of dabs for anybody this isn't gone from me smoking it not for me sharing it ain't nobody in there no nobody's smoking this in a week come on now not unless you're rolling it up in a [ __ ] giant blunts and giving them out for free look at that chunk in there that big old juicy thc chunk oh get your song who's your hash man mm-hmm oh boy packing a meal i'm all yeah yeah this is stupid i think i found my new favorite temperature hey baby um yeah but i'm just wrapping up i'll be done in about five well come here give me what's up y'all see it in there just chunks 207 on the 10th trying to incorporate all this stuff on the side to this nice jello pudding apple [ __ ] sauce son you hear that wet wet gushing around in there so so got it at four percent oh how does that always happen like this is just dumb diddly dumb stupid dumb dumb diddly dum dum dum stupid make your video real quick sir [Laughter] bro it's it's just dumb just dumb dumb bro this is like honestly the best collab work that i've had hands down this is easily on par with my single source and this is terpier than the ruts came out yeah at least from the stir it's it was just straight boulders underneath there that's how i always get it to come off the plates though it always comes off like that where i the i get chunks that just develop and it's awesome because when i go pack them into jars people go through and they're like [ __ ] i hit something hard in the jar and they're like oh [ __ ] it's [ __ ] bolder oh dude it's it's like peanut butter consistency but it looks like applesauce with pieces of apple in it yeah yeah yeah so i'm gonna go ahead i gave it this stir right now i'm actually still on the live i'm gonna go ahead and um oh you're good don't matter about to take that dab right now son [Laughter] that is [ __ ] hilarious bro that's awesome so that's what i said what's up telling the other anthony hell yeah that's what's up all right bro later that was [ __ ] hambone she said he [ __ ] pulled over on the side of the road he parked in the red zone and he's smoking a [ __ ] cbd joint watching them watching the live like what the [ __ ] homie is wild movie is straight wild isn't she hold on let me just show you what i took pictures of real quick since you can't see on the gopro too well see that's a thc boulder down there in that cave and there's another one right there look see it little thc boulder down there oh oh oh that's planned this is so [ __ ] good let's see how much we got [Music] oh boy the jar is 180 ladies and gentlemen 180. you ready what we got god damn you mean to tell me i got 103. 122. what's what's the calculator say about that 103 divided by 122. that [ __ ] says 84 you son let's just say 84 [ __ ] percent son that's the second time in a row hitting 84 percent on the press overall holla at me let's [ __ ] go hambone who are you bringing the rest of your [ __ ] to that's right i'm feeling myself today and that's a okay let me just tell them real quick let me just tell them fire son goodness turn this off now no deep fries thank you [Music] i'm having to go all the way

hash into 103 grams of rosin my goodness that's a dab of [ __ ] roni for real son i'm not even gonna front this dab is like a whole gram i'm not even [ __ ] sure i should do this [ __ ] me oh my goodness let's go let's go live let's go live on instagram real quick let me just throw the phone on the tripod real fast and go live just for a second don't worry you guys are going to see this too

breath it'll make this runs last a little bit longer 73 is full melt best for pressing george that comment is so wrong i'm not even going to address it any further anyways you guys have fun the rest of your day i appreciate you guys", "o7yToj8NgbU": "yes i am going to be pressing two strains of flour today picked them up at the healing center in monroeville big shout out to them and what we have today are some really nice strains i hope they press out really well we're going to find out because we're pressing 180. first one we're going to press is the cresco this is the pineapple express ringing in at 30 percent it has been rehydrated with hydrostones i'll take those out now and we shall get this ready to press hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there if you are a medical marijuana patient the pittsburgh area and you would like to have your dispensary flower pressed into rosin i do that for free for patients right here in penn hills at asher's finest rosin world headquarters it's been a long day folks i am so glad to finally be getting down to getting some pressing done uh so that's that's it that's our quarter and let me see that these new uh press bags okay those are not the right size all right here we go i do believe that that should handle i could have sworn i got three different sizes nope just two okay because here's the size difference from a seven gram bag right there so let me see if this more suitable now this is what happens when you go live stuff happens and not everything is perfect those are the wow i am just having a heck of a day today it has been pouring down rain almost the entire day today okay so that's the one closest matches the size and so these are made by gutenberg's tank pressing and they they had those custom made to emulate as close as possible a nug smasher seven gram bag and i think they got it down pretty good but let's take a look and see how these hold up under the press my crd 30 ton rosin press so there's 120 micron bag we're pressing at 180 degrees uh this is the i haven't pressed pineapple express from cresco in probably two years so we shall see what it's going to do hopefully it's going to press out well at 30 percent i'm really hoping it will but you know as well as i do sometimes the thc level does not equate to a larger yield if the plant doesn't have the right wax and lipid profile so just trying to let you know what happens in the real world we're either going to get a really good result or not and we'll see what the quality of this flower is for the price i really hope it's good because quite frankly it i've gotten surprised by some of the flower lately that should have been good producers and were not but i give everyone their chance i try not to pre-judge anything uh this is really really sticky uh especially now that it's been rehydrated which is a good sign this all tucked down in here nice and tight and we're gonna get it all folded up here and we're gonna move the lights and put it on the plates and see what she's got for us hope she gushes that would be super nice get a really nice happy happy squish out of this we shall see this is video one of the two video series today pressing dispensary flower pennsylvania medical flower from our local wonderful dispensary here the healing center in monroeville i'm gonna move the camera now move it into a better angle for you to see what's going on okay let's let's get this here blow there we go put you right in here and focus is right there all right let's start dropping the hammer on this and see what she's gonna do like i said if you're a pittsburgh area medical marijuana patient you have dispensary flour you want to press bring it over to penn hills that's where i live real easy to get a hold of if you hit me on a private messenger i give you my address and i will do this for you for free because that's what i do for patients is my outreach helping patients who need better medicine and can't afford dispensary concentrates at the price level so i'm just doing this real gently given that heat because i'm pressing at such a lower temperature than i normally do takes a little longer for that heat to start working its way in there [Music] but i'm hoping on paper it should be a gusher you know 30 that's that's the magic number for the gushers usually but sometimes it'll surprise you you won't get the yield that the uh numbers said you should based on what it's telling you and that again goes to my point this is a variable plant it's always changing and as a result it's kind of hard to get a handle on it sometimes and figuring out what you can and can't do there we go there we go you should be able to see that nice cool here we go drop the pressure more now this is going to disappear from your site okay these plates are very deep and the lights will not penetrate past a certain point so once it gets to that point i'm gonna move the camera back out because i'm gonna need to pay attention to what's going on with it and when i pull those plates back apart you should see something really really nice but that's what's going on in there right now and now come right back out here focus right there keep this thing up to full pressure where i want to be don't want to risk a blowout so we're going gonna really go gently on this especially with a bag that i haven't used before too it's always always something new that gives you that learning curve all right we're gonna let it sit right there and at 180 you can let it sit on the heat a little longer without degrading it at 200 you have to react quickly but you can get amazing results at 200. some strains of 200 degrees though will shatter up on you and turn into ground glass and you definitely don't want that so i dropped my temperature profile to 180 and i am getting slightly smaller yields overall but it's not as much as i anticipated so it ended up being a much more acceptable range than i was thinking and you know so now i'm pressing at 180 this year and if i have to make adjustments next year to see what maybe 190 does or 185 then i'll do that but i'm always trying to to do better each year better quality because i'm a quality over quantity guy every time i promise you that okay so i believe we are almost ready to pull these plates apart and see what she has given us as we showed her respect you know that's the thing you show this plant respect treat it with respect press it well and it gives her soul to you you know that's what it is at least for me that's how i approach it i approach it that this plant has a soul i'm bringing that soul out making better medicine so give me a moment we're about ready to open those plates so i'm going to give you a nice view of that ready to see it let's see it pretty oh yeah i don't know about you that's looking pretty to me huh you liking that because i sure am all right so let me get the camera moved down here so as you can see the goodness and stay tuned for my next video where i'm going to be pressing moxie's viper cookies which is another heavy hitter not over 30 percent but absolutely gorgeous look at how beautiful that came out you can't even believe how it smells you know what i'm saying it is just filling this room with the dankness and i did it i got a tiny little bit of a blowout right there okay so i took it right to the edge and got the most that this flower was able to provide now it's time to find out what our yield is because my my own personal scale that i like to use is i want to see a minimum and that's minimum of a half gram per ounce per eight pressed okay minimum i'd like to get a gram per eight and some strains give me that and most of them don't so let us see what our jar ways i'm gonna back this back off now you can see everything there we go okay i got my scale i'm going to tear my 17 gram jar there we go and taking my tool down see how it picks up i did not put this on the cool plate because it's about 65 degrees in the room and cooling it too fast leads to shattering results i like the way this is picking up is sticking to itself it's very stable didn't crystalize up which i believe the last time i pressed this flower was 200 degrees i do believe i had an issue with it turning into shatter on me if that's him so i'm much much happier with what i'm seeing here right now for sure let's get this stuff off here and into its jar it's your home that's where you want to be other than my lungs look at that look how pretty no it doesn't want to focus but it's got a really beautiful color just gorgeous loving it let's get this stuff up in the jar give you guys a yield well tomorrow starts the weekend if you don't have plans get some dispensary flour if you're in the pittsburgh area come see me i'll have a present sesh love doing pressing sessions right now my wife is not in the house so i am going to be able to have people over and we can hang out got a big screen tv and lots of equipment to dab on so if you're thinking hey i want to go party in a safe secure environment where can i go well you can come see me bring some dispensary flour let's have some let's make some good medicine have a nice session you know the social aspects of medicating are every bit as important as the medicine itself in my opinion so anybody who's just sitting around medicating in isolation that's not really very therapeutic but you get it you get yourself around some other like-minded people have some interesting discussions maybe watch some tv or a movie or stand-up comedian or something that is just as therapeutic to me as hang on just a moment i got a visit all right sorry about that folks let's finish gathering this pineapple express up like i said i don't press a lot of cresco flour because i've had some had some bad results from some of it and i always found them to be kind of higher priced than their quality would seem to indicate but in terms of this pineapple express yeah i'm pretty pretty happy with it all right now we got it all in the jar try to get in the jar and not on my hands so much so that is 18.73 when you take the 17 grams for the jar away that's 1.87 no no it's 1.73 my bad 1.73 that definitely falls within the acceptable range for me so thank you for joining me for this video here's a good look at some really really beautiful rosin this is from made from cresco pineapple express premium buds so thanks for joining me on this video i will be seeing you very soon because i'm going to turn right around reset up and shoot viper cookies so stay tuned folks i'm out of here", "1J_dRK1nz4E": "[Music] yo what's good guys welcome back to another video i know i know i know it's been a minute look i apologize bro i don't

try to get some awesome that my guy on Instagram makes Greg 17 Greg he's got the seventh in between the Greg definitely is gonna count the follow right there i'ma go up in there tried to get some of that rosin and I may get some other things too that you guys like I said we'll see in the future and we'll see what they got alright I got a couple different things here as you can see I've got a couple of pre-rolls I've got a live rosin as well which is one of the main reasons I went by jungle boys I wanted to try their live rosin batter which Greg 7/10 Greg he makes that it makes a lot of it and you can follow him on Instagram with the 7th in between the Greg and that's how I even find him on Instagram an amazing page that guy is just absolutely way ahead of anything in this industry he's more than an expert that's for sure so I had to pick up some of that you got jungle boys full mouth jungle boys rosin jungle boys and jungle boys clothing that's all their pages and of course Greg and I'll mention a couple other ones down in the description for you guys to follow first of all let's look at the prices I we got the joints right here and as you can see there are $12 a piece including the tax so I mean they're lower a dollar cheaper than the joints we got back home and that's here in LA now there bud is a little bit more expensive I have that on another video for you guys if you're buying recreational it's 26 dollars a gram so I just got some pretty rolls right here and I've already actually smoked that Topanga Canyon that was just an amazing experience right there it was like great be I see with like a hint of like almost mint and it was it was really amazing so I already smoked that one and I'm gonna probably smoke the jungle cake in the morning twenty nine percent THC 291 milligrams total their strains are really high like that though they come in and extremely high some of them do now I smoked another one out here the last time though mimosa that was only like 16 percent and it was actually one of the better strains I smoked so twenty-nine percent on that one we also have cookies and cream and this one is coming in at 27 percent 277 milligrams in that 135 percent total cannabinoids Topanga Canyon yeah that one I just smoked was nice 25 percent it's that was like a in akadama net hybrid it was a oh gee Topanga Canyon oh gee really good really good I was like a great be gassy skunky with a hint of mint almost does what I would have to say describe that like and the other thing we got is the live rosin and that is a hundred and ten dollars a gram now we don't quite have anything like this back home and of course I can't really you know compare this to back home but I had to get some of that it's a hundred and ten dollars a gram recreational and I think it was a hundred dollars a gram medical I could be wrong on that price but it was one hundred and ten dollars for me including tax recreational for for this one gram right here", "3IIvPYyCmZc": "everybody how you doing I know it's a little late but we're gonna do what I promised we're gonna press a half ounce of this African Thai okay I've got the flour completely rehydrated with spinach leaf it's ready to go sure you can see it right here make sure that can you see it there in the camera it's looking good yeah good people see them how nice it's glistening in there yes it is Jake how is it keep it in focus by pressing the screen right where it's at so it refocuses on the flower you see that yes okay I'm gonna get closer how's that yep yeah that's a half-ounce african time this stuff is ringing in at thirty four point eight percent okay let's go - lets go strength so we got the CRD kt20 trip tech rosin press at 200 degrees I'm using a duly tech 160 micron 14 gram bag and we're gonna load this thing up this spinach leaf is crucial to rehydrating this flower and when you see the kind of yield we're gonna get from it you'll understand why I tell people over and over again you got to get your flower right to get the most out of it out of Raza okay I I don't can't say it enough I hate to have people come by and they bring me flattered and I can't press inform but sometimes that happens and that's cool I mean you know lesson learned and and but I've got this stuff rehydrated to the proper moisture content and no I don't use a moisture you know gadget to figure that out this is a craft I do this by experience by feel I get a little finger - who cares it's my medicine yeah you know I'm pressing for another patient I wear gloves because you know it's their stuff you know anything I'm pressing on cameras is either mine or it's a customer that doesn't care whether I wear gloves or not because they know I you know good steward of this plant if but this stuff is so soft I mean it's it's amazing in the yeah but it didn't mess with the herbs in fact I think the extra moisture on the springs really brought them out kind of like when you're in a shower you're not gonna have that moisture hits your nose and saturates everything you know that's it's kind of the process here so you see even though this bag isn't really designed isn't isn't really designed for be doing bottle textile okay it's made to be flat packed but I've gotten it to adapt to where I need it to be it's just the stuff is so stinking then you know I'm coming up with finger ashes trying to get it to fill in the bag and make a slug that I can it makes it hard get between those plates right oh my gosh I love African Thai and see the thing is nine times out of ten sativas don't produce as well as indicas except for peligro up from grass roots which was an absolute gusher and this African tie is insanely insanely good on its yields when properly pressed you know and everybody has their their own temperatures that they want to depress things that I'm just doing kind of a pre squish here to get slugged up right I can't believe that was a half yeah no I know crazy huh we also saw right boy stur eyes are so now I just trimmed right I just trim about you know half to three-quarters inch above all right get rid of that don't need that this come in here watch the camera make sure that everybody can see what's going on yes okay so now we've got our slug right stage that here I'm gonna take and move this lighting over here so if you get a little nice view of this press please bear with me as I move the camera around I don't do fancy edits and stuff like that my videos are are wrong and kind of like this because I want people to see this is real life this is how I operate my results are my results you see them good or bad I don't try to hide a thing okay so I got my mic 18:20 press set up to 200 degrees I got the paper in there we're gonna take the slug there's your slug we're gonna put that in there we're gonna place together just a little bit give it okay we got it centered in there now that I got it centered in there I'm gonna bring this view in a little closer for you so bear with me as I keep readjusting the camera angle here until I get it centered so you can see what's going on okay so now if you guys want to see something cool use that as a monitor and watch because it's in maximum scale or 200 degrees and we're ready to drop the hammer on this gently okay this handle is weighted yeah so it it brings the place together in a very controlled way when I start meeting resistance and I hit my first heat soak point which is where I want to stop and let the heat start working in the material and all that moisture that we reintroduced into that flower turns to steam and forces all the good [ __ ] that's that's how this works that's why if your flower is dry and it only is from the dispensary I don't care who makes it yeah what kind of Evita packs they use see see it's starting to moist moisten up right there let's see that okay so I've got to get this ready because this stuff is going to drip when it starts producing it's going to be insane oh it is gonna be awesome happy plants treated with love pressed with care and you get some amazing medicine see every time I starts to get fuzzy just tap the screen right on it and it'll refocus yeah okay so try to get the lighting said you can continue seeing the best view of things now I'm still not at the heat some point it's already producing already starting to moisten up see on the bottom edge on the left-hand side air it's getting wet it's getting wet up top Oh she'sshe's gonna be a gusher guys tonight always I always love those gushers oh yeah African type Ellen Roya another one that's an indica though is Prime's double Afghan show yes I got my first very first time I pressed rosin was with a nut smasher mini press Preston a - that didn't rehydrate and got 1.1 brand Wow and I thought oh it's gonna be like this forever yeah it's not yeah and a lot of learning later and I'm at where I'm at now so this is something anybody can do it you could do it with a hair straightening iron but if you want to have results like this you say you need you need to love this plan do you really have to love this plan guys want to try and rely on timers and gauges and think that it's scientific this is an art not a science so you have to know what this plan is showing you look at the color the camera doesn't do it justice with the lighting I mean I get that it's super blonde yeah now you see how the handle is starting to come resistance but it's still closing the place okay slowly and not too aggressive and I don't have a blow-up my god I'm not in a hurry I want to get it flowing so that when I tipped this thing 90 degrees forward that's it's going to say I got to keep messing with the angle of the light to get it to not amber up like that it's it's always kind of a pain because it reflects off of the paper and then it throws off the camera see I get it just right look at that happy plant problem she is so happy I just hope it doesn't auto butter cuz it did that on one me on time it auto sugared up it didn't flow I think this is going to flow it I'm gonna get it that particular batches lipids aligned a certain way I mean that's what we're dealing with here that's why rosin is a much better concentrate and most of the commercial stuff because everything that's in that plant is in that Roz and I haven't taken anything out I've just removed the plant material right in the equation yeah I'm taking the soul of this plant and I'm bringing it forth it's giving me its essence and that's that's what somebody who cares about what they do can do with this plan with the right equipment now I'm going to give it a little help watch the material move look at its like lava yeah now we're gonna do something watch this guys I'm gonna back this back off right move my lighting we're gonna get it shining down on this right here because what you're about ready the season to be very cool you want the camera down there I will yeah I need the camera down there okay now we're gonna get a gravity assist and we should start seeing some tryptych real soon if you want to take your cameras guys if you want to put stuff on your phones put it on your on your Facebook just tag me okay you know make sure you tag prime make sure you tag African Thai and Ciardi okay cuz it one chance to look at that look at that look at that that's common okay look at that okay so I'm gonna take the camera at the free hand here I'm gonna bring you in and show you look at this look at underneath look that is drip tech my friends see Rd makes the best drip tech presses for prices that nobody else can deal with look at that and it's African Thai 34 for almost 35 percent thirty four point eight mile Carberry and just look at what it's given us here we rehydrated it with care and just there's look at how gorgeous that is getting nice close-ups and as soon as it gets off the heat its it gets nice and stable right away it stabilizes so it's it's gonna implant it if you ever get this stuff in a concentrate form and you try the rosin you'll know the difference just immediately in in every aspect of the flavor profile this is as close to actual plant consumption as you get everything's still there you know look how thick it is - I haven't even really started putting a ton of pressure on it yet either guessing there's so much more there is and that's why I'm not rushing this process because see I can feel when the bags getting to the point where you can't press them right so I'm trying to do this one-handed well on that well I'm still applying pressure so I'm going to let it sit there but bring this in so that you can see look at that beautiful medicine right there god I love this plan I love doing this for both myself and other patients too this is this is what brings me joy I used to think it was being a soldier but this is really the thing that's given me the most satisfaction in terms of something positive to do with my life since I was a soldier it means that much to me that's why I've dedicated myself to teaching people how to do this this is all about making better medicine when you take that flower look at that dripping look up underneath there is insane there's spider webs coming off become wet look at that look at that they crazy Oh baby wait'll they see this on you - they're gonna lose their they're gonna lose [Music] see this I said look you keep you kill back under here and you can still see it's still just gushy discussion my god is there any end to this look at this oh man I'm gonna get a record off of this I don't know but I'll tell you what biggest single eighth yield was that I got was in Detroit yeah the lockvar Wonka bars man 30.1% see I got 1.5 back from 1/8 I bought it at reef I can't remember who the grower was and I was too excited about what I was saying happened it was doing just like this it was just gushing and gushing gushing so I'm giving a little more now you see it started to slow down a bit right yeah okay that's let me know that you're the presser workers we're getting well yeah but we're also getting I'm looking at the the plates and seeing how close they're because I don't want to get a blowout and have to clean it up it's not a disaster if it happens it's just a pain in the ass I'd rather not right but getting this stuff off the heat is the whole goal of this press and you see how beautiful that is I mean just now it slowed down enough that I'm going to put the camera back at it stand here okay I'm gonna move this thing back up we're gonna tilt this back up now one two three lighting readjusted on to the plates so you can see that there's still lots of material here and I'm gonna finish off this press with I'm gonna finish off this press with ya right okay so now from this point we've gotten all the stuff that I think is gonna dripped a coffee or now I'm doing this by feeling already I can feel that I got pretty much most of it dripped out with the pressure I'm applying right now it's still applying gentle pressure in a slow measured way but I'm feeling the resistance of the bag now and if I go too much further risk of blow ahead especially with these dually tech bags they're not built as strong as those Knox master bags again I don't I'm not sponsored by these people I pay retail like everybody else does for my bags and I'm telling you nuts faster bags if you are doing bottle tech pressing like I do you can't get better bags you just can't they ain't giving me monster yields I'm looking for these last bubbles over here when those big ones pop I think we'll be just about know I know and the color is still amazing now uh one of the things that this will show you when it's ready to come off as that color will start to darken or it's gonna slow down production at maximum pressure right so right now I'm very very close to max on the pressure with this thing that I'm comfortable applying I always err on the side of quality over quantity and I still get blowouts sometimes I'm not I'm doing this like I do doesn't make you immune to making mistakes and that's why these videos when I have a boil out I don't hide that I don't edit it out you get to see how I fix the problem that's what a professional does right you come across a problem and you have the understanding of it to fix it adapt and overcome exactly look at that big look at that again love that this plant is giving us right now I mean look at this I'm giving it the last little bit of pressure than I'm comfortable you see how I'm having the weight of my arm to the weight of that bar it's not moving anymore so the longer it stays on the heat to lift stable it becomes it becomes more shatter like and then when you cool it off it turns into like ground glass and you can't gather it up because I just want to stick to it so yeah that's why the error on the side of caution and you get a better product the difference is what your philosophy is are you going after absolute quantity then you keep cooking it to death and you'll get a good quantity but it's gonna suck right my my rosin rosin and I produce from flour for other patients I would rather they get all of the terpenes all of the medicinal value out of this flour got their own process you know my way is not the only way to do this but I get pretty damn good results see the sugar the the it's crystallizing on the plates gentlemen you see yeah okay we're seeing diamonds being made on a press right now those are like many not many diamonds that this press has just made all natural now if I want to do a THC a mechanical separation this press can handle that too is just a long process ten stages low temperature high duration yeah and I don't have the money timer material to do that so until we start paying the kind of prices that they pay in Detroit I'm gonna have to wait okay so I think we're not done slowed down to the point where it's not producing a lot more it's starting to crystallize up I think we have gotten the best cut out of this plant that we can so let's drop the plate yeah all right I'm gonna move lighting over here get this can you get this kind of centered right here with the thing is bring this down that's right now here's what's gonna blow your mind people we're gonna get this have to die now a little sugar crystals that came up right on the edge you're over here too but there's a nice one right there you can get in line this puck is perfectly pressed look at that vikon any further it was haunted right out of that side scene yeah so I missed the view that but it didn't I brought it right to the edge which is what I wanted to do I didn't get that blow out yeah and that's what I was I was just rather err on that side I'll get them what's left on this putt now get back in the edibles so I don't lose a thing you know but oh my god no compared to what dripped off initially and we're going to compare the two before we weigh it and get a total new unit you see how that's turned a little green tinged if there is no because as ice going no no no this is because what dripped off was the best part of this the", "NJ38A1JgWvY": "Florida MJ 4:20 here and today we've got a delivery from three boys farm there Tallahassee hub of two 125 dollar ounces yep that's right announce for a hundred and twenty-five dollars of medical marijuana delivered free to your door statewide at least that was the deal so I'm sure a lot of you guys will know about this deal it was released online about a week and a half or two weeks ago and they roll it out in sections to certain sections of the state and they start out there from Indian town that's where their location is you know they're a grow operation and they first started out delivering to all their customers down there and then they rolled it out the different sections at a time well apparently they got way too many orders and I placed an order I tried to place an order the Monday after they announced it and they told me to wait till the next wins until that Wednesday coming up and so I waited till first thing in the morning I called a million times I left a voicemail with my order I filled out their order their contact form on their website a place in order that way and I never heard anything back I kept trying all day long to call on their phones and I can't get through and I keep reading on the forums how you know yep I got my order through finally got it through got it through who got my order through like 10 minutes before 5 p.m. and you know I'm just like oh man I guess I missed out and everybody else is like that too so anyway I decided just to go and get my stuff elsewhere and even went like an hour and 45 minutes to another dispensary one day last week ended up they didn't even end up having any loose flour at two dispensaries way over there so that was a bust but anyway three boys farm called me back and said hey we just want to let you know that we got swamped and we do have your order so here you go here it is right here hundred twenty-five dollar once's let's see what it's like hey hey I like what I see they change their containers already that's a good thing I really like that this is the kind of containers I used before these little pressure sealed containers and they're not that great not that good all right so here we go twenty-seven point four seven percent THC point zero five percent of CBD is a nice TAC percentage on these things [Music] again man they have some of the hardest to open containers in our medical system holy cow hey this won't work there we go starting to catch oh yeah yeah there you go all right ooh Wow Wow okay this has a really strong smell to it it's got a very it's it's like half piney half citrusy oh yeah that smells really really nice look at this man this I'm gonna have to get a plate for this stuff okay so by the way I just wanted to mention before I take this out um she did state clearly to me when I place my order that these are smalls this is what they're you know their versions of smalls it's not there she said it's not there top shelf but that's what she wanted me to know that really clear to me actually this before we started looking at it let's go ahead and weigh it up just knock that out of the way [Music] tear it out yes we do now see if we got an ounce okay these are not smalls man these are nice buds come on that's awesome yeah and they're packed in that drawer is for sure we okay we got 28 point 3 grams and this one right way the other one out yeah might as well that was twenty eight point three so that ounce was over hopefully I can get this one open if not I guess we'll just review one of them me any things are brutal okay here's the second one it just looks beautiful it looks beautiful go ahead and see if this is tear it out still yes it is look at this nice organic canvas right here I cannot believe this quality of flour man this stuff is crystally it's not dry I can already feel these buds have some you know a little bit of moisture to them that smell is pungent as can be 28.4 grams so both of these ounces are over great job we got point seven grams over so between the two we almost got an extra gram do you see these oh man yeah let's take a look at it we're gonna have to do some close-ups on this stuff do you see how nice that is 125 dollars per ounce so this eighth of a pound is $250 free delivery to your door anywhere in the state of Florida of course this sale by the way is over I should probably add that this sale is over they said that this is something that they're going to do periodically with their harvests you know has their harvest is coming up look at this man look this is just really nice look at how crystally it is my goodness my goodness how did they do this for a hundred and twenty-five dollars I have to say three boys farm slash one plant you have redeemed yourself with this in my eyes because man that first shipment where I spent almost my whole allotment on you and got those ounces that were a little bit dry a little bit dry I got those ounces that were really dry bone-dry this is this this is amazing man this is what you need to be doing you pump out stuff like this you're gonna be doing some good business in this day I'll tell you what look at look at that do you so what do you guys think that's not that's not a small to me that's just a nice regular little size regular bud right there you know and some of these other places you get you you would love to have a big ol nug like that in your eighth jar you know let's just see a some some of these bigger ones I like to go through and kind of get an idea of where the bigger ones are or how many of the bigger ones there are I should say man this stuff is gonna make some nice rosin I can just tell oh my goodness I have to make some Malawi cobs out of it and I just love the cannabis plant so yeah it looks like these are the bigger ones right here this is the size of the bigger buds that you're gonna see get a good look at those those are the big buds let's get some of the smallest full of buds out of here see what some of your small ones are like little little anyone's not that many though men if you look you'll see that the majority of them are really nice for popcorn that's what I'd say you don't get there a lot of places this is gonna be your whole order a bunch of this which I mean I know all right but I really would much rather have stuff like this you know nice fat nugs that you can keep intact and who smells so good you know usually they're just much more densely covered and trichomes and all that good stuff boy oh boy we're gonna have to get some close-ups now all right let's go in for a close-up all righty look at that right there does that look pretty it sure looks pretty to me oh look at it hi there little fella aren't you cute we're gonna vape you right up I don't think oh this Tim left on that one no big deal for 125 look man they're just covered just some of those little ones I found as I covered too look at that really nice I wish you guys could smell these things too it smells so good man evany and ivory 27.4 7 percent THC is a sativa dominant hybrid pretty sure and it just has the delicious smell here's another one of those with the a little bit of stem left on it but as you can see it is a really nice looking bud huge deal and there's just not much of that there really isn't a lot of stem there's not a lot of leaf stem right there overall though this is really nice and they she made sure and stressed to me on the phone this is not their top shelf quality buds so I don't know what they got for top shelf quality I guess man maybe some mutant buds over there or something like that now let's go in for a really closeup view look at those crystals man I have to say three boys slash one plant you did a really good job on this batch that's for sure I'm not so upset that you're out of the triangle cush and pink ice now cuz you know at least for this area because uh this looks really good let's try to get some close-ups of these nice big ones [Music] all that trichomes on that thing just covered with them look at that all covered in Troy Khan's s for sure $125 an ounce that is ridiculous that's a great price do that the THC monster coming to get you no no tipsy monster leave me alone raah I will eat you yeah there you go you got a mouth in the nose that's my ha ha ha all right let's see just about time to toke it up I think looky there so if you're not convinced yet and I don't know what to tell you maybe the clouds will convince you", "dTETBUOM_Gg": "hey guys welcome to bubble man's world I am here today fresh after Christmas I guess it's a couple of days after Christmas the 27th hope you all had a wonderful holidays and enjoyed your time with your family I feel like a kid on Christmas morning because I have a new package from pure pressure in Colorado my favorite rosin press company and I'm hoping that this is either the helix or the helix Pro manual rosin press so I wanted to do an unboxing video with you guys I'm not sure if you're familiar with the helix Pro I can put the picture up here real quick it's the helix Pro is a 5 ton manual rosin press they are expected January 2019 so they're doing 25 pre-orders for this particular thing it's got bigger heat plates and more force than the helix it's exclusive preorder pricing as a thousand bucks down and then you know three weeks before shipping you can pay the rest of the the price I think it's another twenty nine hundred for this particular unit every pre-order comes with a free matching accessory kit and entry into their contest where one is going to win a second press for free for a friend or for yourself so top features user friendly and easy to twist press operation no air compressor required ultra accurate force measuring load cell which displays bag pressure in real time that's a market first for manual rosin press super responsive pressure control that allows for as little as 10 pound force increments press up to 12 grams of flowers or 20 grams of kefir hash at a time with ease features our press wear technology which offers a full-color LCD touchscreen with custom software for even more control you can save up to 29 preset recipes so once you dial in your settings you can repeat your results over and over and over again up to five tons of force which is ten thousand pounds of force output from our hundred percent custom engineered lead screw twist press technology these guys have put a lot of time and energy so trust me when I say these guys understand engineering and they really produce their rosin presses from an engineer's perspective that's how the machine is getting built even heat distribution from zero Fahrenheit to 300 Fahrenheit from our in-house machined aluminum plates each with its own thermocouple which is great temperature accuracy to less than one degree Fahrenheit ultra durable powder coated construction and of course their patent pending so I say we get started right away it was just such a pleasure when my long Peaks showed up I loved the way they shipped it I loved everything about how they packaged it it was just really quite a pleasure to open that package and I kind of have a feeling this one's not gonna be too too different crack off this lid see see what's inside just a little bit of papers so you've got your invoice got your invoice right there you've got rosin bag filters which is quite nice I'll take a photo of it and put it up on the screen so you can see about their press moulds they're specialized scraping tools you know the funnel kit the quick flip the bag sizes the screen sizes all of these different things are pretty pretty important to kind of know where you sit how rosin is pressed they have a really nice little folder which I will also photograph and put up on the screen so you can look at that and see the different screen sizes and from flower to Keith to bubble hash and the different tips for the different things and the consistencies and the textures these guys have really been doing a great job I gotta say working with them has an absolute pleasure so they also have a little card in there for the harvest rate pharmaceutical freeze dryer all right look at that here's the top right there be careful with our knife so it's gonna be somewhat careful when you're using a knife especially when you're opening a package that you don't know exactly how it's been shipped all right so these look like the little feet put those down over here there's four of them so that makes sense all right what else we got here yes this is the beat of the press I've seen these enough times to know these go on the side of the machine with the feet that screw into them so that should be easy enough to do while we're on the unboxing video let's just screw these right into here we'll go as much as we can I'm not sure how much we should leave but probably probably a little bit one two three four threads one two three four threads one two three four threads perfect that's the right height get the other one in here what I love about peer pressure is just the quality of the craftsmanship you know the idea that this came from a real engineering standpoint and they put a lot of thought into into putting this this unit together it is definitely not something that is fly by the pants seat of your pants construction they really do an incredible job I might actually cut this whole box away rather than try to lift out the press I think that is what I'm gonna do yeah we're gonna give you a little show on what's going on in here not sure exactly what all these components are because I've never seen this unit before so you're seeing it really for the first time with me here not sure which these guys are for oh yeah this is our little handle yeah that that little guy right there for cranking it on the top of the unit I like it I like it a lot and on to this one right here it's definitely not as heavy as I thought it might meet which is really nice this definitely goes down right on top boom just like that your handle gets inserted and then okay so the screws are actually right in the unit which is great I can take this off I like how easy this goes on and off and it doesn't seem to need to be locked in place which is very nice okay so I suspect these are gonna go like that there you can also put this unit like this so you can actually have it like this setup where it's sort of horizontal versus vertical so both options are there all right so I already got the one leg on what are the things with these guys that I make a bit of a mistake is they'll have a tiny little bend on their foot and naturally I'll think that the feet go to the outside this is actually the opposite of how it goes you can see the feet go in the unit builds up and there's three little allen keys right here in the side but are fairly easy to unscrew I could be using a drill in making easier but i'm using an allen key so be it and so i love the way the screws just come in in place in the machine you don't have to look for a little bag and try and find the screws it's quite easy you just go to where you're going to be screwing them in and they're already there so it's just a matter of removing them and then screwing them in to secure the feet and I guess that's done because the feet can go on a variety of ways the way they've got it set up you can put it vertical or horizontal so all right just get this up here threading is just really done well it's not gonna be problematic where your screws aren't aren't screwing in nicely or the going in sideways everything just lines up really really well on these units and I appreciate that about about them okay there we go little make sure they're tight on both sides yep yep yep boom look at that there it is right there it comes with a power cord got the same great digital screen and really left the little screen I like the look of this little unit I'm pretty excited about it alright so I figured we should do a little press I've got a little bit of canvas here it sounds like we can press a solid 12 grams of flour at a time on this little unit so we're gonna take the little flip tool that they have I've got the screen over top here this is a hundred and fifteen micron screen we're just gonna flip it inside out that's gonna get that seam on the inside for us and it will hold a lot less oil as you know contaminants capturing oil that we really would rather have release I've got my little funnel I'm going to put on my gloves so we've got our little bag we've got our little 12 grams of herb I am of course pressing my all-time favorite where is my bike just such a great flower to press as it truly really releases an incredible amount of resin so we'll go into there nice I've gone off about these tools before but I might as well a little bit again I just love the ease with which these tools operates I've got quite a bit of extra room it's definitely not going all the way to the top I'll have a nice little bit of screen I'll just be able to fold over I brought my pure pressure template here for pre pressing the pre press get that in there much better over there so we've got a nice flattened piece here this is the older one that I took from and then we have some papers so they sent me once again with some screens all sorts of varieties of screens here which I was very happy I'll be doing some experimenting including stainless steel screens right there send me some stickers which I will be giving away to some folks all right so oh man oh they even sent me a new see that so let's get this opened up and access some of this paper I wondered why this paper was a little smaller than the parchment that I'm used to but I get it makes very good sense in the sense that we're using a much smaller press so too will we be using much smaller paper so I think first things first because we're not ready to press yet let's hit the switch on this little boy this bad boy will see the screen line up probably come over to the side here a little bit and you turn it okay please remove force from press then press okay all right let's remove force from press okay ah there we go so it opens up the same old LED screen that I'm used to and know and love it's giving me my force it's got system settings it's got recipes it's got a quick press it's got run recipe it's about last run data so I say we go into recipes I have merely turned the heaters on here and here I've got my settings at 220 Fahrenheit which for the you know recipe that we're gonna be running is gonna work fine for me let's go back to home let's go back to recipes and let's go back to this one so this one edit recipe name set material type well restarted it again that's interesting well let's you know what let's do it so we'll go select flour select bag size okay so it's adding that the weight based on bag side it's got the temperatures it's got my pressures alright so I'll just go run and then I have to push start press when we're actually ready to do this and I'll be turning this little guy to to check out how how well it works so very very cool little unit these guys do such a great job it's got a little drip tray for those of you that didn't know what this was it's loose weight now was playing around with it now I'm gonna hold the camera but I love the idea of a drip tray I have to admit there we go because these sides I've had parchment absolutely drip down inside the machine on my long Peaks so this is a very nice little unit right here this little drip tray it comes in and out very easy you can lift it right out if you don't want to use it and it's just a matter of actually opening up the press a little bit which happens very easy with a little bit of twisting and this just pops right out so that's our little tray right there I also found out that these particular guys are obviously clamps and what they are for is to clamp the unit down to any table that you're working on if need be if you're really cranking away at this thing so I'm going to use the drip tray you can put it down over this way because that's where the wiring is I'll fit that a nice and carefully there you go perfect alright so we'll wait for these to heat up it's already at 105 degrees potentially oh look at that it even came with magnets these guys are on the ball you can keep that on it's quite a bit of parchment coming off the back which is never a problem for me because I love when I have a real squisher to be able to have that little bit of back room for the oil to escape into so very excited 12 gram runs obviously this is a lot smaller than I'm used to doing I'm used to doing 35 to 40 gram runs a flower and even high - but who knows this is like a real nice little small unit I can carry it around with me and I suspect I could get this thing to fit into a pelican case which means adventures in rosin making how fun would it be to take the bubble bags and the dry set of screens and the rosin press up to the ice cave on the parrots and ice caps and bust out some high quality and that is what's up so we are at a hundred and thirty nine degrees Fahrenheit not too bad both sixty to eighty degrees away from the temperature that we're looking at and as you can see there are important components to getting this you know to making this easy to making it you know less difficult and difficult and that's about having all of the proper tools make sure you have your bags okay what do I have the bags I have some 90 microns I have some 36 microns I have some 72 microns and I have some hundred and fifteen microns so for different sized bags most of these bearings are used for flour 36 micronized use for hash we've got the template for pressing we've got our funnels which I can put the dirty ones in here as well as our flipper unit which is very key and then we've got our our bags our parchment paper so that's also very important just kind of getting all this stuff out of here that's pretty cool the way you can the way you can you know basically attach these two to a table and it's it's not very difficult to do is it you're just gonna try maybe one while we're sitting here tables not queue wide but definitely wide enough that it's there's that one other one of those little doctors not sure this so that's actually a really good idea I'm sure once you get you know moving on this thing you could get a little excited depending on who you are you could start moving the whole unit and that's not really gonna be an ideal situation so when the screen gets put in properly and doesn't doesn't come out because then we end up with with a fair bit of screen contaminant and a plate nice to be able to put my finger in there or not worry about the whole press squishing it and crushing it that's very nice okay so let's go start press stage one yeah so we're at 729 pounds we're at a thousand 1,100 forces at 2,800 okay forces at 4600 let's see if we can turn a little bit and I can start seeing the oil coming out now I can see quite a bit of oil coming up the sides here is buttering up nicely here and it's that it's that some good force right little close up what we got going on here there we go without our percentage we got 8,000 pounds of force I like the drip tray I do indeed like the drip tray and you can also see around back here that it's also starting to push rosin up through the back and it looks like it's wanting to butter up right away and that generally is what happens with very high THC product it was only 12 grams so I'm hoping for at least 3 grams of rosin that would be maybe even a little bit more for this particular strain cultivar cycle complete let's stop the press and we'll open this up it really only gets a little bit tough at the end alright let's go around and see what we got here [Music] here we go for our yield so I'm gonna collect that up and I'll let you guys know what it is in one second here pretty exciting alright so I have crushed out the first and second press I did end up getting just over 3 grams which I guess would probably be around 26% 27% so I left up a little bit behind from what I normally get with my long Peaks keep in mind this is my first press with this unit I didn't really understand exactly how to set it up so I'm pretty sure in the next week or two I'll get that 2% back certainly not upset with it that's for sure three solid grams really caramel beautiful where's my bike flour rosin I gotta say so far the first experience with the helix Pro has been really cool I did also figure out both of these how they actually go on as they go between the wheel and the foot so they go kind of like that underneath and so that's why they don't need to be different sides they both work perfectly and I will set it up next time better with the with the clamps because once you get it listen the first when you're closing it and opening it opens really easy as you get to around 5 6,000 7,000 8,000 pounds per pressure it starts getting a little bit harder and I can see for sure how you could move the whole press so I'm going to thank you all for tuning in you're gonna see a lot more happening with this press we're gonna do a whole video and actually using this press with flour dry sift and bubble hash I just really wanted to do an unboxing video today and I thought what a great way to do an unboxing video to also show a really quick press so thank you to the people the the group over at peer pressure the team if you will I look forward to seeing you all at lyft in January January 11th to 13th or 14th I believe here in Vancouver these guys peer pressure coming out and we'll have a booth you could probably find me at their booth otherwise I would be walking around with my team from embark if you see me there definitely pull me aside and say hello and great great little unit super quality I mean once you see this unit in person and you feel the quality of the tools you really get the idea very quickly this is a solid unit so thanks a lot peer pressure thanks everyone for watching and we'll see you next time on [Music]", "pcgb1YtOGd0": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you can run no she is my back it up so you ain't always what happened to the next one mama no say aye it's my break it up so you know in my way you they never last one no shade I guess my freaks back it up so annoying I'll save my game might happen in the last one why my note said break it up [Music] [Music] [Music] so hey I ain't just [ __ ] on the side I think [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you", "c9p8j4tiK0Q": "[Music] hey everyone eric here from peer pressure it has been a while since we've gotten a chance to do solventless review really excited to sit down with pyramid today and review their pineapple chunk live rosin pax pod it is great as a quick disclaimer as a part of our protocols we check everyone's temperature and do contact tracing so this interview was conducted without masks just wanted to explain that we're trying to keep everything above board so it's nice and safe for these interviews all right watch on thanks for joining us today i had the pleasure of reviewing pyramids pineapple chunk hybrid solventless rosin pod these pods are 100 hash rosin which makes the flavor profile and effect vastly superior to other ones out there that i've gotten to try the pineapple chunk is a really nice hybrid very middle of the road effect wise and you would expect it to be pretty fruity but in this case we found that it was really hashy when i was smoking it it really reminded me of some old-school bubble hash that we used to put on bolt hoppers so one of the coolest things about these pyramid pods is that they're actually taking advantage of paxpod's smartpod technology which means that when you connect it with the app on your phone it's going to tell you all kinds of cool things about the strain but that it's also got pre-loaded temperature settings right onto it so if you take a small rip it's going to run at a very low temperature preserving your terpenes or if you really want to go for it it can also ramp the temperature up so you can blow a huge cloud overall this technology is really really cool so the color is really nice the effect is not going to put you to sleep it's not going to get you up and excited it's a nice mid-time day high that you can kind of just ride out wherever you're going and like i said before the pineapple notes are pretty minimal what you're really getting in this card or at least what i found was a lovely hashy kind of sweet flavor that came through and just boosted my day it's a nice break from whatever's going on in your day at that moment and it's really easy to consume with these packs of vaporizers eric here with peer pressure really excited to have pyramid on the show we're going to do some intros and then start talking about hash canvas processing everything and then we'll start talking about these products so let's start off with jake tell us a little bit about yourself hey eric thanks for having us today um yeah my name is jake berry i started pyramid with my business partner coley walsh about six years ago now um i moved out here originally from texas after graduating from college and i um started off as a button in the industry um that was my first gig here and i quickly realized that you know what i really want to move into the extraction side of things and we i really saw a niche there that i feel i felt like we could kind of build a brand around now um at that point vape pens were really just getting started and it quickly became one of my favorite ways to smoke as a blood tender and i just saw the growth happening and you know coley was actually my boss at the dispensary and you know talking to him i was like hey why don't we why don't we look into this why don't we why don't we do this you know i feel like i can find the funding for us to do this and get this up and going yeah and um so we did we started looking around for different licenses and back then i mean it was nightmarish to find a new thing um you know to get into the industry was very difficult and [Music] just googling and going through different municipalities web pages i found the city of we ridge it was the second city i called um and asked them about it and it turns out they were having a lottery within 30 days so um it had just been announced and like happenstance it happened to stumble upon it started applying for and doing the application i had never done something like this in my life um and kind of had to quickly figure things out at that point cole and i were both still working at the dispensary while trying to do all this on our days off finished the app got it in and happened to win the lottery and here you are and here we are now that's incredible uh and matt tell us a little bit about yourself uh what got you in the industry and what do you do at pyramid i'm matt cease i'm the lab manager at pyramid i've been there for about a year and a half now i got my start out in the garage my cousin was growing and he just needed somebody to do some extractions unfortunately butane none of that was like an option so it was all just bubble hash and rosin started with a hair straightener and five gallon bubble bags and it's just grown from there wow cool so in your role as the lab manager at pyramid what kinds of extraction and processes do you oversee now supercritical co2 okay all the ethanol post extraction the winterization distillation we run white film and also overseeing all the solvents cool okay and you guys are mainly focused on bubble hash and rosin you guys do any sift we don't do any sift unfortunately we tried to do sift in the beginning but all of our product just kind of came out dark okay so not the way you guys wanted the route we wanted to go okay cool so jake you started as a bud tender now you're running your own company with coley does it look like being the ceo of pyramid put us in your shoes running a cannabis company what does that look like um you know i think a lot of people think it's this super glamorous job and you know it's actually a lot of work um you know i would say both of us um you know we're five years in now and we're both probably averaging 60 to 70 hours a week typically um you know i wake up at 6 00 a.m i am at work no later than 8 30 and i stay till you know six seven sometimes and so it's a very busy um job and uh but it's super rewarding and that's the great part like i go to work every day and i love my job and so i feel like i hit the lottery like the hours don't matter you know it's super enjoyable um but it's just it's also just exciting like everything like my feeling and my favorite part personally is launching these new products you know getting into uh the solventless side of the thing like of the industry was something very interesting for for me to do in launch this is just my favorite like parts of being the ceo is saying you know giving the company a vision and saying look this is where i see us going this is something that i think we want to do and launch you know and not everything works out you know you can definitely have those you know stinkers happen but um the rising line is going well you know it was something that we really wanted to get into and it's going great and similarly to us going into michigan yeah you know so no that's awesome and you know for a follow-up to that you know what are some of the pieces of advice that you would give to someone who wants to be a cannabis business owner you know what what would you offer to someone who's either trying to get into it or is at the very beginning stage you know now you're five years deep you know um don't get intimidated it's a very very intimidating um experience you know i was 23 when i got into the so you're very young yeah i'm 29 now um and it's very intimidating especially if you don't have a lot of that you know experience and background but just be confident and and continue to stay humble throughout the process because you're going to get hit honestly like along the way so just kind of like keep persevering and working hard and you know don't focus on the little things you know there's a lot bigger fish to fry in the day and like if you get caught up on every everything along the way you know it's you're never going to get there so just focus on what on your goal and and keep working towards it and eventually it'll happen well it sounds like you've built a good team around you you know are there any aspects of team building or like you know bringing on the right lab manager to do the work is there anything that's worth mentioning there definitely um the industry is an interesting place to work in um you know there's a lot of bosses out there that you know might not connect with their employees i think um and so it kind of goes back to that being humble part that i was mentioning yeah you know start this and and work hard towards it but build that relationship with the people you work with you know i'm no i'm nobody in this in the grand scheme of things you know like i i'm more showing up to work every day and working and you know i want to hire people that want to come to work every day that are happy and excited and can feel like that they can connect with me more you know they see me working every day yeah so hopefully that inspires them to also come here and work and show up and so hiring the right people is super key yeah but keep that family mentality um and that's something that i learned from my parents you know and like my culture of just keeping that cohesive bond between everybody and so you know i try to say hello to everybody whenever i come to work every day and um and um i would say people should do that you know if they're looking to start something yeah so word of the y's for everyone who's listening uh pay attention to your company culture obviously that can make all the difference honestly it'll make it break you your company culture is so so important um you know like our christmas parties are like my favorite thing to do every single year it's like we play good yeah we play um white elephant and it's just fun it's it's a good time to let loose everybody to just kind of poke from each other and that's the other thing don't take yourself too seriously i really don't take myself too seriously i mean look at my you know joke around with people you know have those experiences and and be be relatable once you think you're better than anybody else you're gonna very easily no longer be able to succeed especially in this industry yeah so no that that's great advice matt you know to shift gears a little bit tell me about what a day in the life looks like of you the lab manager managing all these different processes all these extraction methods and then you know solvent lists at the end of the day being perhaps your top shelf product you know what what is what does a day look like for you it is extremely busy i'll start off by saying that that's true everything has to be done very very particularly like very peculiar with everything that's done cleanliness i mean just that alone takes up a huge part of the day a lot of people don't focus a lot on that but anything that your product touches it gets on your product it's in the end product people are smoking it it's just not good for anybody but the lab starts off you know you turn the lights on you fire up all the machines and it's just making sure that nothing's broken first so like a lot a lot of our equipment's running overnight with a super critical co2 extraction you know matt is constantly like reloading the equipment setting it up for running it and then he has to set up a run for overnight so you know in order to kind of reach our goals and and keep up with the production of all of our sales you know he's got to be on point all day long you know a lot of people think that it's just kind of come to work and get high and hang out and no and that's like ass buster yeah yeah it's unbelievable yeah that's not the industry you know and so um if that's what you think is happening here you know that that's not the case you know everybody who works for a pyramid works incredibly hard and um you know and and we try to keep that environment going for them so we get in the lab turn on the lights make sure everything's still functioning properly and following that it's redoing the process that you did the day before all of it's the most labor-intensive job i think i've ever had i really i have a hard time even describing like where i start and where i end but it's always changing too it's like and there's always a new fire there's a new problem every single day that you have to solve it's like being a detective a mechanic and then a scientist you're definitely not a scientist right away you're not a chemist you come in and it's okay what's broken all right let me pull out the wrenches let me pull out the tools let's fix this machine and then as you're fixing that machine chances are something somewhere else is just not going perfectly so you bounce around the lab constantly it's like a ping pong ball and then introducing solvent list to our line actually kind of let me slow down a lot the process is much more much more connected i would say like actually getting to wash you know you're in touch with everything in tune with everything and then when you get to the rosin press it takes finesse throughout the press isn't something you go up to and go and pull the handle and get beautiful rosin it's actually a lot of finesse a lot a lot of finesse well that's really interesting and you know talking about connecting with the plant connecting with solvent lists you know why did you guys bring solvent lists on in the first place and i i'd love to get both of your perspectives on this i mean i'm sure you were advocating for it as someone who started off doing ice water hash absolutely no it was mainly the quality you can't you can't reach the uh the terpene profile on anything else in my opinion than you can with live rosin it tastes so true to the plant and it brings me back to kind of like the original days when i first started smoking weed it has that real true wheat taste when i smoke some concentrates they almost all taste the same to me a little bit like vho co2 extractions there's slight differences but each strain has the same particular taste to them with live rosin i've noticed it brings out way more of the flavors that you don't originally notice yeah and i would have to agree with him completely there you know i remember when i first started smoking you know a long time time ago now um it was so exciting to like experience the next the next bag the next pickup you know and um and just try something new and fill a different experience yeah and i i i kind of agree with what matt's saying is concentrates you can definitely notice the self differences but i think a lot of it's harder for people to with certain things that you just with rosin especially with live rosin um it's extremely pronounced exactly essentially and i'm immediately pronounced um and you know everything every wash is different and you know and kind of going back to original question you know yeah you know matt was pushing for something you know and coley and i at the same time we're looking for kind of that we wanted that high-end option as part of our portfolio of different things that we offer and um with our relationship with pax and just like our vape experiences we felt like we could really kind of bring something new um and you know we wanted that that option so it was kind of a mixture of you know matt's experience with bubble hash prior to and saying you know this is something that's becoming a thing me kind of realizing that it's on the come up as well and uh saying you know what let's produce this new high-end product um for our consumers so that's awesome and you know when you're thinking about making a solvent-less product as the lab manager what are you trying to look at is it you know intense strain selection are you guys sourcing specific things from your own garden you know walk me through a little bit how you select the strains that you do that you decide to wash and process mostly it's trial and error unfortunately we do small test washes on things if we need to find out what the yields will be and stuff like that from our grow you know we had some really good things like cherry cake wedding cake uh we've been running this pineapple chunk that we were just playing here today was something that that yielded on the really low side unfortunately but the quality of it is just so good that yeah you can't had to go for it you have to yeah and uh yeah and and i guess you know i i do a lot of the sourcing in the material okay you know um and we've attended some of y'all's classes actually and um and and heard advice from you all you know you guys are the experts honestly at the end of the day you guys have been doing this for a long time and that kind of moves our strength selection um to a certain degree and but finding those relationships of those quality growers is difficult you know and so we have a very small grow um and uh our product typically that comes out of there washes really well i think a lot of that's attributed to the growing style and the lights that we use we use three fifteen watt leds we've got flour under them and the turkey profile comes you know at the end of flowers really really good and so um yeah the yields are very low but transferring that flower into rosin um it tends to come through exceptionally without it rises brings the quality up that much higher yeah that's why i personally believe i mean i noticed it on our other extraction methods as well is that um the lights matter so much um you know from outdoor to greenhouse to you know uh hbs lights to um lec's um there's such a unique difference that you kind of noticed from being in the industry for so long um and but otherwise yeah you know i mean we can only provide a little bit amount of what we produce so we've got to go to outside sources and find and make those relationships with different grow facilities that can provide us that high quality material so and when you get some high quality material that jake has said you know hey man we're getting the strain in you know let's go for it how do you guys decide which solidless products you're going to turn it into for example you know we've got pax pods with us we've got some grams of some live rosin you know do you make a determination beforehand of where you want that material to go we just started doing the grams so it's not even we haven't released it to the market yet all right everyone exclusive coming out in the next couple weeks realistically so we're actually going to start running and pressing a lot more than we have been um to release these these grams okay so it's been pods first and now we're getting into grams yes sir cool and how what what does that look like are you guys thinking about pretty much just doing live rosin uh what what does that release look like it'll just just be live rosin um the big thing is we haven't really gotten to do too much testing on making sauces or batters and what we're going to do yet whether it's going to be just a crumble uh it's going to come fresh off the press so we still have to work out some kinks there i'm guessing it probably some r d that went into getting these pens right um yeah absolutely yeah that was a huge struggle i mean figuring all that out and pins are not easy like yeah hey no we can be honest about that and you know i think everyone who's tuned in and watching now you know we're not here to tell everyone that making a rosin pen is something that you can just pick up and do on day one so for the rosin pens specifically what were some of the hurdles that you guys went through to now come out with what is an award-winning product getting everything off the press and out of the bags like washing is super easy doing the rosin press was super easy getting the actual oil into the carts and the pods and getting them to flow correctly and hit correctly was by far the most part like the most difficult part that we had and that's just the viscosity getting you know getting the viscosity i mean as you know when your first comes off the press most of it's still thca so it's going to crystallize it's going to butter up and in order to flow in a cart you need it to be liquid so it has to be de-carbed back into thc and when you're doing that there's just there's a lot of problems that can arise so it took you guys definitely some trial and error uh some missteps but now we're at a point where you guys have a product that it looks like you're super proud of absolutely yeah you know and i i think you know some of the to expound on what matt was saying is the terpene retention you know what do people want out of rosin they want it to taste it's amazing the best product they've ever had closest to the plant yeah getting that right on that post process after the press is so integral to like what we do to make a quality product and i mean that took him long long time to figure it out uh just to keep that terpene retention and then beyond that yeah filling is is a whole different thing this isn't like this you know i can't crank the heat up and pump it in a cart yeah and have it flow well you know and so um there's still trial and error in that you know it's like you gotta it takes a while to really dial it in and um we feel like we've gotten into a pretty good spot right now obviously we release the product but there's always ways we can improve upon our process so i'd love to hear from you matt you know you said that this was one of the first pens that you guys made and it won an award tell us a little bit about the trophy we've got on the table here and what the story is behind that one yeah so this was a face-off og it was actually our very first wash in our new wash machine it was our very first time on the rosin press first time trying to de-carve things into a cart so there was there was a lot of lost face-off og grams yeah i apologize to them but um yeah it's it you know it's a really difficult process but we're here today you know we got everything dialed in yeah that's that's a cool story yeah considering it's our first watch we're i mean we were surprised when it came through you know it was it was something where we were i mean i i think i was pushing that we were in the middle of developing this product and release and we wanted to get it in before um this competition and you know i was you know on the back of matt saying get this going let's go let's go let's let's be let's enter this you know hopefully we'll something good will come out of it and it happened to and it happened to be his first wash which is ridiculous in itself but super happy no that's awesome to see you guys hitting a home run like that tell me a little bit about your relationship with pax you know we've got some products here you guys are putting your rosin pens in pax pods uh walk me through that sure um so we've been a pax partner for i think going on two years now two and a half years um and we launched with obviously our other products and pax you know provides the hardware provides the battery you know the actual pod system but you know everything that's inside of that you're smoking is is directly from us or any of the other partners that are on the platform um we there was no rosin on that platform at all and that's where we really saw like a good way to to get in and you know we wanted to launch this so this is actually the first rosin pod packs anything um in in the market in colorado no just in nature nationwide yeah this is the first rosin pax pod that you can consume very cool um and so we saw that kind of that lane that we wanted to get into that we kind of went along with our goal of you know having a really high end product that we could sell and we figured pairing it with like our packs you know distributorship was a really good move and so that's kind of how we got there um but yeah you know these things aren't the same either you know like a 510 cart is much different than a pack spot and we have different feeling techniques for each of those options um and so there's a lot of r d on that back end too that like our production manager aaron really had to play around with to figure out how to make these work well you know you don't want someone to get a product to try it and not work and so figuring that out was was difficult yeah so you and aaron were working hard to bring these products here today all right so we've got pineapple chunk rosin on deck both in live rosin pax pod form as well as grams uh how did this strain fall into your hands it starts off in house with our grow and then i hand select the nugs that we're going to use to wash we hand wash i don't advise anybody to use a drill in a paddle it's just just don't do it it's not worth it it's going to waste your time following that we throw them in a two and a half well actually we from there we select which trichomes are going to be the best to press you don't want to just i mean you can mix all of your all of your bubble hash selections together but you're not going to get the greatest quality that you could by selecting which trichomes are better which in this case was the 90 to 120 micron range following that selection they go in the freeze dryer we freeze dry them yeah and then we load them up in two and a half by nine pure pressure bags set them on the peer pressure pike's peak version yeah and we press it around 180 185 degrees i like to press until the oil will start to darken up or pretty much you can tell by as you're adding pressure you'll see possibly the oil darkening up a little bit i like to stop right around that point yeah and that's a lot of trial and error though i mean yeah it varies honestly not even from strange terrain each press will vary like i said it's a lot of finesse when you're working the press it's not something you just pull the handle and you get your perfect oil but so there's some trial and error there you know as far as the grow since you know we talk so much about growing and how important that obviously is for all forms of extraction but especially solventless tell me a little bit about your grow and you know how you guys got a product this good yeah so um all the genetics we've gotten have been from growers around uh colorado um we fl we we grow in a deep water culture system so we use a current culture system um and then we fly under 351 lec's we really feel like the end product while you might not get as big of yields like you know bigger buds we definitely get a higher quality product like in our wash specifically or in our extracts because we don't really sell any weight um all of it goes right into our process um so we either process it into our you know distillates or we process it into our co2 oil or now a lot of it's going right to fresh frozen so um you know the harvest is very very important really knowing what you're doing there is it is key to making the wash go well um you want to harvest right away you know a lot of people think that oh it's okay to you know buck these buds and let them sit here while i finish this harvest no you want to go very very quickly and go um on a plant my plant basis almost um you know you really don't want them to be sitting around for any more than 20 30 minutes so wow so it's a quick d fan um you know all right in the stock and then you buck the buds very quickly um everything we cure is in turkey bags typically and that's kind of what we do for our fresh resin as well so you know pluck buck bag and throw it in the freezer immediately it's very important um to not get too much water cotton content because it definitely will affect the wash on the back end oh so you guys have it nailed down that was almost like a little limerick i i like that so we've got pineapple chunk with us what are some strains that you guys like to smoke start with you matt i've got a weird palette personally one of my favorites right now is mandarin dreams i absolutely love that strange i mean it just sounds nice i also love bananas anything with banana in it is always a go-to for me and then cheese bio cheese any kind of cheese uk cheese i love cheese cheese okay cheesy terms i can't get enough cheese that's awesome what about you uh you know i'm big on the cheese game too um cheese quake is like one of my favorite strains ever um i haven't seen her around in a long time um i don't know how little washes we haven't gotten a chance to watch something like that but i also really like a lot of sub cool genetics personally um so like space queen is amazing crossed with anything jelly bean nine pound hammer jelly beans my favorites hands down yeah and um that's one strain that i really want to wash um and so that'll be coming in the pipeline too awesome so that's kind of yeah that's my favorite strain we're gonna do it at some point okay okay that's right i think you get a decision in there you know i would also love to learn you know before we right before we get into the review here you know let's wrap this up with tell me a little bit about what does pyramid stand for like what are your guys's philosophies um you know it's a very difficult question especially put into words um you know when coley and i started out we you know we were just trying to to get get things going and you know it was really hard to to kind of figure out what we wanted to stand for as a company and you know i think the biggest thing that kind of we look for and and that we want like our message to be is we just want to be a good place to work you know i feel like a lot of people are very unsatisfied in their life and and we want people to enjoy coming to work with us you know not for us but with us on this and so you know beyond that um you know personally like i really like um kind of able to you know expand upon my heritage and and show that you know minorities can be successful in this space um and uh and so i think that's something that we really have going for us there is um anybody can can get into this you know it doesn't have to be one person the other so you know we really are interested in in working with communities of color yeah um and you know that's kind of one of the big things we're doing in michigan specifically we're working in a um kind of a lower income area and bring jobs bring jobs to those areas you know bring business back into these areas that have you know over time have have gotten the shorten the stick here um and so you know i i wouldn't say we have a you know i'm not the marketing guy who's gonna tell you this is our philosophy this is our mantra sure i think it's more of just like inside of us yeah this is kind of who we are as people and we want this to come through on our business side as well so yeah that i mean that's a great explanation jake walk me through what do we have on the table here uh and what are we gonna review so today we are going to review our um pineapple chunk live rosin pods um we don't have a rate today so we'll kind of just let you guys look at bigger hams um and then we're also going to kind of show you guys the newest tech coming out of packs that a lot of people have not experienced or seen yet cool um and so i'll kind of review through that real quick okay yeah please show me break it out um all right so you know pax right now um just released this product it is the pax era pro they've added a lot of really cool tech into this product that is is very new uh i love the packaging to start off with yeah and then honestly the feel of it is is it's it's really premium you know i think pax really wants to be that apple of um of uh vaporizers and i think magnetic lid yeah all right they've put uh they've put some thought into this okay and even there you know yeah shows yeah very well thought out packaging um i really like the new finish on the actual product um and they've done a lot of different things with it now so you actually get some color options which didn't exist before okay um so we've got silver we've got a red a jade and a traditional black i like the silver a lot nice um very clean yep so they've added usbc um charging to so they've kind of upgraded the charging it's fast charged so um throw it in your car you know or you take it out to a hike and it's not ready it's gonna be ready weight is almost nothing which is very cool very cool um and some of the features they've added to it are really nice um they have the traditional child proof usage on here you know you connect it to your phone yeah and it's going to be child proof so your kid can't can't mess with it which i think is a really awesome feature for a lot of people totally um and then some of the what i really like though is that so if you look at all of our pods you really wouldn't really notice it let's crack one of these up real quick please i was hoping we might um okay so yeah so this is our packaging so we really wanted to go with a more um hash head feel to it yeah if you you know we want it to be we really like our packaging to look fun yeah and that's kind of the direction we're going with a lot of things and so we wanted to kind of give you that rosin feel to it that that fresh press and that's kind of how we came up with this yeah with the director this it's very different for us um and so inside the child proof packaging you'll find a a pot obviously pull it out check it out all right and now you are saying child proof often i want to make sure just pop this baby right in there oh it's vibrating and lighting up so no it knows yeah that's another cool feature is the haptic feedback um so you know you plug it into your new era pro and it will vibrate you know like hey this is this is so is this primed and ready to go is there anything else i need to do here uh no go for it okay cool these are very childhood yeah good you guys you guys got your packaging down and you know as a marketing person i'm i'm very appreciative of aesthetics and uh this this got some to spare so you can definitely take a hit um there's three different settings that we load on these pods so these pods are actually smart pods now so tell me what does that mean smart pod okay so in-house so we what we do is you know we fill the pod and then we tag them okay so whenever you buy a new pod it'll have this red band around it when you pull it into your air pro and you have your app on your phone it'll literally show you like this is a pyramid pod so it'll have our logo okay we'll get the description of the strain it'll tell you the potencies so you know that's one thing that i hate about you know our 510 carts is like you forget what you're smoking a lot of the time so you know we have it engraved on the pod but also when you plug it in it's going to give you description of the strain um and then beyond that um we have an expert temp that we set it to and then you also have a load temp automatically set in a high temp so if you really want that high vapor production with you don't care too much about the turbine preservation yeah you can bump it'll bump up automatically or you can set to like our typical temperature so where am i at right now um you know i think you're probably right in the middle okay realistically because voltage obviously very important part of getting a good grip with a solventless pen specifically and usually lower voltage lower temperature you know if i'm going to spend the money to really get a premium vape i'm not just trying to cook all my terps well i think that's a huge benefit to the pax platform is that you know if you're you know if you're that hashtag and you're looking for that really high quality product using a 510 card is usually not gonna get you there um unless you're using a very expensive battery to get there yeah where this really allows you to dial in your high um and dial in the experience you want to get you know we can take it really low and you're going to get that really good flavor almost like a dry vape yeah um but you're not going to get that that that big cloud so typically i like to pump it up a little bit okay um to get that experience right away well i've sat and heard so much about this strain let's [Music] hmm that's really good i mean it it's interesting because with a vape sometimes you never kind of know what you're gonna get and there's a lot of information there's a lot of education and you know especially with the vape crisis that was you know in full swing last year like having a real nice solvent-less vape like this i i really like the experience especially the rosin experience um out of this i mean it's really hard to replicate a true dab in vape form i think that's what what people criticize vape a lot for yeah people want the convenience especially the purists the purest yeah you know they kind of hate on vape a lot and we're really trying to get these p get those individuals who want that high quality product yeah onto a vaporizing platform and that's what our raw our live rosin pods do especially on the pax platform yeah you know just kind of taking this experience in you know it's it's fruity but it's also got something else behind it like it's very smooth and sometimes some of the really high terpene fruit strains that they're not quite as smooth as what i'm getting in this and you know kind of as it's starting to settle in a little bit and i know you know i didn't blow some monster cloud for everyone on the camera but just you know really enjoying you know having a fine vape it you know for me when i consume it it's not always just about flexing on our video it's about really just having an experience with the products itself um yeah it's great i mean honestly this is the closest you're gonna get to a dab in a vape form um no [ __ ] um i don't know if they can say that but no [ __ ] it's um we could square on our youtube channel this is for adults uh and um it's really good and i i this is pretty much all i smoke now honestly on our platform is our rosin line yeah um just because i think the flavor profile is unmatched among vaporizers and um it's always interesting to try something new yeah so well if i could describe you know after taking a couple hits some real small ones some bigger ones i mean it's fruity i get a little taste of pineapple in there there's almost something in there that is a little more savory and i'm having a hard time putting my finger on it but there's there it it's a strain that's got some depth and i like that um and as far as like the actual experience goes of using this it's it's very seamless um i'm a big fan pineapple trunk great choice on this one you guys uh i just want to smoke this all day this is a tough one well i'm glad you like it you know um we'll definitely get you some samples of some other strains to enjoy and um yeah i'm really glad you're experiencing having a good experience this is a great product thank you guys so much for coming in uh you know the review today obviously the sullivan's pax pod but for those of you out there who also really just want to take a dab and that's the experience you want to have we've also got grams here as well and you guys are going to be doing limited drops of those starting soon is that right yeah yeah that's a plan you know it's been a really popular option and so you know we definitely know that the consumers that are most interested in that are looking for those super premium you know product drops and that's what we're planning on doing um this isn't going to be like a widely available product for us unless it goes absolutely amazing which i think it will so we'll eventually start working work up to it yeah but um it's definitely some limited drop so please stay tuned for that in the near future so you guys are

little savory it has this quality to it that's a little hard to put my finger on but it's a strain that just has these hash overtones mixed with that pineapple that fruit and that's a stray that's a type that i really like uh just that hashy flavor on the exhale it's a good smoke it's a smooth smooth rip the pax is sweet i hadn't seen that pen before all in all great product and they're 50 in

this giveaway all you have to do is a comment down in the comments below so today i just want to show you guys some of this flower i just recently picked up i got a really good deal on it i i really love doing these videos where i can show you know how much of a good deal you can actually get from some of the dispensaries here in florida uh this actually is uh one of the cheaper ounces that i've bought uh here in florida besides you know an ounce from one plant or something like that but this is for 130 i'm really happy i mean you know on the streets i've paid up to 225 250 or even more before for an ounce of you know good weed and it's just for for the price to be able to go to the dispensary and be able to get you know all these test results you know you promise you know that you're getting good clean weed with nothing weird on it it's just it's totally worth it especially for that price so let's crack it open and take a look at it and we'll go from there all right so let's start off with some of this ground flour this is actually the cheapest flour that you can get from truleave and it's a really good deal 25 for 7 grams is what you get in this container right here and at 17 it's actually still really good i've smoked some of this other quarter i got to this i ended up getting a half ounce of this super dab here which isn't a real strain it's rather you know a couple of uh strains of weed that were mixed together to get what they just called super dad you can usually scan this qr code right here and it'll tell you what the mix of wheat is but half the qr codes that truly don't work anyway and this is one of them so unfortunately i can't find out exactly what super dad is but it is a really good mix i really like it even at 17 it's really good let's check it out and see if it weighs exactly seven grams and when i say i like it i mean it's actually some pretty good weed as you can see it's not all just you know like trim or fan leaves there's actually like some you know good nodule like buds in there or was buds it's not just all crap there's a couple of you know like leftover maybe some stems here and there but you're not it's it's nothing like you know some of the other guys flower out there i've uh i've bought some leftovers or shake from some other places and it'd be it'd truly be that for sure but they actually give you a really good deal on the ground it's a some really nice smokeable flower that actually gets you high so i really like that 25 bucks all day long for sure i can't weigh this other quarter of super dad i have because i've already smoked it but we can go ahead and take a look at it real quick it pretty much looks the same as this though i'm not disappointed you know like i said it's a it's a great deal for 25 you can't go wrong with that all right next let's take a look at some of these minis right here we got some 5 g's purple f2 now this isn't the the cheapest bud that you can get like i said that's the cheapest bud you can get you're getting 7 grams of this for 25 here you're getting an eighth or 3.5 grams for uh 27 and they uh they'll discount this for you uh like uh on all this bud i got 25 off except on the ground flour they usually won't discount the ground flower because it's already so cheap as it is for what you're getting but i got it actually 25 off on all this additionally too and the way i usually keep up with that is on their website i i'm on their instagram all the time but they didn't even put that 25 um notice on their instagram was only on their website it's just because i get on their website all the time and check for certain products that i'm looking for so keep on their website look on there all the time and you'll get special deals like that that'll help you bring it down originally this ounce was going to cost me 158 and in addition to the great deal of that i got down to 131 so just another reason to keep up on there just takes you know a couple seconds to log on and look at it real quick that five g's purple f2 has a special smell too it's like tiny and frosty maybe a little skunky at the end really really good smell it's a great strain i really like it this one came in at 17 but it's still probably gonna be really good i can't remember the last time i had it what percentage it was at but it was still just really good and you know it's probably just because of the strain let's see if it weighs 3.7 awesome so even a little bit extra on that let's break open this other uh part of the quarter of this and see what it weighs all together oh this bud actually looks a little bit uh nicer than that like it uh this almost looks like it was cured a little bit longer than that or grown a little bit longer maybe you can see the difference in it here and then when i get a close-up on it it's all together 7.3 for 50 bucks and then it's discounted too you can't go wrong at it check this butt out and last year we got some bubble gum minis now these are only coming in at 16 just below 17 thc but nothing a little thca or shattering your joint can't fix like that especially for that price so let's check these out and see if they weigh too all right here's the first eight a little bit of you know uh kind of shaky stuff in there but still look at that nug right there that's a that's a really nice nug right there 3.9 grams i mean you know i've i've gotten some really big nugs in these minis sometimes i'm not gonna lie sometimes i've opened these uh these minis and look at that i mean look that's a regular sized nug right there it's probably uh almost a gram nug right there there's just there's some there's some really great deals in these minis 7.4 grams look at that check this out well i hope you guys enjoyed the video make sure to subscribe for more we're going to be doing more giveaways like with this raw mat here and we'll see you in the next video you", "UNWHow4VH3k": "well we are back we are back and we are pressing a quarter of moxie viper cookies okay uh this is i haven't i haven't pressed a lot of moxie uh in a while so this will be fun this stuff is ringing in at uh 26.9 percent combined thc thca we've got a 121 micron bag here and the crd 30 ton triptech rosin press is set to 180 degrees fahrenheit i don't use timers i don't use the gauge that's on this pump so please don't ask me how long i leave it on just watch the video and you'll see how long i leave it on for okay so this has been rehydrated with hydra stones and we're going to load this bag up hope everybody is staying safe staying medicated and being good to each other out there just a reminder if you are a medical marijuana patient in the pittsburgh area and you have dispensary flour and you would like to have it turned into gold please come and see me in penn hills here at the studio i do that for patients i press form for free that is a patient's helping patients initiative that i've been doing since 2018 never charge a patient to press their medicine for it it is important that patients get good quality medicine at a price that they can afford and i am trying to help in that respect so here is our quarter get this thing all put into a nice little package and move these lights up here and get this placed right where i want it to be there we go that paper of course anytime you're doing live stuff okay all right so let's get that out of the way and get this centered up where i want it to be get the light in there on it real good so you can see it get real close and put it right there all right here we go let's get this valve closed on the pump let's make some medicine there's nothing i enjoy more right now than just getting the best that this flower can offer and as long as you treat this plant with respect she will give herself to give you the best medicine that you can have much better quality than anything you will get in the dispensary as a concentrate solidness is definitely the way to go and rosin whether it be hash rosin or flower rosin is a step way bigger than any of the commercially available chemically extracted concentrates so let's just remember where the quality is and the flavor because this is a full spectrum extract and take terpenes and winterize it do all kinds of crazy stuff they just you just get the buds and the essence of them their soul that's the way i like to approach it so as you can see it's going to get harder and harder to see so i'm going to let this go now and start concentrating on this press i'm going to let that heat soak in for about 30 seconds before i finish get the full pressure i don't know if there's any big drops tomorrow for the weekend but i would be watching the healing center my tree rise all of those guys because you know how that goes friday if you get a big drop and if you're not ready to grab it online you can lose out real easy all right almost at pressure there we go that's where i want to be with it let it sit there for a minute i'm going to pull this shot back out oh yeah this should be fun so again moxie doesn't come out with a lot of flour they've been coming out with more lately and i don't get a chance to press much of it because it's usually at the high end of the price spectrum not a lot of patients bring it to me so i figured i'd grab some and we'll see what see what it does you know and there isn't a whole lot else you can do except uh try it and it goes into my database you find out how it stacks up against the other grower processors and the other strains that they're putting out so i'm just getting the scale ready i already have a jar make sure i get the tear on that first seventeen yep that's great okay are you ready you ready to see it here we go okay viper cookies what'd you give us oh oh yes oh yeah i'll tell you what take a look at that that looks mighty mighty fine to me so let us get that paper off of here turn off the i am done pressing unless unless there's a patient that comes over with something for me let me get the shot out and redirected all right a small blowout no big deal take my tools here clean a little bit of clean rosin off the end of that but like i said blowouts happen no matter whose bag you're using luckily they don't happen all the time so let's get this fired up tara and philip she looks like a happy plant this thing was coming off looking like it was made from washed flour uh and that it didn't just come from straight flour some of this consistency is very reminiscent of a lot of hash rosin i see being shown on ig gas rosin's fantastic it's just not practical for medical patients in pennsylvania because of our prices you know so pennsylvania and the medical marijuana program flower rosin is king of solidness because you can't get the good stuff good ash rosin at the dispensers they don't sell it they don't make it people who do make it aren't making it for the legal market so best you're gonna get medicine wise from somebody who can craft it immediately for you somebody like me who's doing flower rosin just like this gotta love this plant with all your heart to be good at doing this consistently you got to be having access to flour that is of amazing quality to get this kind of result oh this stuff came out so beautiful oh yeah oh moxie my good friend dave perlow gabe pirlo who is the ceo of moxie he and i have had a very nice relationship as far as his business ideas about doing solventless believe me when the feds lift the the lid off this whole thing and deschedule this plant you're gonna start seeing a lot more solventless on the market because it will be on the recreational side probably but you will see it moxie has always been a concentrate centric company it started off they didn't have the canopy enough to to sell flowers so all they sold were their really nice concentrates and their cartridges i love their cartridges liquid moxies melon wreck is awesome ellerange is fantastic a big fan of their distillate cartridges but their flowers always been kind of rare you know now they're stepping up their their production ability and now they're coming out with more flour which is really cool so let's see what we got for a yield and wow 0.61 well when you take away the 17 grams for the jar that is well that is not what i would consider an acceptable yield okay again my bare minimum acceptable yield is half half a gram per eight this comes out to be point three per eighth which i mean here's the thing though the quality is amazing okay and in terms of the look of it it smells incredible you know but there it is maybe i can get it you can see the better light i mean look at the quality of that there's no disputing the fact that moxie makes really good flour the problem is the flour that they make or that they grow doesn't have the wax and lipid profiles to make them a good candidate for solventless extraction via rosin press so always bear in mind that when you're going to buy flour you need to pick strains that work for you and you have to be willing to accept that you may get a strain like this like this viper cookies which looks to be amazing probably going to taste incredible uh but the yield is not sufficient for for me from for me personally it may be for you as a patient you may be a baller and can afford to buy enough eights to get enough of this pressed to make it worth medicating with it i tend to look for the higher producing strains i think this is an excellent strain i bet it's a great strain for the other uses dry vaping quote unquote um but for rosin it's one i would probably take a pass on personally but if you're seeing this and you're liking what you see grab yourself some dispensary flower and get on over here to penn hills and come and see me and i will do this for you too stay safe stay medicated be good to each other everybody have a good day", "G3AFzRuIKzs": "ow yeah that was rough [Music] i used to have this little series on my instagram where i would post a collage for four different strains and i would have the people decide which one they thought was the best and i figured it'd be fun if we did a similar game on youtube so i'm gonna try four different strains out and you guys are gonna tell me which one you think is the best in the comments i picked up a little gram flight of four different strains from grassroots today we have birthday cake garlic cookies chem dog and motor breath it was just my birthday the other day so we're gonna start with the birthday cake this strain is super [ __ ] popular in pa right now it's a cross between girl scout cookies and cherry pie let me pop the bottle get a fresh whip oh my god it just smells so sweet it smells a little bit like girl scout cookies but sweeter super small buds that's mainly because i got grams i'm assuming all of these buds are going to be pretty small bright white trichomes that are just popping out of the nugs it's super sticky too definitely need a grinder to break this one up birthday cake usually tests pretty high in the thc department but this one's only tested at about 20 percent thc merciness the most prominent terpene in this one got a super clean slide here so i can really appreciate that flavor all right the bowls loaded up bongs ready to go holy [ __ ] that was smooth oh my god i love the effects of this one it's not a total couch lock but it's super chill i feel bad for the next three strains because this one's gonna be hard to beat all right next i guess we'll do the garlic cookies i haven't had garlic cookies from this company before but garlic cookies is also known as gmo but let's see how this one smells oh that's foul garlic cookies is just such a unique odor this one is super garlicky though the garlic is the most prominent smell it looks just like the gmo i reviewed it's a little less purple but there's still some purple patches in there it just looks so fire it smells so great it smokes so good it really does look amazing i'm really never disappointed by the strain it's testing over 25 thc super high in terpenes it's 0.5 mercen 0.5 limonene i'm ready to pack a bowl of this and see how this smokes got the gmo packed up another clean slide we're keeping the same dirty ass bong though i don't really care that much [Music] holy [ __ ] i just [ __ ] love gmo that's just fine garlic cookies i mean that [ __ ] smokes great has a nice hint of garlic to it but it's not like an overwhelming flavor this was honestly smoother than the birthday cake i think i really did enjoy that garlic cookies but i don't know if it was better than the birthday cake they're both definitely fire though i'm pretty [ __ ] ripped all right next we're gonna smoke chem dog this one is the father of garlic cookies they crossed this with girl scout cookies to get garlic cookies let's crack this one open this one is super chemy as much as i am a fan of garlic cookies in gmo i'm just not a big fan of chem dog it just doesn't have the best smell to me it just smells like there's like something wrong with it i don't know like some people love chem dog i know some people that it's their favorite strain but it just does not call my name too often but these buds actually do look pretty good they're frosty nice bright green it was definitely grown well and has a very strong scent its total thc is about 20 we're gonna smoke this one out the jaws slide hopefully it smokes a little better than it smells hmm honestly it doesn't really have much of a taste compared to the other strains this one is way less impressive and way less unique to me this is just your average run-of-the-mill strain definitely not bad and the effects so far feel all right at this point it's kind of hard to tell how the high is because i have the other two strains sitting on top of it i really can't complain ultimately with this strain i just wouldn't pick it as the best one for sure all right last but probably not least we're gonna try out this motor breath i've never had this from grassroots so i'm really curious to see what this one's gonna be like definitely has a gassy smell to it it almost reminds me of sour diesel to an extent the buds look kind of basic though not gonna lie it might just be because i only got a gram of it they're dense and sticky but it's just not the prettiest looking strain it's testing a little over 20 thc ow yeah that was rough had a pretty earthy flavor but that was definitely the roughest of all the strains this stream wasn't the best but it was good the garlic cookies and the birthday cake are way more unique strains in my opinion if i had to rate these from best to worst it would be garlic cookies and number one it would be birthday cake and number two it would be motor breath at number three and chem dog at number four that's just my opinion though and that's always subject to change but that's how i feel about this right now don't forget let me know in the comments what you guys think is the best one it is super difficult to accurately rate these off of one bowl pack so if i had like a whole ounce of each one of these it might be a little bit different of a mindset but that's what i'm going with off of the first impression let me know if you'd want to see more of these or something like this this is my first time doing something like this so i don't really know what you guys are going to think about it i had fun doing it i always loved mixing strains trying new strains out so this was a fun video for me to do so make sure you give me a like if you enjoyed this video leave a comment let me know what you think and don't forget to subscribe i got a lot more videos on the way and if you need more popcorn in your life you can basically follow me

midweek snack we have our bowl of various snacks in here so let's go ahead and dive on in and give me something like it's like a bad claw game this okay so raw rev um raw rev actually sent us a variety pack of their different bars and we tried one of them i don't remember which one i think it might have been like some double chocolate thing but i set the other ones that i didn't try in the bowl so here we have creamy peanut butter and sea salt these are a relatively small bar 15 grams of protein 14 grams of fiber 2 grams of sugar gluten-free non-gmo yeah so anyway we're going to try them out uh periodically there's the company mission statement you know check them out online if you'd like nutritional facts and do we have an ingredients list [Music] uh oh oh it's okay so it's below the nutritional facts so it is down there yeah a lot of different proteins p peanut pea protein brown rice protein raw organic kemp protein coconut oil a lot of that good stuff so you know there's a ton of uh companies that do like the you know the raw ingredients or the organic organic ingredients so just do your research but these are very small little bars as you can as you can tell i do love peanut butter though this just comes apart that's not bad um it's pretty plain honestly but i will say it definitely does take on the taste of a raw peanut which i do like i mean it's one of the favorite things about going to baseball games is just getting a big old bag of roasted salted peanuts i'm just sitting there and eating them so you definitely get that raw peanut taste which i don't know i mean most peanut butter just isn't that you know it has so much other content and most people wouldn't even know what to do with raw peanut butter but anyway yeah not bad not like a huge flavor though so if you're looking for something really smacky in the face with flavor um this isn't quite there but if you do like the taste of like a nice you know raw roasted peanut roll wrap might be the way to go so check them out if you feel like it and there was a big old piece of sea salt that i just crunched down on i will say this i hate when people put the put these big crystals of sea salt i don't want that in my bar it goes again i don't want it i actually it's nothing against raw rev a lot of people do this it's a trend i hope this trend dies like okay fine put sea salt in it grind that bad boy i don't want to crunch on on uh salt crystals i just don't um anyway rant over hopefully you guys enjoyed please don't forget to like comment and subscribe and if you'd like to see

we're going to go back to our our higher tip that i like to do that 202 we're gonna go ahead and uh we'll see how that does got some more parchment so i got the uh pucks properly wrapped up now and prepped in the appropriate size parchment sleeves so we should be able to get a decent flow and we'll just have to see what we get and we'll adjust the temperature as needed i don't imagine we'll be

[ __ ] gave me the forest whitaker eye damn [Music] go i hope that everything goes good man [Music] christoph kristoff 54 big up de france i don't speak french i just made that [ __ ] up i think that's probably how you read that [ __ ] as you can tell i learned my french from dexter's laboratory i'm led fromage that's uh yeah that's about as good as we're gonna get on that one [Music] [Music] i gotta now i gotta google this [ __ ] i don't know what you're saying but i gotta find out i gotta find out he said okay goodbye [Music] [Music] the power what pleasure strength i'm sorry is that being is that being culturally insensitive am i being stereotypical am i stereotyping i'm sorry let's get this press started i'm banked already [Music] um [Music] excuse me excuse me hold on the tripod get you guys set up and then um we'll go from there [Music] hey [Music] dabbing gloves big force the team oh the team sounds like he's trying to say like uh the team is strong like big up to the team [Music] am i am i right we just started working at amazon working overnights that means you're packing [ __ ] women's dildo orders and [ __ ] huh doing all the freaky [ __ ] overnight i got you on that [ __ ] [ __ ] it's okay boy what else could they use the overnight [ __ ] for at amazon that's gotta be it that's gotta be so [Music] [Music] [Music] my man said he's part of the ginyu force that's what he said until we figure out what he's saying we're just gonna assume that he's saying he's part of the ginyu force [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] foreign oh this one gets loud oh so good return puck feels uh pretty well emptied and got off the plates pretty quick and was the same color or lighter than yesterday a slightly better return feels like so i dropped the temperature a little bit but not much because this stuff does just come out darker because in the terps [Music] so i still want to keep the flow high [Music] myself [Music] uh wow i'm allowed to give you guys information soon but i can't give you information on pricing yet i was told i have to wait until science led makes the official announcement and gets them on their site and then by then they'll have like um shipping times and you'll be able to pre-order and [ __ ] they don't want to put out the information too soon so they told me to wait trust me i'm i'm so ready to tell you guys [Music] you know [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] [Music] i'm at uh 190 right now it's just looking off because the lighting is [ __ ] and this is a trim run bro here maybe this will help you guys with the color issue i know it's hard to tell but you'll see you'll see get this in the jar and then we're going to go ahead and start the next puck that was a good temperature and we're gonna run it at that time yeah i don't really have a good spot you guys where you're not gonna be in the [ __ ] way i'll try and move you over a little bit i think my laptop could be [ __ ] maybe let me see food grade month okay you guys if you say so you know what determines whether it's food grade or not how clean it melts when i show you how clean it melts you're gonna be like oh okay yeah that's not food grade the trichomes that come off of trim is usually going to be more mature because it's exposed to more direct light than the rest of the trichomes that are covered in the plant matter right so when you process trim it's going to come out slightly more amber too all right and then if you're dealing with a strain that's really really terpy and depending on what those terpenes are can also make it darker right so never judge judge it by the color alone and be quick to say oh that's food grade or that's not good like it's really really hard to judge it based off of color alone especially fresh off the press so oh yeah definitely people judge with their eyes first for sure you eat with your eyes first you judge off of appearance first but again this is fresh off the plates and you got to give me a couple days and work my magic on it telling you guys i'm telling you huh i want to mention just my lighting is [ __ ] probably back you guys the [ __ ] up huh um the plan is going to be to whip this all up and heat mat it and then burp it at um at a certain point [Music] so good extraction on that one too this is going to turn out just like the los altos did it's gonna turn into that like jam with chunks in it and i'm gonna love it we'll love every minute of it there's not good light over here where's the best light for me let's go in here oh no [ __ ] that room goes crazy let's try right here man the light [ __ ] right now there we go how's that color looking it looks like [ __ ] when you look at it from the top because the camera can't perceive the light the same way but it's just terpius [ __ ] so and you would think oh the lower temperature you go the lighter it'll be no because it just takes too long to get off the plates and we already tried 200 that was too hot then 190 is is the sweet spot it's the best it's gonna get for uh for this i mean i can go like 155 160 and press like five grams at a time maybe get a different result but i'm not pressing five [ __ ] grams at a time that's not what's gonna happen today i wonder if it would help so this is gonna get real silly if i don't put you guys down soon oh this is between 16 to 22 grams in every one of these bags how did you already know right my man saw the board behind me and added it up already my press is feminine thank you her name is bertha so yes she is feminine it's not the craziest smell actually because i'm not running it too hot but it's like a minty coffee lag oh there's some fat ass chunks in this hmm two more oh my goodness we always gotta get one or two huh you know actually i think that you've been on this channel being done before you are the weakest link bye [Music] [Music] i don't know yet my yield on this run yet because we're in the middle of doing it right now i'm not trying to be a smart ass but open your eyes [Music] how old is the material it was a couple weeks old when it was given to me about two weeks old i want to say sat in the freezer for a couple weeks i don't know if uh what the yield has been i haven't really been weighing anything yet so i'll just wait and see i'll wait and find out at the end and i get a veggie burger with uh grilled onions no tomato with fries with uh spread i mean i put my own beyond meat burger patty on it when i get home still enjoy in and out but do it the vegan way yeah buddy but also whoever did mention edibles for food grade i am going to turn a good portion of my cut into edibles or at least caps really potent caps rosin gaps no i didn't do anything today i'm working working working working working and uh somebody else says one more and then collection and then we're going to stir it all up and get it going on the heat map i'm gonna heat mat it at least overnight i'll show you guys i have no secrets no secrets whatsoever i don't time anything i don't look at the gauge anything if i don't know who you are on the gram or if you don't follow or like somebody i know doesn't follow you then i don't accept you you got to tell me what your name is so that i can go and accept you and maybe maybe if i've seen your name around here enough i'll accept it otherwise you gotta know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody to know somebody so yeah there i'm gonna start doing a lot more live sessions that are gonna be more interactive i'm gonna set up uh a streaming session in the new hash set so it'll be a good stable connection and we'll be able to have some proper lighting in there our windows uh vented sunlight and we'll be able to have some real good sessions okay so so yo i watched this uh hugh hefner docu-series with my wife and it was actually pretty interesting i didn't know that he was so involved in social issues it was really interesting to see that and how he went against the grain with racism and segregation and he would invite um all these black stars to come onto his show right and he had aretha franklin and um brain farting on the other person and but he had like a bunch of different up and coming artists and he wasn't afraid to have them come and perform at his club because he didn't care he didn't see color he just saw talent and he wanted to make it known what his company stood for and didn't stand for and so he interviewed like he did really really in-depth interviews with a lot of celebrities and at one point he did an in-depth interview with malcolm x and malcolm x was you know saying his typical stuff very radical extremist stuff and mind you majority of the readers of playboy back at this time are white and he published it against the advice of all the other people that were working for and he published it unedited and well not unedited like they edited it but they didn't like edit his answers or change his wording they left it all exactly how he said it you know um and i'm like yo that that's [ __ ] ballsy and he got a lot of support for it actually afterwards and a lot of readers wrote in and said that was awesome thanks for sharing that interview blah blah blah so yeah man that was that was really interesting to watch that and obviously to watch his back and forth with struggling to be um you know married and father and all these different things that he just couldn't [ __ ] do living in the [ __ ] mansion i think any normal man would succumb to that [ __ ] after a while especially after being away from your wife the man was surrounded by titties and ass 24 7. like i think he had so much titties and ass i would get tired of it i would be like [ __ ] put some clothes on like it's not even exciting anymore to see your titties they're just always out like put some clothes on surprise me i want to come around the corner and just be like ah titties surprise it's been three days then i'm gonna be like oh titties but if i see titties every time i walk around the [ __ ] house i'm titties like what like it's like looking at an elbow it's just not gonna matter anymore you know just doesn't [ __ ] matter anymore i don't know how that man stayed excited by i guess maybe there was just so many different kinds of titties i don't know i think i would get over it titty climbing wall bro you know how much i just pictured that [ __ ] on my head like a rock climbing wall but instead of rocks his titties yo oh my god you are creative you are creative that is funny he says my friend has a thing for elbows i mean i'm a classic i'm a classy man i i like exposed shoulders if my wife ever has like a shirt that is like has one of those wide neck collars and you know her shoulder starts to show a little bit i'm like oh that's classy sexy i'm an old man i guess but hey can we get a quick vote while i take this dab a quick vote side boob is 2003 but it's okay quick vote he said yes yo kristoff i wish i knew what you were saying somebody tell me what he's saying titty sprinkles by morgan you know desensitized from titties and ass yeah man i'm telling you bro why you think he needed them pills bro he didn't excite him no more he couldn't do it all right here's my poll thongs or booty shorts drop it in the chat right now that's all i want to know thongs or booty shorts this is going to tell me everything i need to know about every last one of you from here on out i'm deciding your face as a friend or a foe choose wisely how [ __ ] would you guess cheers man cheers i'm going to show you guys how [ __ ] clear this is too here you", "dtKuAxDnHQE": "what is up youtube this is friend of a dude and this is the final update on the three by three flower tent powered by the growers choice 315. um yeah it's been an interesting run you know i like always seem to be too busy with life to really pay attention to this run but you know no excuses uh you can see everything the ice cream cake just never really caught back up to speed and you can see up here these look freaking awesome let's start with the apple printer just looking amazing like always and then we move over here we have the wedding crasher you can see looking beautiful the only thing is uh the weight on the wedding crusher is pretty small but whatever you know moving on the ice cream cake it didn't come out terrible obviously it's not what i wanted but it still looks smokable as far as quality is concerned a lot of the leaves browned out but you can see that it's smokeable and then at the back it's noisy we got the mimosa looking awesome smelling really good so that's the end of this run um you know i'm hoping uh i can do better next run obviously you know it's uh disappointing when something like this happens but it's kind of uh my first time growing that strain so you can see everything else did really well so the strain and it's all unified so the strain is just a little bit more picky maybe but in either case scenario it is what it is i'm not too disappointed obviously the weight the weight of this round is not going to be anywhere where the last round was i already know that but it's all uh you know it's all learning experience and at the end of the day this is for fun so anyone out there who takes this too seriously know that this is literally just for fun this is not me trying to to claim any sort of like status in the growing world obviously this is not something i would brag about but this is definitely something that i'm stoked on just having a head stash a little flavor patch maybe we can work on that ice cream cake for the future and just keep things rolling so yeah i'm going to reset this tent i'm going to harvest here and then reset with more apple fritter more wedding crasher and i think i'm gonna try the ice cream cake again i i'm kind of determined to see where i went wrong and see if i can do it better next time so yeah i'm gonna go ahead and uh get these girls chopped down let them start to dry and just get working on moving forward you know next time i think i'm going to do less plants just to see if i can manage it better with maybe like six to eight plants instead of twelve so other than that everything is you know looking really good i'm just excited to smoke this to be honest with you this is uh what i'm looking forward to so it is what it is uh you know i wish there was more and wait but i'm happy with it so thanks for tuning along sorry for the lack of updates like i said had a lot of crazy [ __ ] going on in my life and this little head stash tent was the least of my worries and concerns so um yeah thanks for following along if you have and uh look out for future updates i'm definitely still going to be posting videos amongst the craziness going on but um just probably not weekly so yeah stay tuned subscribe feel free to like comment all the fun stuff and uh i'll catch you guys soon take care peace", "OXQddbQJfq0":

weed song and then we'll talk music and weed with charles after that [Music] so let's go smoke some grass it's time to bust out this [Music] i always love talking uh with artists on this show artists of of any kind and you know not specifically always people in the cannabis industry but people that kind of use cannabis for their industry and really happy to welcome charles to the show from uh sea of carls charles panalino and first of all charles i guess how long have you been producing music what kind of genre do you guys have for the sea of cars um so as far as producing and writing uh sea cars actually only started a little more than five years ago um our first show was actually on my mom's birthday um in december uh happy birthday mom uh and it just kind of started as a solo project it was just something i was doing in a small studio that me and my dad had in in our house and um after writing our first ep and working on it um took it somewhere really recorded at a studio um and after that i i just really felt you know i wanted i want to start playing this is something i think i really want to do um and recruited my drummer and ever since the rest is history about yeah so about five years have been uh write music as soon cars nice all right so tell us a little bit about the genre who's in the band uh give us the details on that um very small uh outfit we're only a two piece we did originally start as a three um but unfortunately our bass player at the time he just had a lot of personal things going on and felt you know he needed to step away um so i didn't let that hinder us we just pretty much ever since continued as a two-piece um i would like to have a bass player but you know i'm not beat up by it because um kind of adding to what our genre is because of what i view our genre as i use my guitar tones and i build my tones around that to kind of compensate for that heavy bass i give my my guitar a little bit more of a bassy tone um so we kind of go along the lines of a like a ambient um experimental post punk is what i like to say um but you know dean er genre is such a big thing at this point i feel like it's so hard to pinpoint and anytime someone comes up to me and asks i just like internally i feel bad to myself for picking jobs because i mean i just we're so much stuff that and that's why i put the experimental tag because i just i don't like to stick to one thing i like to because i like all different genres and i like to put that in the music to show that i listen to hey not just maybe you know punk music or indie music or alternative stoner rock or something like that and yeah so ultimately i'd say we're kind of just atmospheric experimental music all right i like it people can find the website as if they're watching you can see it seafcars.bandcamp.com and where else can they find your music um we are man pretty much on any any streaming service you can think of we got spotify we're up there on apple deezer pandora i literally i think uh the company we go through they just uh they get your stuff out on i think it's like 50 like 45 50 plus things so i'm sure you could type it in and it'll just pull up everything excellent all right let's talk a little bit about uh cannabis now uh you know we're gonna discuss more about music but let's talk a little bit about cannabis and you know when did cannabis become part of your personal life and why ah so as far as personal life uh about the age of 21 i met a group younger and uh they they were big users of cannabis so ever since then pretty much uh end of the line i've been a user ever since nine years all right let's talk a little bit about cannabis and music now do you have any rituals um when you're writing music that maybe involve cannabis or or any kind of uh combination uh for you and with cannabis and music yeah of course i mean pretty much almost any time um i go to sit down um and play on my guitar more so for the purpose of um creating music for sea of cards yeah i usually try to to smoke a little bit just because it usually will help um and i find with the sativas it's it really helps a lot um and even when if i just want to sit down and like play my drums and and goof off i'll i'll do but yeah definitely it helps me to to smoke and to really get into that creative niche most of the time do you have any kind of go-to crea cultivars that that you really feel help with uh creativity or do you kind of try to mix it up a little bit so maybe you don't are always depending on the one thing because you know the great thing about the the the plant is that we all react a little bit differently to it so what might uh stimulate creativity for me might not for you of course yeah they have that endocannabinoid system um you know i i found a strain recently from my dispensary called mr clean um and that has just i bought two eighths of it and i'm still and i i mean i bought it probably about like two and a half three months ago almost and i'm still sitting on about three grams a little less of it because i enjoy it so much that i don't want to use it right away because i want to use it for when i'm creative um so yeah mr clean has been a good one for me lately uh what about writing have you written any songs specifically about cannabis not yet um and i actually had an idea a while back when i was going to school and a buddy and i my uh mine we were smoking in my car and those little tree air fresheners that are in cars uh we kind of looked at that and we were smoking and we were we're looking at that and we're like you know we could kind of he's like you could make a little song you know about like the two of these kind of mixed together you could call it little trees so i have that actually as a note in my phone on so who knows that might that might turn into something i might do i might reference it on this next album because we're actually in the process of writing for our next album so maybe i'll throw that in there that's good seafcars.bandcamp.com what music uh and and this is probably a bit of a kind of an open-ended question but what music do you think goes well with cannabis and and try not to say every music but maybe give me something right specific uh maybe bands or something that you really think uh go well or songs for that matter um you know i'm gonna i'm gonna rep them again because i think i had said something about them in one hitters but this uh shirt i'm actually wearing wilco they are a chicago band they've been around for for years though at this point um they're older than i am a lot older um but their music is just some of the most like laid back just happy feeling upbeat and i i just i actually have a role in my car whenever i hear wilco come on shuffle i have to smoke because i just i just think they're the perfect band to smoke too um but yeah other than that i feel like i love metal music i used to play even in a mel band and all we did was smoke so um metal music for sure too yeah i enjoy it that's a good game to play with wilco provided you're not you're not the driver and you know yeah right pulling over a lot to uh to wait for the effect yeah exactly uh speaking of uh illinois and chicago in the area that you're in they legalized uh medical marijuana in 2013 and recreational use uh became able for you guys just this last year what has it been like sin is since illinois is legalized um uh it's it seems it seems like they're doing pretty well here um i mean the dispensaries i go to everybody is always super informational super helpful um they've actually been talking with me about getting my medical card uh because i'm actually trying to get in you know the process of that going and um you know it's the recreational it seems a little laggy still compared to medical just because um like you said we're pretty fresh into it here um so we haven't reached that point where we're hanging out like denver or seattle and we got these nice you know let me go buy a half an ounce of shake for 20 bucks and some tax um we're still paying like you know 55 to 65 an eighth depending on you know your strain and the thc content that's in it but um i mean it's it's seems like it's just going up and up though i mean i see more and more people every time i go to a dispensary here um i mean i myself just recently i i mean i've gone here and there to our dispensaries and but you know this this is the way they got to do it and um you know this is going to help the bad and sometimes shady things that happen in the black market and that's kind of why i switched to going to the dispensary i figured i'd rather pay a little more and know what i'm getting than to go and buy the stuff that you know you might ask them hey what what is this an indica or sativa even and they don't even know that you know um and i think it's going to be these dispensaries really obviously being able to provide the information that's going to draw people away from the black market and it's only going to make um you know recreational and medical weed more prominent and grow no pun intended exactly well there's 86 episodes of education for them right here on the cannabis 101 podcast and that's what we try to provide for a lot of people i mean i mean i remember when legalized legalization happened in canada the lineups were so long uh there was one store in the city that i lived in and the lineups were crazy long was it was it like that in the beginning or has it kind of been like a slow rollout you know from what i've seen here in chicago it was pretty i think everybody was just at this point ready for it because i mean chicago's a you know top three sorry my cat um distracting me um the people were ready i mean we're one of the top three cities pretty much in in you know america here you got california with los angeles you know then new york new york and then it's chicago pretty much and you know i feel chicagoans were just they were at that point where they're like okay come on you know why did we we're we're eating past all these other states who have legalized already and you know we're chicago we haven't done so when it first rolled out here people were they were lined it was definitely not slow it was we were ready for here in chicago for that but that is good uh chicago's uh you know one of the best sports cities out there and i'm you know a lot of shows that i do are about sports and definitely on my bucket list to go to and now that there is legalization i will uh get to chicago at some point have you looked at working in the industry at all is this something that you know obviously you have a passion about music and cannabis do you think you'll look into working and i wonder you know how is the the job creation going do you think uh definitely i actually started looking not too long ago um and i've been applying for some um positions i did actually get two emails about positions but unfortunately just because i've recently become a father in the last year and um you know just other personal um things that are mixed into mine in my fiance's life it's just hard for me to get and get into certain schedules so unfortunately i just couldn't work the times that they were looking for which unfortunately they didn't list that within their listings so i didn't know what they were looking for exactly um but yeah i've been looking i would i would love to even if it's just as a picker so you know trimmer to bud tender i just i would love to work with cannabis at all but um i mean every time i look uh more and more positions it seems like it's just getting bigger here in illinois and we got a lot of space out here uh in fields especially down south so it seems to be where most of cultivation is done and that's kind of the other problem i'm towards pretty much the actual city of chicago and all that it's like two hours away so it it's gonna be a bit difficult but if i can i would love to i would love to welcome congratulations on becoming a father and you know family comes first and then uh work on things as you go up you kind of mentioned uh some of the cool cultivars that you've been been able to find when you go into those dispensaries i know the education is is going to get there and that takes time but you know what is the selection and then the quality like selection is actually pretty good um and not that i it would have really any correlation but for like the prices of what um you know you pay out here i i didn't imagine there would be such a big selection but um right to the left of me i actually have a a huge just stock because recently with um you know i got my tax refund so i decided to treat myself and um i've actually recently just been trying a lot of um like staple cultivars that most people you know go bonkers for i i got maui wowie here pineapple express actually and i feel like that when i told a couple my friends they were shocked they're like you never tried pineapple express before i said no i just never had the chance to get it and you know i got i gotta say dopest dope i've ever smoked um but yeah they got definitely a huge huge selection out here very i love maui maui is uh is definitely one of my favorite uh you know blue dream is my jam but maui when i can find it i grab it whenever i can um well you know what about other areas in your life we talk about creativity and and helping with music uh is cannabis do you use it for any other parts of your life definitely uh you know almost almost every single part to be honest uh you know i it was about a year ago maybe maybe two that i've i started personally viewing it as medicine um and not just that you know drug that oh yo they're gonna smoke weed you know let's just smoke weed everybody let's get high um because and honestly uh your your podcast dean was a big a big push into that because i really when i heard your slogan for the first time it really it really hit home uh because it's not just about really getting high it is about getting healthy because you know this this plant has all these um components to it and all these properties that really are helpful and you know it's unfortunate to see what it was like for cannabis through time up until this point but it's great that people are coming around yeah because i use it for mental illness even um you know i struggle and i know from listening to your show you know you're no stranger to that world and um you know people need to not be worried or that's pretty much what you guys talk about time the stigma needs to be gone gotta get rid of that stigma um yeah i use it for everything yeah and it's important to to make sure people know that you know it i i don't smoke a joint and all of a sudden my depression is gone you know like it's not it's not a cure-all for things it can help with a number of things you know but uh you know for people that that do have mental health issues you know do not just substitute do not stop taking your prescription medications do not stop going to therapy it can help with those things i go to therapy you know i i use other supplements that i use so important to know that it can help it's not a cure-all but it can be a big benefactor uh you know in you know as you know and as i know all right i want to ask you a couple more music questions before we wrap up who's a musician and combined with cannabis that you look up to is there is there somebody out there that that is kind of like a cannabis musician idol honestly kind of going back to uh the story from my one hitters uh that that that vocalist and guitarist that i had smoked with the one time they pretty much since the time that i i really even before i i smoked cannabis and i listened to them i knew they were partakers and um yeah yeah but it would it would really have to it would have to be uh that vocalist trevor stranada is his name from the black value murder i look up to him very much so we got a nice shot of um you guys jamming out here tell me how you came up with the name sea of cars oh man you're gonna be tired of hearing about this i actually got it from the band wilco um shout out to them um they have a song called in a future age off of an album called summer teeth and in that song um he says hi above the sea of cars and i just i i just it really resonated with me for some reason and i sometimes people kind of get a chuckle out of it because i'll tell them the name and they they don't they don't hear it correctly so i have to i usually then will have to use the example like oh you know how you're driving by a big parking lot and you're like wow look at that sea of cars and then they get it on but yeah that's i i took it from a wilco uh lyric because i love them and i just really liked it just sounded different nice tribute as well people can find uh sea of cars.bandcamp.com and listen to your music as well as all streaming platforms all right let's wrap up with this i always love to ask every one of my guests because it's an opinion and opinions can't be wrong what do you think is the next big thing in cannabis now you know here in canada you know we have a lot of things going on you guys are just dipping your toes in it uh in in a lot of different states you know you know i think there's only about 14 states uh that don't have some form of legalization in the united states but in your opinion what do you think will be the next big thing in cannabis uh you know hopefully we can take a page out of canada's book really and i i feel like i feel like them trying to do it locally and through state was not the best idea um but i mean what are you gonna do uh so i feel like the next biggest thing they can really do is just you know talk sit down get on a federal level like you guys are and i i feel like that's what's really gonna gonna be what helps america really get that okay everybody get behind cannabis like we need to do this so hopefully we could see that here but again like you said there's not a lot of states there's some that are lagging and i feel like it's going to be a long time for america to get there you know it's but it's interesting we talked on hour one with david wiley from uh the oz on this week in cannabis news is very quickly the united states is going to be sandwiched between two federally legalized countries we're already legal mexico is uh rolling it out and and they're they're going to legal be legal soon you look at countries in europe that are going to get the ball rolling you know it's just it's just putting more and more pressure on the united states to realize this is a plant and it's not it shouldn't be in the same schedule as heroin so the pressure's mounting and it's gonna happen yeah it's it's just ridiculous to see how how how wrong cannabis has done here in america and and how we have to be so pretty much self-centered on our own opinion of everything you know no offense to america but i mean that's essentially what you're doing when you're you know you have all these you know countries doing everything pretty much universally and you're just gonna be the odd man out like it's not how you make friends that's not how you have a good time that's right uh playground etiquette playground etiquette hey exactly there you go yeah playground all right this has been a lot of fun my man uh i really enjoy getting to know you i appreciate the uh the the love that you uh give us on social media and the education that we've been able

ianson regional manager at plantlife cannabis make sure you use the click and collect on their website and we're gonna have uh some details uh in this segment about how you can uh really really get some good deals at uh a new location but i bring in my friend chris ianson our educator on know your buds how are things tonight my man uh things are going really good buddy it's uh it's been a pretty sweet day so far uh yeah i'm pumped to get this one going with you yeah i'm excited about uh this one as well um you know i i ran into and and and was able to meet uh the woman behind this company uh pre-covered when we were actually allowed to uh get out and celebrate and do some different things so excited about this one for sure we are doing blue topaz which is hurricane nine and it is an 80 to 20 indica and these are pre-rolls uh right here beautiful from the queen of bud so let's talk about queen of bud because this is a company uh that has been you know really really growing quite quickly and effectively haven't they chris yeah totally dean um they started up pretty much at legalization there october uh 2018 the founder ashley newman uh the queen herself uh started the brand off with uh with a retail shop in calgary alberta and it was a really kind of high-end shop really um really fancy looking all the decor all the you know displays in the store just had a really kind of fancy uh real pretty vibe to it uh yeah there you can see it there just just gorgeous uh and and the store there in calgary was a big hit uh big success and they went on to open up a second location in toronto uh ontario and uh with that the kind of retail brand was rolling and um she also had quite a quite a large uh social media uh following uh you know currently she has over 82 000 followers on her instagram so uh just a big presence on social media there uh and she kind of realized she wanted to make a more distinct role in the cannabis industry and and a partnership was formed between the queen of bud and uh the kanjuri cannabis facility uh and they started growing queen of bud cannabis and uh so now we're seeing uh pre-rolls and apes uh from them and it's uh it's awesome yeah this uh uh when we get to my experience and and your experience you'll find out how the uh the first pre-roll went for me last night and wouldn't you believe it my lighter has uh conked out in this one so anyway i'm gonna grab a lighter will you tell us a little bit about meeting ashley newman because she is a force when i met her i was at a alberta cannabis council event in calgary and she just kind of really captivated the room people kind of wanted to get in and talk to her and find out what she was thinking and things like that and she just kind of seems to be able to draw the room to her and you know really has some bright ideas i really enjoyed the conversation with her and some of her staff members yeah yeah totally dino uh i think that's that's well said about the the energy she's got a great energy to her uh and you know people want to uh you know be around her um for sure so i ended up running into her in a couple different plant life stores she was up here in edmonton uh checking in on some retail shops and uh had the pleasure to meet her with uh with uh plant life's own vanessa brown there they were touring around together and uh i mean just uh very positive uh very intelligent very grateful too uh just super happy to to be in the cannabis space and and happy to be uh you know doing what she's doing um so it was very very awesome to um yeah get to know her as well uh a wonder wonderful wonderful person uh hopefully we can get her on the on the podcast here uh later on dino that would be i think uh pretty awesome um and uh i've got a i've got a quote from her website here uh and it states uh you know ashley newman is a passionate entrepreneur and mother having worked in many different industries from construction to marketing and retail ashley was elated to finally end up in cannabis her devotion to cannabis began when she was looking for a natural alternative method to live her best life since then cannabis has been a major part of ashley's life and she hopes to break the stigma surrounding the use of the plant and educate consumers on the cannabis category as a whole so just truly awesome there i am 100 down with that message there um that whole stigma with cannabis is such a big thing for me um so i think yeah it's super important to be breaking that and uh yeah it's uh just a tremendous story uh with the queen of bud here yeah real uh becoming a real force in the uh the cannabis industry so let's talk about you know i love the transition from retail to growing let's talk about the facility that they are growing this uh wonderful bud at oh yes it's uh it's the kangaroo cannabis facility and it's uh it's located at the base of the rocky mountains in uh sundry alberta so just near olds there uh and the name of the facility the facility is called calyptra and it's a it's a state-of-the-art facility it's over 43 000 square feet they've got 12 different isolated grow rooms uh equipped with advanced control technology um i've been told i may be getting a tour of this facility in the near future so i'm super excited to uh go down there and check it out uh there's definitely some uh some really cool uh brands that we see in the wreck market that are being grown at this kandra facility as well uh joy botanicals rgb uh as well as violet tourists uh they're all coming out of kandra as well so a lot of a lot of fires coming out of that facility down south yeah and i i love we're gonna get into the uh the website here and um i love how they show you exactly what they are doing um and and the uh the work that they're doing um they they tell you exactly what is going on and uh as as i've often said and we've often talked about transparency transparency is so important in this industry because of that stigma so i dig the website queen of bud cannabis dot ca we showed that retail website uh earlier it was really really impressive but i like what they have going on at their uh their growing website yeah absolutely all the information um all the photos all the stages i think that's just great to have um and if you feel like the the websites are also aesthetically pleasing real easy on the eyes um but yeah all that information that's just that's great that's what we want to see on on everybody's website in my opinion i'm uh with you on that one okay let's talk a little bit about the history of this cultivar um you know we're blue topaz uh the uh the the previous names hurricane nine so tell us a little bit about the uh the lineage and and who created this yeah for sure do you know so it's uh hurricane the original hurricane descends from uh uh docido uh crossed with a purple punch and so docido is uh kind of a classic uh super popular cultivar that's out there right now and it's an og kush breath uh crossed with the face off og bx1 and uh it's kind of kind of known for its like uh real kind of fruity fruity flavor and floralness to it uh and purple punch is the other uh parent there and that's a larry og crossed with the granddaddy purple one of my favorites one of my go-to's i just love the purples for sure purple punch is also one of my favorites uh it's it's right up there with granddaddy purpose as well um and it was created by uh the american breeders in-house genetics and uh and the slurrican nine that um the queen of bud has as their cultivar is a combination of the phenotypes uh hurricane number 44 and hurricane number seven so uh when when in-house genetics were creating this hurricane uh clearly they had at least 44 uh different phenoes of it probably you know uh definitely more than that uh and you know those two kind of paired together just gave this really nice 80 80 20 ratio indica dominant hybrid that's super tasty it's so it certainly is i i i loved slurricane the first time i had it i'm so glad to be able to find something uh once again it's like my guest this week charles from chicago uh you know he loves the bruce banner and we you and i were so excited when we saw uh that uh that bruce come into the legal market as well so i'm really really excited about this and you know when we talk about the thc level this is at 15.4 percent i don't know if you heard that just now but that was a lot of people scoffing at how low the thc is and professor chris my educator is here to explain why it's not all about thc oh totally this is not the end-all be-all in cannabis for sure um now now this uh this slur came from queen of bud it's it's i think their lowest thc offering to the market i mean they've got some like 26 percent uh garlic kush pre-rolls and uh and they're they're california's at 25 and and those are great uh i'm also a big big fan of this 15. now there's more to it uh we got to talk about you know the entourage effect um when we talk about cannabis so that's you know your cannabinoids your thc your cbd as well as your terpenes and uh i think for me just on on my own personal level uh i feel like the terpenes that are in purple punch and are in slurricane work well with my ecs my endocannabinoid system it just reacts really well and it's become one of my one of my go-to's for sure um yeah so a lot of people uh will scoff you know maybe make a recommendation in store and say you know you're looking for something heavy uh in the evening time you know try out the circuit oh buddy it's it's 15 that's not enough for me we hear that a lot um you know i wish those people just give it a shot because it's uh it's heavy and it's nice i'm with you man uh i am totally with you on that one and uh when you go back to their website you can find out a little bit more information about the uh the different cultivars they have and the blue topaz that we're doing now so you nailed it on the entourage effect and it's not all about thc as i've said many times you would not buy your wine probably based on alcohol percentage so look for other things when it comes to thc now i love this segment what's in a name because people can be really creative so tell us a little bit about some of the names with uh the cultivar and the lp yeah for sure so uh we'll start with uh queen of bud uh and you know they got their name from their founder ashley newman um i think it's great you know she kind of stepped up early in the game uh you know she's the queen and uh and she's kind of taking that that role in that throne um all of queen of bud cultivars they're named after crystals and uh and kind of with the crystals uh the effects with the crystals kind of have to do with what the the cannabis effects should be so uh the queen of blood marketing says with the blue topaz is that it's uh it's the crystal that unlocks direct access to your inner inner wisdom empowering us to make positive decisions and reveal our inner truths and gain the ability to forgive and move on helping us become our most authentic selves so that's kind of the blue topaz there i mean uh i i i think that's great uh it is super uh reflective i i definitely think when i consume it um and the uh this hurricane name uh you know has to do with it hitting you like a hurricane um there's also a boozy term uh for for someone that's drank a a hurricane beverage which is got i think bacardi 151 in it i think i had one in vegas a while ago um and becoming a slurricane and slurring their words so uh there's just a take on that kind of it hit you really hard uh so yeah the uh the slurrican name there for sure it does hit hard and every time i i i have this i just have the dylan hurricane song running through about the denzel movie uh about the boxer who went to jail so man it's it's amazing the things that we associate it when we hear but it definitely hits hard as we will get to in the experience but let's talk about the look uh first of all the packaging uh comes in a uh a box as well and then uh just the uh the do tube there holds two of the half grammers probably doesn't need a box but with all the labeling requirements i understand there are commitments that the lps have to make and hopefully in time all we're getting is just the tube with this but pretty good uh the the roll job on this one phenomenal chris uh you know i think that this is one of the the tighter uh joints that i've had sometimes you get those ones that kind of bend at the the filter nothing like that for this one yeah no for sure uh they're they're all tight uh i feel like in in since queen and buds hit the market i've probably acquired smoked over 30 let's say 30 of their pre-rolls and they've all been good and they all haven't ran and they've all been a super good quality smoke so i feel like uh they definitely kind of um you know took their time in deciding the route of going with like how to to get their pre-rolls and they picked the right option there because uh all the queen of blood pre-rolls that i've had have been amazing so uh kudos to the the queen of budden and their crew out there at uh at the cadre facility now uh what about the uh the the the butt itself uh not in pre-roll form i know that you've uh got a peek at some of this totally yes uh i i've absolutely i've checked out uh the queen of bud uh this hurricane does come into 3.5 uh just couldn't track any down um it is a really nice looking bud though uh caked in crystals is kind of the first thing that comes to mind when you see it and the nugs are are a darker green with like some purple flecks in them but uh just the layer of crystals that kind of covers the butt is kind of what makes it so intense uh and attractive that's awesome and you know with something you know you you mentioned earlier about i know and i know how big of a fan you are of gdp and uh the fact that there's purple punch i can only imagine what the colors must look like yeah absolutely there's uh for sure uh some good some good amounts of purple in there it's uh it's really nice and something to see all right let's uh go through the terpene list what are we looking at with this for sure so the dominant terpene in uh in this hurricane here is uh lemonade is number one and that's kind of a citrus and fruity uh aroma and flavor uh periophylline is is number two and that's uh that's dino's favorite that's uh black pepper and kind of a spicy uh terpene uh and then we have mercy taking it up number three there and that's kind of a an earthier uh terpene it's also found in mangoes though uh but yeah those are kind of three common ones we we see quite a bit in our talks here so uh three of the more popular ones for sure yeah mercy and probably one of the most popular terpenes in every uh cannabis it seems to be uh in so many different cultivars now when we talk about the smell uh i always like to give nosy mcgee my wife trish the uh the first sniff when i open it and she went immediately to citrus the next sniff i get i went immediately to pepper and i wonder if we sometimes you know we recognize the ones we like so much more because i seem to be able to pick out the pepper smelling so much so we just decided that this smells like lemon pepper wings but what did you get for smell uh for me it was uh i i got a sweetness uh it's almost like a candy like for me i i definitely get notes of pepper though off the initial whiff uh for sure which is uh very noticeable so it's kind of like sweet pepper uh for me the sweetness i get in the taste um definitely what's uh what was your reaction when you taste this so for me it's it's like a sweet berry fruit uh with some spice on the inhale um and there's some nice kind of grape flavor notes to it um a little bit of vanilla in there and then uh kind of an earthy uh exhale coming out uh but super enjoyable also super smooth i find these pre-rolls are are kind of tasty down to the filter which is uh you know bonus points yeah indeed it is tasty man and it is smooth um i get i get some of the earthy taste as well um and uh definitely i get the uh the sweetness though uh kind of right off the top of it so uh it's enjoyable and that's the the main thing and then when it comes to the the effects and we should point out everybody is different when it comes to cannabis you talked about the endocannabinoid system so we all react differently but i can tell you my experience on this before i get to yours it knocked me out man i was i had one of these the the first one last night and i was uh you know within like 25 minutes ready for bed it relaxed me i had a really good sleep although i do use some uh indica thc spray before i go to bed but man this really really uh you know kind of just got me and i was busy yesterday i was working right up until i almost went to bed had this relaxed usually after staring at a computer or something like that and talking for so much you're kind of wired this really really brought me to a relaxing situation so that's my experience what about yours chris yeah you know mine was kind of similar uh very very chill for me uh very introspective hi um i found it got a lot of thinking done uh you know just like sitting on the couch watching uh watching some netflix and just uh i would kind of like stop watching the show and just kind of get lost in my thoughts a little bit on you know whatever i was thinking about uh it's very uplifting and euphoric for me i think that's why i like it so much it just makes me smile a lot puts me in a really good mood um and i think i you know get pretty lazy so uh it's not really one to you know start a productive day if you've got stuff to do maybe you know plan to hit this hurricane uh after you've completed your list um i learned that the hard way and uh yeah definitely sedative i i find like it's it's couch lock city for me uh it's you know tough to move i i find the struggle of like maybe i'll i'll go in a couple minutes i'll you know i'll just i'm so comfortable right now um and uh definitely a lot a lot of munchies associated with this one too i i definitely uh hit the fridge a couple times when i hit it yeah you know what i think this is going to be perfect for uh when i go camping or this you know this summer we've rented a cabin to go somewhere i'd like to have one day where i just sit around and sit in the campsite maybe do some reading listen to music just chill out around this is what that would be it's just you're in chilling out in nature you're you don't have any really thing to do so you can just relax maybe sit in a hammock for a while i'm definitely going to be picking up uh some of this blue topaz for that but what do you think the three w's are who what and when is this good for chris yeah you know so uh who it's good for i think uh you know we're talking that that intermediate that level two plus and up uh it's definitely um you know it's pretty hard it's it's pretty um relaxing there i mean we're not we're not looking at the highest thc levels there um but uh i just think that uh someone new to cannabis uh you don't want to jump in with this hurricane right off the hall and that's a really good point that goes back to your earlier uh discussion about thc this is one that we would probably say punches above its weight it's 15 but it might rock you like some 26 is out there because of that entourage effect because of the terpenes because of the the quality so you might you might be looking at us saying hey it's only 15 why is that level 2 plus because of everything that goes with cannabis so i think that's a really good distinction to make yeah for sure buddy it's uh yeah it does not feel like a 15 percenter um what it's good for uh hitting the couch right after dinner that was i love uh this pre-roll for that for sure uh it's great for movies tv shows uh i've been watching a little bit of blown away on netflix i think i actually just finished it um it's all about blowing glass it's a like a reality uh series and it's not a lot of like bonds really actually at all on the show but man the uh the stuff they do uh blowing i i had no idea and uh i think uh maybe the canvas made that a bit more enjoyable too um i think it's also good for like uh once things clear up with kobe i think being like social with pals in kind of a chill way uh i've got some homies that i uh used to see on the regular uh you know once a week where we just go and hang out in the backyard uh you know burn a couple doobies i think this would be great for that just to like really just chill uh but you know uh nothing too too heavy um i've also found it good for uh for graphic work too uh kind of worked out worked out for me too in a innovative kind of chill vibe so um big big fan of uh of the slurricane and uh and when it's good for dino i uh like i think any time of day um you know you can start you can start it off your day with it just be prepared to have a very relaxed day which i've done um uh i think mostly though evening time is kind of the best for me uh right after a meal too is a real nice treat kind of sounds like a good campfire cultivar man like a really good cultivar to sit around maybe everybody gets their own joint and you're gonna just have a chill conversation with some cool music in the background so i can't wait to uh bring this out with my friends when i'm allowed to get back and chill out with our friends again and i know you guys are excited at plant life if i was talking with gage the other day he's like a kid in a candy store because you guys have a new store in albany that is very close to being opening yes it's uh it's going

[Applause] [Music] my name is", "44J9LQTcW-o": "hello everybody welcome back to legal weed review we're gonna do another strain review today's Seattle I have a reserve and that strain is cookies and cream I'm very excited about the strain it has been selling like crazy and it doesn't say it's an indica or sativa so I guess we'll have to break into it will smoke it and see what it feels like a quick analysis is as follows THC total twenty two point eight one CBD total one point eight for total one point to harvest one eleven seventeen while I was just harvested potency THC 19.7 CBD point zero four I picked this up at Evergreen market and Auburn and the cookies and cream is $14 grams 14 oz gram cookies and cream Seattle Private Reserve let's check it out let's crack open to see what smells like you can see crystals just all over this jar covered all right that's kind of a mild skunky sweet flavor I really enjoy that smell almost as much as I like the look of it so far look at all those little crystals all over the place so pretty let's break it open to see what it looks like look at that look look how pretty that is it's so incredibly beautiful Wow man that is just goodness look at that I've never seen so many crystals on the bud before man that is beautiful I think I might have to get more of this for the run out and I haven't even smoked yet let's smoke it see what it's like there crack it and smell it - yeah it's like a it's like a sweet skunk it's excellent look at all those crystals of thought just play with it a little bit very dry as far as it's slightly harsh but a nice earthy flavor to go with it from the look in the feel and all the crystals in the taste I really enjoy it and actually stop quick often fairly quickly but it's it's a little dry slightly warm on your throat nice and it's almost sounded like a earthy flavor with the almost a sweet aftertaste kinda see about 20-25 minutes less now it goes see the babies welcome back everybody so wrapping up this cookies and cream by Seattle Private Reserve and I love the strain and looks fabulous smells good tastes good and feels excellent it provides a really nice indica heavy body high so I enjoyed everything about it and I definitely recommend picking it up so I just see how the power reserve cookies-and-cream if you liked the video please like subscribe and share and we'll see you next time on League we'd review peace", "VpIZwirwtEU": "[Music] what's up guys your boy p2 peeps today we're going to be checking out rogue river labs sour banana shriver and i'm just not going to say anything else besides from that from now let's go ahead just take our hit and then give her our normal spiel after so cheers everybody thank you for coming in and you know joining in on this video appreciate y'all hope you got a dab pack the bowl ready to go or you know your cart pen at the ready cheers boys [Music] oh you know we got to get a blinker going for that first hit that's just standard so anyway man this is pretty good so we're looking at the sour banana sherbert strain is a hybrid from rogue river labs and we've already seen you know a good amount of their carts and uh products and things like that here on this channel so you know this i'm not gonna say it's gonna be no different in a bad way but you know you you shouldn't expect anything different from rogue river labs if you're already uh you know a customer if you've already had it you know you're gonna know what to expect it's a smooth hit very good flavor actually you know what i'm saying um i forgot to mention that this is the cannabis derived terpenes version so this one has a personally to me a better flavor profile than the other ones that we've tried here on the channel which are not cannabis derived terpenes cartridges back to the taste portion we're getting kind of a tangy taste there it's not super pronounced but i will say that the the piney taste is definitely there you know the tang kind of there pine definitely there you know we're getting really piney taste here not really much of the gassy kind of diesel-y kind of taste there's anything like that uh sweetness very mild i wouldn't say it's too sweet no pepperiness i'm detecting at all or anything like that so you know that's kind of what you want from a strain that says sour banana sugar i'm assuming if you're you know grabbing a strain like this you're not much for the peppery terp the kind of more bitter terps and things like that so um yeah potency-wise though this isn't too bad i'd say that i think that uh the black lime og definitely hit me a little bit harder than this one did off first hit but we'll go ahead and take another one here i mean i have given this a go a few times every now and then but it's been a while since i i've actually uh tried or you know had a delta 8 thc sesh this is what one of the last delta 8 thc cartridges i have on deck i do have a little dropper to refill them with so that's just kind of what i'm waiting for to finish all of them out and then i'm going to refill them all and you know continue having my delta eight sessions so let's go ahead and take another hit guys so i can give you guys maybe a little bit more notes on that and see how it feels and things like that you know this is a hybrid strain so don't expect it to lean too far into one direction um i mean it could though you know this is this is a sherbert you know sherbert's kind of uh for me at least they kind of lean towards a more uh sativa like dominance but they still slump you out from the you know the indica so let's go ahead and take a hit y'all thank you for joining me once again and i hope you can join me on this woman positivity and good vibes always oh and before we take this hit please don't forget to hit that like button drop a little comment let me know what you smoking down below or what you plan on picking up this week if you're looking at anything that's going to be very exciting very new go ahead and let me know down there all right cheers everybody [Music] yeah that one so that blinker definitely got me i'm probably gonna be coughing for a little bit more excuse me nothing like the first session of the morning right boys always be like the first session in the morning your lungs are like a lot weaker you know what i'm saying like big rips just take me out on my first session of the day um you know obviously when i sash later on it's not as bad but yeah this one this one definitely hit me so now that we got a nice hit there to talk about that potency i'd say it's pretty up there i wouldn't say i'm enjoying it more than the uh the black lime one just because uh i think that highway is perfect for me you know that it was like an outright indica and that's just that's just what i prefer um this one i'm definitely getting a little bit of that uh head high feeling a little tingly in the eye so probably gonna be in that eye droop very soon um i'm not really certain whether i'm feeling more of a sativa or indica dominance here or anything like that you know if if you guys know more about this strain than i do then for sure let me know everything i kind of saw online though was a little disputed on where it leans so i guess it just depends on the phenotype you grab for it so my opinion on this cartridge very good just like all the other rogue river labs ones and um you know flavor wise i think this is a lot better than all the ones i've tried so i'm gonna need to get some more cannabis to have terpenes uh thc carts so thank you guys for watching all right well i know y'all can tell the camera freaking died but i'm still going to take another hit before we go guys this video just ain't over just yet but if you didn't stick around until here please don't forget to hit that like that comment that's so too hey that nerdy bill please please please you know if you're trying to stay in tune for all our uploads live streams things like that please that noti bell is going to do your work thanks everyone for joining in let's take one last blinker here for the video appreciate y'all for stopping by i mean i hope you guys have a good day week night whatever time day it is you guys are watching this i just hope that you continue to go about your day and your time with positivity and good vibes cheers [Music] [Music] don't forget to go check this out if you have not rogue river labs make some great stuff i'll see you guys next time man pizza out [Music] peace [Music] you", "cHz4xTYET24": "howdy howdy there beautiful people guys are all having a amazing start to your day night whatever the hell you're watching this hope it's going great for you we've got a little video here I haven't really done many of these but a lot of other cannabis content creators do these videos and I think a lot of people enjoy it we've got some strain reviews coming up today and of course we're starting with the hottest hash on the alerting rec market happy cabbage farms so happy cabbage farms they came into camp in probably about four months ago I don't know exactly when they came on to the Oregon rec market but at the time it was a pretty Minzy era in the Oregon rec market here in Benton there was just a lot of the companies have really slipped towards the end of the summer and a lot of their stuff really wasn't tasting as good as it was towards the beginning of the summer then comes heavy cabbage farms with hash robison and we don't see hot rods in a lot in the rec market because it's such an expensive and kind of niche product there's not very many people that are searching to pay a lot of money for hash rasam but when you [ __ ] try this hash frozen you're just sucked right on back in guys it is ridiculous this stuff I will tell you I have tried tons of hot rods and a lot of the times I'm going to say that's my favorite hat rosin because I don't get to try it very often happy cabbage now has been around for about four months and they are a group in our circle it's just been around I've gotten to dab it a lot and I've gotten to dab a lot of other hash rosin because I don't have to pay for it other people have it and I will tell you guys there's a couple strands that I have not liked from them but these four right here that I have are so titties I would stick my face between all of them and motorboat myself to death this is hands-down the best half rosin I have ever smoked and it's on the wreck more kit if you are over 21 you can buy this you don't have to [ __ ] buy it black market you don't have to pay the $120 for black market six star hash rosin it gets it cannot expensive for a while there guys so to see a company coming out with stuff that's between sixty and seventy five dollars and medic maybe even cheaper than that that's super impressive and just such a breath of refreshing air so this guy I've got open right here first thing when I open it this is the purple starburst og six star like just what in there is just a bad thing to say let's take a look at what we going got going on in this jar alrighty here we have the purple starburst og 6 star you guys can see it's nice and flaky there's no real huge clumps partly because I dabbed a lot of them partly because it is 6 star and it is just gorgeous look at that color sorry for the shaking I'm filming on my phone they check that out just absolutely gorgeous I am completely enthralled with the look of this rosin I'm enthralled with the look as well as the smell a second you open up this up you get hit in the face with the real ocean groan oh gee smell and it's been a long time since we've gotten that we're getting more chem more gassy oh geez out here this is real ocean groan oh gee and then on the end of it is like this almost faint hint of like purple lavender not in a floral way at all but in a very very gassy way like I can't even begin to explain this we're gonna go ahead and take it yeah we got two rigs out today we first we're gonna start out with the prophecy glass and get a little function shot and I'll shop for you guys we don't have the cleanest rigs or bangers today just kind of caught me on an off cleaning day but maybe we should still be able to see that function right we're gonna start off with the purple starburst it guys this stuff is absolutely amazing I cannot tell you how much I recommend going and trying just the strain right here all of happy cabbage farm is fantastic this strain right here hands down my favorite let's go ahead and get her heat it up and get into some freakin turf skies I am excitement for this video you can not believe how hard it is to have four jars of happy cabbage sitting in a drawer knowing you can't smoke it because you have to come with it it's literally heartbreaking I also want to give them a huge shout out for sponsoring the 420 of it at the Pacific Circle that was absolutely amazing they set up a tab bar anybody that came by could have their stuff a company that produces this high a product of this high quality of product just allow anybody to come up and smoke it no no [ __ ] questions asked is just amazing huge shout out to them for that call that good set a timer for 45 seconds alright we're gonna go ahead get in here and scoop ourselves out a nice flaky dab of this gorgeous six star here we go guys first dab of the half cab farms Cheers [Music] oh good lordy that is so delicious straight to the head immediately my whole head warm fuzzy dice feels delicious but you just know media we have strongest it because it hits you momentarily after you take it down man is a good video to be filming guys yeah I also got to say this is mind-bending how good that flavor is and how much flavor there is usually with a lot of even really good tasting dabs only a small percentage of flavor this there is a large percentage of flavor in that [ __ ] strain it is amazing how much you get out of it I love it for our first thing to have in the morning like if you got one dab to set your whole day straight that's it right there that purple starburst og alright move on to the next string I believe this one was a collab width Oh pull on a stick and throw it into my house I rip the [ __ ] alright I threw the Box away in the heavy collab on it [ __ ] oh no without gaps in garden Gadsden Gardens okay this one is a collab with Gadsden garden and this is Tropicana punch now this one has a much much different look to it let me give you guys an initial smell test it was like pomegranate and man what is that that is a good [ __ ] smell right there it was like pomegranate and fish I'm not like just weed but the actual cush like when you're exhaling a cush strain it smells like that oh man that's delicious now this one has a much different look to it way more waxy was this one what was this one called no just Tropicana punch hash rosin not six-star not their batter or their jam just hash shots but still absolutely delicious looking kind of looks like peanut butter and this was not what I do what it looked like when they gave it to me when it was cold it was much much more pretty and hadn't like waxed up into this solid state yet still [ __ ] beautiful we're gonna switch it up we've got the DBE 503 slimeball rig all ready to go over here a dab of this junk ambush I believe this is the one that gave me a job on the night of 4/20 and I was just absolutely mind blown by how good the flavor of it was so much rudiness to it but still keeping a really nice base in the OG gas cushy that kind of a chem that kind of a taste so I'm keeping it sweet waste in there but still having some food on top I'm a big fan of fruity strains but when I have to smoke all day every day it's not my favorite I really really want the Kim gasps og scum push stuff like that all right that's all set a timer 45 seconds that's not that's not the right dance isn't it there was a dude I'm just gonna stop him all right if vijaya tease this one's a lot easier to load up I'm just gonna take this a nice big chunk here boom I am gonna be so blitzed by the end of this guy's four dabs of hatch rosin and that I haven't gotten into this yet but I'm sure you guys read the title we're taking out Widowmaker at the end but yeah let's do it [ __ ] drop the dead Cheers [Music] [Music] get right with that safe before really really fruity but it keeps its [ __ ] feet planted firmly in a nice little og tastes good very clean - I mean like of course there's no solvents in it but a lot of other people's half-frozen I get a a wheezing in my lungs and that's usually the reason I stay away from hats Rossum as you guys can hear [Music] there is some coffee but there's no wheeze and that is what I love about this stuff it just seems so clean so pure you're tasting exactly what this amazing weed was meant to taste like guys we're going nips out go the [ __ ] nips out Jesus Christ two tabs of hash rosin in we've got the purple starburst and oh wait no the Tropicana punch and the purple starburst yeah okay yes yes boom so we've got punch breath up next this is their jam and this one unfortunately has slowly disintegrated in a series of very unfortunate dabs that were completely unavoidable but I think a little bit left so we have something for this video right here I'm gonna zoom the camera in so you guys can see it's really really clear and very very light in color but it is so ganbei good I can't even begin to tell you guys how many Terps they've got packed into that gorgeous little [ __ ] doing GM glove there when you get in this one it immediately has like a purple smell I use that to describe a lot away I don't know what the purple smell is I don't know what I'm describing there I'm sure there's some people out there that are gonna be like yeah and there's some people are gonna be like what the [ __ ] he's that high already but it does it smells purple purple with a hint of fruit punch on the end that's exactly what I'm getting clenched breath and it's really really cool how true their flavors are guys like you can't even begin to tell you how many other hot rods and strings like taste we're like this one's strong in and you taste it that's great it's amazing how many people just they'll name their strains anything just because that's what's hype that's what's selling right now these guys they've just got some fire a sweet in fire ass hash on the way out switching it back up again to the prophecy glass for our punch breath dab here I'm gonna go ahead and heat this up man guys given that Widowmaker at the end it's gonna be so brutal I have already baked like a cupcake my gourd is gone stone to the bone I just [ __ ] rent I think you guys a good idea of how ripped I am I've taken two gaps and I already am starving I don't feel like I need a turf map two naps like I thank you I'm taking seven gram damage guys this we just took like maybe point one maybe and I'm already ready for a turf down at the end of this I'm going to pass out right here after I've ordered new greens call it good BAM wham Shazam set timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla alright let's go ahead scrape ourselves out some of this leaving just enough left to put into our Widowmaker jab guys we got we got some crazy stuff going with a maker jab this punch breath was definitely one of my favorites it was a lighter high than the six star starburst og but had just about the same percentage of flavor it's fan-fucking-tastic really allowed me to go about my day if I was smoking it in the morning before say a meeting or something it would be really good for that not if you were gonna go out and want a dad that was gonna last you three to four hours that would be the purple starburst six star that stuff is just [ __ ] tits it is so strong BAM Thank You Carla let's take this damn choose people it's tons tons and tons of flavor [Music] [Music] now we got the sweats going big time holy Jebus how is it is hot in here oh my god keeping you close holy [ __ ] this was a good fight hey promised the Widowmaker again oh [ __ ] turf sweats aren't [ __ ] real oh my god whoa next up we got some margarita punch six star don't let the nips cool off for a second here wow that overheated a needle is in the red Oh rubbie oh my god I completely forgot we have water over here not sponsored by but shout out the can event for carrying the happy cabbage four guys are in Central Oregon looking for a place to pick this stuff up get a man got it they got so many different strains oh yes we got one left guys we've got the margarita place six star same with the starburst og let's go ahead and take peak here in this jar very very flaky but it is all stuck together none of it is gonna fall out I don't believe ya all stuck in there when I first got it was flaky like if you sneezed it would go everywhere like a pile of blow it was pretty [ __ ] flaky oh man oh man this one probably actually I'm gonna have to take my my vote back for the smell this one has better smell than the purple starburst dojin form starburst oh gee I do believe tastes better but god damn margarita punch they're definitely a hint of that tropic punch in there but there is a kick what is that kick gasps that is straight gasp oh man yeah once you get past that punch just gassy oh that is good it doesn't have the og smell of the purple starburst I mean it is just Tropicana punch instead of deep purple starburst OG um but it does have a massive undertone of some gassy flavors go ahead keep the slime ball ring up last one and probably take a little two-minute walk around the house and then we're gonna dive into that way a but nothing's more currently done I am so big guy so I can feel my hind legs coming down [ __ ] just set a timer for 45 seconds Thank You Carla thank you very much I can feel my eyelids coming down like heavy hard it is I'm gonna be in for a real long afternoon here we got a photo we got the Gus glass show circle tonight [ __ ] I'm gonna be licking windows all night long guys so yeah super flaky super super potent smell let's get some [ __ ] taste in here oh yes oh yes wants to scrape it all off the bottom it is super flaky again yep all right we got a margarita punch six star and hash browns and over here I bring a ball right up in clothes for you guys kitchens function off the first initial hit oh my god I need a new cord after this video it's not even baked out of it it's just oh [ __ ] cheers everyone a lot more gas when you smoke it less of the push flavor than the go wow they're really not my favorite in terms of flavor definitely not bad whatsoever it's still delicious I'm probably ranked this number three the Tropicana punch probably be my least favorite out of the four but honestly I would buy all four strains again thanks they say that they're that good all scraped up on a piece of paper see if we can get it um damn er and then we will take a lap mop it off a bit and take this [ __ ] Widowmaker all those cobbles alright we got our four grams right here I have completely forgotten which one goes to which cap so that will be interesting we're just going to go ahead and see if we can take this damper here and get some of each of these on here it's not going to be a monster dabbe but I mean big enough for some fun boom there's our starting scoop of the punch breath now this is this is the margarita punch now this is gonna be a little difficult this stuff is so flaky I'm not quite sure we might have to get like a spoon for this so I'm gonna just take some of this and yeah there's no way it's gonna stick on there take that off and then last but not least we need the what what was this I forget [ __ ] I think I've lost more oil in here than I got out definitely alright well there's that there's what I've got and there's also some on this damper too this stuff has all different consistencies let me see if I can't like splurge some of this long as dabber just smush it all together that's kind of working I'd say that's working pretty damn good alright let's look at our dab here guys oh [ __ ] yeah oh Jesus alright alright let's let's get her going oh my god this is gonna be fun I literally didn't move any of this because I was terrified that the dab would fall off the dabber I think we are very lucky and fortunate that we got all that hash onto a bro without any of it falling off I didn't I think that was going to happen as this on a monster Widowmaker but like I was saying before guys - dabs in I was pretty [ __ ] toasted we're at a point now where I am just I'm good at I could be good for today for smuggling I am [ __ ] why are we doing this because you got your [ __ ] awesome but I love each

entertainment and we love talking about grandy flora strains and this bud is something called yada da and it's really a unique looking bud but it was crunchy dry when i got it i opened up this bag and then i set it down and now it's even drier because i think i got this thing i don't know three weeks ago a month ago it just sat in the back i don't know why i didn't review it but i didn't do it so today's the day for yada da and let me load my little scooper into vapor cup straw i've already got two in here we're gonna add the third then we're gonna tamper and we're going to stick this down in the vapor cup then we're going to talk about yadda da yada comes in this bag and i got this at cookies maywood i got this at the apples and bananas drop down there i ran down there they held that for me and there were some comments on wheat entertainment so i grabbed it when i was down there and this flower has 26 thc and people are asking for the package date and uh so i'm going to give it that but to get that date i need a magnifying glass because my eyes aren't so good anymore so this is the package manufactured it is 9 29 20. oh no wonder it's so dry it's been in this bag for months right and you know what's crazy you would think that they're saving money on the jars right so at least they would give us some kind of moisture pack in here so these flowers when they come out of this bag are more fresh so let's say i got this the beginning january was harvested three months before crazy just crazy but anyway it's not about the dryness i don't wait for that so even though i note it that has nothing to do with my ratings my ratings are all about the something something and everyone's got their own something something that they're looking for but what i'm looking for are heavy flowers with focus that could grin me out i have to stay active i have a lot of responsibilities have to take care of i need flowers that can let me do that now i'm also a heavy hitter so a lot of the flowers even though i call them focus flowers they could stone you to the bone but it doesn't necessarily do that for me but certain ones do like the couch lock flowers but this isn't about catch lock i'm not looking for those type of flies this is about focused flowers that can grin me out so today it's jan dada turn to get the review we're looking for the best well let's check it out so you can see that's about amount a time it takes for vapor cup to work you can see that right there that's the terpenes the cannabinoids the water vapor and the oil vapor you can see it condenses right on the straw it takes about a minute and 20 once this cup is hot and also a lot of people have vapor cup so make sure your cup is hot if the cup is hot you need less time in the chamber if it's a fresh you just start it up you're going to need more time in the chamber and that's one of the things when you get vapor cup you got to learn use but i love this thing this thing changed my life but today it's about yada da so let's check it out yada da by grandiflora at 330 degrees out of vapor cup let's do this again so this flower's got a light og taste with a pungent pal but there's much bigger pungent pals than this one but it has it and the pungent pal it's i'm gonna say it's something like the chicken wing you know when you go buy chicken wings you smell it it makes you kind of like the ammonia taste people say ammonia but if you try vapor cup i'm going to tell you it's a pungent pal this flower took me a lot of flour to get stoned actually but it definitely got me stoned this flower's strong enough but not super strong and i thought it was good so what did i rate yada da i'm looking for the best and this flower you know at first i'm saying it's not strong enough but i used a really lot of it i used up half an eighth on the session i mean i really used a lot of it and in the end the feeling was actually kind of good it wasn't heavy it wasn't you had focus or didn't have focus i would say it was like a cruiser a little bit i wish it personally would have been a little heavier this flower gets an 8.65 which means it's a good flower if you're not a super heavyweight yeah it's a try but for someone who's a super heavyweight this flower may be not strong enough for them it was good but there's definitely better out of granny flora if you want to get a vapor cup this item right here and i'm telling you instead of smoking your flour up and joints get one of these things that little bit of flour that i put into this cup can last you 10 minutes and stone you to the bone i love this thing makes so many opportunities for use i love it and you can see it at vaporcup.com if you want to see my favorite picks you can see them on wheat entertainment.com that site's just getting updated right now it's going to have my top 100 strains in la out of 1500 strains i tried this is my journey i'm looking for the best thanks for joining in if you have a tip for me leave it below the video i'm the doctor i post every day but sunday it's my day off party on my friends [Music] you", "12qcQPTIZXc": "hey it's Florida MJ 4:20 here and today I'm gonna do an open and toke on some Jack Herer true flower vape cups these are from true leave I haven't gotten these in a while but uh I decided to go ahead and give them a try again these are $45 apiece I got a 10% discount so it's like what forty one fifty or something like that 40 50 maybe yeah so uh let's get them moving up and see what they will I guess we'll take a look at the THC is 19.6% THC 0.3% CBG pop it open there's a little jar in here and that is where you will find the cups the cups you say yeah the cups so first we got this cardboard box and here is our the cups inside the jar cups inside a jar you say yes cups inside a jar but why I don't know don't ask me wow these smells so good though man this whole I just want to keep my nose just like yeah just keep my keep that right under my nose all day long man it smells so good smells Jack Herer to me it's kind of a hard smell to explain it's a little bit woody not like a piney but more like woodshop kind of woody maybe like think of sawing through plywood or something and but it's like this sweet and perfumey version of that you know it's really nice I love Jack Herer one of my favorites for sure so well I guess we got to get into here somehow let's see what we can do here well that's interesting they're in these cups right what do you do with these cups mmm we'll see maybe I can fit him in my vaporizer you think I can fit these cups in my vaporizer oh man these cups don't fit my vaporizer or maybe they fit in this vaporizer I'll see if they fit in this vaporizer no these don't fit in this vaporizer either dang huh I wonder what I'm gonna do I have vaporizers I even have another vaporizer I tried it on that one before and it didn't work on that one either so that's three vaporizers that it doesn't fit wait a minute are these medical marijuana eggs do we have like medical marijuana chickens is that what it is I think that could be its medical marijuana chickens and they have to they have to hatch so wait a minute well then what do you how do you how do you use medical marijuana chickens I can only vaporize cannabis flowers dang do something I mean this is my medicine right it's medical marijuana I should be able to use it so I guess I'll get a block of wood and we'll just fix it well wait wait first let me do a little comparison here here we have unsmoked will vaporize above marijuana smoke can only be vaporized and here we have some smokeable marijuana this can be smoked and vaporized let's see what the difference is well this stuff looks like brown and green chunks it looks like something that naturally grew on a plant hey it looks like cannabis wow that's nice but this this is unsmoked you cannot smoke vaporize of all cannabis nope the problem is that this kind of cannabis is locked inside a layer of thir idiom and it's there's ancient mines that we have near the lime pit quarries and they're often you know hidden from view so nobody will find them but yeah it's hidden with it's filled with Floridian deposits and if you crack open the Floridian what's inside is medical marijuana you see that's how that works but there's some things you got to know about it you see marijuana unlike many other things is not fungible you see you can't mix these they're immiscible they will not mix together even if you try C you can't mix you can't they won't go together you can't mix them let's try it on a little bowl salad in there mix them up nope you see that they won't they won't combine so I don't know what to do I think my medical marijuana is broken should I call truly even ask him what happened to my medical marijuana dang well since this doesn't fit in my vape and it's locked inside of Flor idiom which is immiscible with any other form of cannabis yeah it doesn't even work right if you tried to burn this stuff you would probably it your house would self-destruct I think like that's how it works it's like a bit of a safety precaution all right let's let's get this thing open so here's how you have to do it just I was taught this by my a miner from Central Florida he's been mining Floridian his entire life he's even got a secret deposit on his own family property he won't tell anybody about but he took me to it and he showed me this technique so you take the mining hatchet this has got to be a mining hatchet in particular and you just go like that well you know here let's try this side there we go aha and now see this right here boys this is medical marijuana it's not like regular medical marijuana though nope this is vaporizer bull medical marijuana it can't be burned there's no way to do it it's impossible just like the same thing it won't even mix if you even try to mix it with another form of marijuana immediately they'll both disappear like they're into another vortex kind of thing there's a dimension portal that will spawn in that event and believe me it's all over quick you're not gonna get anywhere with that method so don't try to mix them now as you can see I can now break it down into smaller pieces it will fit hey that makes a lot of sense doesn't it so there's the inside of a Floridian nugget you can see the crystallization that has occurred on the interior let's give the the interior of the Floridian nugget a nice smell oh yeah and the smell is even stronger outside of the encasement of Floridian that's why you got to crack it open release the essence of the medical marijuana all right now I can vape it so let's get some of this cut up oh you know what I forgot to do I almost forgot to open every one of them and then weigh them so let me do that all right let's open this one up took a crack I'm going to use this I don't know any minor songs so I'll just sing a railroad building song hey you know it's good for your health probably that that's probably good for your health isn't it oh boy probably a good thing I'm going to press most of this then huh well look at it man it is covered oh it's covered in little tiny pieces of oh man what are they gonna do to my medical marriage alone why are you going to do that total medical marriage of Wow mmm I just put that in there and bust open the next one and last but certainly not least another tip he told me is got to be very careful because a lot of medical marijuana miners there is a significant percentage of medical marijuana miners who have lost their fingers now look you think I'm joking right here I'll use that book you think I'm joking you better be careful I tell you what see dang I mean this is ridiculous Floridian shooting across my damn kitchen come on now I got Floridian shooting across my kitchen I got this medical marijuana crystals from the inside of the Floridian nugget I'll tell you what they should find a use for that Floridian stuff it's pretty hard so there you go that's the the Floridian deposit and that's the outside casing of it let's get rid of that stuff and here we have all 3.5 grams of the medical marijuana let's get it weighed up and see what we got at that three-point-nine but you know what there's a little nugget of Floridian in my medical marijuana I got well Floridian chard that's better you want to get all that flaw ready I'm out of here medical marijuana because it wasn't meant to be inhaled or anything like that oh okay you see that right there no I dropped it I guess it was another little shard of iridium get the rest of them out of here alright now let's weigh it 3.9 so I guess the floor idiom is pretty lightweight too alright so that is a really great deal there 3.9 instead of 3.5 I'm liking it especially because you know some places like to cut it closely three boys farm one plant I got some multiple three point four is out of that batch that I bought luckily I know how to press rosin because then it'll filter out all those tiny little shards that happened but you know this is this isn't right you know that's not who thought of this that's not right dang it right at all iridium mine in Floridian nobody ever told me that there were Floridian mines I could have been mine in my whole life but here we are you know seems like they've been keeping it a secret for years and years and years", "rnAckrpV3MI": "what's up everybody cupid's here and we are back with another dispensary haul i just spent all the weed money i got for christmas on the last bit of weed that i'm gonna buy in 2020 here this is the last bit that i can buy it is new year's tomorrow so let's see what we got but first if you want to put five on it next time i go pick up weed you now can with memberships you can support the channel directly for as low as 99 cents we have different tiers there but if you want to put five on the next time i go pick up some weed you can do that and help me replenish my weed money let's take a look at what we got here i picked up some more edibles i got some some true gels pineapple sativa there's some pineapple gummies here i'm gonna do a video on edible soon so i'm just trying to collect a little bit if i can and i also picked up some ground flour so it's going to help me make some more edibles i might see if we compare the store-bought stuff with some homemade yeah i ended up getting two quarters of ground flour and then i got three different tier viii's i got one of their 43 one of their 53 dollar eights and then one of their sunshine cannabis which i think is like 48 bucks or something like that i did have basically a 50 off coupon 75 up at 150 or more when we definitely spent that i think they were doing 20 today but the deal i got was better so we're going to do this all a little bit differently i got close-ups of all these shots already and if you do want to see more close-ups of the weed shots i do post them on instagram which is cupid's 420 on ig but the first one we're hitting here i'll show you a close-up we got the white sunshine by sunshine cannabis and uh it's coming in at 18.5 percent thc and this actually smells really good some of that florida sunshine cannabis i haven't uh had a whole bunch of yet so let's see how this white sunshine hits out of the quad bubbler oh damn pretty flavorful there [ __ ] earthy hits in my throat right here damn uh the smell wasn't as great as i thought it'd be but actually tastes pretty damn good the next hair we're gonna do out of the zone here we got some lemon o g kush and this one's weighing in at over 26 thc i think it was one of the higher thc ones they had at the store the smell on this one really pops all right let's see if that's nice and lemony here out of the zone oh yeah that one's got a really nice smooth flavor to it really good hit on that one that is this is definitely better than the first one oh man it smells really nice and it hits really nice very very very smooth on this one and last but not least we have the mandarin cookies this is 17 and a half percent thc and i think i've had this one recently i know it's pretty good sit before you rip guys holy [ __ ] oh yeah definitely the biggest one oh [ __ ] i'm big on it they're not really a taster if you want to hang out with me i stream almost every night on twitch we just basically chill here and smoke and all the homies come through and chill so if you want to be one of those homies stop by the twitch channel but thank you for watching the video stay lit and i hope you have a dope new year and i hope 2021 has a lot of cool stuff in store for you because i know it does for me", "cDwgUU27NwA": "okay guys i just want to um do a quick disclaimer um before this video first um if you're not a medical patient or live in a legal country or state et cetera um leave bye i'm sorry but like you're not welcome here um anyways so if you're not supposed to be here leave and then the other thing is i my scale wasn't working properly for some reason and um i couldn't probably measure how much i was putting in the soup and um it turned out really badly like it turned out good but i consumed way too much way too much so like you can almost take this as an educational um a video on the effects of being dumb me i'm the dumb one because i'm like yolo um who cares i can tolerate it i could not tolerate it i could not bad bad bad bad okay anyways sorry for this long intro but i really want to stress you guys make sure you're not putting too much in there make sure you know your dosing okay i'm going to put a video below that can explain how to figure out how much you're consuming um but there's so many different ways to figure it out you don't have to watch my video my video is very long it explains it in a lot of detail but um yes please um be careful don't end up like me so i don't know how to explain this because i'm like pretty high right now but the after effects of the soup very dramatic okay if somebody had a low tolerance this would like destroy that like so there's a lot of video i'm just trying there's a lot of video so i just decided to make a separate video so this video is just about how to make soup and then the next video that i like stop stop what am i saying stop where was i oh my god my eyes are they red i don't get red eyes no they're not red anyways i'm checking i ended up like literally stuck in one spot and i couldn't move and it was the worst ever so i regretted my decisions literally every minute here we go what's up guys welcome back today i'm going to show you guys how to make infused noodle soup instant noodle soup to be precise but you could use any type soup that you like because really what we're making is an infused water and fat solution and with that infused water and fat solution you can make anything you like what i happen to be having is the soup like i said but you could use it for tea you could use it for um you could add like um um flavor like a flavor packet to it like um you got iced tea powder to it and they a infused iced tea you could drink it straight um so let's get started because it's going to be sitting on here for a while so i'll talk a little bit more about it once we have it cooking so we're gonna start by turning our stovetop on and i have two cups of water here and i'm gonna pour it in now i'm using two cups of water because that's what my instant meal packages call for um but this water is going to evaporate over time and you can add more water to your liking it's not really going to affect um how the product turns out so use one or two cups and add more water as you like but it's better to have less water than too much um because you can literally add more water any point so i'm just gonna put this aside while it's heating up and what we need to infuse our soup is um some decart cannabis now this is just a bag from before it was the carbs but i'm just keeping it in there and i need fats okay so you can't extract the thc from the flour in the water on its own you need fat for it to bind to so you could use coconut oil you could use sesame oil which is what i'm going to use because i like to taste sesame oil with my um uh instant noodles um and if you didn't want to use this for soup like i said because you can use this for tea you can use this for anything i would recommend something more like coconut oil because it has a more mild flavor um taste whatever but yeah so you could use this and make an iced tea with it right like that would be good actually that would be really good i think i might do that i am going to be using peanut butter and soybean oil for it's not soybean sesame oil for my um fats for my soup because when i make my instant noodle and i might accidentally call it mr noodle because in canada it's kind of just like the the go-to brand and i in my head i call this noodle but um i add peanut butter and um sesame oil to it anyway and they're both fat so this is like the perfect solution um i add a bunch of couple things that make it taste like so good um and i'll add it after but uh you don't need to you just need a fact okay any kind of fat coconut butter soy bean sesame olive peanut butter doesn't matter butter okay so we don't need this coconut oil because i was just showing that uh for demonstration purpose says options and then you're going to need um instant noodle packages package singular um or you know mr noodle not my stranger that's what this uh chicken noodle soup or chicken noodle soup mix or any type of soup mix or anything you want to add to your cannabis water so while we have this heating up here i am going to add in my fats so i'm going to start in by adding about a tablespoon of my sesame oil and i'm not measuring it because it doesn't really matter that much because i'm going to be adding probably more fat than i need anyway um but i think i'm gonna add about a tablespoon of peach so we have our tablespoon of i'm gonna keep calling the wrong thing sesame oil which smells and tastes so good and i'm gonna add a tablespoon ish of um peanut butter actually more than a tablespoon because i really like peanut buttery taste in my um soup so this is more than a tablespoon but this is how much i'm adding and the water's not warmed up yet so that peanut butter is not going to fall off just yet so i'm just going to leave my spoon in there so it can melt off until it warms up okay so we got our fats in there and now we need to add our cannabis in so i am going to be a little bit extra here and um oh well you'll see what i'm doing but um you can put your canvas in there one you can put it all straight in there and um not strain it out and eat the cannabis flower left over whatever but like i don't want that i'd rather strain it and there shouldn't be much thc left in it by the time you're done with it so there's really um that's not necessary so you're gonna at the end a lot of people um will run it through a strainer or they will um put it through cheesecloth or et cetera et cetera but i it just seems like i feel like we could do this an easier way right um so i went to the dollar store and tried to find something that would work um like a deep sitting mesh whatever this is called but i couldn't find any so i bought this one and i'm going to cut it and you could use like a big tea thing like this and the reason why i'm doing they do make smaller ones that would have fit in here but i wanted to have like as much uh i wanted it to like be able to like float freely right i didn't want to have the cannabis all like stuck in one spot if i feel like it's gonna extract better when the liquid and the fat is able to like fully get on all um sides of all the cannabis so i bought this and i have my uh wire cutters i think they're called and i'm going to cut the mesh out like obviously you can cut your fingers doing this so be careful okay our water is um starting to simmer and heat up and we don't want this to be boiling we want it to be simmering so i'm going to turn the heat down now to a low-ish heat hello-ish medium so it's simmering but not boiling okay no matter how hard i try like no matter how hard i try i cannot cut it with the wire cutters um maybe they were just not good enough so i got these like plier things and i'm like just pulling it out of the like just completely taking it out this is like just maybe do this like outside or somewhere because there's little pieces of uh metal or mesh coming off so i'm just gonna finish this outside the easiest way to do this would have been to do it um in the pot when there was no liquid in it but i wanted to do it on camera but yeah that way then you could kind of like shape it uh you could shape it to the pot and now we can put our weed in so i will post the link um below for both how to de-carb your weed and how to figure out how much thc is in it so you guys can figure out how much you want to put um if you're completely like unsure of how much to put you could put like about the same amount as you put for um the fat right so i have put like two tablespoons of fat maybe a little bit more and i'm probably going to add i'm going to add a little bit less than that but maybe like one tablespoon i'm going to do one brown so i had just decarb some weed yesterday i just did it in my leftover and then i just put it in here to keep it fresh so i'm just going to weigh this out my scale male functions and that was definitely more than one gram it's probably like two grams but um i have high tolerance if you don't have high tolerance start low and be more careful with it but if you do have a high tolerance you're probably fine like me to just take your chances i'm not recommending you do that i'm just saying i'm just saying let's get all the rest of that and again we're not having our water boiling or having it simmering i'm just gonna put my crumbs does anybody else do that like take their crumbs and like put it in it's like kinda okay now all i have to do is let this simmer for 20 minutes to like a half an hour um and like i said and i'm gonna keep saying don't have it um boiling just keep it simmering and you can stir it around occasionally but you don't should be fine without it um but yeah just keep an eye on it and we're gonna cook this cook it for um about 20 to 30 minutes so here's how it looks we just have it on um what is it on it's on like three and a half there it's a little bit too high to be honest i'm gonna lower that a bit because this is that's actually like on the verge of boiling there so we'll turn that down and make sure all of the flour is submerged because it's my mesh thing um it's kind of getting stuck on the side so maybe i honestly don't know how good of an idea this mesh thing was sometimes i i think i have like really good ideas and then i try and execute them and like and like trying to see it from like outside perspective and i'm like they're probably thinking this girl's dumb but um we're on crack i i've definitely been told that people call me crackhead all the time on my youtube videos i can't help that actually yeah i can okay um i don't know i still like it and i wasn't gonna waste my four dollars i spent on that mesh since i already started taking it apart you know also why do i always say no okay we've been cooking for about 20 minutes and i think i'm going to do another 10 minutes why you ask i don't know just because i'd rather get more than less you know oh my god if i say you know one more time i swear okay i'm gonna try and see how it tastes to see if we can see how it's going oh my god the embarrassment this mesh thing is i don't know what i was expecting it tastes like that's literally oil and peanut butter yeah ten more minutes okay i'm gonna prepare my other ingredients for it to make it extra delicious also i don't really smell it but at the same time i'm used to it so so since it's almost done i'm going to add in my other ingredients um this isn't necessary for anything other than flavor right so like skip if you want but if you want something tasty and you like like peanut based and like spicy and like yummy add these wow english okay but yeah you don't have to add these things this is just because this is how i like my stupid taste you could add oregano you could add parsley you could add onion you could add you could make a whole soup you could add carrots you know um but then you have to strain them out so that's a whole issue i would wait till after so i do some honey okay a little bit more i know you like honey ew but i love my sweet and sour i mean you can barely taste honey then we have rice vinegar a little splash of rice vinegar and then i'm gonna do some soy sauce and some chili flakes too after we'll grab those flakes i love flakes so we're almost done we're at about 30 minutes or just about 30 minutes and it's looking really good it's smelling good and shortly we're just gonna take it off of the strainer so i believe it's safe to say that this strainer thing was the dumbest idea i've ever had because i could have just put the strainer over the bowl and poured it embarrassing okay so it's been on here for like a little bit over 30 minutes taking it off simmering the whole time not boiling i stirred it around in my bowl i have frozen broccoli because i'm not eating very many vegetables these days because i'm lazy and i figured out frozen broccoli is a great addition to the noodles but not when noodles are by themselves but when you add those ingredients i said mm-hmm like so good so so so good i'm gonna be using my mr noodle spicy chicken mr noodle is like a popular instant ramen i used to say raymond until one day i figured out it wasn't raymond it was ramen like how embarrassing how many times you think i said that out loud everybody loves raymond you know okay so i'm going to take this out i'm honestly embarrassed about how stupid this idea was so dumb and i'm good i'm going to put it back in the bowl which i could have done this the whole time and i'm going to pour my um soup and i'm just uh oh my god i forgot to add the noodles and the seasonings so at this point this is when you add your stuff i'm going to turn the heat back on because we gotta cook these noodles a little bit um and if you weren't making noodles and you're making a tea or whatever you could um you could put this coconut oil and water combination in like a jar put it in the fridge and then you could pull it out and warm it up and make some tea with it or add some water enhancers whatever so just add my noodle how am i gonna strain the noodles out okay maybe this wasn't that bad an idea after all so put my noodles in this video is definitely like i could have been like a three minute video instead of whatever this is going to end up being um please tell me what you guys think would you have liked if i when i realized how stupid of an idea this mesh thing was if i would have like just completely took it out of the video and like pretended this never happened or do you guys enjoy watching me mess everything up i don't know let me know because i don't know okay so i'm just cooking my noodles in the water the juice um and there's actually less liquid than i wanted because um it evaporates pretty quickly if you're letting it simmer for like over half an hour so i'm just going to add some more water and i'm going to turn the heat up more let me show you guys what we're working with here watch me spill it noodles fat and liquid and you want to make sure when you're straining everything out like not that the fat would get stuck in here but the fat is what is containing most of the the thc right so you want the fat that's the good part so i'm just gonna cook my noodles and i'm gonna pour it into my um see you can even see some of like the fat stuck to the bottom of this so i'm just gonna try and press as much of that out as i can use my fingers here oh yeah yeah can you guys see that get all the good stuff i can't believe to waste that also you don't have to strain the flour out because um you could eat it i don't want to though just because i just don't want to and um i'm not serving this to anybody obviously otherwise like gross um i can't believe i almost forgot to strain that out just ignore me i'm so sorry i hope you guys don't hate this video okay for me my noodles gonna go wash my paws and then we're gonna eat and then i'm gonna show you guys how it's like when i'm done and it's kicked in a few hours later i just need to show you guys like look at all that fat that's like the peanut butter and come on there we go like the peanut butter and fat mixture that i like squeezed out of um that remaining amount oh yeah look at those colors the green the pink that looks good okay our noodles are almost cooked and we are almost ready to eat oh boy do you ever look tasty let me just let me try a little bit of that oh i hate human okay our noodles are cooked i'm gonna pour my soup here i am i'm gonna pour my soup into my bowl splashy splash i feel like we should scrape some of that up here i mean there's not really much to scrape i feel like that might be kind of like the the fat sitting on the edges but i don't like wasting things so i'm like i feel like i will just like i'll literally lick it after because i'm just like any bit that i can not waste better i'm very frugal i don't like wasting not like actually never mind okay yeah see there we go yay snack time i mean lunch bone apple tea i wonder if it's a good enough temperature because um the broccoli cooled it down a bit since it was frozen sorry so there's something in my teeth okay oh my god i forgot the seasoning mat so like this doesn't taste as good as usual what is going on what is wrong with me one second okay i got the mix you guys i'm sweating and dying your feet but i have to keep my clothes on usually i would like to take them off well like i'd wear like a smaller top because it's so hot and the windows closed so it's not so loud and noisy for you guys but then everybody's gonna complain about how i'm not wearing enough clothes like does it really bother you that much although it's interesting because it's usually only women who complain about what i'm wearing hmm oh my gosh i've never tried this sauce mix on its own but that reminds me when i was younger and i'd like really want to um uh i'd really want to you guys i haven't even ate this soup yet why am i acting like i have uh i used to love like eating them in the package when you like broke them up um and like put the seasoning eggs my mom didn't let me because i wasn't healthy you know i was like i wish i was allowed to eat that but it wasn't okay it smells like herbal soup let's give it a try temperature is pro oh yeah that's good very very good i never used to really like mr noodle or instant noodles but um can skip over me eating this if you like because i'm not gonna probably say anything that it's like information you need to know to make it this is more just for my peeps who my peeps for my friends my my best buds for my people who like are like i'm not functioning properly today i honestly could use some salt um and this looks like all the msg it already has i'm a salt addict i can't help it i honestly do want to add some more salt or maybe some soy sauce it would have been better with more peanut butter and honey but they're very high calorie and the soup is ready oh soy sauce is good by itself too yum but yeah i never used to like mr noodle because or instant noodles because i'm just like they're just not that good until i added like lots of peanut butter and it's just like game-changing peanut butter and then some acidity from the rice vinegar and the sweetness from the honey honestly it tastes better without the weed in it because like you can still taste it but um it does taste a little better than we but it's still good if you serve this to somebody they wouldn't be like is there weed in this they'd be like what's the unique herb you have in there i'm putting the broccoli for the broccoli like the perfect temperature to eat right away if you do i have the same things that i add add more peanut butter because um there's nothing like peanut butter and like spicy

the worst ever so eventually i fell asleep eventually i regretted my decisions literally every minute", "N0exp56rtNg": "welcome to the shed this is iced out images coming at you with another product review this one is once again I haven't got the kid to respond to me yet about the discipline came from them so just like my last product review that I did yesterday I'm going to put that in the description below so this is Tropicana cookies is the name that I was told on the top the person just wrote traffic honor and I know I pronounced that weird but I'm from England so that's just the way it comes out of my mouth smells so [ __ ] good live better so pick this up 45 of G so I got this and then I got the mother's milk which is in the other video if you don't mind going to watch that one if you enjoy these videos just [ __ ] cold out today house how blonde leaves whoa [ __ ] freezing so I'm still in my work gear but so 45 of G got the mother's milk and got this mother's milk previous video blah blah blah blah blah so this one I don't have my other phone with me much kids on it right now but the the stuff that I can remember that I looked up is that it is peppery citrus hoppy flavor it is cross between Girl Scout cookie and tan G so I've had to Angie before and I've had Girl Scout cookie I've liked both so we're just gonna jump right into this we're gonna be rocking it off of my sci-fi glass piece so anyone new to this channel sci-fi glass shout out to these guys I like a lot of their [ __ ] so far like off-the-wall and cool-looking start heating up the Bangor and get this damn and after work did that I busted my ass in the freezing weather kind of dead you know well hopefully everyone else had a fantastic and warm day I froze my dick off pretty much any time they took my hand and my gloves off and my hands were exposed to the air from the moment I pumped up a tire this morning time I got to work time I got home just cold it's going to be like 17 degrees tonight here in Michigan maybe even less I forget it might be 10 degrees I don't remember get my days mixed up a little bit yeah what's that hopefully you guys had a great day sad I just worked came home my girls about to leave for work so I'm gonna take this and then go inside and spend the rest of set time with my son I'm supposed to pick up my mother car today it didn't start been sitting for months so we're certain it's gonna be the battery we tried to jump it that didn't work we changed the battery out that ended up not working come to find out that on Lexuses there's like if you do something a certain way the security system won't let the car start or recognize that the key fobs inside the car I don't know it's pushed the start though this shit's all new to me it'll be the newest car is over owned 2010 which happens to be almost 10 years old the last war I had was a 92 Toyota for sale before that was a 99 stable 99 contour prior to that the newest car I owned was a 2002 or what if there was a 2002 that I got in O five it was a Saturn SC 2 coupe and I loved it that car so from my other video I'm gonna let this cool down just a little bit longer than I did last night because that [ __ ] must have still been too hot because it's just instant and I was baked but you know I didn't I didn't taste as much of the chirps and stuff as I wanted especially coming from something like this quality ooh Oh fat daddy tasty damn there's that peppery / hoppy taste the citrusy part is almost like bitter you know like it hits hard yeah very tasty well as I said I'll find out what this bow these are from and I'll put it in the description below in case anyone wants to try to get their hands on it I understand it was 45 a gram from the kid I get it from I'm not sure what deals they're running for you know it says five g's on it so so I know the guy picked up 10 grams of live batter five in this one five in the other I got a gram of each very very tasty strong strong high and pretty sure this is a hybrid I don't know I'll put it in the description below I'll copy the ship from Leafly and just I will put it right in there and any other information that I need to put in so yeah strongly recommend it Tropicana cookies if you can get your hands on it it's probably pretty good in just normal wax but if you can afford to spend the extra money and get the you know the live batter I'd recommend it the quality is better taste is better and the potency definitely seems higher just seems like a better product all the way around compared to say a lot of these you know FPR ones that I've been getting from healing tree Wellness Center that's not talking [ __ ] about healing tree Wellness Center that's just saying that the quality of this is better than that and the proofs didn't pudding you know that's like a dark almost goldish color almost like a like an amber type color almost and this [ __ ] like crystal white almost not quite egg yellow but man that smell I wish you guys could smell this [ __ ] you guys wouldn't be like a throw me add a beam right now and uh you know for some of you some of you live close enough to where we could arrange [ __ ] like that you know stop in at the shed and come being a video just chitchat [ __ ] [ __ ] take a DAB and we can you know have like guest spots like hey that is specifically towards you Jim Becker obviously and anybody else we can figure some [ __ ] out like a little meet-and-greet kind of thing little smoke sesh but chances are I'm gonna do it on camera so that it's me interacting with

Tropicana delicious peace out guys", "8yWpvcl5SUY": "welcome to community canvas reviews today i'm going to be reviewing a white label live resin cartridge um i had a bezel i think it was or bevel one of the two um bezel there we go i had a bezel distillate cartridge in and i just kind of got bored of it honestly because the terps are not very strong part of it being um they're not cannabis derived terpenes so live resin should spice that up um the live resin that i got is actually less terpy than the uh or it has less terpenes total we'll see what it tastes like anyways but less total terpenes than um uh cured resin surprisingly but either way we'll try it out it's wedding cake which is an indica this is cultivated by green queen farms and it comes in at 84.05 total cannabinoids um and 5.39 total terpenes um yeah so i'll read the terpenes and show you what it looks like but first let me flip the camera around for you [Music] uh [Music] all right let's try this out step one take off the sticker all right um first that's the thing about some good live reds and this um just some i don't know yeah some just good live resin cartridges i can smell that one no leakage whatsoever perfect seal that just smells nicely very sweet and almost like perfumey that's some interesting elements there so it's got a pretty basic um oh yeah that's it's got painting in there a bit smells kind of piney slash perfumey mostly but the leading terpenes and are the basic um are pretty standard beta cardio filling at two point zero four two percent uh limiting at one point five percent humiliate at zero point six percent um beta mir seen at 0.5 alpha pinene at 0.18 cedrine at 1.7 or 0.17 um alpha vista bologna at zero one point zero point one six and finch all at 0.127 so they always have a very detailed um terp list right there but usually a lot of the ones at the end are in pretty low amounts i don't think i can ever really taste them that already smells like it's gonna be way better than the other one was so um got two uh little silicone caps and the branding on this is c cell c240 620 but yeah proper c cell so that's always good um so first thing it's very very clear and light that happens with some white label um i think part of them being just like they they get stuff from different cultivators a whole lot just depends on who cultivated it what the starting material was like i think and white label actually as far as i know white label means like whenever there's um a producer doing white label extracts it means that they're doing extracts for other growers stuff instead of their own stuff so i think they've just made a name of that and that's just like their process but that's usually what that means so um i answered on reddit recently somebody posted a live resin cartridge by white label that was also very clear and wondering if it was real and also they had someone tell them that it was delta eight but they also said it looks like it has delta eight terpenes in it which if you know much about cannabinoids that's not even how that works so um but they came on reddit to verify it and i posted some cured resin and live resin that looked similar and that's just how white label is sometimes i don't know if it's crc i know they seriously well i don't know that but i'm pretty sure they crc some of their dabs so maybe they do their cards as well um i've never had a card that was remotely bad they always put out really good stuff and it's priced a little higher than some of the other stuff i get so i don't get it as often but part of that is it's higher quality too so i don't think they do it badly so all right so here's wedding cake yeah that smells it's just like a general sweet smell it's um i feel like there's like a very even smell of like the pinene and it's like limonene and something else that i don't know which i actually want to say is one of these terpenes in a lower amount and i definitely smell pining at 0.184 so i think i'm smelling one of these other ones either alpha cedric and alpha visceral or pinchol um i'm pretty sure finch all taste i've had finching which i assume is pretty similar just in this last buddies card i had and that was very like like so i don't think it's that probably i've had uh visible alone i think that's pretty sweet and i don't know about cedrine let's see about taste and smell okay upon hitting it you just get a very a much more pronounced and very standard like weed taste um i say that like it means a lot um a very just like nice balance between uh earthy and herbal and like um vaguely like musky taste to it uh not really musky someone says like the other two though um yeah it just tastes like weed usually does for most streams and don't stand out anyways uh that's how i remember wedding cake to be too i've had wedding cake from a couple different producers never a live resin so that's kind of cool but i've had select elites and that's just distillate with their terpenes and tasted pretty similar yeah so um it's not a a real standout strain to me um things like that are like mandarin cookies and like or tropicana cookies was a really good one or blueberry muffin um things like that usually stand out more to me than like wedding cake where sometimes you have strains that really do taste a little bit like what they're named and then you have stuff like wedding cake where i feel like there's maybe more behind the name or they just thought oh that's a good name for it or something like that um sounds pristine or primo or something like that very good very good but doesn't taste quite like wedding cake and the terpenes don't really stand out to me yeah those terps linger very nicely um very present unlike the non-cannabis drive terpenes that were in the last one that's why i switched it out though um i'll have the other one as a reserve in case i run out or can't get any more or something but wow this is nice and the effect on it very nice and full body too um a really good live rise and that's a good thing about the stream too is it um it's just well-rounded very well-rounded so sometimes something being well-rounded enough can make me be interested in it a little more if it doesn't stand out because sometimes that's what i'm looking for like right now for example and the perks of having a proper c cell at that vapor production all right so that's hitting pretty nice i'm getting some aftertaste again but i think it's some of those terpenes or maybe just all the mixing together but it's nothing really strong it's just so so much of like so little it's hard to describe but mostly just like um i'm getting some herbal tastes and some earthy taste like i said and i'm also getting like a weird i almost want to describe it as like how talcum powder smells that's a weird freaking thing but like it's like a very like reminds me of like a rocky taste or something i haven't tasted rocks so i don't know but that's what i imagine rocks to taste like i don't know if that's uh it's not a bad thing too it's very interesting i have to wonder what um alpha cedrine is like the effect is very nice and terps are just they stand out very nicely as they should with some live resin so yeah i think i'm starting to repeat myself a bit so i'm going to close it out here with some smoke rings at least one of those was a ring i'm pretty sure alright thanks for watching uh like and subscribe if you want and stay tuned and um yeah i'm a lot more interested in the cured resin this one's kind of a placeholder but the in the cured resin is a josh d strain which i've done a little bit of reading about because my name is josh as well so i thought that was interesting enough and he has some pretty good uh good-looking stuff and it's a josh d strain extracted by white label and it has more terpenes more cannabinoids more thc cbd um all of it really just seems like a better cartridge honestly it was cheaper i probably should have just got two cured resin cartridges um but yeah stay tuned for that one that'll come around in the next day or two so thanks for watching like and subscribe and stay tuned for more", "lBKPjGKJ8gw":

and i just dropped about 300 bucks on all here jasmine hooked it up and we got an ounce of some flour and a couple grams of some concentrate so i'm really excited to check out grow healthy i haven't had the flour yet so i'm really excited and let's grab something delicious to drink for the weekend and i think we're gonna get this is one of my favorites all right my dudes let's take a closer look at everything we were able to get from grow healthy today they had some decent options and i really like that flower i was able to pick up a half ounce of this mine bird this is their littles it's not the best looking but it was 65 for the half ounce with the discount so really good deal there i also got some of their key largo some of the stuff's a little bit leafy but it smells really good i also got some bubba kush here's one of my one of my favorites it's a classic strain everybody likes bubba and we also got some star dog this is one of the better ones here but take a look at the queso pero i think this is the best flower i think it was the highest percentage they had in there i wasn't really looking for that but it's also the nicest looking buds i scooped their last gram of rosin it's the last one smells so good i'm stoked to try it and then i also got a couple half grams of some distillate and we're gonna take a look at these all right let's heat up a dab of this big pine tea lime rosin and before we dab just so you guys know we now have memberships available on the channel you can support the channel for as low as 99 cents check out that join [Music] button oh buddy uh where's my water at oh man this is so [ __ ] nice oh man this is good oh man that rosin is really good it's nice to have more dispensaries open up i think since i've moved here there's at least three or four new ones within a 10 mile 15 mile radius or so so it's nice to be able to go to more places have more options because that means better chances at deals one shop doesn't have a concentrated deal call the next one they don't have to check the next one so very nice to have more dispensary options overall that helps to bring the price down and increase the options because they're all going to be trying to compete with what do they have what do they have all right let's take a hit of their birds of paradise i did get the littles which is normally 99 for the half ounce that's a pretty good deal but i got it for 65 today [Music] oh yeah that was not bad i might hit some more flour here i've actually been out for a few days so it's nice to get a hold of some as much as i like dabs something about bong rips it always gets me damn oh yeah yeah yeah we're gonna get high oh man i just smoked so much and i wasn't recording i thought we were i just did the whole end of my video and everything and i look over to click stop and it says start anyway let's get high again the svog is pretty good dang i really can't believe i didn't record that oh man this thing is cloudy well dang don't forget

36 percent cac terpenes are lemony mercy and pineapple and as you can see it still comes in a bag this time we didn't get the box i still think riviera creek should change the packaging to maybe some type of jar i do like the box riviera creek this is my first time trying the garlic cookies at 36 percent i've tried many other batches i think i've bought like 15 bags total of garlic cookies since october of last year so i've definitely had success with this particular strain it's been good for my pain and anxiety and it's also been useful for me in the evening the buds are pretty much average size buds for this type of product as far as with frivolour creek they're not bad but um they could always uh be bigger but uh it's only 2.8 so i say they're pretty giving me some pretty nice size nugs here the smell is pretty much the same even though i've noticed the terpene profile percentages have declined over time i definitely give this one a 90 on the mastermind score and if you like the videos make sure to like subscribe button and i'll see you next time peace you"}
