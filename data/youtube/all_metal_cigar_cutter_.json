{"1ek4LUw1bl4": "one word ever spoken in this video we're going to be looking at the Scorpion tabletop cutter [Music] hello my name is Paul Anthony I'm CPA and today we're talking about cutting cigars with the Scorpion table top car here well this actually known as a few other things as one's from quality importers are sold by a whole bunch of different people quickly on the price point this is around 60 bucks and any of you into cigars have been into cigar shop especially here in the USA you soon that's probably seen bloody everywhere so we want to do a quick review some pros cons of who it may be good for and go from there but I suppose the first order of business is to really car cigar with this thing so sure here's your weapon I know you're a Vika very much a Vika month but I I do it very rarely because most new cutters are sharp enough you end up just mangling the yes with this version this is the bigger version around 60 bucks and there's a to cutter version as well as 45 which I do not iron so I'm not sure if it's the larger holes of the smaller holes but on this this reduce notice of five by fifty we're putting in do the smaller holes as you can see the cigar can actually just disappear down this we're gonna get perfect cuts so you want to take it away show too so I actually I think that even though the smaller one is made for this kind of a toner it's never deep enough for the v-cut so you have to go for this one but let's do it with a small one anyway I'm a bit scared I'm not gonna end up having a smoking cigar it's whatever - that's it so there we go that's okay that's not too bad thank you it'll be a pretty tight droid you want to try different cigar on though not too bad so didn't completely chop the leaf off no is it honesty yes I'm off my finger in saying that so that's right this time again I don't think it's oh here we go no that's quite good actually that's not bad that's not bad one if the camera can see though he's over here these two yeah side by side maybe we'll put them on an angle there if you guys yeah see it definitely there's a significant difference but that's gonna be a pretty tighter on the first one exactly so you actually want to use the one that's designed for the large gauge I'm gonna go ahead and do the straight cut quick please okay so this is what I always fine with this cutter is that like it doesn't actually do a bad cut with a straight card however it does is kind of weird president shame I suppose laters day yes the lady comes around it's like curving around with the cigars I mean it's not anything technically wrong with it but just something to be aware of that it does create this like semi like depress like concave okay it's obviously not really gonna affect too much I might give you a bit more surface areas of actually exposed cigar so it might be a fractionally looser draw no I just feel like it's kind of a clunky operation though it doesn't feel smooth it never you know right I mean I suppose so the pros of this unit are one it's relatively inexpensive too it does offer some different ring gauge options and you can kind of get used to free it does kind of look cool and have that nostalgic feel because it's oh looks like in each you know like almost like a fruit machine you know on the old you know that one-armed bandits also it holds a lot of cigars yeah I mean we've got another video here where we review my personal favorite desktop cigar cutter but that 40 only holds maybe 15 cigar casters where this thing you could probably hold like a hundred in there so I put these you put this out on parties just because people are used to it although I'm not you know massively a fan of the performance I probably gave the performance a 2.5 to 3 out of 5 to be honest then just right give that a solid 5 out of 5 you know I mean comes down to a stakes if you've got a large desk or you entertain a lot of people or a man cave is that which may be a good addition for that especially at the $60 price point the cons of it are I mean I think we've touched on them a little bit clunking the operation and as it's a it has it has got these little rubber feet here which it doesn't really you know stop you moving it around to be honest as well that's a totally different rubber on the colibri that's like almost like glue so it really comes down to personal preference know that there may be some slight cutting issues I know you've personally have the SV car from Calibri which we kind of but yeah guys so hopefully that kind of review helped you out there we've seen as cut feeders busto sized cigars you know so really I think it comes down to personal preference so okay love to hear your comments or questions on if you've got this cutting yourself and if you think it's good value for money also on other tabletop cutters that you may wish us to review or that you've used before and had great success with we'd love to hear about those we have a page on the spoke unit where you can go to bespoke unit com4 slash cigars where we cover a multitude of different cutters as you see some on the table from scissors punches these iconic so etc and we may even start to dedicate a specific one to tabletop cards depending on the amount of recommendation you guys may have below so with all of that being said please like the video if you found it helpful also please feel free to like our channel as we do release many videos around cigars including how to store cigars how to cut cigars how to like cigars and surprisingly even what cigar tastes like it's the kind of interest we also cover a lot of our men's lifestyle topics with Charles Phillipe he likes to cover champagne whiskey I like to cover watches shoes and suits so definitely come back to check out that content and turn on those notifications you are notified when those videos come up any other comments on final thoughts on this one show I think just about covers it personally I like to look at it but I'm too scared I wouldn't rely on it for my diecuts Northey cousin okay well I do like I kind of like the look of it it's maybe a little bit big for me in size but it does have a great reservoir kind of an interesting straight stroke concave car but it's not overly expensive it's $60 and it's a conversation piece it's got a bit of that nostalgic feel so all right we'll all that being said my name's Paul Anthony I'm a CPA we'll see you next time take care [Music] [Music] you", "PMkEssqX52Q": "[Music] the Cuban crafters perfect cutter large ring gauge addition hi I'm Brian Glen cigar obsession calm tonight we're taking a look at this new update to the Cuban crafters perfect cutter line and there are a multitude of perfect cutters in that line let me take a quick second just to run you through some of the key differences first of all the only Cuban crafters perfect cutter that over the years I have given you my stamp of approval on meaning it works for you it doesn't gum up it doesn't break you won't have cutting problems with it it simply works it's a great inexpensive tool is the original it looks like this you've got these D shaped rings and I've gone through a number of reviews on other models they have smaller models for literally a couple dollars less with round holes they have models with rivet construction I have never endorsed or told you guys to get any of those this is the only one and I make it very specific and yet there are still people that they want to save that $2 so they get the cheaper model and then they hit the seal fans group and they're Lou this is the words cutter I've ever had how could you like this well dude you didn't listen original design only all solid construction no rivets just sharpened polished steel and that's it works perfectly I don't know how many thousands thousands of cigars I have cut with this very same cutter sharp is day one never had to send it back never got a replacement nothing just works well now for all a large ring gauge lovers they have literally a large ring gauge edition of the same original just as good but for those people that like 60 to 80 ring gauge cigars they now have just a bigger opening everything else is exactly the same nice large finger holes for guys like me with big sausage hands this is what we like you know fits perfectly big fat fingers yay solid construction polished sharp stainless steel you've got the same hole through the middle that's for your bella cosa or torpedo tips so you can get a little bit of a starter cut and yes you have a limb depth just like the original but when you want more cut off of those you just take multiple cuts pretty simple everything else literally it's the same just larger now why do you need this well obviously because the original one I think they they certified this up too I think 56 or 58 we're engaged somewhere in there not quite 60 I remember that but you know what I've cut 60s with the original just fine it still takes enough where the shoulder will just start to rest on the outside of the Ring here so I get a great cut I've never had a problem with that but obviously with the big one well here I've got a sixty and you can see that if the diameter of this is just huge so yes it really does up to 80s no problem you can see it all the space around the 60 there so I mean the 60 in this looks like you know maybe not quite at lancero in the regular but along those lines certainly below a 50 ring gauge plenty of room left perfect cut every time captures your calf so you can toss it by the way thank you very much to jo-ann Mitchell who sent me this as a gift of cigar bomb several weeks ago I've been using it off and on I'm not a big big ring gauge smoker so I don't have a lot of occasion to use it but you know what when you what I am doing 60 ring gauge which are certainly more common for me than anything above 60 it works beautifully I can certainly wholeheartedly endorse this I'll put links below these there's not often a great deal going on on these but I'll put links below to at the time of filming what I found was the best deal for them they're not expensive they're they're just not expensive at all these are some of the best starter tools in the cigar hobby that I could suggest to anybody and this goes for a brand new smoker or a 40-year veteran if you haven't tried one of these you're going to be pleasantly surprised I used to use regular old guillotines and frankly it does its name it gives you the perfect cut every single time you don't need anything special sure you can take a regular cutter and put it on a table like some people say to do and then put the cigar straight down or you can just get one of these that's it I mean done so that's it just want to let you guys know about this in case you are a larger engaged lover and you want the perfect cutter experience now you're in luck that's it thanks again Joanne this video is great give me a thumbs up it was horrible give me a thumbs down subscribe to see more and we'll see you next time", "9oK2mAr5AFU": "hey what's going on guys well today I want to talk about cigar cutters I'm gonna give you a demo of my favorite with those cigars that are up top there at the end of the video so first off as you can see here I've gone through a bunch of different cigar cutters this is believe it or not not all of them I probably have four or five other ones I just misplaced at the moment so I can't find them but these the ones that I've used since I got into cigars so there's no particular order here I'll try to go with the oldest to the newest this is probably one of the oldest cigar cutters they have and this one is made by Calibri I believe like it's on the blade yeah you can maybe see that here we go Colibri alright and this was not cheap I love the design I think it's awesome there's a little button here so it's always under spring tension so you pull the button down they shoot open alright nice and sturdy easy to grab and you can set your cigar inside here alright get the correct length you want put the blades on either side and snip okay once you snip it it stays shut and locked right well I like this in the beginning because I had no experience with any other cutters unfortunately even though these are fairly expensive in my opinion on the blade quality or blade steel it doesn't really hold an edge very much so even though this one is heavily used okay and it is dull and I believe I can take this apart you can see a little flat head screws I haven't really messed with this yet but I will try to take it apart and try to sharpen these up I was actually disappointed I don't have an exact count as to how many cigars I was able to cut with this before I had problems but I'll tell you that I stopped using this once it started tearing cigars alright so although I'm sure there's a way to take this apart and sharpen those blades easy it is not alright so that one unfortunately doesn't get you just I love the design just didn't last the test of time okay then I got into using scissors which I thought were super classy I like the fact that it is nice and exposed so that I can easily sharpen these blades which I have before but again unfortunately as nice as these looks and these are just no-name scissors there's no branding on these this steel just does not want to hold an inch for long okay and I also kind of got away from using the scissors like I said it's kind of classy I like the idea of using the scissors but it's not as precise as I would like wearing it so those don't get used all right I got the CA oh cutter from actually a viewer who sent this to me a while back people were sending different cigars to me to try which I thought was awesome and someone sent this cutter and I use this cutter for a while and I liked it and one of the things I like most about this is the fact that had a back plate so when you insert the cigar okay it can only go so far and then when you make your cut it's just a very small cut you can cut as many times you need to bring that cut up and open up the cigar as much as you want unlike something like this where you can obviously do it on the first shot you can put this in as you know as far as you want and cut the cigar but I like the fact that this is making a very small cut if you're not into cigars one of the big issues with taking too much off on the end here is that these have caps and the end of the caps call the shoulder and if you take all the cap off and you're smoking this it's going to start unraveling so you have issues like that so you want to be able to take the end cap off but just enough to open up the cigar so you can take a nice draw without taking the entire shoulder off because then again like I said you have construction issues where it serves to literally unravel and fall apart which is an enjoyable so I like the the fact that this one had that little plate on the back but it's cheap it's plastic and he's got dull real fast I mean literally like five or six cigars I use this cutter on and the dull these are dull there's no way for me to take this apart and there's no way for me to sharpen these with them like this inside the cutter plus you can see they're starting get some surface rust so I never throw them out just kind of save them but on the line I'll probably throw them out at this video because they're no good then I got this review which I thought was really cool because this has both a traditional cutter here this is a single blade so instead of having two on either side it's libri or any of these other ones here this just has one blade I just comes across I don't like the fact that it's just an open hole I do prefer these now with the back plate but this was super cool because this also had a V cutter okay which is over here and as you can see that basically literally takes a cut in the shape of a V which takes kind of a a not CH at the end of the cigar just the preference thing I'm not super into V cuts I actually really prefer punch cuts as you guys know but I am uh you know these days more often than not using this cutter which with the cata bag this is my favorite so get that at the end so I think this is very cool this is still sharp as it gets probably seen here though this is not removable to sharpen I couldn't sharpen this blade if I could take it out but it's not screwed in it's just kind of molded alright there's no way to remove that unfortunately but it's nice to have exciter every now and again maybe you know break it out and do a V cut but I don't use this side alright then I got this screw top tool cutter which I don't like at all I do like the fact that again I can open this all the way up and easily sharpen both of these edges here but the blade still stinks okay and it's a little awkward to use and getting a cut I end up getting kind of a crooked cut and things start falling apart so I'm not a huge fan of this alright I don't really use that more of a novelty than anything else but to get to it this is my favorite cutter okay this is a Cuban crafters cutter and the reason I got this is because of a recommendation if you guys are into cigars you probably already know this individual but Brian who runs the channel cigar obsession probably be biggest I was gonna say one of the biggest but I think he's literally the biggest cigar pretty much cigar only and that's mainly what he does like 99% his videos of cigar related here on youtube so huge cigar channel obviously a lot of people watch him enjoy his videos as do i and he uses a cuban crafters original cutter and he swears by it absolutely swears by it i mean the guys cut literally thousands of cigars with that cutter never need to be sharpened never need never gets dumped up or or jammed or rusted and you know nothing like that no issues whatsoever so after hear him talk about it i thought alright i'll give a shot shot it on amazon bought one for 20 bucks he only specifically recommends the original because that's the only one he really uses i know recently he got the big version which cuts up to and I think an 80 ring gauge if you're like the huge cigars it's a different version of it because this one only cuts up I believe to a 54 which is fine 99% of cigars I smoked are under 54 ring gauge but I didn't go with the original I went with this one simply because I like the ring design as opposed to a d-ring so like the original has kind of D shaped you know handles I guess you call as opposed to these round ones this is the perfecto model y know specifically which one this is but since I got this thing it is absolutely flawless I absolutely love it solid construction no rivets or anything I know Cuba craft is does have a bunch of different models some people have issues with some of them but the originals inez and the new ones the ATR engage ones I haven't heard anyone complain about them like I said solid stainless steel you can see there's a little brass insert on the back there it does have a plate similar to the CEO but the big difference between a CEO and this one is that there's a cutout for perfect dose or torpedoes which we happen to have here okay here's the black ops the Gurkha Rubicon so you could say this will poke through the other side to get a nice cut I'll give an example at the end the video here but since getting this I probably cut maybe 20 cigars I love it it's absolutely perfect it is still razor-sharp I mean these blades the actual blade steel don't know offhand but it is really really sharp and after hearing Brian which I definitely you know take his opinions very seriously he's very much into the hobby of smoking cigars and it gives me confidence knowing that he cuts thousands of them and it's still sharp so this is something that I've really been enjoying and feel like will last a very very long time it was worth every penny of the 20 bucks that it costs alright so I'm going to quick demo here taking bold easy and first I'll give you a cut on this one is a raptor cigar alright so more about traditional shape you just rest this right on the ends okay put both ladies on either side all the nice and straight and there you go and once you make your cut it holds it in there you can see nice clean-cut took off part of the cap there no tearing or anything so that's awesome and again as far as cutting perfect those just as easy remove that band all right so you're just going to put it right in the middle here and again that's going to poke out the other side so it keeps it nice and stable hold it level and I kind of put both blades on either side right when it touches it okay so they even even push on both sides and then snipped okay and you can see it holds it there so takes off a little cut on the ends a lot of people would want a second cut on these just so you have a better draw Tesla for kite again seems okay but will open up a little bit more again just for the demo purposes here push it against the back plate hold it on both sides nice simple cut all right so it makes nice even perfect cuts because it is super sharp and just a simple design all right so I've been extremely extremely happy with this cutter and so I want to take a video thoughts about it because although I haven't had too many problems with some of these once they start doling out to kind of like throw aways most times it's not worth even taking the time to sharpen them because it's not going to hold an edge so as far as the cheap plastic ones I mean if you don't smoke cigars often obviously and you don't get the job done if here to smoke shop or something just want to try one or two but if you're consistently you know enjoying cigars part of it is the experience in prepping it you know getting it ready making your cut toast in the foot lighting it up that's all part of it kind of like smoking a pipe it's ritualistic so if you have issues with cutting it kind of ruins the whole experience so that's pretty much it just wanted to touch upon the subject for all the people who are interested in this kind of stuff as you guys know I was definitely a punch cut guy you know I liked them and I didn't have too many issues with the the draw being too snug every now and again maybe it was a little bit of a tighter draw because I wasn't opening up the cigar but using this thing it's a nice cut on it no issues at all with drawers and it's just stay sharp it's just a really awesome cutter for 20 bucks so I definitely recommend it that's it let me know down below what was last cigar you enjoyed let me know what kind of cut you like some people are diehard v-cut guys some people you know like the guillotine cutters I mean just let me know what you're into so thanks for watching hope you guys have an awesome day and I will see you soon take care", "MmbKcpCeigA": "to blame the lateness of this episode on that damn hurricane living in Florida that thing had my schedule totally messed up last week hurricanes have a tendency to be inconsiderate that way frickin hate hurricanes hate hurricane season in general but anyway we're here we got a cigar let's talk about some man [ __ ] [Music] today we are back talking about cigars and today's subject is probably as polarizing as putting water and whiskey putting ice and whisky or hell even what's better scotch or bourbon any of those type subject that people have a strong opinion on what they prefer probably going to stir up some uproar in the comments we're gonna be talking about the different ways to cut a cigar [Music] this is a Bellas Artes is it that would be a I don't know if that's assume that's Bellas Artes huh and Spanish usually to ELLs or Y's would that be Vegas artists there you go so that way even though I butchered the name you can see what it's called in a box press lancero it's an excellent cigar and I'm drinking coffee today no whiskey cheers to my brother Calvin over in the UK I know I've posted stuff before and he's not a drinker so we're doing one with coffee today coffee in a cigar it's this coffee from this company oaken bond really excellent stuff you guys should check them out they actually barrel-aged coffee beans in whiskey barrels they have Scotch version they have a bourbon version they have a rye really pretty cool stuff so definitely check those guys out not sponsored just big fan of their stuff so just wanted to mention them real quick but back to the subject at hand cutting cigars there's a whole lot of opinions on the best way to cut a cigar there's really three main ways to cut a cigar you've got your punch cut you got your v cut got your straight cut now there are other ways to cut cigars obviously I've seen guys use just their fingernail to get the cap off I've seen guys bytom seen guys use pocket knifes you're gonna have some people that argue and say this is better than that or that's blasphemy shouldn't do that I follow the same rules with cigars though that I do with whiskey and this comes straight from our good folks over at the whiskey ball if you've never checked out the whiskey balls it's a great channel if you're into whiskey definitely check that out with whiskey you get people saying that adding ice and stuff is blasphemy it's your whiskey drink of how the hell you want whichever way you enjoy the most is the correct way to do it same with cutting cigars in my opinion it's your cigar cutting however the hell you want that being said all the methods do have some inherent pros and cons and there are some general guidelines it's probably a good idea to follow up to help from tear in your cigar up in the process for any you knew guys out there let's just go over the different parts of a cigar at the closed end of the cigar you have the cap which is basically just a little piece of the cigar leaf there's a fix to the end to kind of hold the wrapper together and seal off the cigar some cigars are single caps you have double caps and you have triple caps that end of cigar is also referred to as the head and at that end you also have the shoulder of the cigar it's going to come in important later when we talk about how to the middle of the cigar is called the body and in the open end of the cigar that you like is called the foot the basic premise behind cutting a cigar is just to remove a little bit of that cat as to allow air to flow through the cigar you don't cut some of it off you're not gonna get any air through it I know I've done it myself I forgot to cut cigars before I know maybe some of you have done the same foot it your mouth you go to light it nothing try to only remove just as little of the cap as you can to achieve the airflow that you desire a lot of guys who haven't cut cigars before or new and cigar hobby have the tendency just to go in and lob off the whole end of the cigar and if you get down past the shoulder past all the caps what's gonna happen is your wrapper leaf is just gonna come unraveled and that is gonna make for a really crappy smoking experience now quick tip something I like to do all guys may not agree with this I like to moisten the tip of the cigar before I cut it it's really hard to say moisten the tip without you know my 14 year old self getting a chuckle out of that but I like to give a cigar just a quick little just twist in my mouth just to get a little moisture on the end of the cigar before I'm cutting it I would only do that if you're using your cutter if you're using somebody else's cutter you don't have your own don't do that because then there's saliva on there and you don't want to go gumming up somebody else's cutter with your spit that's just nasty but I have my own cutters so I like to do it what that does is safeguard against cracking the end of your cigar if your cigars are properly humidified you've got a nice sharp cutter that shouldn't be necessary but you never know the condition of the cigar you're smoked and if you buy it from a store or if it hasn't been in your humidor long enough so just as kind of a safeguard I like to add a little moisture to the tip before cutting it and that leads us right into the next tip which is make sure your cutter is sharp and this applies to all the different cutting methods if you don't have a sharp blade on your cutter it's gonna smush or you're gonna have to apply too much pressure and it's gonna crack your leaf so whatever cutter you're using make sure it's nice and sharp probably the most common the one you'll see the most is the straight cut straight cuts are generally done with these guillotine style cutters you can also be done with scissors and some other ways but generally speaking most of them you're going to see are these guillotine style one of the great things about the straight cut is you can cut basically any cigar with it you can cut small cigars you can cut fat cigars you can do box press cigars you can do figure Otto shaped or torpedo type basically any cigar you can slap a straight cut on it and you're good to go to perform a straight cut pretty cut-and-dry unintended you're gonna want to take your cigar you're going to place it through the cutter line your cigar up make sure it's 90 degrees from the cutting surface you're getting a good straight cut watch where the blades are at to make sure you're only right there below that cap still up on the shoulder so you're not over cutting and then you're just going to snip just removing the very top cap of the cigar to allow air to flow through it now if you're straight cutting a figure Otto same basic principle it's gonna go a little different though if you're using something like this Cuban crafters you're just gonna open it up got a little hole for your tip to go through and you're just gonna snip off just a little bit of the end generally maybe a quarter inch or so I've seen a lot of guys that end up cutting these torpedo shaped cigars all the way down to here and basically making it a pair a hoe which kind of defeats the purpose of smoking this type of cigar so I would generally say less is more with all cutting that's a good rule of thumb to go by you could always cut more off you can't put it back on once you cut it so I usually just trim a little off take a test draw see if it's got the drawl I want and then I'll nip off just a little more in a little more until I get to draw that I want trying to leave as much of that taper as possible there is no real shoulder on these cigars but you do want to be careful not to go down too far to where your cigar comes unraveled because that's going to screw the pooch and ruin the whole experience one other quick thing that I have seen some guys do on these types of cigars is some guys will angle cut them so instead of going at 90 degrees like you generally do with the cigar some guys will put it in an angle and snip it which gives you a little more surface area because you've got an angled cut and some guys like that draw better the main drawback of the straight cut is if you've got a normal cigar cutter like this and you're a beginner put it way too far down and just lob off the whole end of the cigar the good news is straight cutters come in a huge variety some which will help resolve that issue all are not created equal those should be these guys right here I wouldn't even recommend using these these are your single blade cheap plastic cheap steel just shitty these are gonna more likely just mangle your cigar more than cut them so I probably wouldn't recommend using that now this style these double bladed plastic ones while definitely not cream as a crop generally do a fairly decent job as long as the blades are relatively sharp because it's a double blade style it generally can do a pretty decent job and they're super light and cheap so they're nice just to throw in your pocket or throw in your car to always have one on hand if you lose it who really gives a crap one of my favorite style straight cutters is this guy right here from Cuban crafters it's called the perfect cutter and one of the reasons I like this is it really takes out the guesswork for guys that are fairly new to cigar smoking or even people that are advanced and just don't want to think about it too much because it's got this backstop in here which prevents you from over cutting your cigar so you just put your cigar in there flat until it hits that backstop you cut and it's gonna automatically cut off the perfect amount they're also like less than 20 bucks so really great cutters I've cut a ton of cigars of this thing and it's still nice and sharp I would be remiss if we're talking about straight cutters if I didn't take just a moment to talk about this sweet little bit of awesomeness sent to me by urban EDC supply this is the BMF cigar cutter from red horse knife works let's just take a moment of silence to appreciate the awesomeness of this cutter this thing is sweet now this is a high-end cigar cutter this thing is like over 220 or 230 bucks somewhere in that range I can't remember the exact price this is definitely for somebody who is more into cigars and they're looking for a little pocket jewelry a little bling to add to their cigar repertoire this thing is a titanium frame with an m3 90 blade if you guys are into knife so you know anything about that m390 is some really awesome high-end steel it has ceramic bearings that ceramic detent it has g10 inlays you can also get it in carbon-fiber I mean this thing is really next level it is crazy crazy sharp it also has a as we've talked about most everything has these days has a bottle opener and you might notice by the shape of this guy that in an emergency it could be used for other things I don't advocate violence but in an emergency if you had to defend yourself you know really really awesome cigar cutter if you're big into cigars really really cool tons of different options out there for straight cutters straight cut is a really really good option and a ton of guys use it next up we have one that might be a little controversial I feel like guys either love this or hate this and that is the v-cut this guy here happens to be av cutter from Calibri and in my opinion this is the only v cutter worth having don't get me wrong some other companies out there have some nice ones there's some pretty good ones out there from xikar but I've tried a bunch of them and the V cut from Calibri is the only one that I like be cutting your cigar is really simple it's got a cradle kind of backstop little area your cigar goes in you're gonna place your cigar inside cradle and push down to cut it's one of the things that's great about the v cut it's kind of hard to screw up if you push it to the back stop push down you're gonna be cut it correctly it's my preferred method for cutting box press cigars I really like how clean of a cut it is it leaves a little more of the end of your cigar intact I feel like it usually gets less tobacco in your mouth it also holds more of the end of the cigar together so I find you generally speaking have left unraveling problems and the reason I really like for a box press is I found that some box press cigars because they're square a round cut doesn't always sometimes you can kind of crack it puts weird pressure on the sharp edges where a v cut you can just put in there and cut right through the middle some guys are gonna tell you they taste differences in these different types of cuts that you're gonna get a different flavor from a straight cut than a v cut than a punch cut because it funnels and kind of directs the smoke differently I'm not gonna say it's [ __ ] some guys have more advanced palate to me I don't notice any flavor difference between the three different types of cuts I just use different cuts based on the size the shape of the cigar stuff like that for utilitarian purposes what I think cuts the cigar best and gives me the best airflow the one drawback to a V cut is you have to be kind of careful if you have a shallow cap on a V cut times this deep-v can cut down too deep and then you will run into issues of your cap coming off and then your cigar coming unraveled so generally speaking I don't use this on smaller gauge cigars or cigars with a very shallow cap that's just something to look out for now last but certainly not least you have your long sheet on this edge you have your punch cut you have a punch that is basically just gonna take a little hole out of the end of your cigar a lot of guys love this I used to punch cut cigars quite a bit I don't really punch cut stuff anymore but it is a relatively easy and clean way to open up the cigar and it's great for beginners because it's kind of hard to screw up much cut to do a punch cut what you're gonna do you're gonna just line up your punch in the center of the head of your cigar and you're gonna slowly twist the cigar in the punch and apply gentle pressure until you penetrate penetrate that's it there goes that 14-year old mentality again I swear I'll grow up one day but anyway you're gonna just slowly rotate until you penetrate through the wrapper and then pull a little plug out and what you're gonna end up with is a really nice clean hole and end of your cigar one of the great things about a punch cut is that it is probably the cleanest the least amount of tobacco in your mouth way to cut a cigar basically keeps the majority of the end of the cigar intact because you're just taking a punch out of the middle there's not really much risk of over cutting the cigar with a punch cut you can also kind of customize your airflow with a punch cut you can put one punch in there if there's not enough airflow you can just go to the side a little bit add one more punch to test draw if you don't like it punch to the side of that a little bit keep repeating that process until you get to draw you once punch cuts are really small portable you got little guys like this that basically go on your keychain the other great thing is they also include punch cuts on the bottom of a lot of lighters I don't have one at the moment that has a punch on the bottom of it but if you're traveling or you're out and about you don't have to pack an extra cutter things like this cigar tool have a punch cut integrated this one is a modus two cigar tool pretty neat little cigar tool really it has several different tools in it it has a number on one end so you de nub cigars if you're like me and you like to smoke them down to the bitter bitter end it has a draw tool draw tools okay it it's not as good as like the perfect drawl I actually prefer that as a draw tool but nevertheless it does have a draw tool and then at the very end here it does have a nice punch this is a pretty handy little tool to be able to pack around with you it's also about the size and shape of a cigar so you can put it down in a cigar case and take it with you and you've got a whole little toolbox with you at all times and that's one of the benefits of a punch cut is they do integrate punches into a lot of different cigar accessories so it's pretty easy to always have one on you the only real downside of a punch cut is it does take a little longer it's a little more you have to fidget in you're over there twisting and it's not as satisfying to me I like the click of like a guillotine cutter or even of a V cut you know these are spring-loaded which is kind of fun to fidget with you know these aren't near as fun so to me it's not as satisfying you also can't cut all cigar types with a punch if it's a really small cigar like a little Lance arrow you could punch it but at that point you're really it's the same diameter at the end of the cigar so you might as well just straight cut it it's kind of difficult to punch cut a cigar like this I have seen guys come in at an angle and do weird [ __ ] like that but I mean just snip the tip off I don't really get it anybody who tells you one is for sure better than the other is generally blowing smoke man I'm really full the puns too but it's really boiled down to personal preference how the cigar feels in your mouth how much tobacco gets to your mouth how much draw different shape of cigar different size of cigar all these different things my opinion is go out there try some of these different cutting techniques on different shapes sizes of cigars and see which one you prefer the best I personally use v-cut and straight cut the most interchangeably depending on the type of cigar I'm smoking alright guys so that wraps up another episode of man [ __ ] soozee 1/3 from whatever day this

well done medium well rare medium there's an endless selection that's not a way staked art no no alright [Music]", "4-Obba8wLC0": "Hello my friends, Nick Libretti here from JRCIGARS.COM and today we're talking top five favorite cutters. So, there's gonna be a lot of heat with this one because everyone has the cutter that they like to use. Listen there's great two-dollar plastic cutters out there for you to use. These are the top five that I prefer to use on my various smokes for various reasons and although there's a lot of great companies. There's Cigar Savor, there's Vertigo. I narrowed it down to two and the two big dogs, it's the two you know about. It's mostly going to be Xikar and Colibri. So starting up with my newest cutter, a lot of you have seen this on the internet recently. This is the Xikar XO, awesome. First of all,  just basic it cuts beautifully. Straight, true, no excess tobacco stuff coming out, jus a nice clean cut. A little on the expensive side, but hey it's totally worth it. You can see the gears in here. It's an awesome design. Look, pops right open closes really easy. Easy to put, you just put it in your pocket 'cause its got that nice round shape to it. Really awesome, cool cutter. Coming up next this is an awesome cutter from Colibri. This is the S cutter. Great for this straight, simple cut all the way through. Kind of has a cool switchblade feel to it just like that. Not that expensive at all, fits easily in your pocket. It's rubberized so it's not going to slip or anything like that. Self sharpening. This is a cool color it's called like a rose, like a rose color, but i think it looks more like a really awesome copper. It has all the basics. Cuts well, fits in your pocket well and it's not that expensive. And it's Colibri so it's the highest quality. So coming up another great one from Xikar. This is the XI1. I call it my lancero cutter I had actually bought this cutter when I was smoking a lot of lancero's and it just so it just happened I was cutting them all with this and it just cuts a lancero really nice. I mean it's a great cutter all around You might recognize that has that teardrop design that Xikar is famous for but unlike your normal average everyday Xikar, this is actually all metal.You can see the rivets in here. I went with like this basic just silver but it comes in a lot of different colors. Tad more expensive than your normal Xikar teardrop cutter but again totally worth it this steel design makes it nice and hearty. Also super slim... It can go anywhere. You put in your hat if you want. Another great pick from the good folks over at Xikar. Now, as many of you know i'm a big V cutter, and this is a tough choice because i use.I alternate between two V cuts. I went with the Colibri v-cut, because this is the one I use most often. The big difference between this V cut and the Xikar V cut is this one's going to be a little deeper. This deeper V cut is going to give it a much better notch and you're gonna get a much better draw off it. So that's why this is usually the V cut I go with, is Colibri V cut. And lastly I was not going to leave a punch, of course, for my bigger ring gauge cigars or something that I really just feel like a nice narrow draw. The Xikar keychain punch. Self-cleaning all-metal design, that's right on your keys. Give it a twist... Look at that bad boy. Comes right out. and then so, then you punch it's. Its got all the guck in here. Then you just close it up, everything falls out. And talk about easy-to-carry. Fits right on your keys you'll never forget it. You'll have it with you as long as you're driving, or have to go home, and unlock a door. So those are my top 5 cutters here at JRCIGARS.COM All of them are available for purchase. We're gonna have some nice links that you can click on, you can pick one out. Why don't you tell me what are some of your favorite cutters? And you can put it in the comments right below. Thank you.", "V5Q0jSnj-NA": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] okay i've had some people ask me on this new cutter from winston's what's the purpose of this little piece down here they thought it was a means of being able to adjust the spring so the action on the cutter as it increases uh or as it opens up rather would change that's actually not what that is this is actually a secondary way of cutting your scar it's actually a punch so it's a stainless steel very sharp punch so in case you have um friends like people you're golfing with or whatever that don't like a v cut and they want to punch you have it available here um so that is the explanation of that mystery hey i'm peter i'm here today to talk about the xiphay v-cut cigar cutter with a built-in punch so off the bat it comes in this really nice high quality box when you open it up has this nice suede pouch for carrying in and the cutter itself is just gorgeous black and gold it's heavy feels good in the hand so it's spring-loaded and all you have to do is insert the mouth side of the cigar into the divot here and then close it up nice and tight and what that'll do is it'll cut a nice smooth v-shape into the mouth side of the cigar giving you a nice smooth pull when you're smoking so like i mentioned earlier it's dual function it has the cigar v-cut here as well as a punch so depending on your preference of smoking you can either use the cut or the standard punch so it functions beautifully on top of that the fashion aspect of it is exquisite the black and gold looks amazing it's nice and heavy in your hand it feels good and it's definitely something that you'll want to carry whenever you're ready to smoke the punch is nice and sharp so if that's your preferred method of smoking that's a good way to go if you prefer the v-cut the german blades come pre-sharpened and ready to give you a nice smooth cut on the end of your cigar so this is perfect if you have a cigar lover in your family or better yet just get one for yourself", "z9wbwY5ys9M": "hello this is Brooks Whittington with half wheel comm and today we're taking a look at an Italian tabletop cutter from a company Kotel areia Saladin II now these are all hand made by hand and they have some interesting features in the the idea that they are made with different materials and you would normally find in a tabletop cutter this one for example is made of ox horn they do make another version that is actually made of reclaimed wood in this case olive wood that they find around their area there and they actually have two different sizes as well the one that we reviewed was a smaller size that's this one here and that one actually has two different cutters two different holes the first the smaller hole has a that's about 28 you engage well the larger hole cuts about a fifty-two ring gauge give or take on the larger version you actually have a the smaller hole on this one actually cuts a twenty-four ring gauge or the larger hole cuts a 58 ring gauge now these cutters were built and designed for the most part they were designed for use with Italian cigars and if you don't know anything got Italian cigars they tend to be quite a bit thinner and are actually made a little bit differently than what we may be used to here the idea is that you would actually cut these in half as you can see that they are open on on the ends here already and so you could actually cut them in half and then you have two separate cigars cut in the middle and you have to separate cigars and as you can see this goes through there very easily and you cut that and we'll do that in just a second but you can see that that actually goes through there very easily now these are as I said made in in Italy and the the metal on the on the body here is actually made of 304 stainless steel while the blade itself is actually made of 420 C steel comes in a knife gifts box which you can see in the photographs in the review as well as a velvet bag and weighs 312 grams which is a fairly light and we'll get to that in a second but cost for us was about a hundred and eighty five dollars so I've used this for about a month now five weeks we use it on just about every cigar that I cut and while it has significant disadvantages that I'll get to in just a second there are some some good parts about it number one is the idea that it is use it does use very interesting materials it does look very nice it uses a you know the ox horn is not something I see a lot of and the wood is reclaimed and it's you know it's a nice it's a nice look it looks very nice on a desk it looks very high-end on a desk and I do like the look of it for sure not the easiest thing to carry around or do I mix you know would think that you would want to but it's you know the idea that it does it does it's all in one you hit it and you know goes down and it's very simple to to use and a very nice looking cutter another thing that I love about it is the the safety feature here you can see this little thing here is actually a pin that actually goes right inside here and it actually stops it from moving and so if you ever have an issue with you know anything that you don't want to cut you just don't want it moving on its own you know that'll love that'll they'll stop it for sure the problem with that is of course that you have to be careful with that this actually comes off very very easily and mine actually came off I lost I actually lost mine very very very soon after we I started using it and this is the one from the other cutter but it does go there very nicely it's integrated very very nicely into the cutter itself which I find it's very nice I liked it quite a bit I just wish it was a little bit easier to to keep there as opposed to losing it and that's about it for the for the good stuff about it I mean it looks nice but unfortunately all comes down to cuts and this this cutter is uh has some significant issues I think it comes down to a couple of very quick factors while the blade is sharp another good thing I like about it the blade is very sharp the issue comes down to the fact that it is still designed a little bit more poorly than I would like one of the big issues is just a straight guillotine cutter and so if you try to cut something with it big blade itself as you can see does not go all the way through it stops right there at the end and so that means that when you're trying to cut a cigar if you see here we will cut it we just cut right through here and you push down the problem is that as you can see here it doesn't cut all the way through the cap and so this means that you're left with this little piece of cap here and you can either pull it off of course or you can do whatever but it's almost always an issue with the cuts that I had with it where there's this it just you know it kills the the cap in some various form of fashion or it just it just it looks like this we've had other you know we've had other cutters would have the the single guillotine action and they cut all the way through and as a result it tends to it tends to be a lot better in terms of actually being able to to cut through there and not have that problem with the with a cap like that you know torpedos actually do a little bit better in terms of when you're cutting cigars they actually tend to do a little bit better you push through and it's the problem is that about eighty percent of the time you've got problems with the cut and you can see that cap there is is just not not great the balance and Charlie and I go back and forth on in terms of what to call it but my my contention is that the balance is off a little bit as well in other words it's just too light it weighs 312 grams which is not very not very heavy at all and so if you're pushing down on this you can see it move it slips you have to really really hold down on it when you're pushing it through now if you had something that you could actually put on here but you know if you've got it on a desk or something this this would alleviate the problem quite a bit you don't have any any major issues but if you have it on thing that you're just you know a regular disc or something of that nature it's definitely going to have some problems slipping around I found myself holding it down as I'm cutting and while it does stop that and it makes you know better cuts for sure it does also just make it a little bit more problematic when you're trying to use all these things you're thinking of it once now in terms of the Italian cigars you know these the the Italian cigars that they make this is a Toscano actually has a very thick wrapper typically and so you basically when you cut it you cut these like this you cut it right here in the middle and it will cut right through and as you can see there's less issues as I show to you there's less issues with this thing cutting or having a problem with the wrapper itself and these are actually cut very very well and it cuts right through a little bit of crack there but nothing huge and it it seems to have a it seems to have a no issues with those at all and so you know it's just the the wrappers that we sometimes use on on our american cigars if it was to cut all the way through I think it would definitely I think it would definitely be okay the blade is sharp enough for sure it's just a matter of design in terms of not just not going all the way through there so bottom line do you you know do I think you should buy this cutter it looks nice it's it's a very nice looking cutter it has design issues and it just does not cut cigars at least not the cigars that we smoked here very much I mean a lot it just does not cut those cigars very well about 80% of the time I had problems with a cap there were issues with you know caps unraveling and things of that nature and you have to you have to say that a cutter you know the purpose of fondant cutter is to cut cigars and this just does not do that very well at least of the cigar is that the we smoked here so no yeah you shouldn't buy this it's not a it's not a it looks nice on the on the desk but it doesn't actually do it's a intended purpose very well so for other reviews news and anything cigar related check out half wheel com you you", "xeIayT6UfHw": "hello this is brooks whittington with halfwheel.com today we're taking a look at the tops 208 clipper cigar knife now tops is a company that was founded in 1998 by former vietnam veterans and they started the brand to produce knives that didn't have the problems with durability and strength that they found were rampant with blades that were issued to soldiers during that war the company has grown quite a bit since then and currently produces more than 200 different knives that are used by the public members of law enforcement and various branches of the military all right let's get to some physical characteristics the 208 clipper was previewed by tops in early 2019 but wasn't released until june of 2020 it's a friction folder tonto style knife with a single guillotine style cutter and essentially a friction folder means that there's no lock on the blade it actually is kept open and closed via the friction between the blade itself and the handle a tonto style knife is a sharply angled tip that has a very unique style as you can see it's not a normal style blade and it is very very easy to notice the difference the actual design of this cutter was designed by top's president leo espinoza and is actually based on the design of the company's first ever release name the steel eagle 107d the blade is a 2.25 inch blade made of cpm s35vn steel and the exterior which you can see here is constructed of od green g10 plastic knife handle material i say that 10 times fast but it's a composite made of layers of glass cloth and epoxy resin very easy to work with and very very durable the entire knife weighs just 4.7 ounces and measures 5 inches when it's closed like this with an overall length of 6.13 inches when it's fully opened like so it also comes with a built-in bottle opener here which we'll get to in a little while retail price on this is 230 on the company website i was able to find it for as little as 159.95 online but the total price does include a leather sheath a very nice leather sheath very well made that actually has very usable belt loops here and here that you can put onto your belt and the knife goes into the sheath like so all right now that we've actually gone through all the physical characteristics let's uh let's look at cutting some cigars the actual blade is opened by pushing down on this lever here the actual uh this is the bottle opener and this opens the blade up completely you can use this as a knife immediately after pushing open that blade or if you want to actually cut a cigar with it you can actually put the cap of the cigar into the opening here and then cut it from there now the opening is 20 millimeters wide exactly 20 millimeter millimeters wide which means that you can fit a 50 ring gauge cigar all the way through it and cut it in half but nothing else all the way through 50 is the is the limit on that in order to cut the actual cigars you can actually use it in either your right hand or your left hand however the cap of the cigar always needs to be in the same place so depending on which hand you use it on the actual cutter is going to be facing a different direction if you want to use it in your right hand you're basically going to put it so that the cap of the cigar is the smaller end which is going to fall off when you cut it it always needs to be on the end with the actual blade bevel itself so basically the larger side of the cigar that you're going to smoke is going to always be facing away from the bevel so in this case if you're going to hold it in your right hand you're going to put the base of the actual cutter in your palm of your hand you're going to put the thumb right here on your uh on the tip of the blade and it's going to be facing away from you the tip is the cap is going to go uh is going to go on the side of the actual bevel that is the smaller cap that's going to fall off is going to go on the side of the bubble and the larger part of the cigar is going to go pointed away from the bevel you're going to put the cap of the cigar into the opening and you're going to line it up as much as you can it's very difficult to see exactly how much you're taking off you're going to push down on the actual blade and push through as evenly as possible when that's done you pull it out and you have your cut now as you can see there are some pieces left over here there's a little piece right here that has been left over and that it does happen quite a bit with this cutter sometimes minor this is fairly minor in terms of damage but for the most part there's always something it's never a very very clean cut this is extremely smokable to use this in your left hand you would essentially reverse the process which means that your the actual tip of the blade is going to be facing towards you this time and the reason that you do that is to make sure that the cap of the cigar is actually the smaller cap that's going to fall off is on the side of the beveled edge while the larger part of the cigar that you're going to smoke is on the side of the non-beveled edge and as before you put it in here this is actually a 54 and so you're not going to fit it all the way through but when you actually push it through you can see that you can actually see just a little bit in there how you're going to um how you're going to cut how much you're going to cut and you do the same process where you're basically pushing down on the edge of that blade in order to push as easily as possible through the cap and once you do that you're left with a wrapper that is fairly uneven does have a little bit of some problems there but again smokable um but that's going to come off in your mouth and that is um that is not exactly a clean cut um there are again once again very very um few times when there is major damage to the cap but a lot of times when these little pieces will come off and have an issue so as you can see that is exactly how you can use that on either your right in your right or your left hand the cap is left behind on each one of those and you can put that wherever you want little pieces come out a little bit so you need to be aware of that but there's one more aspect very very interesting which is the bottle opener that's built into the lever that opens up the blade this is something that you use quite a bit more than i expected to and it's very very simple to use essentially you take a bottle which in this case a bourbon county 2018 and you attach it like so and then just pull up and once you do that that thing will pop right off very easy to use very well constructed and very well made and very well designed all right now that i've shown you how to use the actual cutter as a cigar cutter in multiple ways let's go through some good and bad things about the the product that i've learned over the month that i've used it i used it for every single cigar that i reviewed in that within that month and um let's go over the good things first so first thing right off the bat it's very well designed and very well constructed there's no issues whatsoever with um you know scratching or anything of that nature it's very easy to use in terms of knife and bottle opener capabilities we've already gone over the uh the cigar part but you're not going to have any issues with you know major scratching or rusting or you know anything of that nature it is it is uh it is very well constructed um and then will you know will not give you any issues in that regard um the cool thing about this and and the the reason you're paying a lot of the money is because of the triple functionality and it's easy to see that this is very very easy to use as not just a knife but as also as a as a bottle opener and the triple functionality is something that you know you take one product and you can use you know three different ways and that's definitely an attractive option in terms of what you're trying to do you know you're out in the field you're doing whatever and you need a knife you got one you've got a bottle opener you've got one and then you've got a um somewhat of a cigar cutter um and uh all of that thing all of that is in one product that you carry around speaking of that knife the um the knife and combo here is very very light in terms of what you actually get with it and it's easy to carry around even without sheath now i used the sheath a little bit when i was testing it just to make sure it worked and it does and it's a very high quality sheath but in terms of carrying it around i prefer to have it just loosen my pocket and it's easy to carry around that way except for one um one specific thing that we'll get to in a minute but the idea that you can you know you can feel it a little bit in your pocket but it's not something that you're going to really really annoy you or it didn't annoy me and i get annoyed very easily by such things i was able to put it in there with my keys and had no issues whatsoever just carrying it around and loose there was no damage to it or anything of that nature and it's very very light and very easy to carry around now great thing about it last thing i'll mention is the sheath is very very high quality and it comes with the actual price the total price it's easy to use it has the belt loops as i mentioned and it does keep that knife in there very very securely now having said all of that there's quite a few problems with this with this product as well first thing is the cuts themselves from this cigar cutter function are as you saw problematic at best and you know there are very few times during this month that i was using it that i was able to get um really just you know really clean cuts from it there was always some little pieces of tobacco or or a little little bit of damage to the to the to the wrapper or the cap um most of the time that wasn't major damage uh didn't you know cause a cat break all the way down the cigar or anything of that nature but it's certainly enough that you just can't um you can't get a clean cut consistently with this with this cutter uh in my experience um you can get a two dollar double guillotine cutter and get better cuts than this will give you another bad thing considering the cutting aspect of the cigar cutting aspect is the fact that you can't cut anything larger than about a 60 ring gauge use you know with usable cuts on this as you can see a 60 ring gauge won't fit anywhere close to through you can get a little bit of the cap off of that but if you need to take more than that you're you're out of luck um there's nothing else for you to actually do in that situation anything larger than a 60 is you know you're basically just taking off the very very tip of this thing another thing that was uh fairly uh fairly bad about this cigar cutter was the idea that like a lot of these style of products the process in terms of cutting the actual cigars is long and it is awkward and it is very you know difficult to um to do very quickly it's um it's definitely something you have to think about every time which side does the cap go on which side does the the rest of the cigar go on if you get it wrong you will know it immediately because it just it really really destroys the cigar itself and it's not something that i ever got used to it's not something that i was able to do as you know you get quicker and quicker at it or something of that nature it's always going to take time and it's always going to take effort um it's not something you just pick up use and put down and that's the end of it now the bottle opener is a very very useful no doubt about that i used it quite a bit but it does actually snag on things when you pull it out of your pocket when you pull it off of the sheath you have to be careful i never really damaged anything specifically but it's definitely there and you have to be very careful when you're actually pulling it off so can i recommend the tops 208 clipper cigar knife the answer is no as a cigar cutter it is too inconsistent and uh it damages the wrapper or the cap way too often uh for me to actually be able to recommend it especially at the price that you that you're going to pay for it granted most of the damage is fairly minor in scope but the fact that you can't get a clean consistent cut is extremely problematic when you're talking about something like a cigar cutter i could easily get a better cut more consistently with a two dollar cheap double guillotine cutter that weighs almost nothing and is extremely easy to carry around and that's a problem when you're talking about a product like this now granted it does have the functionality of a bottle opener and it does have the functionality of a knife a very nice knife it's very well built and very well designed and also does come with the leather sheath and the price but even with all of that the price is extremely high for what you're getting and as a cigar cutter it basically fails in its primary mission that we are evaluating so for halfwheel.com this is brooks whittington for more news reviews and anything cigar related go to halfwheel.com", "sqRVlFQqa3k": "hey everybody I'm Tim today we're talking about the punch straight cut and V cut and you're watching cigars daily [Music] [Applause] as I'm shooting this video I also have a special going on on cigars daily comm where if you spend just $20 on pair Domo cigars you're gonna get one of their craft series specifically designed for pairing with beer for absolutely free so check it out on cigars daily and there's also free shipping opportunities almost all the time this morning I was tooling around on the cigars daily nation Facebook group and I saw a great question from Dave Strobel he said this being a newbie to cigars straight cut Vica or punch what's the difference when it comes to actually smoking and that's a fantastic question because there are a lot of opinions on this but there are some important things that you actually need to know so let's jump right in when it comes to how you penetrate your cigar there are a few different opinions out there but that's exactly what they are is opinions it's just like how you gonna cut open an apple there's different ways of doing it and it's absolutely okay to do it the way that it suits you best but there are some things that you should know about each one of these different methods before you jump in and so I'm gonna take them down for you one by one let's start out with the cigar punch a cigar punch is a really really simple tool for cutting your cigars and like every other way of cutting a cigar it's got benefits and it's got drawbacks the benefits of this is that it's pretty nice and small and compact and it's easy to carry around the downside is that it's super easy to lose and if you've got one like this one that I've got right here if you lose this part then this part is worthless and so you want to make sure that you've got a really really good one that's either on your keychain this one made by jet line it comes to go right on your keychain but if you want to get all the benefit out of a cigar punch then don't buy the punch at all you can get a lighter that comes with a punch built-in and this is my absolute favorite thing about cigar punches is there are a lot of lighters that are made with a punch built right into the bottom so you've got everything you need when you walk out the door this right here is called the Ganza and the benefit of it is it when you light it up it's like a jet flame that turns red it's wind resistant you can't shake it out you can't blow it out and it burns it like ten million degrees I don't know why you'd need that but the benefits of this one I really like is it's got that punch built into the bottom right here and I love this thing because as you slowly twist and turn and press it into the bottom of the cigar it's gonna cut out just a cap just the cap of the cigar and it's gonna give you a more defined smoking edge now if you do this too hard you will crack the cap on your cigar but a good punch will also pull that lid right out of there and then you've got a nice hole this will give you a perfect draw now here's all the mystery behind this a lot of guys will tell you that if you punch a cigar you'll get a stronger flavour out of the cigar because all of the tobacco comes and like culminates in this mall smoking area and so it makes it stronger a lot of that stuff is minutia that a lot of you guys aren't going to notice and some of it is scientifically insignificant when it really comes down to how you're preferring to do this it's gonna be a matter of opinion some guys like the punch just because they like the punch the next one is a cigars daily favorite it's my personal favorite and this is my Calibri deep v cutter there are other V cutters out there a lot of them not all of them but a lot of them in my opinion are kind of worthless this one does a fantastic job I've said it before you can cut a thousand cigars with this cutter it won't go dull but it also has its drawbacks let's take a look at it the benefit of the deep V cutter is exactly as the name describes it gives you a really nice deep v cut in the end of your cigar which is really nice because it gives you a cool and unique sort of drawing pattern right here I'll show this to you right here like this I usually cut these like that and you can look and see that I got a nice clean deep v cut here's the gigantic drawback with the deep V not all cigars have got a super deep cap on them some of the caps are real pretty thin and the deep v cut will actually cut too deep and cause your cigar to unravel I this happened with a few different cigars and they're not necessarily cheap cigars even some nicer ones some guys are gonna try to convince you that this deep v cut gives you a special benefit to your smoke because the V actually gives you a wider drawing area than if you just cut it straight or cut it with a punch this is something that is like scientifically insignificant the draw that you'll get out of this isn't necessarily going to be better than it would be with a straight cut or a punch but if there's a knot right in the cap of the cigar the deep V can help pull out that knot and give you a better draw but again when it comes to using a deep V cut over a punch or a straight cut this is a matter of your absolute preference I personally like the deep v cut and it's just a thing that I absolutely hate saying it's frustrating but it's a mouthfeel things I just like the way it feels on my mouth I don't even like to say it but it's the truth alright that's a deep v cut now you know the last one we're gonna look at tonight is probably the most popular type of cut on the planet and that is a straight cut this one right here is made by vertigo and it's a double blade straight cutter they have single blades they've got once with a backdrop on them so you don't cut it too deep but this is probably the most common most popular and original way to cut a cigar that there is out there and the most important thing to know when you're cutting a cigar with a straight cut is that you don't want to cut too deep I see pictures all day long all over the internet of guys who literally chapter cigar in half because they cut the thing so freakin deep and the goal when you're cutting a cigar like this one right here is you literally just want to pull the very cap off of the cigar and as little tobacco as possible I'm gonna try to do this without butchering it in front of the camera so if you can see right here I've literally got just barely the cap sticking through and I'm gonna slice that up but I'm gonna actually look at it so I can do a halfway decent job and then I'll show it to you again just like that and I've cut just barely the cap off of there and you can see that what's most of what's left in the cap is still there and I've literally just slivered off the very top of the cigar and by doing that you're gonna get the best draw with this straight cut now if you get a bad draw with any of these cigars and a hole all three of them up so you can see that can come not necessarily from the cut but it can come from the way that the cigar is rolled and sometimes that's just the way the cookie crumbles but the reality is that these three things come down to a matter of your preference none of them in my opinion is scientifically better than any other one and it all comes down to a little thing that disgust me when I say it called mouthfeel some guys just like the way these things feel in their mouths that's the way it is but I'll tell you guys I want to know what you like to do with your cigars do you prefer to punch straight cut or Vika and why put that down in the comments below because if you're a newbie like Dave struggle that can be incredibly helpful to you as you journey your way into cigars and while you guys are at it check out cigars daily comm for this best deals on cigars we're a family-owned company and we love to do a great job of customer service and lightning-fast shipping thank you guys so much for hanging out with me this is Tim signing off for cigars daily and I will see you all in the comments", "Y5l8sylLKCY": "hello this is Brooks Whittington with half whale comm today we're taking a look at the Red Horse knife works Condor cigar cutter red horses have been around a while and it makes all sorts of knives of various shapes and sizes actually founded by Edward Kim who was a former mmm a competitor as well as a former private to security contractor but the Condor specifically is a very high quality cutter made of very high quality titanium with blades also made of German bohler m390 steel which is a very convoluted way of saying that it's extremely high quality in fact so high quality that the cutter can go about 1,500 cuts without being sharpened again according to the company also the cutter uses ceramic ball bearings instead of steel ball bearings which is one of the reasons that this cutting action you see here is so smooth also last longer so it's should the blast quite a while once you once you buy it it was actually a the cutter itself is three point to five inches long so not very long at all and only 2.1 ounces probably because of that titanium very light in your hand very smooth action cutting it it is a modified single blade guillotine cutter as you can tell works kind of like scissors backwards scissors and it actually comes in three different versions at the moment there's a black one which this is there's a green one which replaces this black piece here with a green one obviously and there's a carbon fiber version which replaces that with a carbon fiber version all three of them are exactly the same it's just the differences this piece here this insert here and so after using this cutter for about five weeks on every cigar that I reviewed and smoked I can tell you some things about it very quickly first of all is the fact that this is a very well machined very well made cutter very high quality in terms of the materials obviously a lot of time was taken in the design aspect of it it's light it's easy to carry around it's pretty cool-looking and it has a another function that I'll get to in a minute so there's no problems with the actual construction of the cutter itself and how it works this nothing is not gonna fall apart on you anytime soon I can assure you but the actual cutting of the cigars did leads into some issues and the first issue that I ran into when I was actually cutting the cigars was this piece right here if you see this here it's a pretty inconspicuous but it actually causes some fairly significant issues for me I have a pretty big thumb and if you put your finger through here and then push down on this cutter here as you see the actual thumb catches right there every single time that I use this cutter that happens I can mitigate it a little bit by pushing down on the actual piece here so that ie doesn't go through there but it does definitely has to be something I have to think about as opposed to just putting it putting you know put this cigar cutter in my hands and using it the one of the cool things when you shoot when you're actually cutting cigars is this piece here the companies actually built that there specifically apparently to give you some more stability you push this finger here let me move this here there you go this finger here put this out here and it gives you more stability when you're pushing through it does actually work very very well the way it was intended now actually cutting the cigar we can actually go through this the there is another problem as you were actually cutting the cigar and the problem is that you can barely see how much of this cap you're actually taking off and so you have to kind of guesstimate a little bit but you put this into the hole you push this through you want to make it as perpendicular as possible and then you push down and push right through now as you can see the cut is actually clean but there is another problem in that the actual wrapper has a little bit of damage here this unfortunately is not unusual in fact that happened on about 75% of the cigars that I cut with this cutter some of the damage was minimal some of it was more specific and larger but it happened quite a bit on this one for example you can see the wrapper actually it's coming off just a little bit based on the based on where I cut it now the clean the cut as I said it's clean it's a very clean cut but that wrapper had damage on quite a few of the cigars that I cut with it it didn't matter what size it was or anything of that nature for the most part it has problems with cutting these and damaging the the wrappers itself however having said that there is another cool thing about it that some people made so I can some people may not like and that is the fact that the caps are actually caught inside the cutter here and so when you're actually done with it that counts not going anywhere you actually have to open it up and fish it out and drop it wherever you want to drop it so I actually am NOT a big fan of that because I have to actually do that every time instead of actually deciding you know cutting the cutter it comes out and that's the end of it now you have to actually open it up and actually make sure there's no more pieces inside and that kind of thing one more cool thing about it that it came in came in handy quite a bit actually is the fact that this is actually a bottle opener as well you can see this little lip here and this actually can be used as a bottle opener and so you actually use this here and you can actually take a bottle and you can actually take this wrong side uh-huh take this and you can actually open that bottle there it actually lips right here you can see and you just open that from there and I can open it because I don't need a beer at the moment but you can easily do it it works like a charm and it's really nice to have as you as you carry these things around it's nice to have something like this that works so well in that regard that's something that you need a bottle opener it can have it for you so in the end can I recommend the Red Horse knife works condor cigar cutter the answer is No it's very well machined it's very very well built it's actually fun to use because of how smooth it is it's it's it's a joy to you know to to carry but in terms of actual cutting it just it fails almost every time a little bit sometimes a lot sometimes but it it just you just cannot depend on it to to cut clean every single time without damage to the to the actual wrapper itself then you throw in the cost of two hundred and eighty-five dollars and you've got yourself an expensive cutter that that very rarely performs the way that it should", "BNEcTyiWgCY": "what's happening everybody furious peed here and today I got a cigar hack for you that's right not everybody has these cigar cutters with them at all times let's say you're on the golf course and you need to smoke a cigar with your buddies but you don't have a cutter you don't want to just bite off the end because that's really really bad because then you get pieces everywhere you don't want to just cut it off with a knife because again you get cigar pieces everywhere so like you take a cigar and let's say you cut that off with a knife and you can still get those bits and everything into your mouth and that is just the worst thing ever also in Cuba when I was there um I basically I learned this is the hack that I learned so I'm gonna play that for you quickly from a Cuban that that taught me this this is a cigar hat you would never see this never cigar 101 staying on access the backup as you can see he he is making a hole in cigar rather than cutting it he's making a hole so what you can do obviously the the type of instrument that you're using for the hole has to vary according to the actual thickness of the cigar obviously if the cigars this thickness you can't use something that is almost the same thickness otherwise you are going to destroy the cigar what I also learned within Cuba is that you know people really really appreciate the cigar and the tobacco leaves going into it and the whole process going into it so you really got to make sure that you are preserving it so what I'm going to do is take this cigar and take a golf tee basically let's say you are on the golf course and you don't have cutters but you have yourself a golf tee and so what you can do is just get into the middle right here and start making a hole you go in deep just like so right and that's it now you have a hole you can go really pretty deep here and now you have a hole ready for smoking now I would light it up but I I don't know if you can I don't know you guys currently can't hear it but there is very good ventilation going through right now obviously that also depends on the kind of cigar so you can just put that hole into it right there just like so and that's all you need you don't have to cut it all off it's still going to work just fine if if you make a hole like this it's going to work very very well you're not going to have bits and pieces go into your mouth you're not going to waste at a cigar whatsoever the cigar is ready to be smoked ready to be enjoyed just a little hack that I learned when I was in Cuba hopefully you guys enjoyed that video hopefully you guys enjoyed this hack next time you are out with your buddies and you intend on having a cigar use this hack if you don't have a cutter and even if you do have a cutter use this hack anyways catch you guys next time furies Pete wake up this video subscribe stay sexy stay hungry and of course get laid my friends should I do cardio before after now the answer is quite simple after um however a lot of people will argue that um I will never argue that", "-sQrgJH7Z7A": "it's politically incorrect to smoke a cigar it's politically correct to smoke weed with this shows how sick our society is that there's been a war on cigars but not on marijuana all right very glad to have our next guest as you may know some people right away will be incredibly offended triggered this is one time two also can get a long shot here yeah where we covered up our sponsor Walther they're not gonna be happy but they don't care they're good sports with our next guest book of course Exodus Exodus but the rationale Bible we've talked with him about that's before he's also a big cigar guy and pipe guys so today the entire episode he's going to teach us the ins and outs and also mattock and the loaded could go weird places a little bit of the legislative fight with with cigars very different yet the weed folks but still very real you can follow them on twitter at dennis prager mr. Prager how are you sir great to be with you my friend and I wish I could smoke with you right now funny because later today I'm doing my fire my weekly fireside chat know where a lot of thank God a lot of people watch and I smoke a cigar the entire time cuz I'm in my house right right now I'm at my radio studio I just finished my my national radio show so I can't smoke here but I do within the house I have a great wife who's totally at peace with it now by so I I am gonna give you more philosophy of cigars than you believe exists okay well let's get it we'll get into that but first we have to we have to like this this puppy what are you well because son computers in here didn't know if anyone this is just the standard brick house cigar which actually for the money isn't is not a bad cigar in my opinion my favorites are I think I totally the the Melania I like a lot I like the the Espanola Residence Life you know and here haven't you heard she's been cooped up some button somewhere he's a but this is just something that's a little less offensive for people in the room because you know sensitive Constitution so it's a normal brick house the Churchill length yeah gotcha so I want you to know I tweeted this out last month by sheer chance I came across an article morning news they interviewed the oldest American I think the guy's 111 or hundred thousand black guy the black guy is in the Armed Forces they asked him they said look we know you're always asked this but we'll ask you anyway what's the secret to your longevity and the guy without blinking just simply said God and cigars I said this is my man if he's right I'm going to 116 there you go what I love about him - he doesn't get it exactly in first up it looks like he's smoking very bottom shelf cigars if you wash it and he goes thinking is about well that smoke monster I don't inhale I do it the healthy way we're like well I don't know if you'd say the healthy way but it's certainly less harmful than inhaling yeah shows me and he's lighting it's not it's not like a vegetable it's lighting it on his stove if you want yes if you watch these like we had before we have to the first sketch once we had no lighter with us we had a lighted on an electric stove which hit spoiler impossible yes so he does do that if you watch the video go watch it I'll send it to you after it is video I read the article I got to watch the video you're right he's face version of stuff my father who passed away at 96 would have gave me given the same answer yeah got it cigars well I don't want him I don't want to mislead our audience I'm not I can't make the medical claim that cigars lead longevity but speaking of legging letting in our stuff okay so first off what's the proper way to toast and light a cigar for Pilar light first before that we have the biggest of all philosophical questions regarding a star what type of hole do you make on the top yes okay so those people who don't know it comes wrapped right and you have to make a hole obviously you can't breathe in any smoke right so there are three types a hole cut which I call circumcision it's just a hole cut right right the whole time guillotine yeah guillotine right another one is a bullet hole where you get a sharp thing and you die got here a punch right punch it in and the third is a v cut it's shaped like a pyramid sort of it's or viii and you slide the thing across the bottom it's steel and it makes a beautiful indentation and it that's my favorite at least rick is the whole car yeah you know what I have a V cutter and I like it on bigger gauge cigars not for those who don't know I was mainly a pipe guy this is something that Nike Gerry myself I've to pipe is great it is but I you were the one who got me into cigars more by he introduced me to some different kinds I had smoked before cigars before now I'm not a certainly changed cigar smoker but I enjoy them very much I have a V cutter I like that on bigger ring gauges for people who don't know they're different you know they gauge it gauge by ring size in the United States so 50/50 to I think this is a 50 by 7 a Churchill sized longer it would take a v cut I typically do it on 54 or large right to the v-cut and this is a 9 millimeter punch so a little bit bigger than the standard punch and this I do it's just totally opinionated a zoom in on it can we can we get a zoom on this the reason now I will tell you this mr. fragran maybe you can correct me the reason I like this is if a a punch is sharp and long it won't realize you know you can get cheap punches but it does have to be sharp there's no risk of it crushing anything or compacting like so if you don't get a good draw with a punch you're not going to you won't get a good draw with any cut is what I've encountered and it's convenient because I can keep it on my keychain if I go through TSA so that's why a man is this there you go oh there you go look he's got his whole keep there you go okay well there is that there you see yes I usually think it's a bullet yes yeah I've seen that too then I showed them you see I twisted it there and you could see yeah and they go oh it's just it's just a circular razor blade you're free to go exactly the guys don't know they don't know okay so toasting this because I want to get this started as we continue it's alright this is a very tough question I have bought the idea that you light it first and then you start smoking as a soup supposed to puffing in wild lighting I have no idea whether that is an old wives tale or old husband's tale as it as it is or or true I have no idea okay I do it now separately I somehow think it's a waste of time but I do it anyway I appreciate your candor so would you do it in a 45 degree angle and toast the edges show me here I've got the light going how are you do you put the net generally you put the lighter at the angle on this cigar straight out so what yes okay that's right and then just realize okay man I do you want to make it you been do you purge when you when you open the lighters being a little bit difficult here trying to diss on camera do you purge at all some people I know they do a quick purge of it because they claim of the butane might oh my gosh I am I am NOT in that arena no okay all right now wait now do it while puffy gaming you'll see how much faster of course yeah that's usually a so I'm not sure it's not nonsense there you go you see look at that yeah it may be nonsense it could be nonsense but I really like it is if I'm at a cigar bar and they've got you know women walking around lighting your cigar for you then I'm happy if they take their time no that's called hooters but I will smoke I'm sure that's a regular restaurant no no I you know you you ever been to cigar bars where they're there oh I have I haven't experienced the first time I ever had a cigar I look back and I know the person was measurement and I get to it has a cigarillo there so that's a soft flame lighter there um I went there it was the Chop House in Grand Rapids member that jerk yeah a great a great little cigar great little cigar lodge they would give you half off on your birthday with steak the best day cuz it I would go and get the venison medallions was my birthday I'd never had us to cut off your entire meal your entire me or to I never had a cigar before at this point I said I don't know what should I do they come up and they offer all the cuts and looking back I want to say because it was my birthday they gave me something fancy I don't something with a lot of Leggero in it which is free you'll explain to people very high nicotine looking back it was it wasn't Leflore dominicana might have been in something like an Opus it was absurdly expensive I didn't enjoyed it all and then they kicked us out because I said they have a party coming in so I'm driving home I don't nothing like and I have it basically hanging out of my mouth with the wind going by because my wife doesn't want this our smoke in the car like a snorkel breathing through it non-stop and I got home by the way I don't I don't smoke in the car even for me it's too suggested or under an arena well I like it I like to rule like you're sitting in now that's perfect this is what we do we have some air exchangers in here so the studio is good long story short I did not handle that cigar very well the room was spinning and I got very sick and then I learned later on about the different kinds of cigars so yeah I've been to a cigar lounge once now let me ask you this we can get into cigar philosophy and I want to continue with that one thing I've noticed for sure though if you're at lounges for example I was in Florida there's a cigar lounge or even in northern Michigan it seems pretty consistent across the board in my experience anecdotally that you find a lot of conservatives in the cigar nose right why do you think that it's because it's politically incorrect to smoke a cigar it's politically correct to smoke weed which just shows how sick our society is that there's been a war on cigars but not on marijuana yes this is not tampered with our brain well with my pilot smoke the cigar the entire flight I would be thrilled feed the entire flight I would not be thrilled smoothest landing your ass well it's true I think about every great every great piece of fiction of the last several centuries almost all of them nicotine or caffeine assembly no I'm not saying people should go out and light up cigars though they are no no cigarettes will kill you hourly kill one third of cigarette smokers according to the Lung Association die eventually of lung cancer and I believe that but two-thirds don't that's also significant too but I would not smoke cigarettes remember and this people don't understand that it drives me crazy when they say war on tobacco tobacco's not the issue inhaling is the issue you are not inhaling now you are bringing the smoke into your mouth for a taste right not it to your lungs for a nicotine effect this is true something else do I actually have this up in front of me the FDA finally released and I'm sure you know about this but I have to talk about us for audience the FDA released a study where finally eliminated people who smoked two cigars per day or less handmade cigars because all the previous studies included people who are smoking swisher Sweets and basically cigarettes that look like cigars at at gas stations and they found that people who smoked two cigars per day or less the increased mortality risk of cancer overall is statistically insignificant statistically nonsignificant that's very rare for the FDA to say something like that I did not know about that when did that come out I want to brought this oh darn it well you know what here people have already a chance to mention my book there you go Dennis pretty well think I'm actually a CS Lewis all of these guys always over piped her cigars back and they would philosophize they would get into theory they get into - what's the word I'm looking for here the real depth of the sea of life feel at theology ology I'm not a good ambassador right now look nicotine makes you dumb you should smoke weed it's a smart drug Exodus God slavery and freedom the rational Bible highly recommended I've been very much enjoying it here's a question for you how often are you supposed to what's the recommended amount of before you you you you tant you know tap the apps' great taps the ash Dennis before it falls on you I feel like the therapist in that Annie Hall the important thing LV is to enjoy ourselves while we're here what's the point he wouldn't do his homework no this FDA study hold on let me bring it up I believe it was 2016 and it was actually they finally eliminated they said okay and a big reason for this is because there's been a lot of new FDA regulations people don't know this work you owe me a favor seriously sent it to me okay I will and we have it here as an overlay for people watching and again I'm not advocating that people go out there and just start chain smoking cigars I'm just saying it is incredibly rare for the FDA to do and the reason they did it is because of the obama legislation they wanted to get tibet cigarettes out of the hands of children which we agree with but they included all cigars it turns out kids aren't smoking $9 cigars and people pan you know cigar makers that you have long long storied history with family cigar rollers and pipe makers that we shouldn't be treated the same as marlboro so the FDA did have to come out and release that study of two cigars per day early date on that study I but well what they do is they examine their studies and then eliminated those variables let me bring it up right here I believe it is 2016 the author's reviewed 22 perspective epidemiology studies and cigars so if the FDA acknowledges there's no cancer risk greater risk then I would argue that for many people it does bring longevity because of the calming effect that it has not the marijuana calming right just the relaxation with its with a yummy if that's why we do it I do it for it's because it's yummy it tastes great I love the taste that's why I like a pipe I'm sure looking at your pipes there yeah yeah because I love the taste of tobacco tobacco is a yummy thing I can't I don't i've never inhaled in my life I'm not Bill Clinton I would happily admit if I did but I have it I can't I would I coughed my brains out if I ever inhaled anything smoky to my lungs now what God you started into cigars my father was a cigar smoker he smoked all day I lived in 96 as I noted to you mm-hmm and when I was about 16 he said I said dad I'd like to taste one he said fine I know it's a non-issue he said I think if I'd have said it at 12 he would have said fine yeah so I did and I loved it and that was the that was it so I've been 16 my daddy was a smoker and his daddy before him his granddaddy before but he'll be a pipe smoker dude you will be a pro smoker - it is well it's migrant for I felt so guilty because my mom smoked cigarettes and quit the day she found she was pregnant and ever again I'm in French Canadians they every all of them smoked cigarettes was a huge culture of smoking cigarettes my grandfather than hand smoked a pipe and then he moved on to those cigarillos later on in life when I was and you know maybe about nine or ten and I remember I thought it looked so cool cuz my my grandfather right he's a coolest guy and it was in the ashtray but my parents always told me never smoke never never smoke if you're offered and I just took it to look like my grandfather and it was still lit and I didn't realize and so a little smoke one in my mouth I felt bad for years I felt like I had lied to my parents and I was I might as well been a smoker but on to me for haunted me for years but he didn't live long because he had up he had a blood clot and he refused to go to the doctors but he was up until the day he died close to 80 was super spry and healthy so how often would you say you you smoke a cigar dennis prager whoa I spoke with everyday and I but it's one a day I very rarely smoke more than one a day i smoke one a day then I don't also smoked a pipe full a day so but when I'm writing which is all the time and when I'm not broadcasting or flying or speaking yeah that's that's it's it's my companion and I and I love it and a lot of people by the way like cigar the smell of cigar smoke yeah I do a lot my wife does she can't stand cigarettes can't stand them but she really does like this by the way your point about the cigar lounge in every city virtually every city there's a place to go and smoke cigars right excuse me and I go all over the country constantly and the first thing I do is I go from the airport I rent a car and I go to a cigar lounge and you know most of the time somebody they will know who I am which I'm not looking I'm not wanting it happens but the beauty is even when they don't have a clue who I am they're so friendly yeah is that the it's such a bonding male experience cigar smoking yeah that's what the guys just talk to each other it's very and it's it's it's a great experience the whole thing is and if there's a young guy there I buy his cigar well that's right well just make sure to just follow you around the country that I'll have the padrone 25th anniversary mr. Prager would you say is a mark of a good cigar place what do you look for when you go to a different town find a new spot oh well I like that it's that it's not tiny that you know you can sit down in a very plush chair have it have your smoke you could be private if you want you could talk to people if you want and you could plug in your computer I do a lot of writing and cigar lounges so I I just did an event for my Tampa radio station and in the hand of a gigantic I mean truly gigantic allows the you know campus a big cigar city yeah and they I there were 200 people there in a cigar lounge for me to talk to them and of course they gave out cigars and so on I do a lot of cigar events around the country that's I've looked at some of your old archives like back as far as 2008 and there's you broadcasting with your laptop from a cigar lounge and I thought that that looks like a lot of fun and it's becoming increasingly rare places where you can go and do this but it does seem like the quality establishments stick around what what in your opinion is the mark of a good cigar for people who may not know want to get into it the the theories really there are only two answers to that if you like it it's a good cigar if you don't like it it's not a good cigar and and that's true for you know I mean I'm into audio equipment you know people say what's the best speaker so the best speaker is the one you like and I mind that other sincerely the other thing is though will it not fall apart as you smoke it that will occur on Apple port that's cheaply made cigar yeah like when I did George Washington remember and you what did you buy me oh gosh it was awful it was something really cheap and NASA we're doing so we were doing George Washington with a machine gun it was a sketch and we had it you know chewed off basically a block a mile with the tip colors of black it was like wine dipped or something we have outtakes of me because it kept going into my mouth integrating what was this we had to go to the drugstore last minute to do this sketch let me ask you this you've talked about the camaraderie I will say this why do you why do you think that is I've had some of the best conversations when my best writing like writing in groups with other people do you think it's because women can just sit and look each other in the eyes and talk and men often need a device whether it's playing pool or sitting down in smokin acid i think that i think there's a lot of truth to that and i I'll play this I've had some of my best talks with my sons over cigar for that alone it's been worth it I just dropped a ash on my desk so I missed that I'm sorry I meant to warn you you should have dumped it but I wanted to see how long it would go on my part yeah I know as you were time went from okay but you know the story about Churchill putting a pin in his cigar have you heard that day yeah he would take a pin or like a nail and put it in ago so it would keep the ash so long when he was having diplomacy talks that people would focus on this crazy long ash and not what his opponent was saying oh my god that's why I don't believe it but it's hilarious it's probably not true but it is a story Google is well known and he used to pierce his cigars you know he would do it no I don't think a pin is gonna keep the ash anyway that's it hilarious a riot I have no idea if it's true one thing I do however is um I put activated charcoal in this little mason that's my ashtray and if you put it the ashes don't smell in there the one thing that people do cigar smell nice ashes never smell nice you want to get rid of those it's quick oh that's interesting I didn't even know about that tell me about it so you know a lot of the air purifiers that you have either have an activated charcoal layer I have bags of activated charcoal you can do it you know sometimes people tell you use it for teeth whitening and stuff I just get it in a powder it's very very messy so it's important you buy it in a jar as opposed to a ziploc bag and I put a few spoonfuls and I tap my ash in there and you can actually inhale the ash it's melt and it doesn't smell bad at all it really does capture the yet not if I drop it all over myself like a  you put it can you put it in an ashtray you could easily put yeah you could put it anywhere the only thing is it's a very fine powder so the depth of this helps to keep it from blowing away at all if I'm like okay but you put it in that tray for sure um so we were talking about that so you think that really adds to the to the camaraderie is is a device to sit as I said I I really I love saying to one of my kids when they visit or if I visit them they don't live in California is you know a eight let's let's have a cigar together and then it's great yeah and if they're in California they're they're horrified and they they shun you you know in Burbank I live very near Burbank and you can't even smoke by Burbank City law in a cigar lounge how does that well are there any other are no cigar lounges then there can't that's right or cigar stores you can't smoke in a cigar store Wow right so it's so disgusting it's can you smoke in a head shop yeah exactly this is not a joke driving home from Austin we're spend computer infiltrated the LGBTQA a IP panel might my friend John and I wanted to cigar I had one didn't have one so we stopped today that unfortunately hatch they call it a smoke shop right so he stopped and we see all these bongs never gonna okay alright so they probably do you have any cigars here for chance and the guys actually yeah in the shoot and it's in the corner that's tucked away old humidor that had net clearly never been opened and we open it up and there was a Romeo Giulietta in there and it did you know the tube in the tube Oh kind it had the old label the old silver label before they even rear-ended and it could have been the best cigar whoever it was paraded private eating there for ten years the guy had never sold a cigar was to cut the fuzz off of them so what do you do then is it just the municipality of Burbank where you can't smoke a cigar Burbank and I'm sure other cities but I know because I live so close but I tell you it's so controlling of people's it's so it's so infantilizing you know an adult cannot decide whether he'll smoke a cigar or not in an enclosed place right you you know I used to go on Bill Maher show a lot when he was on ABC and and then you know then he moved and I have been on because I don't broadcast Friday nights but the for religious reasons but anyway I on his show once I live up it's a long time ago and the the you at that time you were at least at least fifty feet from the audience at least and I asked people no no it wasn't it was here was Bill Maher's anyway asked so how many of you think you're gonna be hurt by by secondhand smoke and most of the hands went up yeah I mean it's it's so easy to frighten people irrationally it's scary well explain that for it because a lot of people still believe that who are watching but you're you obviously know better there was research that when they finally actually conducted the research it's not nearly as harmful as people thought it was well first of all it is a brazen lie and it's terrible when science is used for propaganda it is a total lie the fifty thousand people a year die of secondhand smoke I don't deny that a baby that has that has asthma will be exacerbated if he's in a little room with the cigar smoke or cigarette smoke of course I understand that use your common sense yeah does it bother you does it make you coughed ever I won't do it that's fine but killing people from secondhand smoke Oh give me a break I was in in northern Michigan I told you this story and I had a little just a little Perdomo cigarillo there there huh ba\u00f1o and I was smart so that thing makes a lot of smoke and I was smoking it walking down the street little tiny cigarillo and the sky was with his wife INGOs that's right yet a pot leaf on his shirt and I'm sitting there like if only I were smoking a joint it wouldn't be a problem and that's smoke what's your so what is your stance on that as some people start doing that phony cough around electronic cigarettes that's just healthy oh I know I know I've seen it I've seen people do that exactly that's pure pure psychology well and you know what's funny though and this is a good example what we're talking about I decided to let those people walk on by I was sitting at a park bench while my wife retrieved some olive oils fine olive oil she's very into olive oils in balsamics and this guy walks by and he goes oh a stogie that reminds me of my grandfather he was from the old country and we had a conversation about his grandfather we talked for 20 minutes and he moved on as with his day nice guy just me said thanks for that memory I appreciate it and it does seem to be a bonding experience of a lot of people maybe just because it's been so ostracized now that's part of it but I don't know but you were right about having something to do it's amazing that that alcohol has not been demonized and tobacco has I wrote about that 30 years ago mm-hmm how sick that is how many people baluster child after a cigar or a cigarette and how many after alcohol well if you're counting pill Clinton isn't with the interns with a cigar but I don't think it's station no it was excuse the polls excuse results a little bit yes is it I'm not a Clinton fan but it's not mono station it's credit where it's due that's a good Pilate will say where do you line up then on on on marijuana and and how do you sir I hate marijuana marijuana tampers with your brain this doesn't so do you think marijuana should be legal people who want to smoke it in their house or where do you end up on that III my view was if it had always been legal I would not have voted to outlawed but since it was already illegal I don't know what we have gained by making it legal I know there people are needed for medicinal reasons nobody has a problem with it I have a an emotional it's one of the rare times I acknowledge an emotional reaction I am a child of the 60s 70s and I saw so many of my friends just to not of life as they would you know just have wheat you know they'd smoke stick after stick and i-i-i i have an egg attempt is with the brain yeah III am I'm really really opposed to and they inhaled to that's one thing by the way the one thing I will say but for us you don't inhale is there's no effect no that's one thing that I will say cigar smokers and general just want to be left alone they're not telling anyone it cures cancer they're not telling anyone that if that Big Pharma is suppressing it in my experience and by the way I think of states wanna legalize marijuana I don't smoke marijuana I'm not a fan of it personally this is a very controversial position but I think if States want to do it go ahead and do it yourselves but they claim it cures everything what's crazy is they claim it's not a performance-enhancing drug and a lot of athletic commissions they want people to be able to smoke marijuana and then they go around and say it sharpens you and it makes you more brilliant and it's this it's this miracle drug there is a remarkable inconsistency with it seems to me cigar smokers just just want to be left alone that's what I've seen yeah exactly but I I admit that I have a positive view I don't I don't merely think it doesn't hurt I think that of all the vices it's about as harmless as exists now wait you do inhale no no no no I buy retro hell the nose yeah but that's you know the that just you do you do that don't you don't someone that someone taught me that I don't know how to get it through my nose and I don't want to learn oh well you get you got to let someone told me this is actually Sagat a cigar expert from I think from aficionado and he said yeah you get all the flavors you said you kind of you puff and you just let it go out the nose and you get different flavors and actually you'll get entirely different flavors ones that arrive I'm surprised that I'm telling you anything about cigars that you don't I'm surprised too I admit it all right well there you go well give it give it a whirl it can be and you can a particularly there's a very strong pepper note you notice cigars for people I'm gonna give it a verb I'll say I'm gonna Crowder now Matt if you want to be popular at the cigar lounge I mean that that punk who dressed up like a lady and interviewed Wendy Davis we're not sure he's on our side what what what do you look for in a cigar because they're all different kinds what kind of flavor profile exactly what people say to me cuz so a lot of people give me a gift of cigar when they come to speeches and stuff I tell them because they don't know anything about it I said go into a cigar place and tell them the following I would like the strongest a best cigar you non non-cuban for up to the following price okay that's all I care why not timon not like I've never there is not a single Cuban cigar I've smoked that I've liked I like Nicaraguan and Dominican and Honduran what why is that do you think it's just I don't know I don't know huh why don't why don't I like you know I mean given food it's just it's my taste buds do not respond to Cuban cigars yeah I did not enjoy them you know for other the rationale Bible there's a lot of irrational I don't know I don't know I just don't like Asian I will say that in the commentary it's true I'm it's why it's called the rationale Bible I know I appreciate that that you say that you know I have heard and this is something to be could educate me on I've heard that Cubans think about it just like anything socialism communism once they were taken over by the government I think they may have ruined their cigars I think most people think of Cuban cigars there it's it's at the legend not the reality I'm Nicaragua makes spectacular sand I love strong it's funny this amount of alcohol I get a headache the strong a cigar I'm mr. happy were you always that way yeah always you know that's there's something but you should probably do something testing would be interesting with your with your brain type probably some what they refer to as ADHD or because a lot of people get very stimulated by cigars or cigarettes or any nicotine for me it's yeah but I'm gonna be going now two weeks to Eastern Europe to give some lectures and I I won't be able to smoke nearly as much I'll look up I am as far from addicted even though I smoke every day but I but I'm not addicted because I know if you can go I can go two weeks three weeks and it's a non-issue you want to hear something funny this is true when everyone had that brung I had a bronchial infection a sinus infection from hell and so I went two weeks we used to smoke pipes it was very intermittent it was maybe once every couple of weeks and with cigars now it's it's much more frequent because I just I enjoy them and because of you I've taken notes and I'm going through a whole cigar book now and my producer and I we actually keep a book of the labels on there um but I went two weeks without smelling any cigars of course I was sick and then I just I was doing the nebulizer and steaming and I said to hell with this I feel like crap I'm gonna try a cigar and guess what I coughed up what seemed to be a Ridley Scott film creature with a cigar and I got it's like it's not the best for smoking no that won't be in the next Arturo Fuente magazine it's you know a lot of people don't realize that that Cuban a lot of the seeds come from Cuba the soil was great and then there was no competition left in Cuba when I came to cigars it's whatever Fidel wanted Fidel got and so a lot of the really great rollers left to Nicaragua Honduras and Dominica Dominican Republic correct that's it yeah could you give us a like a couple I know you you do this in your private email oh so I don't wanna I don't want to let the cat out of the bag can you give us a couple of your favorite cigars for people yeah sure but understanding I'm I my favorite thing is to try a new cigar whenever I go to a cigar lounge I go show me something strong and good that I haven't smoked anyway I love all of the things called my father have you seen those I do I like the the bees you as my trait a favorite from theirs I think John likes the judge the most yeah the judges they're both great that my father is very tasty again it's on the strong side but that's what I like and of course I love Lafleur dominicana ee heroes because they're the SuperDuper strong mm-hmm - ee Ferro not the one leaf arrow is not strong enough it's all about Tula heresy either way some yes some of the patron anniversaire OHS are very yummy mm-hmm at or off one day is honor you know so is hit and miss yeah it's got a very good reputation and it deserves it whenever I see Rush Limbaugh he gives me an hour off one day which is very sweet of him nice and you know off the top of my head those are those are some of my my favorite Oliva makes a good cigar I know what I like box pressed have you had the the CEO flat heads at all I probably did but I don't have any recollection a whether or not it's the litter it's literally a cube and the label looks like an old muscle car so this thing is six by sixty they have in smaller Vitello's but they also have a seven by seventy called a big block which mean we do a writing binge and we write a bunch of sketches and commercials we sit outside and we we have one of those it's very it's very it's got a very very strong sort of fig flavor you know that some cigars had that like date fig ray yeah the flavors are the best it really isn't I tend to like the hub but this is just me speaking you can cry I noticed I tend to like the spicier cigars the Habano wrappers the with that kind of almost wasabi effect that's kind of what I call it you and I mean where it gives you that whoosh of spice and cedar that's kind of in my profile I've gravitated toward I am not believe it or not I never quite resonate they say chocolate or they say spice spice yes that's the one thing I can I can identify with but otherwise I either just like it or I don't right I don't analyze why I just at but my wife loves coffee I love cigars it enhances her life this enhances mine I really I'm grateful to God for creating it and what am I gonna tell you it's that's the way well we can't go much longer so I believe with it one thing I do think that is important to note for people out there who don't know like I said you don't inhale cigarettes for example have over I've read as high as 400 something active chemicals that can be added to it there's no paracin right it's not it's dishonest to love cigars and cigarettes just dishonest there's one ingredient in this tobacco and that's you explain to the audience three different there's the the filler the binder and the wrapper and can you explain for audience who might not know what that that means yeah the filler is the thing you see the most of what the ash that's right that's but you really are the binder is what keeps it together and the the wrapper is what you see on the outside the wrapper is the place of most taste right most of the flavor now not because of the smoke wood because this in direct contact with your mouth right right okay so that's now final words for people who might be interested I'm not do do not if you are not of age and if you do not if you have a proclivity to an addictive personality do not partake morning okay go legally I'm covered what would you recommend for people out there who are looking to get started my brother started to tell them I'm a novice I watched Crowder and Praeger they convinced me that this is one of the harmless joys of life for most people what would you give a beginner sir and show me how to light it cut it and that would be a blast for somebody to try it would and you know what my brother how do you know when you're done because my I'm getting second-degree burns yeah that's well that's a little cigarillo those burn very second-degree burns on fingers just fine it's my brother actions in LA and started a cigar and pipe club at his church and it's proven to be immensely popular if ever you want to connect with them with some great company great young conservative activists I'm sure they love to speak with you but I know you're a busy man final question before I go what is your philosophy that the reason I picked this is because it's longer and I thought I could maybe snip it and salvage it later do you ever do that do you ever blow it absolutely okay absolutely and I I don't understand why anybody would object it's yummy later too so what do I what's the best way to do this that's correct you you first of all dump your rash completely okay all right all right and then put this you know about you know an eighth of an inch of of the fire part and by the way for those who know I take it she I have a sheep cutter specifically ripeness oh I could tell here it's cheap yeah yes thank you very much about about like that yeah okay and then I'm gonna try to do this on camera here make sure yeah you gets hard to do it damn it yeah it looks like it might unravel a little bit later but you know what and then do I do you put this in a ziploc bag or just leave it out that's right yes put it in a ziploc bag there we go look look at all the stuff we learned with dennis prager and look at the good camera even even without a cigar in his hand but I do want to do the fireside I know you invited me out when I'm in Los Angeles I will do that come on exactly and just all you people know I mean we got a like a half a million viewers every week and I just talk about life to the camera take questions and it's at Prager

Orton wasn't selling many of them so I thought of that on there but then and it's still a good cuddler this is the Palio very good comes in a nice little punch and there's a little pouch it comes in but what's nice about this is you just want a very smooth cutting cutter it's beautiful the action on it is very nice between the two I think I go desire cart most times but this is a good second but that's just my opinion I learn a lot of people that really like the Paleo but I think you'll find this is one of the most popular cutters around you get all sorts of different colors and stuff in those so what are your other options well you could get one of these now this is a punch we do is you unscrew this particular one this is occluding profetas punch nice and heavy you can get one as you can see it's a got a hole in it and what you do is you push the sharp in there onto the end of your cigar and it make a little hole in the end of the cigar you can and pop it out pop out the bit that's left with that okay very nice good thing about punch I've got one of my keys it normally comes with keyring so you can leave it on your keyring so you've always got something to cut your cigar when you're out and about I was born amazed least as this contraption this is for older cigars these onyx and metal cutters have a V Cup and also that I would say they're probably not the greatest cigar cutters in the world but you will see them about I got this on a car boot sale for a pound but for me it's just a little bit of memorabilia and I find a little thing to collect and have I have no idea what this bit the end does I'm sure it does something and but they go so there you go that is the selection of cutters that I've got there are some other brands around but I would say these two those i-car and the Palio are probably the two most popular ones Cuban craft has also make some good cutters but ultimately you'll probably start out with one of these see the budget single or double blade cutter I that's been informing for you and if you want any questions please please just post below on the question set on the comment section cheers for now", "j1myRpbdKFo": "[Music] hey guys welcome back today I've got yet another cutter to go through this is the latest design from screw pop you might have seen my other videos throughout the years from screw pop they're a company that makes accessories that incorporate or have attached to a bottle opener they've done a number of cigar cutters in the past this particular one just has a simple notch here so there is your bottle opener and this is basically a guillotine almost kind of like a scissors cutter now I definitely had issues with all their past models there's always something major where it would keep me from using it or recommending it then using this one a little bit I can definitely say it's a lot better still not perfect but it's cheap a lot of people are definitely gonna like this design and it has some merits so we're gonna go through it we're gonna compare it to this Calibri which has a perfect cutter like side to it for a nice straight cut won't compare to the beat the benchmark standard the xikar of course the Palio's are just as good but this is definitely what every type of guillotine cutter is measured against as far as clean cut that's really all i care about and then of course the personal benchmark standard the Cuban crafters perfect cutters now even though this physical cutter has gone through no exaggeration thousands of cigars it is still as sharp as day one so it's not even unfair that this is a brand new screw-top compared to something that's chewed through thousands of cigars we'll see how they stack up but like I said the only thing I care about when testing a cutter does it cut the cigar well does it protect the cigar the worst thing a cutter can do is ruin a cigar pinch it not cut the cap cleanly start a split it cetera et cetera has to cut cleanly straight without any damage or that's it I will never use it again it's not going a whole bunch of cigars here we're just going to start chewing through some stuff got a variety of sizes these are all perfectly maintained just pulled them out of my cool adores this is a fairly light not so densely packed stick just for reference we'll do the Cuban crafters absolutely flawless as it is every single time you have no Ridge perfectly smooth perfectly straight cut okay this is the benchmark standard this is how it should always be likewise I expect the exact same from the xikar I'll just go up a little bit further down but the zyq are super easy to hold you've got nice beveled thick edges here to put your thumb and forefinger on and a quick snip exactly the same thing perfect cut no resistance both of these go through tobacco like a hot knife through butter okay that's how every cutter should operate now this Calibri I don't actually like the street side because the blade is so the blades I should say are so thick it leaves a very slight Ridge when they meet in the cigar you don't end up with this perfectly flat cut that's where I look it still cuts well but I definitely prefer a total Street cut so you'll see the difference here it still cuts easily but it leaves this little Ridge you can see it kind of right in the middle there like a little mound that's the only difference I don't like that it's not a problem doesn't damage the cigar but it's not as perfect as the other two so it's got a fresh cigar here and we will start using the scooped-out now there's a few different ways that you can hold it by the way I was only told this directly from the company the instructions that come with don't give you any kind of tips or tricks or suggestions or anything like that so you're kind of on your own you get this paracord like little tail and they say it's a help hold on to you can do whatever you want with it you can put your finger through the hole here where you can just hold it kind of like the xikar this is how I prefer to do it with big hands I just grab this little tail here between my little finger and then just pinch it just like a xikar now the downside is there's a spring mechanism so you have to position it manually and it's not as comfortable as as I card by any stretch of the imagination this edge is very thin and it's just rolled over metal compared to these type of lighters or cutters sorry then have a nice thick this is three or four times as thick so your finger has a nice comfortable place to land this is barely thick enough to even confidently get a feel for but they did that to make it very very thin and just slide it in your pocket personally I'd like it a little bit thicker these are totally easy to put your packet in so just take a little bit of finagling because there's no spring mechanism to hold on to so you got to get a position right don't squeeze it because it'll close on you before you get your cigar in there and then of course like the xikar you have to manually eyeball it close it just up till it's touching where you want it to cut and give it a quick snip hold everything steady because once it starts squeezing you don't want it to move it has significantly more resistance than the xikar the xikar like I said hot knife through butter just you just have to push your fingers together and a plow through this doesn't do that and it leaves a ridge just like the colibri does you can see well maybe you can't see but if you zoom in right now you can see there's a ridge okay that's just from the blade design the other downside to this is I don't know if it's just this particular unit or all their production or what these blades are not entirely sharp and they do pinch the cigar at the edges these blades are really sharp right down the center and even that is not razor sharp not razor sharp here is just downright dull and you can see it maybe you can see it the photos it's not even sharpened to a point it's just rounded off it's like they ran a sharpener just down the center and said screw the sides so the only part of the cigar that starts getting actually cut is the initial contact point and then as it closes right here these are just pinching and you can see the cigar deforming and then it slices so definitely not perfect but I will give them that it's a heck of a lot better than the old designs but again if you're looking for a totally clean cut with a sidecar for example no pinching absolutely smooth that's how every cutter should be so is it going to damage your cigars probably not is it safer to go with another one yes absolutely now I haven't had it do any real cracking or start to peel the caps or anything as long as you get it positioned and give it a nice even squeeze the only time you're at risk of that pinching being an issue is with the very thick wrappers or if it happens to be dried out that will start to split the caps and I do have a cigar here that is just notorious for being hard to cut that's he's freaking Romeo san andreas they are just terrible wrappers I mean they really are number one they come hard as a rock they say I swear they lacquered these cigars these are just the one of the most pain in the ass cigars that I've ever tried to smoke half of them out of the box crack it just split right at the cap doesn't matter what cutter I used that tells you it's a cigar so we'll do a couple here we'll do this i car first see what happens I'm not gonna be shocked if it even has a problem well that actually worked so good and bad example there but let's try another one let's try a few of them we'll use a screw top here see what happens you know what let me try the perfect cutter see how that does [Music] just a tiny little crack here but it did start to lift one of the shoulders try another got plenty of cigars the cool thing is cutting them ahead of time doesn't do a thing by the way that's another tip get a lot of questions about hey can I take my cutter safely on the plane with me cut your cigars ahead of time unless you're buying cigars wherever you're going you don't need to take your cutter don't risk it just cut them at a time so let's try the screw pipe here line it up with the first tip a cap there and okay messy but the caps okay so yeah like I said had bad luck with these but it's doing better than usual now but not not clean cuts not happy with that Ridge as opposed to the perfect cutter perfectly flat so there you go cool design definitely an improvement I would love to see it completely sharp all the way around I don't want to see any pinching in my cigars I don't care how cheap the cutter is not especially comfy to hold don't like this edge I would definitely prefer a thicker edge this is something that you interface with and comfort should be second to performance is it a cool design yeah I like the bottle opener whether you care about it or not that's up to you it does look good I like the way it looks it's got a nice finish I have no problem with the manufacturing of it tolerances are perfect so there you go worth it to you that's completely your decision but these are the results take it for what it's worth see you next time", "hbwIOkydLUU": "[Music] hey gary korb here my family question this month comes from scott in colorado who writes can you tell me how to sharpen an old cigar cutter my favorite cigar cutter a double blade model has gotten so dull it's doing more shredding than cutting i have other cutters but this one was a gift from my wife so it's very sentimental since i can't return it to the manufacturer for sharpening i'd like to try doing it myself well scott i've got several cutters my own they're getting a bit longer the tooth maybe a bit short in the tooth is a better way to put it but i recently learned how to sharpen my cigar cutter so watch this okay to get started you're going to need some tools you're going to need a rat tail file i'll talk more about that in a little bit some steel wool some cotton swabs and pads some alcohol and some dust off here's a cutter that i've had for years it's kind of sentimental it means a lot to me it's a a cutter that alec bradley did for a party he did many years ago with the playboy mansion that's kind of a fun story but anyway you want to clean it first you always want to have things clean so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to clean the blades with some q-tip here that's been dipped in some rubbing alcohol isopropyl alcohol is good too and we just want to make sure we get some dirt off it i usually leave this one in my car and you can see a little bit of dirt on there yeah it's kind of nasty you know those oils from the tobaccos get on there and you know you don't have to do this part but i guess you know you could if you want to and that's that's the main thing just make sure it's nice and clean okay and then you want to take a pad here and just kind of you know clean it up and it looks nice and shiny now yeah so all right and now we're going to get into the filing part of it all right so let's sharpen our cutter now what you want to do is you want to make sure that you have the blades positioned so that the beveled side is facing you first and i'm going to take the rounded side and i'm going to just use like the edge of it you want to do it kind of gently like everything else when it comes to cigar stuff you want to be patient so i'm just going to very gently use this poke through there just real lightly and you don't want to do it flat against the blade because then you're going to have real problems right you want to keep it at an angle so keep it at a nice angle you can already see some of the edge starting to shine up a little bit from metal coming off of it very very gently a little bit at a time okay and then what you want to do is you want to turn it around and you want to get the other one make sure you have the blade exposed to show most of the blade all right a little bit a little bit okay now you want to take your steel wool just sort of burnish that a little bit do this side now all right but now the important part is the other side of the blade okay so the flat side right here saying it's not beveled so we're going to do is we're going to take our cutter and turn it to that side where is that side okay here it is all right this is kind of tough to do so you want to take the cutter and you're going to expose that side of it the flat side right and then you want to use the flat side of the file so we get it in nice frame here and very gently with the flat side just kind of go over the underside of that bevel side and that will give you a little bit more of that edge but very gently and again at an angle now you know what if you have a dremel you might want to use that but if you don't this is the way to go and i'm feeling it now and it definitely feels a lot sharper yes very nice yes much sharper than it was that's for sure okay so now let's test it out all right now you saw me sharpen this cutter i'm back now down here in my garage and we're gonna really give it a test now let's see how it does on the cap because that's where it really matters right so let's see if i can get this position right and wow that was nice well i hope scott's a lot better with tools than i am but you get the idea so if you're going to start sharpening your cutters you know do so but practice on a cheapy cutter first like i did i hope you learned something from this video and if you like it then please like it on youtube that's it for this month's fan mail i'm gary korb see you next time and happy smokes", "zRuDz_nZJdU": "hey guys this is Jared with cigars Street now today I want to talk about cigar accessories I absolutely love cigar accessories everything from cutters two lighters the ashtrays you name it I love everything about cigars including cigars themselves and today I want to talk about the V cutter now I've been smoking scars for well over a decade and until recently I've never had a Vica cigar so went out and purchased this guy on Amazon got it for around $39 and I have to say I'm actually really impressed with it I've burned through quite a few sticks with this guy I've probably had this for about six weeks now and I pretty much almost exclusively use this on all my cigars and the nice thing about this V cutter is you can use it on torpedoes you know traditional shake cigars it doesn't matter so really impress with it and I just want to kind of go over the things I really liked about it and just kind of a few things that were initial concern with me but now that I've used it quite a bit and I've even let friends and family borrowed as well I really don't have any concerns with this cut and the way you open it it just has this little trigger here so you pull that trigger and the top part snaps open so the first thing that you notice is this guy's it's extremely jiggly as you can see here I can shake it with ease actually shakes on a song and that was a big concern at first I thought man is this thing gonna fall apart in a month is it gonna be a problem and I don't know if that's by designer or mine but it hasn't been a problem for me cuz as you draw the slide closed the top becomes more stable so the closer he gets to the bottom the more stable it gets so I'm assuming it may be by design if I'm wrong just somebody leave a comment below and let me know so but as you close it it snaps in place and it will cut your cigar I'm gonna cut this guy out on the patio but before I do that what I want to talk about is there's this little Bowl recessed area here and what it will do is allow you to simply rest your cigar in there even if it's a torpedo or a bellicose oow or anything like that you can rest it in there and you just draw shut to snap it in place and you get that perfect be cut so let's go out on the patio cut this guy up and see how well this be cutter works just to recap what I said a few minutes ago you pretty much pull this trigger here to release the blade that you're gonna use to cut the cigar now this bowl here will allow you to perfectly fit the cigar in there it stays in there pretty secure and you just slide it down so as you can see regardless of my cigar shape I end up with a pretty nice-looking B cut here I mean it does a pretty great job cutting messy guard okay so one of the key benefits that I found with the be cut cigars is that they really fill your mouth with smoke now if the scar is not putting off a lot of smoke it's there's nothing that's gonna fix that but in cases where you do have a cigar that's performing as it should with the big cut I noticed I seem to get a lot more smoke in my mouth I don't know if it's just something events in my head I haven't done a test where I've actually done a normal cut cigar and I'd be cut back-to-back I'll have to try that one day to see if there is any difference but for me it does feel like you're getting a lot more smoke output from the v-cut itself now the other thing that I want to kind of point out about the big cut is when I first started smoking to be cut it took me about a half a cigar to get used to it so the shapes a little weird as you can see here you got a pretty much fit your mouth around this whole area took a little adjustment on my part but about halfway through the cigar it was like I've always been using because it wasn't a problem at all now I was also concerned at that time that maybe a larger ring gauge like a 60 would be an issue with me because they're so big I've had a 60 ring gauge with the B cut no issues there as well I have to say as far as the quality of the smoke you get I think it's improves it improves it so much so that I pretty much will lean towards my V cut when I'm cutting cigar than anything else so I think that's the key advantage to having a V cut in itself now the vanish with the colibri cutter is that it's just very durable I mean like I said it's got a lot of nice weight to it it's very responsive it does jiggle but you know rest assured I'll be curious if somebody else gets one of these or here we have one of these let me know if yours does this as well if it's just mine but like I said once you start putting any pressure on it it's solid as a rock I mean I can't get it to to rattle at all and it just snaps into place so really impress with it no issues with this one and they come in a variety of different colors I end it with the gold one because I thought it was yellow and like a dummy I thought it would match my Jeep not quite they do have other colors reds blues blacks and a variety of different colors for the $39 $40 price range on Amazon and I'll have a link for that in the comments below okay guys that's my take on the colibri be cutter it's definitely worth the $40 I've been really happy with mine I think it's a well-built tool it's one that I pretty much just use on all my cigars if you've used this cutter before know what you think about it in the comments below and I'll see you guys on the next review", "mrL7rOG4FP8": "[Music] hello i'm mike and this is the enthusiast experiment if you're new welcome if you're not welcome back today i'm continuing on the trend of some of my favorite cigar related items usually i like to bring you packaging details when i have them but this has been with me for probably over a decade now so that packaging is long gone and i wasn't planning on doing any cigar related content on the channel but a few of you have requested more so i decided to share some of my favorite accessories with y'all and this is one of my most heavily used uh tried and true products it is a straight cutter by paleo which you can see here i will overlay a graphic that explains the different types of cuts so you can do a straight cut a v-cut which i'll have a video up here for you for one of my favorite v-cutters or a punch which i also did a review of a inexpensive punch option which i'll link above as well so this is the paleo cutter it is very simple and straightforward it's a composite plastic it's ergonomic design and shape and it's a large cutter opening which it can cut up to a 60 ring gauge today's cr market that's kind of small now i mean i've seen stuff up to 70 ring gauge which is just preposterous 60 is pretty ridiculous in my opinion but this will get you up to 60 for those super duper larger guys uh i don't know use a butcher knife or something um anyways uh so it is they are thin uh reinforced double blades of the cutter and they're made of a hardened stainless steel which they say you know stay sharper longer lasts all that kind of stuff and it is a i guess they're just using state-of-the-art polymers i'm not exactly sure i won't have a website down below for you guys because this company since i've actually bought this has disbanded and they stopped selling product they basically shut down and then were acquired by another company in the cigar world so have started back up so you can actually buy these again now um but since i've bought this one they actually closed and have now reopened so that's good good for news for you guys i don't know how the quality is on the newer ones unfortunately again i've had this for so long one of the things that attracted me was the design and also their warranty policy you could you know exchange it if anything ever happened if it broke or if it got dull but yeah you could see it's a super super simple design so not much to go wrong here i mean just slide it open put your cigar in chop off the head of the cigar what i mean about design is this is a very comfortable uh cutter you can see by the little extensions they have on both sides here it is ambidextrous i guess if you want to call it that but you can use it either in either orientation and this gives you a little extra pressure to push down and cut the cap of your cigar and again you can do it on either side no problem plus one of my favorite features about this is that it has little indents on both sides so again it doesn't matter which sorry which way you set this down on the table there is a little rest for you to actually rest your cigar uh as you're smoking it if you're not at a place that has a ashtray or you know somewhere like that or if you're i guess afraid to put your cigar down on an ash tree i don't know but yeah again there's not too much i could say about this other than i've been using this for a really long time and it is still as sharp as the day that i bought it um it's been crushing it i'll even use this if i use my v cutter as a stand so it's pulling double duty i really really do like that they're the online pricing is kind of all over the place i've seen them for 20 bucks or less all the way up to 30 plus depending on which finish you get they have a ton of different colors and patterns and finishes and i think all of them are this plastic the polymer plastic composition i don't know if they have any full metal compositions but again i haven't used this for so long there's not been any issues and i like the lighter weight that the plastic allows but it still has a little bit of a heft to it so for me i actually prefer this material especially if it keeps the cost down if you can grab one of these for 20 bucks that's a steal as far as i'm concerned um because some straight cutters are pretty expensive and not that good of quality and this is pretty inexpensive and excellent quality so beyond that i really don't have much to say if you're looking for a straight cutter or a backup or you know a gift for a friend something like that this is phenomenal not only does it cut your cigars without any issue but you can use it for a rest and yeah i appreciate you guys swinging by and checking out the video i would also appreciate it if you like shared and subscribed so that we can grow this channel together and until we meet again take it easy", "7sSvQ8OPxfc": "[Music] what's wrong long for back in with another video for you this is for my cigar smokers this videos about when and why you should buy a better cutter if you're starting to smoke cigars you're going to have to buy a cutter at some point you can go to the lounge and they have cutters there for you but you're gonna have to have your home color is just something that you just need to have maybe once one part it looks good it makes you look like you know what you're doing and other part is you want to be sure that you are cutting your cigar the right with your home clutter alright so the first thing is when should you buy a nicer cutter so let's first let's talk about being cheaper cutters I have quite a few cheaper cutters here here's one of the first cutters I actually ever purchase and this was given well i purchases what gives me at this time now this is my first one now what is it about cheaper cutters that good good about cheaper cutters with cheeks and calls me hardly anything and they cheaper cutters can cost you anywhere from I like this one around maybe three or four dollars and this one will be around seven seven or eight dollars for a cheaper car and I also have this one right here and this a v cut and a straight cut you're straight cut cheap cutter kids one thing I don't listen to tell it's not moving that it's one of the cheapest words you can get and then the blade is just one blade one blade all you get so you can step it up a little bit more and you have two blades two blades right there and then of course you have here the double that's nice too but it's at one point at some point you're going to have to go ahead and not discard it but realize it's time for a new cutter it's time to spend some money on a cutter and how much money would you be spending on a new cutter rather than this six six to eight dollar cutter you're going to spend around twenty-five all the way up to fifty and even some of them cost a hundred but I wouldn't I'm not talking about those right now I was talking about these these cutters Colibri daikon one of these two they have other more expensive cutters while are all their lines but least across them of the companies I really endorse alright so what are you getting this first talk about the diet are what are you getting now first of all this is heavier material yes to blade which is good and it's made out of a thicker thicker push harder flatten the still plastic is not metal but sticker harder plastic especially was I car the same you are getting that's worth every penny is a warranty there's a lifetime warranty you spend it back with I Cox to either replace it or face it so it's actually worth it because if you're smoking enough to dart it's going to go dull your your cutter is going to go down officially and and they don't sharpen a cheaper cutter they don't sharpen the cheaper cutters as sharp as these they just do not it's not the same it's absolutely not the same so if you are purchasing this right here for anywhere from 24 to 30 $30 it's a great deal because of the warranty you're not going to hear it's almost like insurance you're not going to be let down because if something goes wrong it's replaced or it's going to get sharpened so the colibri doesn't have the same warranty but what it does have is the workmanship the craftsmanship and this thing is designed to last a long time you can see how thick they are the screws aren't aren't both grown this week here I'm not so sure I'm not so sure that this is the actual food and keeps us together and not really I'm looking at it I'm not sure I'm absolutely positive that this is the absolute screws that are used to keep this together and look how thick it is compared to it it didn't cost that much more if this was a it was $40 this is a 25 then also what are you getting you get you getting a little more action you're getting a little bit more quality and it's spring-loaded spring loaded so you get mad also it's not so crazy to spend $40 on a cutter if it's about time and so what I'm saying to you is if you've had enough cigars or you've got come to the point where your cutter has dulled your brick your of your old um cheat cutter your cheap cutter starting to dull just go ahead and shell out a little bit more money and get a real cutters well here's another thing see that is broken it's bound to happen if you have that you cut it's bound to happen they will break them in if you have a nice ricotta either built to last clearly or it can be replaced and or fish like the sidecar all right near the boy I hope this video helps you out this [ __ ] informative for you and you learned a little bit about color I drove long strips folks on high [Music]", "F8iICXMDAzs": "miss Brooke's Whittington with half wheel comm and today we're taking a look at the benchmade 1500 181 cigar cutter now I know what you're thinking to yourself you're thinking benchmade is a knife company what are they doing with a cigar cutter well they did produce a cigar cutter they just came out with it just recently this year and they had 250 numbered units with the cigar cutter now the cigar cutter itself is extremely well made carbon fiber with a stainless steel blade very very easy to open has what they call it axis lock which is essentially a way to open the blades from either side one side or the other you can open it it's very very very well made as you can see they are number we have number 81 out of 250 gorgeous gorgeous looking in fact it has a real sapphires on the handle here trigger as well as a white-gold bevel the blade as I said a stainless steel it comes open very easily when you when you click the when you do the trigger I'm very solid it's very very heavy 4.2 ounces which is quite heavy for a cutter very well designed cuts up to 56 ring gauge cigar 's and it actually has a lifetime warranty that includes sharpening which is very unusual when you're talking about a we talking about a cigar cutter in terms of the company itself covering it for that for that sharpening they're all made in America and they are definitely definitely priced very very interestingly the the MSRP on these are $1,000 now street price is about 850 but each one of them at $1,000 it made a splash when it was released and it's definitely something that we wanted to take a look at and see exactly how it how it worked now after about after about on the say three and a half weeks using this cutter almost exclusively for every cigar I cut for review and for our personal use I have come to a conclusion that it cuts very very well up to a certain point and then does not cut well at all and I'll show you exactly what I mean the idea is that you open this cutter and you take this cigar and put it in here and when you cut it cuts very well but and about 90% of the cigars that I cut I had issues with the CAF it cuts very well for this part here very front and then at the very end it just destroys the cap it cuts it and just leaves it just absolutely mangled now 10% of the time give or take you know I had a pretty decent cut but it was never so clean that I thought to myself wow that's just awesome it does matter if you're cutting you know a little bit or a lot you know if you cut just a little bit off of there sometimes it does not have a problem not very often and when you cut more that's when you've got the issues there it's very obvious and it happens just about every single time that you cut the cigar very simple to me you know if you're going to cut and destroy the destroy the cap like that it's it's very very simple decision in terms of what we can recommend thousand dollar cutter she cuts cigar is extremely well every single time and this one does not it mangles them more often than not it is definitely not something that I would spend the money on the reason I think if you care is that you are going to have a gap and I'll show you a picture there's a picture that will pop up here and there's a gap in between the blade and the edge of the housing right there on the end and I believe that's why that is cutting that just like that every single time so is the benchmade fifteen hundred 181 worth the thousand dollars MSRP that has charged for it the answer is absolutely not not unless you want to spend a whole bunch of money for a really really really crappy cut so that's my take this is half wheel calm you want to see more reviews on cutters lighters cigars just about anything having to do with cigars check out the website half will calm", "nzbD-zNdbSQ": "I'm insomniac and this is the paleo cigar cutter for those of you who have a humidor but would like to give your cigars to find care they deserve the Oshkosh premiere humidifier is the best know refilling for months as it holds about 10 ounces of water it'll last about twenty times longer than foam sponge in about humidifiers no chemicals need to be added in because the cellular material is consistently moist it'll last many times longer than other humidifiers but the Oshkosh primary middle fire every opening of your humidor is a symphony of aroma where your well cared for cigars feel in light just like your in Havana know before I get into this review want to give a big shout out to the patron that actually sent this in for me much appreciated I didn't forget who you are I just didn't want to say your name here on camera because we actually didn't discuss crediting you in the video and some people are kind of weird about having their names in the video if I don't ask first or whatever so you know who you are and thank you very much so a couple of things that get out of the way ahead of time with this cutter first of all I don't know how you say that I said in the intro paleo but that could be Polly Oh Polly you Polly oh polio I don't know how to hell you say that that's the only thing I don't like about the whole cigar industry is I can't say half of these names whatever the hell it's called I'm just gonna be saying paleo through the whole video so hopefully that doesn't burn your ass if I'm saying it wrong I really don't know what it says second thing to get out of the way this cutter is ugly is free I mean god it is ugly in fact the only reason I didn't have one of these beforehand is because it's ugly I mean look at it doesn't matter which way you hold it either it doesn't matter what the angle is if you're holding it this way you're holding it this way really the only way it looks good is here so yeah that's that's a bit better got its ugly a function over form when it comes to cigar tools for me I don't careful lighter or a cutter is pretty I need it to work well so the reason why this was sent in at all I won't go into a long rambling thing about the cigar cutters that I've been using on camera because for those of you who missed the video that I put out only about a week ago about Calibri versus xikar and I also tell the story about why you no longer see xikar products on this channel watch that talking cigars video and you will be caught up to speed but the fast-forward to the general end of it I have to Calibri cutters not to say I'm not going to use those anymore but I have them and I'm not happy with them and I'm not gonna use i-car products on my channel anymore so one of my patrons sent me a text message and said hey I've been using this cutter I'm super happy with it it's a great piece do you want one to try out on the channel see if you like it you could use it and the ordered one and had it sent here and here it is now let me give you a little bit closer look at the cutter because regardless of whether or not you think it's ugly or not has the brand name on the blades on both sides so there's a little bit of attention to detail there you also have this kind of little plaque like thing that has the brand on it and that is actually also on both sides see if I can get the other one for you there it is so there is some good attention to detail there also I will admit that if you have your eyes closed this cutter is really not that bad it's very ergonomic it's actually fairly light probably because I believe this is plastic I don't think it's metal the blades are obviously steel or some type of steel I'll probably have that in the spec screen in the beginning but the body of it is some kind of plastic but it does feel good in the hand you have large cutouts which are great for your fingers so I don't have large sausage fatty fingers but my fingers actually fit pretty far through here which means I'm sure even if you are a much larger guy or have big fat fingers that they'll probably fit in here just fine and also speaking economics this not unlike some other cutters that I have reviewed here before has that bevel on top and for those of you who aren't sure what that's for there you go now you learned something of course obviously you wouldn't be holding it and wobbling it all around you would have this sitting somewhere but it is a good idea for a cigar holder until you get down to about an inch and a half you're just burning your cigar cutter personally I don't use my cigar cutters as cigar rests but it is cool to have that as an option if you need to set your cigar down now one thing to note about this cutter is you can see that it's a fairly large size but compared to the large size of the cutter itself the blades in the opening are really small now for those of you who are either new to cigars in which case you have an excuse and it's no big deal and for the other half of you have been smoking for 20 years but you're just doing it wrong definitely look at my talking cigars video called you're doing it wrong I address a lot of things in there this is actually not a problem you're probably thinking well I smoked 56 ring gauge 60 ring gauge 70 ring gauge which by the way if you smoked 70 ring gauge please stop this is actually not too small to cut just about any cigar and that's because like I've talked about in more detail in other videos the diameter of the cut is always supposed to be smaller than the diameter this cigar even this one which I did kind of quickly and sloppily the diameter of the cut is smaller than the diameter of the cigar so even if you're smoking larger rain gauge cigars you're gonna get enough of the head through here and I've tested this with a lot of cigars so far since I've had this cutter that you can cut it and get a proper sized cut and obviously anything under fifty four or fifty six rain gauge is gonna fit in here just fine because again you're really not supposed to fit it in there as in fit the damn cigar through the cutter that's not how you use it but again that's a whole nother video now before I get into operation which is obviously the most important thing with this review I will get into one little tiny thing that burns my ass because obviously I like to pay attention to detail now it's not like this is a hundred dollar cigar cutter so this is not a huge deal but when you actually open the cutter it's not nearly as neat looking you can see that it has kind of overspray on the light like slide rails there and you kind of have some extra pain up here things just kind of look a bit sloppy when the cutter is open you can see some there as well so not a lot of attention to detail on the inside of course your cutters really not sitting open probably most of the time when you're not using it at least that's not the safest way to have it and most people probably aren't as anal and ridiculous as myself so they're probably not looking at the inside of the cigar cutter go that's sloppy and of course the most important part of this review is how it cuts now I've only cut about I'd say about 50 cigars with it so far mostly off-camera I've only used this on camera a couple of times but here's what you really want to kind of look out for if you've been using a different style of cutter this whole time one of the biggest differences between this paleo or however you say it cutter and things like the xi1 or even the two Calibri cutters that I have those are spring-loaded and what I find is that the spring-loaded mechanism actually helps in terms of lining up the head of the scar before the cut because you have a little bit of tension so you can kind of lightly squeeze on the spring-loaded mechanism until the blades are touching the head of the cigar you get it lined up exactly where you want it and then you squeeze it now this one wouldn't be a big deal if it was more free-floating but I don't know if you can tell there but it's actually very notch II and very sticky and not sticky like there's something stuck in it just the operation is very kind of stiff and nachi and it feels kind of like plastic sliding against plastic which is probably what's going on here and why it's really not the smoothest operation now like I'll show you in a minute with a couple of cigars the cut I've been very happy with the cut is buttery smooth once you have it lined up after kind of screwing with the notch enos of it a little bit because here's what I'm trying to explain with that if you're just opening or closing the cutter it's not a big deal but if you're lining up the head of a cigar which I'll show you in a minute when I get one out and you're trying to just adjust it a little bit it kind of notches like that on you and what happens if it notches like that when you're trying to line it up and just get the blades at the ends is you wind up kind of slicing into the cigar a little bit and if you cut into the wrapper of the cigar somewhere that's either below the endcap seam or above the end cap seam but lopsided or you're kind of just committed to going through with that cut because otherwise you're gonna have the wrapper on roll on you so it becomes a little bit of a pain in the ass in terms of lining up the cuts for me perfectly and of course one little kind of trick or way around that would be to actually just close the cutter a little bit of course this is gonna vary based on the head shape and ring gauge of the cigar your smoke but you could just close the cutter a bit and then press the head of the cigar up against the cutter and then if you have enough of the end cap coming through that you're gonna slice off the right amount then you can cut from there but I find that to be definitely more of a waste of time than you know putting the cigar in and then just getting the blades where you want them and then being on what your cut so I have a couple cigars here that I'm gonna cut for you and don't worry before you see me cut these cigars at the head and maybe other places these are cigars that were damaged they arrived damaged because USPS ships things here like animals now these cigars are cracked and ruined and damaged and I use these as demonstration sticks for things like this so I'll show you the cut here first of all I'll show you what I'm talking about in terms of lining up for the cut which this is actually not as big of a deal for most of you watching it kind of becomes more of a pain in the ass for me because I have to have the head of the cigar facing you when I cut on screen for the reviews most of you we're not gonna have that problem because you get to actually have it in front of you and take your time even then this nachi thing becomes a little bit annoying I'll show you what I mean is best I can so here we have the cutter here we have the cigar right so you're starting to put the cigar through the cutter a little bit have less of an eighth of an inch of it through there and you see that that wasn't me pressing hard at all that was me trying to just move the blades a little bit and that notch enos kind of just shoots it forward because once you put enough pressure on it to get build past that stickiness it kind of moves the blades a lot more than you want it to and you don't line it up exactly right once you do though you have a buttery smooth cut you don't have any kind of jagged edges you don't have any kind of strange point or anything like that you don't see any cracks or peels on the wrapper and this is a wrapper that's already destroyed on a fragile cigar and still a very clean cut so once you get past the notch enos and you line everything up it does cut very well and one more demonstration stick that I pulled out a very nice clean sharp cut but anyway I guess the super long story short with this is I am happy with this cutter and compared to the complaints that I had which again go back and watch my talking cigars video on Calibri versus I car compared to the complaints that I've had with the two Calibri cutters you've seen me using on camera pretty recently this is actually a better cut as far as the sharpness and accuracy of the cut with this cutter I am pretty happy with it so far I guess the kind of super short summary here in terms of my experience with this cutter in the week or two that I've had it in the 50 or so cigars that I've cut with it is that it is ugly as hell construction has a pretty good quality look to it and fairly good attention to detail but the plastic kind of feels cheap the ergonomics are very good - the feel of the mechanism it is just really really sticky and nachi but the tolerances are tight the blades are very good and so far the cuts that I've made with this cutter are generally very accurate very smooth so it is a cutter I could recommend especially for the money it really is not very expensive so it is a cutter that I think you could try if you're looking for an alternative to the xikar stuff or the colibri stuff pretty cool well again big shout out to the patron - sent that in I super appreciate it if you owned one of those or have owned one of those definitely leave a comment tell everybody about your experience with it and tell everybody what you've thought of your experience with that cutter so far obviously honest feedback is definitely what helps a lot of people make informed purchase decisions so hit the comments tell everybody about your experience with your Polio cutter paleo whatever the hell it's called I don't know and if you want

look at the cigar cutter knife cm8 by lily flores who is a third generation knife maker who produces knives and blades in historical process and basically makes them like the craftsman of various time periods would in the same processes that they would use now the website that these blades are sold on is called triditione sarde export and that website sells from different artisans knives like stilettos damascus blades even switch blades and this specific blade from lily flores is a cigar cutter as well as a knife all in one product now for the physical characteristics of the cm8 cutter and knife as mentioned it is a cutter and a knife both and it is entirely made of metal the handleless brass while the blade is stainless steel in terms of physical characteristics it weighs 4.92 ounces and measures four inches when it's closed with an overall length of 6.75 inches when it's open which as you can see here is about the size of a dollar bill just a little longer than a dollar bill now it includes a small link that you can see here you can use that to attach to a keyring or something of that nature the diameter of the cigar opening is exactly 0.75 inches 19 millimeters you can cut a 46 ring gauge cigar and completely in half while you can also cut the you know the caps off of a 54 ring gauge cigar give or take anything better than that and you're going to have some issues with it the price is 183 dollars and 33 cents it is currently out of stock on the tradition a saturday export website all right so as part of this review i've been um using this uh cigar uh cutter knife for about three weeks and i wanted to show you how it's used and the best way to cut cigars so essentially what you're going to do to open it is you're going to pick it up you're going to hold on to the base here and the blade and you're going to pull them apart which opens up the blade now you can use this at this point specifically as a knife and it's a very sharp knife that no issues with that whatsoever or you can cut a cigar with it if you're going to use it as a cigar cutter then you're going to take the cigar in this case a 46 ring gauge and you're going to put it into the opening of the cigar cutter and then you're going to push down and push the knife through now there's only one thing that you need to remember the most important thing you need to remember when it comes to using this is that the beveled edge which you can see right there needs to be facing towards the same side that the smaller piece of the cigar the cap of the cigar is going to fall off on and the side without the beveled edge but that does have the logo as you can see here that side needs to be on the same side as the side of the cigar you're going to smoke so if you hold it in your right hand the cutter you're going to take it like so you want to put your thumb here on the blade of the scar a cutter and you're going to use you're going to put the cap of the cigar into the opening like so and you're going to make sure that that beveled edge is on the facing the right the same side that the smaller piece of cap is going to be cut off and fall off on you're going to put it into the opening you're going to then get as much as you want or as little as you want taken off and push through like that so as you can see it's a fairly decent cut not great by any means still some tobacco left on there and and certainly not clean by any means whatsoever but if you were going to use a larger ring gauge let's say a 54 which we have here then you're going to have the same process this will not fit all the way through the opening and so you're going to just be able to put just a little bit of that cap on there you're going to put it in you're going to get as much as you can off there cut through and when you push through as you can see uh more significant issues with that cap when it comes to the actual cut itself lots left over a little bit of damage to the wrapper but not exactly a clean cut when it comes to uh to uh cutting that uh that cap if you wanted to do something like a 60 ring gauge which is uh certainly not unusual these days uh you're basically going to be out of luck you have a 60 ring gauge cigar you're going to try to put through there as you can see um it barely fits through it it doesn't fit through the first opening and there's certainly no way that you're going to get enough of a [Music] of the the cap cut in order to smoke with the cigar so you're going to be stuck with about 54 and below if you're using this as a cigar cutter with the opening you could still cut it with the actual blade of course um although that's uh sometimes can be uh fairly problematic now this cigar cutter was probably specifically made for not just smaller ring gauges cigars but also for italian specific cigars like this which are open on both sides both ends as you can see they're already cut and basically what they do in order to get them cut is they put the cigar cutter through here they cut uh in the middle and then when they're done with that since both ends are cut they have two separate cigars after they cut in the middle all right so i thought we'd go through a list of good and bad things about the cm8 uh cigar cutter and knife um after using it for about three weeks i have found a few things that i love about it and a few more than a few things that i that i don't love about it but we'll go with the good things first first of all it is made entirely of metals i mentioned before and it is built extremely extremely well um this thing is not going to fall apart on you it is is it is built like a tank uh and it is obvious when you pick it up that it's a that it's a you know it's a well-built um piece of equipment um it does have a very thin footprint as you can see um it's it doesn't take up a lot of space in a bag or something of that nature it is a little heavy to carry around in a pocket which i i did not really like carrying it around because it is heavy um in terms of you know how thin it is it's actually surprisingly heavy um but it's as a you know to put into a bag or something you're not going to remember it in terms of or feel it when you when you pick it up um it is a very nice thin and easy footprint when it comes to that it does look great visually from a visual aspect it's really really unique uh the blade especially uh something that when i when i was using it you know people would ask you know what is that you know how do you you know how do you cut with that things of that nature and so i love you know showing things off and i love being able to have conversations about you know unique uh products and this is definitely fits that bill and lastly you can actually see where you're cutting so a lot of these cigar knife cutter and combos you have a major problem with me actually being able to visualize where you're cutting a uh one of the um the caps and this is not that case at all you can actually see um very well uh not perfectly but certainly close enough to um to get to where you're going in terms of how much of that cap you're taking off and that's just not always the case with these type of products now in terms of the the bad things about it there's uh there's quite a few but the biggest thing that i that i had a problem with was basically the the the the fact that it just does not cut cigars very well at all um it's limited in the number of cigars you can cut ring gauge wise up to you know about 54 52 54 you can cut fairly well um but in terms of you know the amount that you're taking off but in terms of actually cutting the scars you're just going to have problems with just about every cigar you cut i did they were very few times that i had a clean cut on any of these um only the cigars that i used this on and um that's a problem when you're talking about a cigar cutter that you're trying to carry around and use you know on a consistent basis um the price is you know 183 dollars is is indicative of it being a a custom made product no doubt but in terms of a cigar cutter that you just can't depend on day in and day out it's a it's definitely a problem it's difficult to open as you can see i struggle to open it um it's it's very very very stiff and did not get any better that i could tell in the time that i was using it and so it makes it more difficult to actually use when you're actually cutting cigars in that regard and finally impossible to keep clean it is it is a it is a figure and fingerprint and dirt magnet and it shows it every single time there were times when i cleaned this thing off uh multiple times and it just comes back instantly there's there's impossible to keep clean and it shows everything and so after all of that can i recommend that you purchase the cigar cutter knife cm8 by lily flores unfortunately answer is no there's one thing that a cigar cutter must do and that is cut cigars cleanly and consistently and this product just does not do that there are other disadvantages as well the fact that you can't cut anything larger than a 54 ring gauge give or take the fact that you can't keep it clean to save your life the fact that it's difficult to open and close even after three weeks of testing and therefore more difficult to use and the 183 dollar price tag all of these equal a product that is really more of a conversation piece as opposed to an actual working cigar cutter for halfwheel.com this is brooks whittington for all of your review and news needs in terms of the cigar world visit halfwheel.com", "VvKCaee37OE": "hello this is brooks whittington with halfwheel.com today we're taking a look at the benchmade 1500 cigar cutter now benchmade is a very popular knife company that has produced any number of creations over the years but in 2018 it introduced its first cigar cutter the 1500 181 they carried a retail price of 1 000 and was limited to just 250 units now that cutter was followed by subsequent models until august of this year when it announced that it was producing a single guillotine blade that was regular production and priced at only 250 dollars the 1500 which is what this is shares a similar design with the original version but the handle is made of rich light which is a material made of resin infused paper that is water resistant sanitary and is both heat and fire resistant the blade on this cutter is cpm s30v stainless steel with a hardness level between 58 and 60 and is only 0.9 0.09 inches thick it weighs just 3.95 ounces and measures at 4.185 inches long which as you can see here is about three-fourths of a dollar bill retail prices i mentioned is 250 on this cutter it is a regular production and it does feature a very nice leather sheath with the price that fits the cutter like a glove now as i mentioned benchmade introduced the 1 500 181 back in 2018. this is that cutter here now there were quite a few problems that i had with this cutter and starting and almost ending with the fact that it is very difficult to get a clean cut off of it and you can see when you actually cut a cigar with it that there is damage with the actual cut itself now a lot of times this diamond is minor that i got from it but it still is fairly inconsistent in terms of getting a clean cut but that wasn't the only issue the thousand dollar price tag when not getting clean cuts was also a fairly significant problem when it comes to that specific cutter now the company decided to redesign a little bit of the cutter itself to come up with this newer version the 1500 and what they decided to do was they decided to change up where the blade was inside of the actual cutter itself and it is difficult to see no doubt but you can actually see that the blade on the interior perhaps you can see it is closer to the edge of the handle on the newer version than it is on the older version uh there's quite a bit less space in between on the newer version and what that does is it gives the actual uh blade a little bit more stability when you're actually cutting it the cigar cap and it gives you a little bit cleaner cut on those more consistently for sure now there is some issues still with how clean the cuts are on this uh which we'll get to in a minute all right now that we have all that out of the way it's time to actually show how to use this cutter so as i mentioned before this 1500 is a single guillotine blade and it's opened by pulling back on this lever here which is embedded into both sides of the handle this opens the blade up as you can see it closes as well very very securely using that axis locking mechanism that honestly is one of the best parts of the cutter that benchmade decided to put into it it's very very secure there's no issues with that whatsoever every time you use it it's solid very solid and very very nice to actually be able to open up and close feels great in your hand when you're actually going to use the cutter you put the base of the cutter into the palm of your hand you can see there's a curve there and you put it into the palm of your hand with these four fingers here to support it you put your thumb uh onto the top of the blade you put the cap of the cigar into the opening and then you push through in a nice even motion and that cuts the cap off so in order to actually cut the cigar there is one thing you want to make sure about when you're actually using the blade and that is that the logo side that is the side here with the benchmade logo on it is always going to be on the same side as the larger part of the cigar that's left over that you're going to smoke while the smaller end of the cap that's being cut off is always going to be on the side with no logo and with the beveled edge as you can see here once you realize that you realize which way you need to have the cutter ever every time you cut it you'll know if it is not correct because it will destroy the cap even more than normal all right so as i mentioned before you want to make sure that the logo side the benchmade logo side is the same side that you have the large part of the cigar you're going to actually smoke is on and the non-logo side with the beveled edge is the same side that the cap the smaller piece of the cap is going to fall off of so you take the cap of the cigar you put it into the opening you want to make sure you can get as close as you can to knowing exactly how much you're taking off it's very difficult with this cutter and that's one of the things i really didn't like about it you can get close especially if you're looking at it from above but then you have to actually turn the cutter in order to make sure you're cutting correctly and putting the right amount of force onto it so you can only get just so close to knowing exactly how much you want to take off but once you have that approximate location you put it in and you basically just push down with your thumb and cut through so as you can see a pretty decent cut on that one it does have some minor pieces there that are coming off but no major damage at all and i'd say this is probably 40 of the time is it is a same cut you would get with this cutter um better than the uh than the first version as i mentioned um especially with the number of times that you don't have any major rapid rapper damage so i thought as part of the review we go over some comparisons really quickly of the benchmade 1500 181 and the 1500 which we're viewing today now when benchmade introduced the 1500 181 in late 2018 it had a the msrp of a thousand dollars and one of the reasons that that was the case is that the cutter was part of benchmade's gold class which is benchmade's top-of-the-line series and it's basically what the company considers to be just below a custom knife the items are limited they use more expensive materials for example in the 181 the handle of this is carbon fiber which is not cheap the blade is actually made of s90v steel it is a limited edition out of 250 and there are actually gemstones in the uh the trigger mechanism as you can see here so all of these things and a few others equals a very expensive cutter now since 2018 the company has introduced other variants at various price points in various materials all of them are very different in terms of how they're constructed for example there was a 450 model all the way up to a 1200 dollar model the 1200 model has damascus steel for the uh metal for the blade while the others you know had various options in terms of handles material there was one with burl wood for the handle um and and things like that they switched in and out in order to make different price points and so when they wanted to make a cheaper model and more budget-friendly model they decided that for the 1500 they would go with a dif a few different options that would bring that price point down one of those is the rich light handle which we've already talked about there's no gemstones on the trigger mechanism as you can see here and in addition the s 30v steel for the uh cutter mechanism the the blade as well as the fact that it is not a limited edition it is a regular production item and all of these things equal a more budget friendly the most budget-friendly uh version of this cutter all right so now that we've got that over with let's uh go through a list of uh advantages disadvantages good things and bad things that i found as i was using this for about a month on every cigar that i reviewed start with the bad things first of all most important thing it just does not cut cigars as cleanly as it should um the design that it has is better because of the fact that the blade has been moved a little bit closer to the edge as we mentioned before it's a better design and it cuts better than the 1500 181 for sure but it's still not as clean as it should be still cuts are still problematic they still have some major issues with cutting you know uh damaging wrappers and damaging the caps and you know sometimes it's minor sometimes it's not minor um but there's definitely some issues with the majority of the of the cuts that you get with this cutter another bad thing is the fact that you can't really see where you're cutting when you're actually cutting the cap off of the cigar so in any situation you want to be able to tell exactly how much you're cutting off of that cap and the problem is that when you're looking at this here through this thing is very very very non-specific now you can get close but in terms of knowing exactly how much you're cutting there's just really not that much of an easier way to do it and get this cutter inside the palm where it's nice and cradled like it should be supported you can do it from the top you can try from the top but again it's not very not the easiest thing in the world to see and once you turn it around like this to actually cut um to actually cut it with it supported the way it should be uh you lose that exact exactness of exactly what you're cutting another thing is the fact that you can't really cut anything above about a 60 ring gauge with this cutter it's it's very difficult to get anything through there that's more than about 60 ring gauge and if you have something even larger say a 70 or something of that nature you're just you're going to be sol in terms of getting anything more than just a little bit off the cap off of that and finally basically the the prices is a is a big issue 250 is better than the thousand dollars of the original model for sure but in terms of the return on investment of how much you you know get for the the cuts that you get for the money that you pay it's very very difficult to justify in that regard now there are some good things of course after using it i found quite a bit that i liked about it first of all is the the exterior is handle is made of rich light as we mentioned before and it is really really fantastic it's very durable i had no issues whatsoever with it um having marks damage anything of that nature it is it is solid as a rock um and um i don't think there will be any issues in terms of carrying around more and more uh with me and what i had the how i usually carry it which is typically in a pocket with keys and things of that nature it looks great when you're actually using it it's very solid when you're when you're cutting the cigars the axis locking mechanism works perfectly every single time there's no issue with that at all it's not loose or anything after that much time it doesn't feel like it's going to get loose and i don't it just it's very very solid when you're actually using it the balance is excellent as well there's no problems with the balance and how it actually comes when you're actually using it the the cutter itself um it's a very very well made and very well designed cutter in terms of actually balance and and getting that uh getting that cap off of there other than the actual cuts themselves obviously now uh it also is made in america and comes with a lifetime warranty which is uh which is very very nice and and not the norm these days so in the end after all of that can i recommend the benchmade 1500 as a cigar cutter the answer is no unfortunately look 250 is a lot of money for a cigar cutter and i've i've mentioned this multiple reviews before over the years but the idea that you can have a 250 cutter that cost that much that is built this well um but just can't give you a clean cut consistently um is is really just it's really really the point of a cutter is to give you a clean cut and i can get a better cut more consistently with a two dollar cutter that i can buy in any shop in america now it is extremely well constructed i love the access locking mechanism on it i love how it feels when you're actually holding it i love how you how it feels when you're pushing through on the cap it is commendable that benchmade decided to try and fix the problems that they had with it and it did actually help noticeably the cuts were more cleaner more consistently cleaner but they just were not still good enough to actually be able to say yes i can you know pretty much promise that on 90 of the cuts these are this is going to cut through it just doesn't it just did not work that way unfortunately um i can't recommend it as a daily cup daily cutter and i i just i can't recommend it just based on those issues and the price alone so for halfwheel.com this is brooks whittington for any other news reviews or

unique item out on the market in fact they've been coming out with this product for a while but it's a new launch of a smaller size hey guys obviously this is an older video but I still want to get it out because the holiday season is really busy for us and if you can pronounce laughs and Lomb correctly congratulations try out their color it is French made and it is Lafe and Lomb which means the thin blade now we recently helped them back some stretch goals that they had on IndieGoGo where they went ahead and launched the lay petite which is the smaller size - the bigger one and just for reference I have the bigger one here again cigar cutter and knife easy simple to use cuts it very nice but we'll just show you this this is the original one we'll compare to this the petite and get into it because I have the petite right here like I said this was launched on IndieGoGo this is the first batch I don't know if you can see that it says first batch the petite got a nice the French flag kind of adorns the front here and getting into it nice box presentation you have the cutter itself little guy and the big brother so you can see the size difference it's pretty big this is a lot easier carry on your pocket than this which is why they probably had for this original one they had this nice leather case and then this one around your belt so slide through your belt loop carries on the outside I don't prefer that style carrying but teach their own I prefer something simple that goes right in my pocket very small very easy to use love it the one nice thing about this too is well inside this packaging is it comes with this nice leather sheath so you can and it's really well constructed very high high-end good leather grain drop it in now it goes in your pocket you'll protect your I believe this is I believe it called pronounced paddock wood but they also have olive wood they have some evany would they have man-made materials and different colors and I'm sure he's gonna come out with a ton of more so this was actually quite quite a fun tool to kind of learn it does take a couple of seconds to be like okay how am I gonna you know which hand am I gonna hold it in the key is to always put it on the side where the leaf and Lomb logo is because if you look that is where the blade is straight and then it kind of on the other side it curves out so I know that some people have tried to cut it on the non logoed side and I've kind of ruin their caps but for sure go on the logo side snip you're good to go I like it a lot it's kind of cool this one's marked as the first batch so anyone that did the campaign starter got some uniqueness to it they got a leather sheath they got some unique writing on here as well as they all got up over to one your humidor bag so kudos to them anyways I just thought you guys would like to take a look it's been showing up on social media quite a bit by a lot of different influencers and I thought the packaging and the product was very well I'm a knife carrier by just by day I always like to have a knife on me so this kind of kills two birds with one stone I can carry my knife and I can also cut my cigars so I like you guys I hope you enjoy and if you want to check out more you can go to Lafe and laabh calm they are going to be releasing this to the market I believe that retailers there's some across the United States

we're going to be reviewing the colibri quasar desktop cutter hello my name is paul anthony and i'm CP and today we're going to be looking at the colibri quasar cutter this is a nice desktop cutter here it's got some good weight to it I said probably about weighs all feels like almost weighs pretty about a pound it seems like a nice construction there this is actually he's done Okita kind of spoiler like this is actually my favorite cutter right now I truly believe that this is giving me the best strat of a straight cut guys I suppose with that being said we should actually cut a cigar so the nice thing about this I suppose the pro of it is that it has guards here I know you just got the SV cutter the handheld version which is a straight n Abeka then they both have guards as well which is nice you can kind of get that perfect cut all the time so simply put a cigar in and chop I mean this thing is just like wow every single time I mean I've never had an issue there is just awesome yeah go for I know you're a VIP guy I used to be straight cut like Paul but since I discovered a proper Vica and they're really hard to find that do it well I'm a complete convert but I'll only do it with a decent cutter because it's so easy to just mash the cap and there we go that's a reasonable yeah it was reasonable yeah I mean yeah so then let me uh let me try because here is just you or me I'm terrible at v8s by the way there you go fine that's perfect so I mean to be honest for $125 I mean is this great value car just because I always get just an absolutely perfect cup on the cigar I mean you can stand help and that's a little bit wonky / it's great the only one downside to it I think is the fact that it does fill up very very quickly so this isn't a commercial solution I think this is a nice desktop solution for home use you know I think there's probably only holds about 10-15 caps or not and it although it has a nice kind of place here to remove the cigar debris is a bit finicky you kinda have to be spinning it around so you wouldn't I don't think you'd want this in a shop because you'd be unloading it every like 10 15 minutes yeah but for a home use like 15 cigars I mean that could be anywhere from a week to a month's worth plus of cigar usage so you're probably fine it's got a nice rubber foot on it as well which stops it from moving around which is nice so that's kind of the pros of it the pros are fantastic solid construction and also has a nice kind of rubber foot to it it doesn't slide around kind of Kansai doesn't hold that many cigar ends it's a little bit difficult to remove them once you do the v-cut wasn't straight perfect but the straight cut is perfect and here's 125 dollars which is probably double what you may have seen for that the Scorpion tabletop cigar car which we haven't reviewed in another video below so it's a little pricey it does come in a bunch of colors so they have this silver version of black version or red version and the nice thing is if you like this particular style then they've carried that theme through into humidors yeah human ash trays even on the SB color and the rally lighter I have they've got this kind of domed diameter yeah a diamond shape as well so which is really nice you can start to create a collection and even have the the quasar cutting out as well so this cutter as well which has been introduced in a quasar modern our hands like the diamond Peaks as well so actually kind of one of those guys that once they get something they like they like to get you know all of them in the series so if you're a big Calibri going you have some of the quasar line already then this will definitely be a great introduction it's super easy to use has nice perfect cut guard or therefore the straight car so I don't you can go really wrong on this one so we'll provide some links below and where to buy this on Amazon and some other places that may have better prices but yeah check out those things below also please feel free to go to bespoke Unicom forward slash cigars where we cover a plethora of topics around cigars not only how to cut them how to like them how to smoke them as well as actual

today I'm going to show you how to use a variety of cigar cutters we have a bullet cutter cigar scissors a regular guillotine cutter a perfect cut guillotine cutter and AV cut standard guillotine cutters are perfect all-around cigar cutters they pretty much come in two variety you have your dual or double blade cutter as you can see when you open it up here you literally have two blades one on the right and one on the left and then there's also a single blade cutter which is less expensive that's more of a usually it has kind of a slanted blade in there too to cut through the the cap of the cigar I would prefer to use a double blade cutter it's going to give you a better cut it's going to cut from both sides of the cigar these will fit a variety of ring gauges they do max out usually at around fifty four fifty eight ring gauge depending on the the cutter you're buying so if you do like to smoke larger ring gauge cigar make sure you find a cutter that will accommodate or you might want to go to a cigar scissor or a punch now to use a guilting cutters is very simple what you're going to do is on your cigar you'll notice that there is a kind of like a line around the cap of the cigar and this this is what differentiates the cap from the main part of your cigar you never want to cut more than that cap off otherwise your cigar can unravel so you're going to take you're going to take your cutter basically open it up place it as far into the cigar as you want and snip there's there's two ways you can do this some people prefer to take their cutter and put it on the table and open it up and stick the cigar in like this and cut it so you get the same amount every single time but traditionally what you would do is you would open it up put it in make sure you have as much of the cap in as you want and give nice firm even pressure to cut the cigar the more firm or even the pressure the better your cuts going to be this is a standard guillotine cutter the punch cutter comes in a variety of styles this specific one is what's known as a bullet cutter because it looks like a bullet but they're all going to primarily work the same way what you want to do is expose the blade at on top you can see it's a round blade and this is one of the easier cutters to use you'll take your cigar and you're just going to line the blade up with the back of the cigar make sure it's exactly where you want it and then using firm pressure you're just going to slowly rotate and twist that cigar as you can see the cutter is cutting in nicely now you can go as deep as you want some people like to go all the way and some people just a little bit it doesn't really matter but all you're trying to do is make a nice hole in there if you want it a little bit bigger you can twist this the cutter like this to enlarge the hole but the the standard size hole will be great for most people you're just going to simply pull it out you can see we have our nice cut and most of the punch cutters will retain the tobacco in the end I'm sure if you could see that there and you simply push the little lever and all your tobacco comes out it's nice and clean you can see that's a punch cutter nice clean circular cut cigar scissors are perfect if you smoke of cigars that have large ring gauges those are the thicker cigars because it allows you to open up the scissor pretty much as wide as you as you need to to get around even the largest cigar cigar scissors do need to be cleaned regularly and it helps if you if you do sharpen them so you get nice a nice clean cut what you're going to want to do is on your cigar if you can see the wrapper kind of has a line here that goes all the way around it that's the cap so you never want to cut more than the cap of your cigar you never want to go down this far of your cigar and most people prefer just just to take a little bit off the top it's really personal preference and over time you'll kind of find what you like best so you're just going to take your cigar scissor open it up as wide as you need to and you're going to put it just on that cap portion and you want to try to give it a nice firm even pressure like that so you're going to just give nice firm even pressure sometimes you might have a little little straggling pieces again you need to cut off obviously that has to do with the sharpness of your blade but pretty much it gives you a real nice smooth cut takes a nice bit of the cap off and it's a perfect cutter if you are someone that smokes larger ring gauge cigar this is a v-cut cigar cutter it's probably the least popular of all the cuts but it is people that liked it liked it a lot and what it does is it's literally going to take a a small little notch out of your cigar and if you look at this you can see the blade in here will show up on counter really well but it's the blade is kind of like you know almost like a half a triangle so it's going to make a nice notch in there this is you know there's always just going to be one blade in here and it's you know it's very easy to use what what you're going to do is take your cigar you don't have to worry about really taking off more of the cap than is necessary because this is going to give a pretty consistent cut and it's not going to really go down this bar it's just going to take a little notch off the top so you're going to open up your cutter place your cigar inside you want sure you you have some nice even pressure on there so you have a consistent cut you don't wanna hold this too loosely or you're going to you know your V cuts going to be all all messed up so give a nice nice firm pressure and push the blade just until it touches the cigar and then what you're going to do is just again make sure everything is lined up how you like and nice firm even pressure you're going to cut the cigar and as you can see it made a nice little notch in there some people prefer to make a double notch which would be a notch going the other direction again that's personal preference if that's something you want to do as I said it's not the most popular type of cut but it's certainly one that you should try because it might be one that you do enjoy more than a traditional guillotine cut or a or punch cut this is a V cutter this is a dual blade perfect cut cutter they come in a variety of names basically some people call perfect those some people call perfect cuts and basically what this is is a standard guillotine cutter that that you would normally see such as as this but it doesn't have the thrown through it has a back plate on it and the reason for that back plate is you can see here you literally are going to get the exact same cut every single time you're going to take the exact same amount off of your cigar every single time so it's therefore called the perfect cut this is a double blade cutter so it's going to apply pressure from from both sides and to use this what you're going to do is take your cigar and you'll notice on your cigar there's going to be kind of this line of tobacco kind of near the end of the cigar what that is is that's your cap you never want to cut more than your capital if you never want to go down to the body of your cigar or you'll have some unraveling so you just want to take a little bit off the top out however much is your personal preference if you're using a perfect cutter it's going to take the same amount off each time and you really can't control it you can use this one of two ways you can put it on the countertop and open it up and use it or most people would take the cigar open this up you're going to push it all the way up into that plate so you want to make sure you have nice even pressure on the plate you're going to close the blades just a little bit just so you catch your cigar in there and you are just going to give it a nice firm pressure and cut your cigar and this is the cap I was talking about you can see it took the just just a slice of it off and it has a nice cut so that's going to give you the exact same cut every single time something to keep in mind you can only really use this type of cutter with with most cigars if you're going to use a cigar that has you know like a pointy tip at the end it's it's really not going to work so you're going to have to use this for if those are types of cigars you smoke you're not going to want to use this type of cutter but besides that it really does make a perfect cut and it's really easy to use this is the perfect cut guillotine cutter", "st3fHJeeacs": "[Music] hello everyone Charles welcome back again with another product review and today I have the cigar Rio polished stainless steel cigar cutter [Music] this cutter feels nice and sturdy and well-constructed I like the weight in the design these cutters have a smooth sleek look like an airplanes wing the cutters have a double guillotine blade made from zinc alloy nice and sharp [Music] these cutters come in a silvertone gold-tone and a black gunmetal here let's take a look at the gold-tone cutter I think I may be partial to the silvertone but both a pretty damn attractive [Music] with your purchase you will receive this leatherette case and in velvet bag for storage [Music] this cigarillo cutter looks great but how well does it do its job let's test out this cutter now it is advertised to cut larger cigars up to 58 reengage let's try a 60 to have a better perspective here's a 48 gauge this was the more common size of years past but larger sizes are more common these days [Music] that took a bit of finger strength but the cut was pretty clean so why purchase this cutter over others like it well the price for under 16 dollars isn't easy buy you can find this cutter on Amazon for 1595 I'll have a link below in the description to sing you straight to this product ok ladies and gentlemen that is my review I hope this helped you with your future cigar cutter purchases I'm Charles Longford and this is how I would spend my money", "McTgzMgA27Y": "the colibri s cut cigar cutter in black and gold hi I'm Brian claw no cigar obsession calm today we're taking a look at this pretty beefy unique cutter comes in a pretty typical case hardshell anything underneath yep a little warranty book it says a ah as everything falls out a 2-year limited warranty on it and we've got a little cleaver catalog and a little catalog on there lighters that's it for the box the unit itself very thick this is a hefty metal base design it looks like it has four hex screws kind of bolting everything down at the corners here the center section has a rubberized coating on it the ends look like a brass or like gold type coating it's not actually brass it's not actually gold but it's got that tone to it no flex solid as a rock but this center section is a lot easier to grip than the ends no rough edges very smooth you can see the thicknesses about half my pinky finger so it definitely has some size to it now it's actuated by a single lever button and it pops straight up the blade itself just as thick it has kind of rails on the sides and it does have two internal Springs I can sort of see them in there but you can hear them so it's got that spring sound when you activate it it's not like a lever spring so it doesn't it doesn't have a silent use but it's there I would imagine maybe a little squirt of silicon spray in there might make it a little bit easier and quieter just a suggestion the blade itself is a dual blade but single action guillotines to the bottom section here razor sharp it doesn't move and then the top slides down and actually cuts your cigar whether or not a guillotine cutter is single or dual side doesn't really matter some people think well if it's single side it's gonna somehow squish your cigar or not cut one side better than the other that's only a function of the blades themselves yes on those super cheap plastic jobs that you find usually for free at a cigar shop man those blades can sometimes be so dull that they will just deform the crap out of the cap and maybe you know start to pop it off or unravel the wrapper because the blades are really cheap but if you get good blades these are exceptionally sharp you have no problem doesn't matter if one blade is moving or both alright it just doesn't make a difference your scars in the middle and oh there goes my finger believe me it's gonna work so using the guy this is your typical sized hole alright so this is what we're all used to from Zhai cars and Palio's and cali breeze and anything else this is your normal sized cigar hole so we can size pretty much up to a sixty without any problem it won't go around a sixty this is probably about a 56 or 58 to where you can get the whole cigar through and again I've mentioned it before these can be useful even though I don't particularly use them that often if you have a case where cigar has some damage or it's tunneling anything like that you need to be able to put the cigar completely through it and that's where these types really shine other than that it's pretty standard you have to visually line it up line it up with a cap figure out exactly where you want to cut it make sure you're straight an alternative method is to lie this flat on a table it depends on the exact lighter how beneficial this technique is because it's the thickness of the cutter where the blades are that determine will kind of cut your get but you can put it flat on a surface and then just put the cigar in like that usually that's pretty good alright so it's mimicking the perfect cutter that I prefer except you don't need to put the perfect cutter on anything cuz it has the back but that's what it's mimicking but most people will use a double guillotine or single or dual guillotine like this they'll visually look it up and snap it shut nice clean cut like I said very sharp nothing else to say it works as advertised the button works very nicely it falls right where I expect it in my hands I've got big sausage fingers so it's very easy for me to grip I like the extra size in the heft that just again goes with the size of my hands it's easy to actuate down it's really a one-hand device I'll have any problem using it it's got these nice curved edges here everything is chamfered no problems whatsoever not terribly expensive about 40 bucks I would have liked to seen a lifetime warranty but two years is certainly gonna bring out any flaw in it with any kind of regular use thank you very much - liger usa.com for sending this in for review

is this one of the best cutters I've ever had honestly I have the gargoyle version of this but I love how fast it cuts in our clean it cuts temperature finger in here real quick I will not do that but we are gonna do something like that from tests okay then I'm gonna show you sigh cars EXO cutter I'm showing this to you because I know that it'll drive Bradley crazy that he can't show it to you this is a newer cutter to the market so you guys have commented on our previous videos it's not brand new we know that it's not brand new on the market but it's new to us we just got these in we like them but we're gonna see how it stands up in the tests so we got three tests for you today and we're gonna take all five of these cutters through each one the first one involves this a bag of carrots which I eat a smaller bag of carrots almost every day cuz I love carrots that's all folks what was that that was [ __ ] Bunny meets carro have another that's all folks Bugs Bunny says what's up doc the bunny says happen Abba Dabba Dabba what's up that's all fur all right you know what dude I'm not doing this show I apologize I've offended everybody out there and Wonderland and what's up doc what's up that what's up doc and so I apologize for that by the way Abin out of that that's when you cut your pork rinds with these I apologize cuz Porky Pig right you're gonna cut your pork rinds cut your pork rinds I feel like chips there are pork rinds pork skin sounds terrible to me so we're gonna take you with these five cutters through three tests that are designed to test the durability the quality and the terrifying 'no sub each of these cutters because if if a country is not at least a little bit terrifying it's probably not worth your time so here the three tests we're gonna run the first one is the extreme durability test we're not gonna sit here and cut cigars all day long because that would be a waste of cigars and at the end of the day I have to account to him for all the cigars that you use on the show so we're going to be cutting carrots today we're gonna take each one of these cutters and go through a few carrots just to wear them down get them dull and get them ready for the other tests then we're gonna do the ultimate mob test that's the test where you take a cigar cutter and you cut off someone's finger mmm the terrifying test so you'll know if your cutter can cut off someone's finger just in case you ever need to do that and so we made this ballistic gel hand just for that so that'll come up in just a few minutes after that we're gonna take them and we're gonna get a nice clean cut off of some cigars and light them up and see how well they like are you ready to go do it I'm ready let's cut all right ready to go ready so go oh it's easy here's carrot number two at the same cutters I'm still using the jetliner Bradley still using the vertigo where to go here we go got look at this that is all look at that that's like a julienne slice right there you ever done that I'm so sorry for you guys I've been cleaning this up this is grandpa John's in advance all right the next two cutters that we're gonna use all right the jet line so ho yeah it's good you Calibri double blade bring it go that's a good cut so you're saying is that Calibri one over the course of time is significantly more work to use that's for sure the thing I'm surprised by is that this thing is cutting so well after cutting through the carrot itself I can't fit I can't fit in there anymore oh my god that one actually stuck on my knuckle for a second yeah a little triangle here it is a little small I get stuck on my knuckle but so I would say it's still sharp though the collector still sharp too yeah now last one is the XO the XO is the one that Bradley's gonna test out right now I'm gonna get the two half these currents I can find the two that really look like they're ready for a battle oh wow that was quick was that quick yeah yeah yeah it was really smooth there's no effort whatsoever in this cutter I mean it's just it's just super smooth of all the cutters I'm telling you right now this cutter is the smooth as I've ever had now one the number one complaint that we've heard about that cutter is that uh it gets a candied gum that's got open little windows where you can sort of see the gears in the circle we've heard people say that that those gears get gummed up by Lent in your pocket that gets in there and all that sort of stuff honestly look at this I mean super easy to use and it's just sharp as a tack give me another carrot so after the carrot cutting test our first ones I cart comes out on top that EXO cutter does give you the best nicest cleanest cut after you're cutting through you know two carrots you got you know 25 30 40 on there the second test we're gonna do is a terrifying mobster test have you ever worried about getting your finger cut off with a cigar cutter I think if you're a normal person you have and so we're going to literally cut one finger off with each of these cutters but I'm not going to use my actual hand what we're gonna do is we're gonna use a replica of my hand I made out of ballistic gel and a fake skeleton so let's take these we're gonna start with a jet line cutter and now which for you I'll start on you must run on the thumb or the thumb thumb the thumb okay all right so these this is me some money some use money as a result that you can't pay your money I gotta take your thumb okay let's go ahead and move this out of the way that's pretty good now that Bradley's fully in character don't like that Italian Italian but mostly Native American [ __ ] gosh it's good and cut like right there hold on oh god okay so on to 300 Wow you didn't get through the bone did that hurt that hurt me so pull all the skin off the bone if you can see that right there enjoy saying if that you didn't get through the tendons and the ligaments there yeah ligaments and tendons all right go ahead cut right through it right there can you do it here no no that's a fishing liner here ya go right there cut okay just couple two knuckles there okay there it is there okay so the gentleman cutter had to cut a few times through that little joint between bones there but it eventually did get through the thumb so conceivably you could cut through a man's thumb with the jaw line but that would be quite a bit of work let's go ahead and go through the pinky now with the Vertigo cutter there you go go to slant on this one okay you ready okay guys ready set one two oh wow oh my got it it got it look at that yeah right through right through the bone and through the skin and and everything like that that's not bad that is really good all right so it looks like it's about to step up that's pretty great up next we got the Soho by jet line right there you're gonna cut off the ring finger with that one up let's go on the ring finger right here wait that's not the ring finger that's a middle finger do you know what we figure your ring goes on also look at your own hand goodness alright how far you gonna go right there she can't get two knuckles one to get you gotta use two hands here I'm in pain right now oh my god go through the bone zone be a man about it you got to be a mob boss about this mm I can't do it dude get it I got don't go dudes Ryan I could do this I'm doing everything I can Isaac remar because I do it all right I got all the skin off I'm sorry I got it all right there it is so uh there you go sufficiently dismembered but uh not deboned so here's the problem this guy could go to the hospital and he could get that put right back on there I mean not this guy but in in our scenario all right dude are you that was hard that was hard I got a cramp in my arm just trying to do that oh it hurts the first one is the colibri double bladed cutter I have a feeling I'm gonna cut this thing right off because I can squeeze it really hard we're gonna do believe we're middle w ready cutter let's go ahead and do the index fingers okay here we go ready it's putting in there okay you ready for one two oh man you got one yeah the other one oh good geez you're not cutting through the ball I kind of did look I got it oh wow you're pretty close get it Ryan just gonna get there dude we're good all right so uh surprisingly the only one that's actually cut through the bone so far is the jet line cutter but the last one is the middle finger right here okay let's go into shape this guy right here all right what are you gonna use for this one I'm gonna use my favorite new cutter the X oh by xikar I'm pretty I'm pretty confident this little thing right here could definitely go through that middle fingers all right okay nobody flicks me off it gets away with it all right here we go here we go i I think I gave this one pretty good smoothness through this guy's going to the hospital I feel in hospitals so we're at a five finger right here one two two three get it get it get it Wow look at ya that is a nightmare you go directly wow dude yeah that's impressive that morale mekka okay so what we learned about this is that when it comes to cutters using them for I mean really sick and twisted violence there's really only two you can use if you want to you can get a vertigo a nice affordable vertigo stainless steel double blade cutter I got an opening in this you're gonna get a vertical stainless steel dull blade cutter or you can see you can go and splurge and get yourself the xikar X oh if you've got somebody that you need to repay or who owes you money XO or vertigo are definitely the way to go so so we got our first two tests done the first one was the durability test now we know that the exo is really the best cutter suited for cutting the fingers off of a hand now we got to see how well we're gonna get a nice clean cut on a cigar you've had the cutter for a while you've cut 30 or 40 cigars with it you had to cut some guy's hand off because he owed you money and he wasn't paying now we're gonna see how nice and clean you can get a cut off a cigar with your cutter let's go and start with the vertigo vertigo here we go over here that's clean that is very very clean I'll tell you the vertigo cutter we actually keep one of these in our office and use it regularly both of vertigo and the jet line one we use them in our office regularly and you can't get a nice clean cut off it the next winter view is the jet line that will blade see how it does okay yeah so the jet line cracked the cap turned that around to show jet line crack the cap it really ripped oh I saw a lot sort of fall off the cigar little pieces of debris and whatnot gentle I didn't get a really nice clean cut it does seem like there's a shelf life to that cutter and the blades do eventually go after Lobo but I sort of expected to happen with that this stainless steel double blade yeah next we're gonna do is a Calibri double cut let's see how it does I like the design of the colibri double cut fits in your hand Wow oh wow that destroyed the end of that cigar big thick the cap is distrubing the cap and the wrapper are destroyed you can't there's not even a clean cut at the top there's literally a ridge of tobacco in the middle try another one you mean oh yeah let's see if we can do another one here will they be a second chance here I made it my fault there's your fault let's even get a nice clean cut still it's still crack is still crack the cap and this is something you've seen happen on cigars before the cut kind of goes level and then there's a bit of the tobacco that's sort of sticking up and it's jagged and it's like a little Ridge right through the center of your cigar because you just didn't get a good clean cut the Glee brie actually didn't stand the test of all of all of our love our tests okay unfortunately the last one we're doing is I cars XO cutter totally redesigned on a cutter this cutter just cut through however many cigars with the carrot test and it was the only cigar cutter successful in cutting through a finger in the mobster test now we're gonna see how nice and clean of a cut we can get on this lhasa knees in a minute Kanna perfect look at that no hair sticking up perfect yowzer cut all the razor-sharp cut all the way through and I bet this thing just stays true to it by lighting perfect I got notes back over my mouth everything is perfect just ah so of all the colors we test today there are some that seem to do alright there's some that seem to do better than others but there's one that stood above the rest and was clearly the winner and that's sigh cars X oh this is a great cutter it cut through cigars and cigars again in the carrot test it was the only cover we had that could cut through a man's finger and then still give you a perfectly clean razor-sharp cut on a cigar afterwards now you're gonna pay for this these are these costs between 100 and 120 dollars so the price tag is there but it's worth it so here's what we want to know from you in the comments below what do you use to cut your cigar what brand do you trust what color have you had you have a cutter that's been like your favorite cutter forever or do you feel like you keep going through them drop something in the comments below and we want to catch up with you down there all these cutters will be

three-blade cigar scissors hi I'm Brian Flynn with cigar obsession calm today we're taking a look at this truly remarkable way of cutting your cigars there are a number of different types of cutters out on the market the simplest being a single blade guillotine I don't particularly care for those you'll find them given away or very inexpensive that typically local shops are usually plastic with a pretty dull blade and they just have one blade that will snip off the cap of the scar but what they tend to do is pinch and squish it more than anything then you have double bladed guillotines which have blades that come from both sides making two cuts simultaneously then you have scissors typically you have two bladed scissors much like a normal pair but the blades are curved to better fit and get more surface area to cutting the cap and a popular sets are from companies like sidecar and they're about 50 60 bucks these are from Cuban crafters and what they offer is three blades curved to better fit the capitalists cigar like regular cigar scissors however they close like the aperture of a camera there each hinged and the scissor action closes them all simultaneously to close the gap from three sides rather than two like traditional scissors this gives you the ability to cut the entire cap in one cut typically with scissors you kind of trim it around the edges now the only drawback to this is it's a little tough in my finding to be really consistent you do have to obviously position it manually and very carefully on the cigar and you do have quite a wide action of moving them open and closed so you have to steady them with your hand you have to keep them steady in the same spot on the cap and then make your cut very steadily all the way through the action maybe it's just me with fairly large hands but I found that sometimes it was a little difficult sometimes I would have cuts that weren't perfectly even they would kind of waver a little bit I couldn't really find the sweet spot between going slowly going fast and one cut do multiple cuts and that's just my personal preference I never cared for normal scissors as opposed to guillotine either for those of you that have watched a lot of my videos you know my personal preference is another Cuban crafters cutter the perfect cutter which happens to be a double sided guillotine with a backing plate a lot of people make fun of them call them the noob cutters or whatnot but I'm sorry it works really well every single freaking time the scissors they're really cool I mean I love all mechanical things metal things I think these are really really freaking cool and everybody I've shown these to what no matter what their preference and cutters has to pick these up wants to try them is always going to look at them I mean there is no denying this is a seriously cool piece of hardware now it does a decent job cutting cigar like I said you got to be careful it's not foolproof you know it's it's built very very well these are not expensive you know they start around 15 bucks on the internet you can catch them on sale they're just they're neat to look at there need to hold the blades are very sharp like all of Cuban crafters the fit and finish is impeccable the tolerance is exact they have just an absolutely perfect instruction I'm sure they're machine made but they look and feel handmade that's how well they're made it's really unbelievable for as cheap as they sell them for that being said if you like scissors give these a shot because the problems I had worked with the design and weren't with this actual unit or anything it's just my personal preference is for guillotines as opposed to scissors some people love scissors and if you do these might be right up your alley because they give you that scissor action the feel but you get one nice cut and you're done and you don't have to go back and trim now the only drawback I see using three blades is that it does make the cut a little lopsided because what you're doing when you when you have a single blade cut you're guaranteed a nice flush even flat cut as for the cigar when you have to you can have a little bit of a gap difference between the left on the right because the blades are overlapping one another now with three that's really even more pronounced because now you not only have the gap between two ladies you have three so you actually have a full gap between the bottom side of the bottom blade and the top side of the top blade plus the entire thickness of that Center blade and there is a tolerance in between the blades so the cuts on the cigars can have kind of a step if you will I'm going to go ahead and cut this one I have no idea how it's going to go I don't think I've tried this particular cigar I won't say it in case I butcher and I don't want to embarrass anybody clean myself but we'll see how it does on here all you do is line it up kind of manually eyeball it where the cap is same as any other type of cutter what I do is I kind of snug it up and make sure that I'm you know at the right level and flush of the cap and then I make my cut I had better luck going a little bit faster than slower like I said I've ruined cigars going both ways with these so you know I'm not sure which is the best way for this one but here we go okay so that was a fairly quick cut it did cut nicely I mean it didn't cut rough or anything but you can see that it's not where as lens other it is you can see it's not a crisp cut using three blades definitely has that drawback now that's supposed to as opposed to using a guillotine cutter where this would be pretty much just straight across so you can see this one here this is more of a guillotine cut straighter not ragged so that's the drawback some people it's not going to be an issue for me I personally prefer it to be the perfect cut the first time scissors just aren't for me but a lot of people love the routine and the tradition and whatnot of trimming their cigar and going through the motions and that's fine to each their own by the way the these do come with a nice little cleaning brush it also came with a foam molded box and for the life of me I can't find it I haven't seen it since Christmas and I'm afraid I might have accidentally thrown it out with stuff but it does come with a neat little brush kind of like cleaning out electric razors to get out all the bits and stuff from the blades because it's not real easy to by hand you don't want to be swiping these blades too much with your fingers anyway to clean all the bits out and it does get pretty messy I'm just cutting the cigar once gets lots of bits of tobacco everywhere that's a better example of a step that you can see you can really see the difference here between where the blades end up you can see that line and that's the thickness of that middle blade there's just no getting around that then you use three blades when they come together like that that's as close as it could possibly cut the cigar so like I said that's a minor drawback in my eyes it smokes fine you know if you're used to using scissors this isn't a big deal at all if you're coming from guillotines and you go into scissors you you have to expect stuff like this thank you very much to dose Kabbalah cigars for sending this for review I greatly appreciate it check out their site they have a great line of products excellent prices do some shopping this has been the Cuban crafters revolution scissors cigar cutter I'm Brian Glen of cigar obsession calm we'll see you next time", "arOZcos8c7c": "hey guys I had a request to do this video and if you saw my most recent review you saw that my perfect cutter well getting a little gummed up totally normal this just comes from use you know after you cut so many cigars especially if they're on the moist side they leave some tobacco residue in there and it just gets a little sticky you know it's not as gliding and smooth as it can be so how do you clean it well I'll show you how I clean mine and a couple little suggestions first of all what don't you want to use there's a lot of things you don't want to use don't use this guy right here even though it may lubricate it just fun probably would clean it don't use anything like this guy right here again probably do a great job of cleaning I definitely don't use this guy right here or anything like it because all of those are gonna leave residue and residue is not what you want on your cigars so here's what I do and here's a big caveat this only applies to the original perfect cutter or any other cutters that is that are just all metal all right this is all metal is no paint there's no enamel there's no wood there's no plastic BAM works great hose the hell out of it you'll have to worry about your hand get it all in there in a little slider parts boom now a couple tips about doing this just like you don't want anything other than metal on your cutter don't do it over any painted surfaces like top of your driveway or your patio or anything like that because that will bubble right through it and boom there we go baby smooth totally clean after this dries off in a couple minutes zero residue perfectly good to use and that's all you need to do now if you have a cutter that has plastic wood enamel paint anything like that what you want to use is some rubbing alcohol and some q-tips and saturate it get it in the blades as best you can work the q-tip in there you know get everything out as best you can if it disassembles go ahead and disassemble it and clean off all the middle that way and just keep it off the other materials and you'll be good to go but if you're lucky enough to have the original perfect cutter model that's all you need to do 10 seconds of blasting good as new see", "i5DCehLkPBs": "[Music] hey everybody i'm delicia and thanks for stopping by the cigar vixen channel with another cool check-in this is a new accessory that i'm adding to my collection coming straight from the colibri quesar lineup and it matches that gorgeous humidor if you could see it behind me this one is in the metallic silver it's one of four colors that it does come in so the beautiful red color is one of the colors that comes in as well as a black and a metallic gunmetal and this metallic silver so a lot of fun i'm not somebody that uses a punch cutter very often normally because well when i do use a punch it's usually because i've forgotten one of my other cutters and so it's attached to a lighter this one caught my attention because of the versatility so it has three different sizes which i love so it's actually hitting pretty much everybody out there if you're somebody that likes the smaller vitolas you have the smaller seven millimeter punch then you have the more traditional you know robusto kind of sort of middle the road sizes for the nine millimeter and you can also do those larger ring gauges so if you're a 60 ring gauge or pl or larger you can do the 12 millimeter offering on the punch blades here so these are great it's lightweight it's very compact i mean it just pops into this cute little you know spiky design here which again is a nice attention grabber i like it because i can put it in a travel humidor easily i can throw it in a bag it's just really easy to to travel with and it's also just a cool piece to even if you just leave it you know leave it out it's fun stainless steel on the blades i think i mentioned three different sizes so again very versatile and just love love love the design this whole quasar line is just an attention grabber it's a conversation piece it's super sexy on the design i absolutely love it and so i'm going to demonstrate real quick cutting i brought just a couple cigars just to show one of my favorite features that i liked um just it really just caught my attention because i have noticed that when i do use a punch on other punch cutters this is one of the pet peeves that i have which is why i don't like to use the punch and this one actually alleviates that so i'm actually just getting a robusto here and i'm going to take this real easy and just have it right there and pop that out and you can see it's just a gorgeous straight easy clean cut on that no problem and so again best feature i think is right here check this out boom pops out and it's clean it just as soon as you close it pushes that little piece in there which again a lot of the other punch cutters that i have um they don't do that and so you have that little piece of cigar cap stuck in there and you have to like pop it out like with your hand or i don't know i just i never liked that and so this i absolutely love that it does that just very convenient and easy to to keep clean and free of you know excess tobacco debris and all that so i actually grabbed one of the larger cigars that i have on my humidor this is not a 60 it's just under this is about a 58 ring gauge but i couldn't find a 60 in there so i'm going to go ahead and use the larger the larger punch here and again just easy on that it pulls right out and then you have just a clean a little cut there which is nice so you have that nice clean cut and then again it just pops right out and i like really easy use on that one oops easy to use super cute to look at very sexy design love it love it love it and i'm again i'm gonna use this going forward i'm gonna try and use this pretty straight through for about three months and do another check in with you guys to see how the blades are holding up if it gets dull you know what is it doing how is this working out with opening and closing it so often and just kind of check in so that you guys can see whether you have one whether you are buying one after you watch this video or you're thinking about it so you can kind of see how it holds up after a few months these do retail for just under 60 so on the calibre website you can find these for 59 and again available in four colors they do have free shipping which is cool really like that feature and yeah so i'm going to go ahead and use this so when you see me in my videos using this punch you'll be able to go back to this video to refer to all the details so thanks again for tuning in and love to hear your thoughts what do you think about it are you planning on getting one and adding it to your collection what's your favorite color that they offer and all your other thoughts and comments are always welcome thank you so much and i can't wait to see you guys soon cheers you", "G6sspQMy7NA": "The Tonino Lamborghini Les Mans Cigar Cutter.

you five ways to cut a cigar when you don't have a cutter we literally are in a 4,500 square foot cigar facility right now we got over 2,000 square feet of warehouse here about a thousand square feet of lounge and then about 12 1 square feet of retail shop does that equal 4,500 i said roughly RuPt it roughly I roughed it out in my mind before we started whatever you know what never going to keep going so we are always sitting in the office or sitting in the lounge and we're about to smoke a cigar and one of us surely looks at the other and says hey you gotta cutter you got a cadre decoder and we don't have a cutter so we have a number of inventive ways that you can cut a cigar when you just don't have a cutter because you're dumb and you feel dumb so I just want I did this all the time I went fishing edges fish smoked cigars everything when I was back in Ohio shop so now say hi anyways so what I did is I would just chew the cap I'll use chew wood mmm mmm you're eating it any lien would spit it not in your friends direction the opposite direction and then when you light it you should have a perfect roll you know like you know it's cowboy stuff you have my spell cutting a cigar we gobble it that's that's Midwest style barrel that's what we do in the Midwest med whatta so you know Midwest the Westerners know how to to cigars man let's just what we do so if you're a white collar schmuck and you end up sitting in an office all day especially you can smoke in your office which I know you can't but I can't mind you're here in your backyard anywhere near a house and we're near building work you can always cut a cigar with a ballpoint pen what I do is I take my ballpoint pen you stick a little singing out and call it and you just want to penetrate the cigar little holes right on the end I'll make usually three or four of them it's a little bit of Bend in it yep penetrate that thing I usually make four little holes in a square on the end and it gives you a perfect drop gives you a perfect drop what's wrong cousin okay how many it's greater dude job okay guys great Oh diction next one yeah so if you find yourself in need of a cutter maybe you don't have you know you don't want to choose a cigar you don't list it because you want to be dignified and your lounge but you're from the Midwest usually carry now not everybody's from the Midwest pretty much everybody who matters is so here's the reality here's the reality what you can do is two ways to cut with a knife the first way you can do it is just cut a circle around and you're basically cutting the cap off they're in a nice little circle and it's really easy especially the sharper your knife is and you're going to get a nice little circle cut like that that's one way you can do it the other way you can do it is you can cross cut a lot of guys do the star they'll cut one line like this they'll cut another line like this like a cross okay and then they'll do two more like this and it's not nearly as easy as I make it say I use that knife to cut pretty much everything in the warehouse oh man you get a really unique draw with that believe it or not you really do so I've never crosscut that's the first time I've ever crossed cut with a knife before by seen guys doing so I'm gonna tell you what the drawers like right now so we're going to experience it together 92 grams that's mine oh yeah okay here we go make me a house you draw get it lead there you go that's really good careful will be sticking out it's really good in which really cools you have these you can see you can start pattern right on the back a little start pattern it looks kind of cool and it doesn't have them I imagine each of these along a canal yeah over time I just smoke it so here's way number five especially if you're a blue-collar guy you like to smoke in your garage we know plenty of you do everybody has one of these in your garage it's just a Phillips head screwdriver and it basically functions the same way as a cigar finds only it's a little more rudimentary you just put it push it through the cap of the cigar right there without cracking the cigar which I did not do most definitely and then you just got a nice little hole in the back of the cigar that gives you plenty of drop this star thing is pretty cool like a lie it's a really unique draw because all of your mouth really get really crazy and there you go it's a perfect draw you have to be careful not you want to push your screwdriver too far and back in this car you crack this thing wide open but you just get a little puncture in there and then you're drawing now that's five different ways that you can cut a cigar and get smoking without a cutter we want to know if you have any inventive ways to do this post those in the comments below what's the weirdest thing you've ever used to cut open a cigar no matter how weird it is what's yours I don't mind you know you're weird of yelling yep I made a cigar punch out of a piece of paper wrote it really really tight to a point punch this boom smokes it yeah your story I'm not that inventive okay one of you son of a marine I don't improvise adapt overcome like you do lot I thought this was really I thought the ballpoint pen thing was really clever that was my thing that's cute oh that is a that's neat thank you guys for watching please hit subscribe comment below", "eOjp1EJZTKQ": "hello this is Brooks Whittington with half wheel comm today we're taking a look at a very unique product a cigar punch slash spike I guess you would call it it's called select draw now I have used this product for about two months on just about every cigar I smoked and I had some pretty significant problems with it with that I'll get it to in a minute but first a little bit about the actual product itself select draw as I said it comes in two different finishes the first one is called the original which is this one here a silver color both of them are made with aluminum and steel and the original comes at a retail price of $39.99 there's also one that's called the obsidian which is a black matte color and it comes in at 39 97 for some reason two cents cheaper both of them are the exact same design a kind of a chess piece or something else that I won't mention that looks like and both of them come with the velvet bag which I carried around forever and got something on apparently so it's about three ounces weighs it's pretty substantial in your hand very well balanced actually very well made obviously of metal and it's obvious that it's not it was you know some thought went into it now in order to get to the actual product itself you have to unscrew this piece here which is a tight it's not going to come undone by any means it's solid and then you are left with the actual spikes themselves which as you can see are substantial and they're very very sharp they're not they're not something you want to carry around without this base here at all your you're gonna want to you're going to want to carry them around with those so they're on there they're they're on there really well they're not going anywhere it's well made for sure so it's a it's a well-made piece there's no doubt about that but in terms of the actual use of the of the product it's it's got some pretty significant issues and the first one that you that you look at when you're cutting a cigar what's so cutting or spiking or whatever however you want to call it when you're using this product the idea is that you're going to punch a holes into the cap of the cigar and so you use it to actually just very very gently you don't want to go too hard or too fast because it'll damage it even more the cap even more than you could if you don't but you very very gently move that in about half way give or take and then pull it back out this is more difficult with smaller engages obviously and if you don't get a decent draw from the beginning you want to put more holes into it and I found that I really had to use quite a few different holes in most of my cigars I had to do more than I expected I guess I thought you'd need three maybe five and it ended up I needed you know eight or seven or something of that nature in order to get the the kind of drawl that I that I really really wanted and so you would turn it you know this way and then push it in a little bit more and you can see that if you wanted to actually you know it there are certainly places to put the holes but every time you put a hole into the cap of a cigar you're going to risk damaging it and as you can see here the damage is already I only put in four and the damage is already there it's just a matter of you know you're having to push down on these on these on these spikes into the cap which is not a very you know it's pretty fragile anyway and so you're really trying to to not damage it as you're trying to actually open it up which is a combination that is is difficult at best the company does say that you can push into the sides and they recommend doing it four times which we've twelve different holes you don't go you don't want to go very far at all just very very gently you want to put those in just like that not very far this does alleviate some of the the problems with the tight draw but it also you've got problems because you're actually punching into the actual wrapper itself not just the the CAF and there was a one time at least that the the wrapper came undone based this you're damaging that rapper and anytime you damage the rapper it's gonna be a problem so Olivia of other than the actual cutting of the spiking of the actual cap and the damage they're in I had problems with tar as well tar buildup which I don't run into a lot with cutters and regular cuts and D cuts and things of that nature not even punch cuts honestly and so I had some frogs about 25% of the cigars give or take had some issues and not a very nice thing to have and not to not a great not a great thing to run across and it was it wasn't once or twice it was it was more you know significant in terms of numbers than that but the bigger problem is the fact that even on larger ring gauges which is what you're gonna you know these this works well on larger ring gauges for sure but you have to be very very careful when you're using it and if the wrapper is fragile at all it's going to have problems you push it in you push it just a little bit gently just like that and you can hear even though I did very very gently and you can move it around three is not enough typically for me so you have to move it around and you push it in a little more like this half way or so you can see that the wrapper is already busted on this now this is a fragile wrapper on this specific cigar but even so it's just I mean it's a Connecticut so you know it's it's it's not something that that is you can't you really have to be very careful and it's not something that you can do and just forget about it it's it's a process every single time that you do it and that leads to my basically my main complaint other than damaged wrappers is the fact that it just takes too long you have a process that takes so long to do you're gonna push in you know different ways in order to get around the fact that you're trying to get your that you may damage this cigar and it just takes way way too long and too much effort you know I I don't understand the idea behind having a product that takes so long and so much effort when you can just punch cut it or you can v cut it or you can you know to straight cut it and get a much better end result about half the time and even at its best this the draw on these is is problematic and that's assuming that you don't that you don't damage the the cap as I did like I said about half the time so can I recommend it no I can't it's it's not quite a gimmick necessarily but it does work about half the time but it's it's just not worth the effort or the time to in order to actually use it the way that it's supposed to be used in order to get you know a decent draw half the time you", "zXDkGRWtSAY": "all right what's going on it's your guy insomniac here to give you kind of a mini review of a cutter for those of you have been following me on Instagram you've probably seen it there and I've actually used it a few times already on the channel I believe every time I've had this on screen whether on Instagram or on YouTube everybody just oh my god you're gonna review that right you're gonna review it right there you go it literally is like two cutters and one you have your standard guillotine style and a V cutter so every time I had this on Instagram or YouTube I got requests after a request to review it so I will share it with you and the only reason it wasn't immediately a review anyway is because this was actually a gift from my brother actually who a lot of you have seen in some of the recent videos he and I did a few door reviews recently we actually have a couple more coming up he bought me this for Christmas which is awesome cuz I saw these Assange's which is where he picked it up son just smoke shop which is here in the local area by the way you notice how I keep rubbing the damn thing that's one of the only minuses that I will just jump to if fingerprints so easily anyway back to what I was saying I saw it over there beautiful beautiful cutter and even though most of you know I'm not really a V Cup fan I like the fact that you do have the option I do appreciate a V cut for certain cigars but then I saw the price cuz DuPont is what it is and I was like yep they never buying one and then my brother bought me one so uh pretty great and I've really been enjoying it so far so the operation of this cutter is really nice you just push this in and then both cutters slide out together it's just a little spring-loaded action see push it in again to lock it push it in again to get it out that's it very very easy it's very secure when it's locked so I haven't had this come apart in my pocket or anything because I actually do carry this most of the time now yeah but it's very easy to click out and the mechanism just feels really solid not only is the glide really nice but you really don't have any play or tolerance here at all which I mean is what you'd expect from one of the most expensive cigar accessory brands on the planet it really just the build quality is phenomenal say fingerprints giving you a little bit more of a close-up of the everything I suppose so like I said the mechanism is excellent I'm really enjoying the action and feel of it that's just its quality it feels quality really really great sliding mechanism here and some of you might be thinking well you have two cutters basically stacked on top of each other that has to be really awkward and sloppy to use to cut a cigar no absolutely not I'm gonna cut two cigars on camera just to give you a little demo and if you go back to some of the recent reviews I've done before this you'll see that I've already used it on camera has been great with both the guillotine and V cut not at all awkward to use believe it or not and I think that's partially because of the build quality and because of the zero tolerance that I was showing you in terms of the mechanism if it was sloppy in terms of a slide I would imagine this would actually be a nightmare of a cutter to use but it's not so it's not and one of the other things I'm very much pleased with is the sharpness so far of these blades now I've probably cut maybe 3540 cigars with this so far so I can't speak to the long term sharpness and durability of this cutter although I'm assuming it's gonna be good based on what it is but so far the sharpness of both the v-cut and the guillotine side butter absolute butter like even better than my 440 stainless blades in the xi1 that I've been using for years but I'd actually venture to say that this is sharper and smoother than my ex I ones as well so really pleased with it in terms of feel and carry size and weight one thing is unmistakable this is absolutely well made you can see there it has a decent thickness to it the build quality of its great I don't know exactly what the body material is but it's some type of metal or alloy something like that so it definitely has some weight to it yet at the same time it's really not massive in any dimension so I've had this in my pocket basically since Christmas and I comfortably carry it I forget that it's there most at a time it's a long version of absolutely well-built enough for you to feel weight but dimensionally slim enough to literally pocket carry without it being a burden but you guys are probably tired of hearing me talk about it you want to see me use it so let me get out of cigar too and let's try both sides of the cutter for you on screen okay so we'll start with the guillotine cutter you see they're super super sharp that's with minimal effort going through that and also not a quick cut which is what I normally recommend obviously with any cutter just because you get right through it you get a nice clean cut but I wanted to cut that a little bit on the slow side just to show you how sharp it is cuts super precise so that's your straight cut that's been great that's what I use the most alright now we'll go V cut there you go like I said nice and sharp and because I know some of you are gonna ask there's the depth fairly deep so straight cut or v cut with one cutter it does both and does it well so in my opinion there are really only two minuses to this cutter one of which is what I mentioned earlier which if you're not as OCD about things as I am you really won't care but let me try to show you here just how damn fingerprint e this gets especially this kind of chrome side here I don't know what you would call it the button the handle whatever you want to call it I mean I've been wiping this thing off the whole time I've been talking and there's still just fingerprints all over the damn thing it looks like CSI was dusting for prints after every time I touch it any other - you already noticed if I put a spec sheet in the beginning of this review which I probably did and that's the price these sell even online for a little over 200 bucks now here's the thing I'm gonna be totally me here and just hit you with the honesty which is for that money you could buy a really nice ski Atene style cutter and a really nice V cutter and have some money left over so do I think it's like a great value at 200 plus dollars no but what I can also honestly tell you objectively here is that if you have the money to spend and you just want a nice cigar toy it's also not a bad value for that money you have a really great guillotine cutter one of the sharpest ones I think I've used in all the time that I've been doing these reviews and a pretty nice V cutter and in a really just nice sleek all together package so I mean that's a lot of money for a cigar cutter but if you have the cash and you want the classy and you're looking for basically the rolls-royce brand of cigar cutters well there it is so that's the honest truth there is it the best value cigar cutter you can get no but that's like expecting Bentley to build a car for everybody but is it good enough that after compulsively purchasing one of these despite the fact that you don't really need it you'll enjoy it enough to almost justify spending that much money on one of these yeah I think it is that good it's a little bit easier for me to say that being that I didn't have to actually buy this but that's the truth as well as I can give it to you alright well y'all wanted a review on the new cutter I gave you a review on the new cutter again another big shout out that my brother ang cuz he surprised me with that on Christmas and that was really cool cuz otherwise like I said you wouldn't have seen one on the channel because I wasn't gonna buy it if you have one of these definitely leave a comment let everybody know what you think about yours also feel free to leave your comments I'm sure a lot of them are gonna be ridiculous because of the price and what it is but feel free to leave those comments down below as well and speaking of money I wouldn't generally have to buy one of these definitely sign up as subscribe star if you would like to help move this channel along that is link at the top of the video description I would really appreciate that you get a lot of cool rewards you get entered into my giveaways all that cool stuff and you're supporting the work which is greatly appreciated that's how these videos keep coming all right I'm gonna get back to smoking this I'm gonna wipe this off again and I'll see you all the next one [Music] [Music]", "zSrLR0xQ1_k": "hey guys I'm Bradley here with the seal cigar review and today we're doing something different than cigars we're actually evaluating two brand new sort of brand new cutters and punches on the market that I really like the first is gonna be the screw pop mag pulse I think it's called the mag pulse - I can't move this back post - or not but this is it right here you can see this beautiful thing actually comes in black and I'm actually fusing for you and tell you what I think about it so I have not used this yet I just want to make sure that it worked pretty well I will tell you this that coming out of the box it worked pretty good now it's a little different to hold as a cutter because you want to hold on to the sides but you shouldn't you should actually hold on right here and then release it and it shoots right up if you hold on to the sides because you want you cut your fingers kind of want to go here but you really shouldn't hold it there in order to open it you should just push it right here and it opens like that now what's really interesting about this is they have two strong magnets right here I don't know if you can see the magnets right there you can see them right there they actually repulse each other and that's what opens it so it's not opened with a spring or anything else like that it's actually opened by magnets ie the name mag pulse so it does open fairly quickly it does close very easy so while this is traditionally something that most people don't do as far as cutters are concerned screw pops been doing things different from the beginning you guys may remember when I was at another show actually reviewed a screw pop cutter there they sent me this one to review so I wonder if you it for you I want to cut a couple cigars and tell you what I think about its cutting ability and you guys know that I'm a accessory guy I love cigar cutter so I love cigar lighters I love reviewing them but I'm telling you right now I can't wait to cut my first cigar with this because I've been holding off kind of any cigars this so you could be the first people that I cut it with how cool is that so let's go ahead and start cutting a cigar the first cigar I'm actually on the cut is going to be a torpedo because a lot of people in my personal opinion tend to cut torpedos flat and you can cut them like that but I usually tell people to cut them on an angle so you have more of a smoking more smoking range on an angle so you have a torpedo right here this is actually one of our house blends which one it is just jacks let's get the wrapper off if you go right here you put that you put it on an angle just like this you can see how I have it that's how you want to cut it in my personal opinion you cut it on an angle so I'm gonna cut it real quick look how sharp that Bank cut that's the first thing you see about this thing it is very very very very sharp and you gotta be careful otherwise you could really mess things up so it doesn't leave a whole lot of gunk in there whatsoever it's clean you don't get a whole lot of stuff but it will cut immediately so let's try cutting another cigar so let me go ahead and cut this one for you too as well and this is a little difficult because you want to you want kind of like this is a little difficult it but when you crimp down man you just want to let it go so let's cut this one and see what that's like it's sharp and there's the proof look at that beautiful beautiful beautiful cut as sharp as you can get right there very very sharp got some not many leaves left over in that it kind of clears leaves for you so it's good it does exactly what it should do I don't know that it's one of my favorites I'm not really pumped about the design necessarily although it's it does feel pretty hefty in the hand it's a hefty cutter you're gonna know you have this in the fight and I believe that this sticks to anything metal because of the magnets so maybe if you have it on the fridge and give it your fridge at home but the magnets are incredibly strong that repulsive that opening is all from the magnets so you can you can see just how strong the magnets are when you do boom that it opens right away very very easy so it's a very good it's a very good deal but I want to show you the next thing they have the screw pop punch 3.0 and this is pretty cool because it can actually it can actually have actually as a little carabiner alright this carabiner actually doubles as like a bottle opener watch SB role where I open it see it actually doubles that Basel bottle upper which is kind of cool so you can put it on your key ring use it as a bottle opener but you always have a punch with you now you guys know if you can watch the videos for any time I've been the punches like crazy and this punch is very very nice look at the b-roll it's just it's gorgeous it's sharp but I've never used it before so I'm gonna use this punch on a six sixty okay a six sixty cut because it's a big punch and its might be this punch might be a little big for some Coronas but on six sixty I have long to have a really good punch for my 660 cigars so my leg a little bit this is my punch my share with the house or anything else so I'm going to screw down like this a little bit oh yeah wow that's a big punch that's a huge punch look at that's a big punch it really it really really is so I imagine oh yeah mmm oh yeah that's great Oh tons of air mmm sounds of drawing you Billy a lot of times the punches are smaller because they're like on a lighter and I have my trusty jet line back here somewhere look at that huge difference huge difference more airflow probably better smoke I would definitely recommend the screw pop punch 3.0 I'm gonna love it I'm gonna enjoy it if you want to pick up any of these go to the website below it's gonna be in the description you guys can see it in the description and thanks so much for joining me on my first accessory of the review okay and if you're sending me reviewing your accessories and your company out there that makes accessories please just contact me via email in the description below and all that said we'll catch you later in always when you're looking for cigars you know the deal shop with zeal", "qRPjHG31p3U": "coley Bree v-cut cigar cutter this cutter has a heavy metal construction and stainless steel blade for making precise to be cuts Colibri v-cut cigar cutter you", "3yCkcIHcV_U": "okay this is gonna be a quick review of this nub cigar and this is the Connecticut wrapper version and I did a video on these last week I got a 10 pack of them from Thompson cigars and what I wanted to talk about today was a couple of different ways of cutting the cigar and most people know the traditional guillotine cutter and I literally have dozens of these this is a natural cutter which is from that Sherman tobacco in New York City they make excellent cigars this is a really good cutter and this would work fine when you're cutting that little cap off another way of cutting the cigars to have a cigar scissor and they're sold you know specifically for cigars and you you know cut the again you cut the cap off with that yet another way is what's called a V cutter which would be something like this this is a very old antique one but I have quite a few of these and basically if you look in there it's like a V and when you stick this cigar in which actually in this case you would use a slightly smaller cigar or I could go in and get a larger B cutter it cuts in a v-shape and then again there's you know a single guillotine which would be the one Mike attached this Calibri lady right here but for this particular cigar what I think I'm gonna use which is appropriate because my channel is gun collector double-oh-seven we're going to use a bullet cigar cutter and basically what that is is a it's a it's a cigar punch I should say so basically it is looks just like a bullet it looks like a 44 Remington that's what the shell is but inside it as you see when I undo that is a actually razor-sharp little cigar punch they call it and what we will do in China do this carefully so you could see it what we would do is you push the end into the cigar and you do like a twisting motion so it's now in the cigar you twist it and you withdraw it when you do that a little cigar will gets a little cigar little top of the cigar will get stuck stuck in there and you have a little punch hole and what you like to do before you even like the cigar is to take a little draw which is a little puff and you can see that that's that's a pretty good hole maybe give it another little twirl open it up just a smidgen more to get a little better draw pull that out pull out that leftover piece and they see the hole yeah so that's a much better draw and this is gonna be a very mild cigar I've had nova cigars before they're very enjoyable cigars and what we're gonna do is we're just gonna light it and when you light it what you do is you warm the foot of the cigar and you just hold it there hold it it's quite windy today that's fall that's what you could probably hear the breeze in the background you warm it you want it you want it so you keep going in a circular motion and then you're bringing it up and sometimes you gotta give it another shot it's no stingers perfection in this and that's a nice cigar it's a very mild cigar and what I'm having what this cigar is a Irish cream this one is called savory and James and it's basically like a Harvey's Bristol cream I get these free and one of my businesses so I take a lot of stuff home and I try them out but we'll take a little sip of that and that's a very pleasant drink it's a mild drink to have with a mild cigar like this nub yeah the draw is excellent and I could see it's gonna be a good smoke this one has the Connecticut wrapper with the Nicaraguan filler on it and highly enjoyable smells delicious has like little hints of chocolate almost like a slight coffee flavor to it very very enjoyable so I'm gonna sit here and smoke the cigar I'm not gonna bore you with the whole detail I know some people asked if I could smoke a cigar all the way to the end but I really can't imagine anyone watching me smoke a cigar for 20 minutes and I want to spay of that agony so but I would just tell you it's a good cigar I won't I don't smoke crappy cigars there is an old saying that life is too short to smoke a crappy cigar and I fully abide by that if you can smoke an expensive cigar every day and smoke expensive cigar once a month or twice a month or whatever your budget allows but if you are new to cigars and you go to a gas station and you buy a cigar and you buy the cheap crap that they have in there you'll never really develop a good love for cigars because those are not quality cigars smoke a good cigar get yourself a copy of a good cigar magazine like cigar aficionado or you know read online subscribe to cigars international Thompson catalog so many other ones and and and read the reviews on them and you know see what's good and and that's it excellent cigar all right thank you guys very much for watching and enjoy a day", "3f628BqIC4M": "[Music] welcome back my fellow aficionados it's great to be back so as promised here are all the tools that I use or have used to cut my cigars I know in love you've been asking what what do I use so I figured why not let me let me get them all together and I'll show you and this is it this is all that I have so starting starting off is with the tabletop and now this guy here pretty straightforward self-explanatory right you have the single blade so you have your straight cuts for depending on the size of your bitola and the two V cuts as well I as I said before I don't really I don't use the the be cut but for the straight cut this this is great this actually works really well the issue I have with this is when I am cutting a pyramid or torpedo bellicose o8 it takes off too much for for my liking but you know I again personal preference I'm not saying right or wrong but that's the only issue I have with this guy but but great great great tabletop if if any anybody's looking for one going on to the next I'll just go through each and every one of these the next one the scissors these in particular or the xikar again I don't use this often but when I do I get a great cut yes you have to pay a little bit more attention when doing it and I found when I do it actually I shoot a hat a cigar I tend to push and cut wat while using the scissors and I get it clean a nice clean cut great great great thing to have in your in your repertoire the next one this is new to me this is the paleo again a fantastic fantastic straight cut no complaint the only the only issue I don't maybe you somebody else has a paleo like I just find and this is new this is pretty fairly new but I find it's like I don't want to say sticky but it just doesn't move as smooth as as I would have liked but the cut itself is awesome no complaints with this guy which leads me to the complete opposite and I know there's some of you that love this this is the Cuban crafters I just don't have any luck with this thing I just find for myself no matter what I do when I cut I never get a clean cut it's always kind of jagged I don't want to say ripped but there's there's a lot of a lot of debris it just doesn't leave a clean cut and I've tried it and kind of I won't like given up on it so again that's me but that's the the Cuban crafters the next one I have is the xikar the the XO this thing and I'll be brutally honest it's a great cut it's a great cut it's you can probably put a tree trunk in here and cut it like the ring gauge on this is massive I'll probably never never use that big of a ring gauge I love the way the blades come in to cut equally great cut when when there's a lot of daylight I just find for some of my friends that come over when we use this end up taking off a little bit more of their cigars and again it there's a learning curve to it but frankly it's more of a novelty thing like if you have to pick a cutter I wouldn't rush out to get this one I would definitely get which I'll get to this now the the X I I can't remember what the newer model was but this thing is fantastic and this is what I use 90% of the time great cutter always a perfect perfect cut I've never had an issue with this thing this I would say highly recommend before getting the get the X I before you get the exo but yeah great and great cutter which now leads me to the last two now punch I do use a punch now and again depending on the cigar and in this by far I ended up getting rid of all the other punch cutters that I had this is the able punch and what I love about it is that you have to um actually let me see if I can do this you actually have two sizes for this I don't think I'll be able to do it with one hand here yep so you have that end and then you also have the bigger and hopefully you guys can see that in the camera maybe let me move it over here there you go so you have a smaller in the bigger punch size this is by far in my experience using punches probably the best punch cutter I've used and absolutely love it can't recommend that enough and I know I talked about this in the last video now this is the recent one I bought and this is the Lu show now I know a lot of people are saying you know holy [ __ ] like why you know why would you ever spend that for a cutter and you're right you're right this thing though the cut is fantastic I'm not saying this is any better than the Paleo or the xikar the x1 they cut it cuts just the same as these guys and it is very clean just as these now the material involved yes is a little more exotic yes but what what I do love about this cutter is the conversation that it starts because as soon as people see this it strikes up a conversation right away of hey what is that like what in in my field in the industry that I work in it's it's an it's just a bonus it to me that I put value to that if that makes any sense for me that that's about you because it engages conversation which can lead to business and for me it's worth every dollar just just for that so but you know if you're just looking for a simple cutter yeah I mean don't don't get this like yes it is cool you know you do have the magnets there is no mechanical device Springs or anything it's just the the the magnets and that's it put it in your hand and away you go but you know yes the the cut is great it's just the same as as any any of these quality wise for the cut so there you go guys that that's you see all the stuff all the tools that I have I just wanted to share that with you all and again congratulations Shane for winning the the draw that we had last week and stay tuned folks I believe now we're at 7:20 so at a thousand subs I will definitely be giving away a 10-count box of the hoyo de Monterrey speciale the reason why I'm picking that is just because the cigars are absolutely fantastic I just killed a box and they're smoking fantastic right now so it's definitely one that I want to see somebody somebody have that in their humidor we are having some other cigars donated as well but we'll get to that when the time is right and when I have everything in hand and then that way I can video exactly what the winner will be getting will be getting back into the next video what will save the questions there's a whole bunch of shout outs new subscribers a ton of emails and questions Mazen I I know I've been emailing you but we'll we'll get onto that in another video and get back to two unboxings all right guys so as always good night good afternoon good morning wherever you're watching around the world I hope you guys enjoy this and we'll catch you guys in the next video Cheers [Music]", "vsMnlVWPUpw": "Colibri Deco Pointed Cigar Cutter This

include a storage bag for the cutter and here's the cutter itself it comes in a plastic wrap to protect it and I just so happen to have one that's already that's out of the box to show you right here this is a pennant design and it looks similar to some of the major branded cigar brand cutters but it is slightly different if you look at it it's very well made it's it's metal it has screws in it and what I like about this is the fact that's a V cutter itself but then also the design so all you have to do to use it is press the button that says Winston's on here to deploy it and this spring will open it up now the wonderful thing about a V cutter is it will control the cut much better than a traditional cutter it's in the probably personal cutter a lot of times is that it will cut inside that cap it will cut across the line of the cap and when that happens they'll start unrolling as you smoke the cigar the benefit also the V cutter is it's going to increase the total amount of surface area that you're going to be able to draw the smoke in from and I'll show you so this V cutter has a nice channel here that you can put your cigar in this is probably a 42 or so ring gauge that's not particularly large but as you can see there's a lot of room here so if you have a big church fellow if you have a 52 at 54 it's going to fit in there very well so you want to do is you want to bring in the cigar perpendicular to the cutter itself you don't want to put angle so you don't risk cutting through the cap and then this is a very just easy consistent and gentle cut and what you're gonna see is an absolutely perfect cut every time it's a very sharp stainless steel blade so if you look at it the cut has not gone below the line of the cap however the cut itself has gone very deep into the crown of the cap and what that's going to do this can increase the surface area that you're gonna be able to draw the smoke from you're gonna be able to get a much better taste of the cigar as as you may have a very complex the cigar wide cigar also it this also helps if inadvertently the wrapper or the person that's wrapping the cigar wraps a little too tight sometimes they'll loosen that initial draw up and even if it's not a perfectly rolled cigar it will it will taste it and draw a lot better so again this is a new V cutter from Winston's check out", "YjDVO608nV8": "I want to do a review this like right would seek a cutter very high quality that's a sting is still under the hood is not a cheap very high quality very sharp H we have a seeker here let's try to cut it you see edge is very sharp very smooth very see it's very nice clean cut okay this one is used so I cannot say okay I'm gonna keep for myself okay so let's measured 3.5 inch 1.5 inch let's put on the scale 57 grand Wow so if you like this cutter you can get a far website simple clasp happy to come and thank you for watching", "WVAyDU2py-g": "hello this is Brooks Whittington with hat wheel comm today we're taking a look at a very unique cutter visually which is the colibri quasar now obviously the first thing that jumps out at you is the blades and we'll get to those in a second but I want to first talk about this hobnail pattern around the edge it was inspired the look of it was inspired by an old 1960s Moltres lighter that Calibri produced the first time we've seen it in recent years was when Calibri and Daniel Marshall got together and produced a humidor as a collaboration and released it at the IPC pr show but other different accessories have followed since them with that same look to it including a ashtray which is very very large and very very heavy but you can see that same the same look to it as you can see there then they they've also released a tabletop cutter which you can see here also has that cool look but this one also has two different cutters in it AV cutter on one side and a regular straight cut on the other side this is very cool I've actually I've actually reviewed that on the side already you can take a look at it the review that is and it is a very very cool cutter and very good and perfect really for at the office or for a tabletop or anything of that nature if you need something like that also released a punch cutter which we haven't reviewed yet but are going to and this one here will so you can see it has the same look to it as three different punches very cool design very lights very easy to use I've not reviewed that yet but are going to and so they would get to the the cutter or the cutter of the hour here so basically a fairly standard specs in terms of cutters you have eight different colors and combinations that you can buy including blue here all of them cost fifty nine dollars apiece 440 stainless steel in the blades and it can cut up to 60 ring a 62 ring gauge cigar which I did should test and it does cut them you can cut bigger caps it just doesn't go as far through so you would you be just have to you'd have to cut a little bit less off the cap if you wanted to use it for that but they would use for larger it would work for larger caps as well and that's a spring-loaded release basically you just click this and it comes right open the blades come out very very nice click and very very easy to use in terms of that now some things that I loved about this this cutter really right off the bat number one is the unique design the blades as you can see the blades are actually they're very interesting-looking but basically what they did they call an open on open design where they basically just cut out the rest of the metal around the actual sharp part of the blade and that's basically how you're getting that look to it basically they wanted to be to just have the blades the sharp part goes through the cap as opposed to the rest of the metal which apparently is unnecessary and so that's how they they came up with the idea it's a very unique look very cool when you pull it out people don't really know what to do with it or what to think of it it's it's definitely something one of the most unique looking cutters that I have seen in quite a while it's very light as well it's very very easy to use and very thin I can carry it around in my pocket very easily and not have to worry about it being annoying or anything of that nature you know that it's too heavy or anything like that another good thing about it very cool is that it can be used as a cigar stand so you can actually use this basically just put that right on top of there and you could very easily just use that a cigar saying I've done it many times and it works like a charm in a pinch and so there's that it's one of the cool things to show you the blades are very sharp I've had no issues at all after two months of use I've had no issues at all with actually having any issues with it not cutting a cigar or doing something where it would ever think that the blades or anything but sharp but the one of the coolest things about it is that because you can see everything that you need to see here I can see exactly where that blade is going to cut in there because there's no more there's no the other stuff is not in there and so you basically just find it to cut it BAM you and you can see that is a that is a pretty sharp pretty sharp cut a little bit a little bit a little bit angled but sharp very very nice and and you know I had no issues with it the entire time I was cutting it there were some with breaking the cap or anything major issues there were some problems when I had some problems with some pieces leftover tobacco or something of that nature but it was probably my fault not the not the cutters I'm some things that I didn't like necessarily about it number one is that knob as you can see the knob actually sticks out from the the the cutter itself quite a bit and so you have to be very careful with it catching on things your your pocket or a bag or something of that nature when you actually do that and because it will catch it will catch very easily on things and I didn't have any problems ripping or anything like my pocket but it possibly could and so you have to be careful about that the other thing is that one of the other things that I'm I think it's going to be a more of an issue going forward is is the fact that the paint seems to be coming off you can see it right here the paint seems to be coming off on all of these Peaks they're not sharp enough these diamond edges are not sharp enough to actually cut you anything but you can see that it seems to come off a little bit wear off at least it on this specific color and that's I think is probably going to get worse we have not tested in either the color so it's possible it's just for this one specific color but it's it's obvious that it's that it's going to be a problem in terms of in terms of the peaks on this specific cutter you can see that it's it's definitely happening all around and to varying degrees so there is that too to look at also one other thing that I did get kind of annoyed with was the fact that when you actually cut a cigar every once in a while you'll find some tobacco that gets caught in these edges here and you have to kind of dig it out with a with a with a toothpick or something it doesn't happen often but when it does happen it is very annoying but having said all of that would I would I recommend the colibri quasar the answer is absolutely 100% if you need a straight cutter this is an extremely nice-looking unique looking very awesome to use light but balanced cheap at $60 for something that you're gonna use for years the blades are sharp and it's just a joy to pick up and use every time I enjoyed immensely and I absolutely recommend it if you're in the market so for half wheel comm for

as we explore the world of\u00a0\nquality craftsmanship and tradition\u00a0\u00a0 now in today's video we travel to one of\u00a0\nmy favorite places in the world and that\u00a0\u00a0 is davidoff of london never is there a trip\u00a0\nto london without first visiting davidoff\u00a0\u00a0 where you'll find edward and eddie are really\u00a0\ntwo of the best cigar merchants in the world\u00a0\u00a0 helping those that walk through their doors\u00a0\nexpertly select and really enjoy cigars now so\u00a0\u00a0 in this video we visit with eddie and he is going\u00a0\nto show us how it is he cuts his cigars and talk a\u00a0\u00a0 little bit about the proper way to do so eddie\u00a0\nhey thank you so much for taking a little bit\u00a0\u00a0 of time with us today and to walk us through\u00a0\nyou know really how to properly cut a cigar\u00a0\u00a0 thank you kirby another classic question how do\u00a0\nyou cut the cigar my advice is of course related\u00a0\u00a0 to the particular cigar and usually the preference\u00a0\nof the customer we have three distinct types of\u00a0\u00a0 cut a punch cut where you're pushing into the\u00a0\ncigar and pulling out a cross section of the base\u00a0\u00a0 a straight cut which can be done with a\u00a0\ndouble blade scissors a guillotine with\u00a0\u00a0 a single blade or any combination thereof\u00a0\nand a v cut which is a very old style cut\u00a0\u00a0 in recent years it's become more popular\u00a0\nand i'll show you why in a few moments\u00a0\u00a0 i'm going to start with a slimmer\u00a0\nengaged cigar back to my number two\u00a0\u00a0 here i'm going to be enjoying this for\u00a0\nlunch i think how am i going to cut this my favorite cut it's a davidoff\u00a0\nscissor it's sharp surgical steel\u00a0\u00a0 and you're looking to cut just above the line\u00a0\nwhere the cap is placed on the wrapper why is that\u00a0\u00a0 important because that's helping to keep the outer\u00a0\nleaf the wrapper together don't cut beneath that\u00a0\u00a0 position the cutter above the key line\u00a0\u00a0 get it ready and then you want\u00a0\nto do a short sharp powerful cut\u00a0\u00a0 there we are you've exposed it beautifully\u00a0\nthe cap you can add to your compost heap\u00a0\u00a0 and you're ready to go now what if you're smoking\u00a0\na thicker engaged cigar can you use the same\u00a0\u00a0 cutter of course you can no issue with that but i\u00a0\nlike to have a little bit of fun and i especially\u00a0\u00a0 do this if i have a cigar that is likely to be a\u00a0\ntight draw uh it could be a poor construction case\u00a0\u00a0 for winston churchill it's not at all that but\u00a0\ni'll show you it's a good tool to have in your\u00a0\u00a0 armory you'll need the right cutter for this\u00a0\ni use a calibri sv cut this is a really deep\u00a0\u00a0 v-cutter has the advantage of a guillotine\u00a0\ncut on the other side but i use it for this\u00a0\u00a0 pops out this is how we do the v-cut you're\u00a0\nputting it absolutely perpendicular onto the cigar you're going to push down while pushing the\u00a0\ncutter towards the cigar as firmly as you can there we are look at that most people would stop\u00a0\nthere and that's fine you've got a deep incision\u00a0\u00a0 the airflow is going to be fantastic and you're\u00a0\ngoing to have a slight constraining constraint on\u00a0\u00a0 the aperture i like to have that extra cut and i\u00a0\ncall this a rose cut for no good reason i call it\u00a0\u00a0 a double v-cut you can call it what you like key\u00a0\nis to turn the cigar 90 degrees put it back in\u00a0\u00a0 there do exactly the same thing and look at that\u00a0\nfirst of all i think it looks beautiful but it\u00a0\u00a0 really opens up the back of the cigar if you have\u00a0\na tight draw sometimes that can solve the problem\u00a0\u00a0 thank you very much wow eddie thank\u00a0\nyou talk about a beautiful cigar cutter\u00a0\u00a0 that v cutter i think just made\u00a0\nits way onto my christmas list\u00a0\u00a0 and again you know those accoutrements i mean\u00a0\nare really one of the things that in my opinion\u00a0\u00a0 just like with shining a pair of shoes help\u00a0\nembellish and really heighten the experience\u00a0\u00a0 of smoking a cigar i mean a proper ashtray like\u00a0\nthis kirby allison one that we sell on our website\u00a0\u00a0 and then also a good cigar cutter like the\u00a0\nones that eddie was able to show us but also\u00a0\u00a0 there's another cigar cutter we have here at kirby\u00a0\nallison.com this is one of my personal favorites\u00a0\u00a0 this is our el casco scar cutter a little bit\u00a0\nlarge but what i like about it is very similar\u00a0\u00a0 to the first cigar cutter that eddie showed us\u00a0\nthat davidoff won because it's hinged and that\u00a0\u00a0 allows this to really a perfectly slice through a\u00a0\ncigar i really like butter and this is literally\u00a0\u00a0 one of my favorite cigar cutters i've given them\u00a0\nto all my friends who smoke cigars i've actually\u00a0\u00a0 sent one to eddie and his father you know to use\u00a0\npersonally and you know these small accoutrements\u00a0\u00a0 really go a long way invest in them once and enjoy\u00a0\nthem for decades another great accessory is a good\u00a0\u00a0 cigar lighter of course you can use matches but\u00a0\nyou really want to stay away from big lighters\u00a0\u00a0 this is a vintage dunhill lighter i purchased\u00a0\nit on ebay i think it was 250 300 and this is\u00a0\u00a0 what you would call a desktop ladder quite large\u00a0\nnot necessarily something you would carry in your\u00a0\u00a0 pocket and of course i've enjoyed adding this to\u00a0\nmy small collection of cigar smoking

around Google has shown us that no one has actually done any sort of subjective review of the best cigar cutter you can buy the best gold clock old class only oh my yours for the low low price only at northern not marbled carbon fiber sapphires I do dig that marble every top to marbled was it called marble yeah it's Holly no you don't touch the blades huh that's which operated come here so I can stick your finger in it [Laughter] [Music] damn that is I almost want to start some cutting cigars you never have to sharpen that ever you be a cigar girl this is number 24 of 250 so you're part of a limited Club and you guys have two of them yeah how many other knife shops or online stores Afghan tent can even claim to actually have to bow that that does cut pretty smooth Wow", "MFmxMkXYvME": "Amma giving a bonus on how to actually use something called cigar scissors I'm all the time I don't necessary prefer scissors but I don't see a lot of videos on the internet showing you actually how to use scissors so these are cigar scissors and they're made by xikar and maybe some other companies out there but sidecars actually has a little you know mini bottle opener and it's got like a purge tool and everything else like that on there and I really really do enjoy them and they are really kind of cool if you know how to use them so I'm gonna show you how to use them you actually see the tools right there there's a purge tool for your lighter but I'm gonna show you actually how to use cigar scissors I haven't seen many people use these so these are an elegant way and kind of more of a distinct way to cut your cigar versus just simply cutting it with a regular cutter or punch I tell people lick the cap so you get the tobacco a little bit wet it actually cuts a lot sharper that way and these scissors are actually razor sharp you can actually see they're razor-sharp and what you want to do is just cut right above the cap and like like anything you just want to commit and you can actually cut slower and cut again with scissors if you want you just want to cut the cap off there and what a lot of people like to do with scissors is like trim the cigar okay you could trim it however you want to with scissors but you just want to break it open a little bit test wood raw make sure you have a perfect draw so and after that you obviously want to go ahead and light your cigar and when you light your cigar I tell you all the time if you watch the other great videos to basically toast the outside of the cigar and start from the outside in that's a very important part of smoking a cigar after you're done toasting from the outside in the foot of the cigar should be gray with ash or cherry red depending on how close your flame gets then why I tell people do all the time and you should do this it's blow out the smoke in there because it's already Taylor that's a backhoe now relight you can also blow back on the cigar and then find any places that have like little bitty dead spots in the cigar and relight them mmm and the more you blow on your cigar the more you'll get rid of dead spots so [Music]", "obMZMVd3uEY": "the xikar xi3 cutters hi i'm brian clone with cigar obsession calm today we're taking a look at this aluminum series of cutters from xikar these are guillotine type cutters they offer an all-aluminum design with the stainless steel blades lifetime warranties exceptional value great comfort very excellent size they fit in the palm of your hand very easy to hold but they feature is an spring-loaded centre lever design all you do is flip the center lever and they spring open you place the scar inside the center hole and simply squeeze them together to make the cut every time it's flawless they're great blades very sharp very tight tolerances I've never had a problem using these cutters to cut any of my cigars I have often had lesser cutters that I started out with and they would bind or cut on an angle or not come together cleanly that's never the case with these I cars now these are available in a wide variety of colors and designs I have here the solid silver design they also come in lots of different artistic styles this is called the body art and it's kind of got a tribal tattoo like design on it still all living them riveted together very lightweight very solid very tight but again a very personalized design if you go on the website they have dozens of different configurations they have them slightly less expensive in plastic and they have even more personalized more expensive versions in metals but I really prefer the xi3 line they're very economical you can find them at just about any major retailer the lifetime warranty is good at those same retailers it's just an exceptional line both in value and performance and like I said I've never had a problem with these and that really stands for something when you're smoking cigar whether it's a $2.00 stick or a $20 stick you don't want to chance ruining it by snipping off the cap and having a circuit unravel or you know just a bad cut now the guillotine type is a personal choice I like them towards certain things for those of you that watched most of my videos you know that I like a different type of cutter as my main however there are times when you just simply need a guillotine say you're doing a torpedo and you want to do an angle cut that's when you need a guillotine cutter you need to be able to slip the whole thing through the hole and make your angle say you need to step a cigar in half maybe you're getting those new big long ones that you have to cut in half and you get two cigars or maybe you decide that you need to save it for later and maybe you've got the one end burning and you want to flip the cigar in half and you know save which can you need a guillotine for that because you need to be able to again put it through the hole so they are a necessity and they are handy in some situations and in those situations this line is definitely my favorite they have just such good performance such clean cuts tight shaving blades that's I'm sure I've just never had to think about it you just pulled out of your pocket it's you can put it in your pocket without having to worry about anything it's not going to come open in your pocket it's not going to cut your finger it's not going to snag on anything the fit and finish is just flawless I mean I can't tell if it's all machine made or handmade and hand finished I don't know but they're doing it right I mean every single edge it's just beautifully done and like I said these are inexpensive you can pick these up depending on the model you choose from 30 to 50 bucks for a lifetime cutter that's clearly the way to go so if you're looking for a new guillotine or just want to try one or even your first cutter actually the very first cutter I ever personally bought was one of these in plastic I wanted to save you know that 10 or 15 bucks it was the difference between the plastic and aluminum I use the aluminum now actually gave it away to another friend that started out smoking and he really enjoyed the plastic but if you are in need of a guillotine definitely give these a shot check them out your local shop feel them look online on the website find is a design that appeals to you you're definitely going to find one are a ton of them and give a shot this has been these i-car xi3 lighters this has been the xikar xi3 cutters I'm Brian Glenn drew cigar obsession calm we'll see you next time", "l-bN16590ZY": "the combo cigar cutter and knife

table the camera's going to shake i just realized that dang it whew that was fun did that entertain you i'm always trying to keep you engaged in the video because the longer you watch this video without clicking away the better youtube likes it so i'm trying to keep your attention with silly zany moves okay anyways this is the cigar we're looking at today this was sent to me by my cigar pack if you'd like a cigar sent to your home like this check out my cigar pack they're in the description of the video the link to my cigar pack they're amazing really really amazing so we're going to look at different we already know you already know what we're gonna do today because it was in the description of the video now listen i don't have listen listen i don't have every tool available to cut a cigar there's a lot of different ways of doing it i'm just gonna show you the most popular standard ways and there's three of those it's not that exciting actually it is i mean i say it is the most exciting thing you've ever heard don't click away from the video okay let's open the cigar in the most entertaining fashion possible okay i'll just i'll just whatever oh oh boy this smells so good i'm trying to get a good shot of it [Music] okay so i have three different types of cutters for this cigar and i think i said that already repeating myself does not keep your engagement so i apologize is this are you still super engaged highly committed to this video because you should be videos don't get much better than this the first style we're going to be looking at is this oh this way okay ready oh that's what's cool about this lighter it's not a lighter though it's a cigar cutter look at that it's like bat wings it's like hey i can't hurt you or can i so this slider is very simple very basic you cut the tip of the cigar off wow this cigar is so big it barely goes in there but it actually is a perfect example of where you should cut your cigar using this method so ideally what you want to do is you don't want to cut too far into the cigar and you don't want to cut too close to the end what you want is this perfection right around here i moved the camera a little bit because the shot was bugging me so just calm down but first before we get to this one let me show you a different cutter this next method is called the v-cut it helps with this cutter to make that noise anytime you open and close it you can also go you don't have to make any sound uh i got this cutter for like three dollars very cheap but what it does i'll show you but it cuts a little v into the back of the cigar but first before we get to this one let me show you a different cutter this cutter comes equipped on my lighter little secret door secret compartment there do you see that amazing this lighter you can find on amazon i'll put the link to it in the description below if you'd like to pick up your own it's like eight bucks great lighter and cigar cutter so this has the punch method this is called the hole punch or something like that if you look on the end of this thing you can see that it has this like it's actually pretty sharp this area right there and all you do is stick the cigar onto that kind of in the center and then just kind of push back and forth like so and you'll notice there's now a hole in the cigar and the other piece of the cigar got stuck in there and i can just tap it out so that's that now we can go back to the v-cut i'll show you what that looks like so the cigar goes in the hole and you move this little knife thing down cuts and it i that was the worst cut ever let me i wasn't paying attention okay terrible terrible cut that's not what it should look like i don't think it did so well because i already had the hole punch in it and i just am bad at this but that's that's not how it should look now my trusty stick it in there look how simple this is boom oh gosh it was awful too well our cigar is now cut so now we can smoke it and enjoy [Music] if you like to know which method is the best none of them doesn't matter you can use whatever you want i personally like the punch i think little hole punch because it it's a little bit more like a pipe you get a smaller draw smaller air through but it's it's a total preference thing it's whatever you like i just like that you're still watching this video and you're so sweet um if you'd like to be even sweeter be better you can go to my patreon and you know give me money that way all this guy does is ask for money i know what a jerk i have three kids so is my wife they're the the same three kids they're getting older my oldest is 16 then i have a 14 year old and well on and on actually there's only one more age but he's the youngest it doesn't matter so one of the things that happens to kids get older is they start to have their own opinions about things happens from a young age actually it's a good thing we always wanted our kids to have their own opinions on things but sometimes our kids will come to me with an idea that's different than my own i found as the kids get older and more and more opinions get thrown out there that might be different than my own it becomes ever more apparent that it's difficult to challenge your own way of doing things looking at things [Music] when it comes to cigars and how you cut a cigar most of us are pretty dang open to new ideas like wait how do you do it i want to learn that way maybe it's better i'll try it out who cares we're that way with a lot of things but oddly enough we're not so okay with that when it comes to differing ideas or viewpoints on big issues i guess that makes sense but at the same time the big issues are the things that actually make the biggest impact on our life but those are the things where the most hesitant not only to change but also sometimes to even hear to listen to it's of course easier when it comes from your own kids because you know them you bore them and if you don't like their opinion you can tell them to shove off force them to think the way that you think but when it's somebody who has a different opinion that maybe you don't agree with you don't really like it's very easy to just shut them down to not even listen to it or if we know that we're going into a situation where we're going to hear a differing idea from somebody else we prepare ourselves with our own idea and make that strong so that we can change their opinion or idea or thought to become our own i guess i don't have a big point on this it's just struck me lately that as i hear more and more different viewpoints as my kids grow older and begin to have their own viewpoints it's made me keenly aware of how often close-minded i am [Music] just because i might prefer the punch method doesn't mean that it's the best for you but most people will be open to trying it and at least we've tried it we can say for sure i know what that is what it's like and why i like it and don't like it but in the areas that matter most to us in our lives that dictate who we are and how we see the world those areas more often than not we don't know what the other side is like we don't know what the other opinions are or viewpoints or why people even have them because we're not willing to even go down that road or we're afraid with our kids especially we're afraid that if we let that influence into our kids lives maybe they'll just think differently than me whatever you believe to be the truth in your life your opinions your viewpoints if they're strong and they're right then they should hold up to your kids or yourself exploring other ideas and looking at other things because to me that just reinforces what we believe you know what i mean if what you believe about any particular topic is right is true at least for you then it should hold up to other viewpoints other opinions that you could actually not just listen to but investigate try out i'm not saying it'll sway your opinion or that even should sway your opinion but it should make your opinion even stronger well that's it for this video hope you enjoyed it if you like it there's a lot more like it on this channel so subscribe to the channel

"Hi everybody, this John over at Cigar\nAdvisor and Famous Smoke Shop and I'm here once again answering your\nFan Mail. Now, I got a Facebook message from this guy Tino in New York,\nAnd he asked a very common question: H ow do you sharpen your cigar cutter? Now it can be a little - it\ncould be a little difficult if you have like a cheap-o plastic cutter or if you\nhave a double-bladed cutter like I do. Sometimes it's hard to actually sharpen\nthe blade. But I'm going to go into a few ways that's actually pretty\neasy to sharpen your cutter and we're going to go over a theory\nas well. So, we're going to be doing this together because I've actually never done this\nbefore. So really the theory is, you take tin foil on your dull cutter\nand you snip through it, and as you snip through the tin foil, it's not\nsupposed to really sharpen your cutter, but it's supposed to de-burr your cutter. And what de-burring is, is, it simply\nmeans all the imperfections on the edge of the blade are supposed to be\nsmoothed out or reduced, because of the tin foil every time you snip.\nSo, like I said, we're going to go through this together I'm going to show you\nhow you're supposed to do it. And remember: no good cigars were harmed in the making\nin this video. So let's try it out. Now I'm going to try cutting it\nwith my dull cutter that I didn't sharpen yet. Now, as you can see,\nyou can see this like perforated line or how it didn't cut properly, so that means that the cutter is completely\ndull and it's not going to give you a good burn it can give you\nsome draw issues - it can really just mess up your entire cigar experience.\nSo now, I'm going to go ahead and try to de-burr my blade using tin foil\nand let's see if it works. Now, as you can see, the tin foil should\ngo on every part of the blade. So you have to do this multiple times\nand try to get all over the blade if you can. It may not cut all the\nway through the aluminum foil, but every time you snip it should de-burr more and more\nand more as you go down the line So, I'm going to try to jam it into this\npart of the blade and then I'm going to go to the other side, and I'm just\ngonna go all the way down the - oh wow. That side is messed up - so I'm going to go\nall the way down the the cigar cutter, and hopefully, this de-burrs my blade and sharpens\nit a little bit. All right. So there we go. I de-burred\nthe entire thing using aluminum foil Now, let's see if this blade is better.\nAll right. Now that I did the tin foil and should have de-burred the cutter,\nI'm going to try it on this cigar which is uncut. So let's\nsee if it actually works . Okay. As you can see, it snipped through\na little bit easier than last time So, look at the actual difference between\nthe cigars. This is the first cigar that I cut and you can see that there's\njagged edges right on the top of that cap. Once again, this can create\na lot of draw problems for you s o this is no good. This, on\nthe other hand, has zero jagged edges - straight all the way through. So de-burring\ndid actually help the cigar. It helped cut the cigar really smooth, clean,\nand you should have no draw problems. Okay, so what have we learned? De-burring\nis a temporary solution to a permanent problem. Every time you cut\nthrough a cigar it's going to - it's going to fray. You're going to have\nsome damage on your blades. So even though the tin foil worked this time,\nthe next time I use this cutter it's probably not going to work as well\nas it just did after I de-burred it with tin foil. So what does this mean?\nIt means don't use tin foil as - as a permanent solution. What you need\nto do is, you need to sharpen your cutter and you need to clean\nyour cutter. By cleaning your cutter you're getting rid of the gunk from the oils. And if you lick the cap of your cigar,\nall that gunk and that saliva builds up on your blades and can make it duller,\nand it can wear down your blade a lot faster. So, don't lick the cap\nyour cigars before you cut it and wash your cutter so you can get rid\nof all that gunk. The other thing you want to do is, actually just sharpen\nit with a round whetstone. So you have all these screws around cutters\n- around your cutter - so, most cutters have these screws where you could just\ndisassemble it really quick and you can just get around whetstone and\ngo with the blade of the cutter and sharpen it up really quick.\nAnd that's quick, that's easy, it's efficient, and it's going to keep\nyour - your cutter going for a long time. If you have a plastic cutter,\nlike a cheap-o plastic cutter like a one- dollar cutter that you get from a retailer\nor a cigar store for free or for a buck, just throw it out.\nIt's not worth - it's not worth sharpening because it's harder to do and you can't\ndisassemble them. If you have a punch cutter - unfortunately I don't have one\nwith me right now - but if you have a punch cutter, a good tool\nto use is actually a shell casing de-burr that actually works. It's meant\nto de-burr the shell casings from a firearm. So what you do is, you take\nthe punch cutter, get the de-burring tool and just run all the way around that ring\nand it will sharpen it up nice and new. That's actually a really good technique. So,\nSo, at the end of the day the tin foil technique, although it works\nevery once in a while, or it works when you when you first de-burr your\ncutter using tin foil, it's not - it's not a permanent solution.\nneed to actually sharpen your cutter So, So, get yourself a round whetstone,\nmake sure you know how to disassemble the cutter that you're buying or that you\nalready have - if you have a cheap-o cutter, just throw it away because\nit's not really worth it - and make sure you sharpen your blades\nand keep your blades clean. And that is how you keep your blade sharp.", "5KGwLPuvoKc": "hello why would you be smoking in this video we're going to be exploring the best tabletop cutters to cut your cigar [Music] hello my name is Paul Anthony and I'm CP and today we're looking at the colibri quasar desktop cutter and the scorpion or quality importers desktop cutter so we've just got finished off actually reviewing the cigar cutters and you can see the the kind of fruits of our labor with the cigars on the table here before it will be good to do a little video on the best tabletop cutters and the reason why we like these in our current best tabletop cars is they both contain reservoirs yeah you know so there are a lot of other cars on the market they're just kind of do a single stick but I think we both like the fact that you know if you're going to get a desktop cutter like it should probably you know perform the function of one kind of cigar but to also storing the debris rather having a mess already a desk because we all have you know I mean some of them look cool and you've got like guillotine styles and all of that but I really form a double function which is nice as opposed to some of the other cars we have on the table that are obviously gonna you know create a cigar debris so that's why we chose these particular two I think there are pros and cons to both models I'm gonna go over the pros and cons of this one quickly so I really like the colibri this you know for me has the best straight cut of any cutter I own so that's out of probably the 15 20 cars I own which is pretty impressive we had a little bit of trouble with the V Cup major pros are very solid construction looks awesome comes in a bunch of different colors the rubber feet really do hold the cutter into place even though such a small wine better than that one actually is so much larger before the kind of down sides of the car that I don't particularly like our one that it doesn't hold very many cut so I think it's more of a personal use option it would be very good for say a party where you've got you know 15 20 guys around for a barbecue like I do several times in the summer here at the house because it's just going to fill up pretty quickly also it's really hard to remove the cigar there even though there is kind of a poor at the bottom to kind of remove those it's not very good so but that they only two kind of downs like the upper one major upside the highlight is Calibri of comment of a whole range of quasar stuff from handle cutters lighters or you know even the SP cut you have has this kind of diamond pattern there humidor so if you're like me and you like to kind of see something you like and then kind of go down the rabbit hole and get everything within that line then this could be a really nice option where you have like the desktop''option the handheld cutter except for etc but I with you so meanwhile the scorpion cutter has rather than this modern contemporary geometric design you have something is very nostalgic very old-school to be like a tail or something you'd expect it on a mobsters desk in the 1940s it's quite iconic also you do have a selection here of gauges so you have two straights two v cuts of different sizes and also you have a much larger reservoir than the quasar which means that you're going to be able to use this either commercially or the big event is going to be there now in terms of drawbacks the cuts well they give good straight cuts but as Paul mentioned in the dedicated review to this you do get a slight curvature on your straight cut which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it may be a bit unusual whether it affects the burn or the draw who knows as for the V cuts the V cos were surprisingly reasonable we were using a booster size of gauzy above so 5 by 50s so as for the V cos what was quite interesting was a they were quite good I was pleasantly surprised as a Vika enthusiast but for the Robusto size here for this gauge it came out was quite now quite shallow and a little bit too tight so he ended up having to use the larger gauge hole anyway and once you get to a cigar that's maybe you know in the 60 range it may be a bit of a struggle even on a larger gauge yes and obviously bigger cages are in vogue right now so this is definitely a nostalgic looking piece oh yeah for sure and also there is the issue even though a larger cutter it does slide around despite its rubber feet so actually find that quite hard to operate to be honest yeah you know I know it's only cutting a cigar but it is kind of is where this is just a nice up-down motion you can't really mess this up when that kind of starts sliding around it's actually a little bit trickier than Arius so but okay who's this cigar cutter good for I think it's good for the guys maybe got a smaller desk he's going to be using it for you know kind of personal consumption with respect to this kind of huge weakness is good for this is good for businesses maybe like a cigar shop you've probably seen this in about a dozen cigar shops here yourself specially in the USA but also if you for example when you're noticing parties you leave this out which is a great option because of the as of well you won't really need to enter probably don't know it's kind of a setting forget it that's a nice option again I'm not a massive fan of the car as opposed to this one I've been they're both out there place in your potential collection of cars this one comes in around 120 bucks every links below I'm going to buy this from and this one is around $60 and there's a to gauge version as well which is about it's about 40 bucks that one yeah 40 to 45 so we've provided links there to Amazon from where you can buy these from also you can see the specific reviews on these cutters where we go into the pros and cons and you'll see us actually cutting them in action please feel free to go to bespoke unit comm for specialty cars where we have a dedicate

Cheryl I think that cuz it okay perfect of all that being said my name is Paul Anthony live CP we'll see you next time take care [Music]", "4PyT03wB9Ag": "hi everyone today we're having a look at how to cut a cigar with the guillotine type cigar cutter a lot of people sim seem to think that these types of cutters with one blade is not necessarily a good ones now it's important to note that my single blade cutter is made in Germany so this is although it's a plastic cutter it's not a cheap blade it has to be extremely sharp to properly cut the cigar if not you crush it and then it's a pain to smoke it so the way we go about cutting it with a guillotine is first of all we have to prepare the cigar cigar has to be slightly most moistened so you do that with your mouth this will allow the cigar to be easier to cut actually and the way we start cutting it is you leave the blade partially out you put the cigar in like so and you rotate it and this will allow the the cutter to actually cut just the outside once you have cut the entire cigar circumference you can then you can then close it and there you go you can clean the little particles off so they don't come up in your mouth and you're ready to smoke enjoy", "8YI7M9NZtxc": "oh hey you know the site cigarpage.com duck goose tim you let's check out some accessories today actually not some accessories just one accessory we have a cutter from from xycar so that car is just one of the best accessory companies out there cigar accessory companies you can't go wrong they have a very very unique uh lifetime guarantee policy which is like unheard of i think the only other things that have lifetime guarantees are like uh like oshkosh pagash's or something like i really don't even know what else has lifetime guarantees but that car does because they're so confident in the quality of their products and you know what they have a good reason to be after many years of uh personally using their products i gotta say they make great stuff so let's check out this cutter we have here today a zykar slim line cutter oh that is slim ultra slim cutter yeah all right so um you can see here very very slim and trim so it's like a like one of their regular cutters but on atkins i guess you could say that was a that was a bad one what is slim i don't know so um pretty unique here it's got the uh the kind of ring gauge guide here um to be perfectly honest with you oh oh so they're telling you like if you want to cut a 24 ring this is how far you would open it if you want to cut a 48 ring gauge this is how far you would open it so okay that makes that makes sense that's nice um so it's just the one um arm here that that moves it has motion um the bottom stays stays set and that's fine actually it makes it kind of like a little easier to use and really with the cutter like this there's two keys or two reasons why you'd want to buy this one is if you have tight jeans on you know what i'm talking about guys out there wearing those type jeans um but you know the pockets you don't have a lot of space in your pockets for some of these big bulky cutters this would be a great option just slide it right in there doesn't look like you're happy to see anybody if you know what i mean and you just take it right back out also great for shirt pockets nice and uh nice and slim and trim there and the other reason or the other the other kind of um you know great selling point on this one is the the blades themselves are going to be really nice and sharp so you're going to get very precise very clean cuts when you use this so between being easy to carry around and also very precise and effective at doing what it's supposed to do this this would be a great uh great purchase for you so the ultra slim cutter this is in this is a silver model um with all the little helpful uh ring gauge guide there this is one that uh i think a lot of you should check out we have it in stock right now", "3OmiM8DJqQ4": "hey everybody will come back what an awesome awesome cigar cutter we have here from benchmade now this is a new Gold Class cigar cutter from bench made knives model number one five zero zero - 191 so

baby blue stitching nice little benchmade logo there I really like that it's your see there you go just a nice little what it's made flip it inside here this little note from lusty Asus Tanya what you got in the box confirming this is number 132 and it was made June 1329 teen and got a little piece of foam we got your microfiber cloth little bag just got the gold kind of silk what do you call that screen printing bench made very nice okay set that aside really quick and usual bucks wool foam padding all around keep it nice and secure so let's put all this back inside let's put all this over here just put it up here as a reminder well let's take a look at this so now really quick let's just take a walk around got a little bench made laser marking in there with 1500 now you can see through the handle material we'll cover that in a minute but you can see the hardware let's look at the back bar here goes underneath little spacer there now this has an auto access release lock which is patent pending so obviously don't put your finger in there kids only put things in there you wish to cut let's look at this side of the blade it's got the s9 UB steel in number 132 very very nice so let's talk a little bit more about the handle material and we'll get into that here and obviously we talked about the s9 TV steel on the blade and it's got kind of their stone wash finish to it so it's got a black g10 spacer which we saw right here it's got the auto access release mechanism so you just pull back both of these very nice very smooth kind of smoke gray coated stainless steel liners so it's hard to see they are lightly coated got a chisel ground guillotine blade I don't know if you can see kind of right there let's flip it over the other side there's a little dirty because I did use it last night we'll cut to that video in a minute and it's got a handle meted the wrapper noble black waves and let's see if we can get a little closer look at that this is bronze and brass in a mesh material put together and they use like a super translucent resin to hold it all together so hopefully you're getting the details on that pretty nice each one's gonna be a little bit different based on the pattern I'm really diggin that you see it kind of shine through there what do you guys think now this does retail you put the retail about $500 450 and on a lot of websites I've seen recently for pre-order this will come out shortly this week from benchmade knives let's do a quick cut over to using this with a cigar so this is like one of my favorites of padrone but you would basically take your cigar put it inside there do a little cut so we'll flip over to that video show me cutting one up and we'll come back [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay we're back so I was a little off on the price retail is 454 5-0 MSRP from Benjamin let's go over some quick specs just want to wait up see what you guys think this is gonna be announces three point nine five ounces three point nine five ounces and let's do a size comparison I know it's you know I don't have any real other cigar cutters here but let's compare it to the new bench made proper this is the three 19-2 and we'll compare it to the bench made gold clasp bug-out so you can see size-wise it's gonna be pretty similar just a smidge more and width you see what that is it's gonna fit a lot bigger in the pocket but obviously you're gonna put this inside your sheath and you're gonna carry this you know in your bag or in your pocket to keep it protected just you don't get any scratches on it so the rest of the specs it's got a ring gauge of 66 zero it's got an overall length of four point one eight five inches m/s well not I guess the actual specs of it's a four point zero two ounces but this is coming a little lighter so maybe a little more Paul shootings done on mine but yeah so what do you guys think of this one I think this one you know it's definitely for somebody that you know maybe it's your

intermission gentleman here and today i'm going to do a review on a cigar lighter and cutter combination here this is the lotus duke v serrated cigar cutter and lighter so let's start with some specs here um let's see so the lighter itself is about two and three quarters inches long it's about half an inch wide or thick and it's about an inch and a half wide here it is a triple torch lighter you can see the three jets there and let's take a look at the weight so this lighter comes in about 4.87 ounces which we're looking at 138 grams let's just do one more this way 138 grams and still 4.87 ounces for some size comparisons we have our black sharpie marker we have a standard uh run on the middle zippo we have the ubiquitous uh bic lighter and also we have uh a normal like credit card debit card size and a little bit of a throwback here we have an ipod video now what makes the slider a little bit special is that it is also it has an integrated v-cutter here and it does have serrated blades which the information out there is that it does protect the cap of your cigar as you're making your cut a little bit those serrations pull down activation that does flip the lift lid off there three nice uh blue flames that come out uh to the tip you have your refill here and then you have your flame height control knob here now it is a little bit of an order design if you will where it does require the use of a coin or a screwdriver to get in there nowadays a lot of lighters are doing some sort of bigger um knurled knob or they're doing some sort of mechanism that has a a flip tab to give you a little bit more purchase on your flame adjust wheel it does have a decent fuel window here on the front maybe a little bit hard to pick up on camera but it is blue lit and uh on the back here the integrated cutter it also flips up allowing you to either cut in this way or clear out tobacco that you've already uh used in the downward position uh i think as you heard there it has pretty good detents right here on both sides that uh that secure it in the downward position so i heard that click in there nicely so it's not going to come out any risk there normally what i'll do is i'll cut the cigar in its down position here and then after a few cuts throughout the day or that cigar smoking open it up then and kind of brush out or blow out any tobacco from within the tray here this is the antique bronze finish but the lighter does come in some other color combinations there is an all black there's also a kind of pewter or silver um antique finish as well as a red and black finish too the lighter itself is pretty good now triple torch coming to a nice point there pretty good for your i don't want to say necessarily bigger cigars like 60 plus but i would say anywhere between you know 48 to 60 uh this lighter is going to do just fine because the jets are angled inward on the outside it does come to that uh more fine point so if you needed to do some touch-up work with even this triple torch lighter you could there are some lighters out there though that all of the jets are parallel with each other so they don't come to a point it's more of that paintbrush style broad flame that is becoming more popular with a lot of lighters it is coming in at seventy dollars and to be honest it's probably a little bit overpriced i think it would be more competitive at that fifty dollar range however with the integrated cutter here a lot of lighters from let's say xycar or calibri that do offer some sort of integrated cutter are oftentimes a lot more now a couple downsides with this slider is that it is heavy coming in almost at five ounces there um its form factor is pretty narrow to slip in the pocket or to rest inside your travel humidor i haven't had many problems with the ignition it has pretty reliable ignition almost fires every time but i will say that this lighter doesn't do a great job of constant flame regardless of how much fuel you have in the lighter so as the lighters fuel kind of uh dips and even though it's enough to get you through lighting a cigar you will find yourself having manipulate your um flame adjustment wheel here as you lose fuel in the lighter unlike some lighters out there regardless of how much fuel you have your setting will still out output the same flame height or intensity no matter how much fuel is in there until it's completely depleted uh this lighter though as you light you'll definitely and as you use fuel you'll definitely have to modify or play with that with that fuel indicator i'm sorry the flame adjuster one thing though even though like you know a lot of times a coin or a screwdriver would be your best tool it's not that hard to get a fingernail even my shorter fingernails in there to make your adjustments as needed now this lighter is this lighter is okay it it doesn't really do any one thing well if you will it's not the best v-cutter it's not the best lighter um from a standard or pure lighting standpoint the design is really good the angle of the jets to bring that to a nice v the pretty reliable ignition is great what's not great about it is its fuel capacity without having a full transparent window here to really see how much it uh it can hold this is just anecdotal at best but if if you're looking for a lighter that's gonna last you a day on the golf course and you're thinking this is great because it's one package one item that's a cutter as well as a lighting device all in one it's not going to last you even nine holes through golf this lighter is more designed for if you're going to a cigar bar after work with some friends or you're traveling and you don't want to take a lot with you and you don't plan on smoking that many cigars while you're gone meaning you're not bringing uh any type of butane with you because i've probably found let's say like a let's just go with an average of what i smoked like a 52 uh gauge size you're gonna get through i would say maybe three or four cigars depending on if you have to do any touch-ups or you're doing a relight here and there you may get through i don't know at most four to six cigars before you're really um getting low performance even at the highest uh you crank that adjustment wheel the whole way uh to the positive after about six cigars you're really going to need a refill which may seem like a lot for some people out there so you know if you're not planning on if you're planning on being okay with refilling here and there or in between your smokes then you know this should be fine depending on your smoking habits but looking at integrated lighters and cutters let's say even something like this vertigo quad lighter here which is like an eight dollar lighter that you find at some cigar shops uh tobacco stores etc this has a huge tank even for a quad lighter and you saw me have to double hit it there but this has pretty reliable ignition too and it's only eight dollars so if you lose it or leave in the golf cart or you lose it during travel because technically even um even with the the specked cases that they've pretty much stopped making are really hard to find because the tsa now it doesn't matter if you have one of those cases or not you really can't fly with a a lighter that is full and even if you have it empty and you have it in your checked luggage if it gets randomly searched regardless if it's empty or full you're probably gonna lose that later but this lighter doesn't have an integrated uh cutter per se but it does have a punch there it's about a seven millimeter punch works pretty well it's uh retractable here and lockable so once you punch you retract it a couple times and it kicks out that tobacco what i mentioned earlier is this one also has that tag that you can pull out to help you adjust the adjustment uh the flame adjustment wheel a little bit easier but something like this is most likely even between longer smoking excursions and i keep using uh a game of golf as my as my benchmark you probably won't have to fill it even with another couple weeks or a couple days or if you keep this in your golf bag it'll probably still be good to go the next time whereas something like this you will have to be conscious of refilling before your your next big cigar smoking endeavor but again let your mileage kind of be your guide it's a it's a pretty cool lighter regardless and um it all depends on how many you're smoking and how quickly you're gonna use up that fuel but now on to the cutter as well so uh well before we get to the cutter actually another another triple flame lighter this one's from jetblue uh i can't remember the model this one i'll i'll annotate it in the comments here this one's a side squeeze with uh three vertical jets kind of formulating in a triangle there so they're not really angled in it doesn't really give you a fine point so it's a pretty broad flame i clear tank here and it does have a kick out punch that you can use but i find this lighter even though it's a little bit bigger in size this lighter definitely lasts a lot longer even from a triple torch design compared to the lotus here but now onto a cutter so if you see uh the cutter itself is a very manual pull plunger type cutter so no spring system in there you know it's very nice they thought about the gate being able to be lifted up either by cutting your cigar this way or just uh cutting it while it's in the lighter still and then utilizing the gate to get rid of any excess tobacco that's in here but as a cutter it's still not as good as something like zycar here that is spring-loaded cutter or even let's say the let's say like the uh calibri v cutter here as well so both of these dedicated v cutters are infinitely better than the lotus integrate cutter the calibri being the most deep meaning the v that you cut in is going to be the most steep or deep into the cap of your cigar some people claim that you uh if you have a single cap cigar uh the the clipboard can be a little bit dangerous because it'll cut into the cigar and you'll lose your cap after you start smoking a little bit your cap will unwind the xy car is relatively shallow but still pretty deep but we can see about both of these v cutters let me open these back up is that the size or or gauge or thickness of the cigar both the calibri and the xy car give you a little bit more surface area here for your bigger cigars this v cutter i'll tell you anything over 54 it's almost like you're gonna have to do two parallel cuts to be honest to get a nice draw compared to what you might be used to if you're using a something like the calibri or the xy car or even like those um those cheaper two three dollar plastic ones to be honest they give you a little bit more of a a generous ring size for your cuts and i've found that most things or anything over 54 i find myself doing a cut and then moving over just a hair and doing another cut as well to give to give me really like the draw that i'm used to if i would be using a dedicated v cutter at seventy dollars again i think the value would be there if it was fifty dollars but but do some shopping because if you look at other integrated lighters that are made from more premium materials uh let's say not something like the vertigo here that is that plastic um the flip tab i don't have to press the button i can just kind of push it and it's unlocking on me already again eight to ten dollars for this type of lighter if you are looking for something with some more premium materials and you are looking for something with an integrated cutter the punch the punch feature has been very common on a lot of lighters forever but if you're looking for a one-stop shop lighter and cutter 70 dollars actually isn't that bad competitively but when you take it at its single view and you look at the product itself i would say that if this was offered at around more like 50 or even 60 i know that doesn't seem like much this would definitely be flying off the shelves and i would be able to say definitively that you should go and out and buy this lighter but again what i can tell you is think about how you would use the slider or when you would use it how many cigars you'd be lighting how okay are you with purging and then refilling your lighters it is a nice compact package that has everything included it's a soft buy for me it's a soft value for me as well but i am glad that i bought it and i do find use for it in my regular cigar smoking so thanks for tuning in on the short review this is the intermittent gentleman like and subscribe for some more content and we'll catch you later stay gentlemen intermittently of course", "8p2Ts-R-jTA": "hello gang I'm back with another video for today hopefully you guys don't get sick of me in and run I'm gonna do a little a little little bit about cigar cutters I don't smoke that much but when I do I you know in the beginning I had a had a lot of trouble finding a good cigar cutter so I I almost bought everything I looked at reviews what people were doing and you know and online and everything and see what what's what so I bought the four four main cigar cutters available and I'm gonna show you guys how they work first of all there's the there's a cigar punch this one I found to be the best out of all of them it's a push push button you push it push the back cigar comes out and then there's just uh there's this button right there that you push and it pops back out again when you have cut the cigar it just pushes it out so the way it works is you of course this is though this is a tapered one so it would work obviously better on on more rounder cigars but basically you just put it and you twist it so side to side and it doesn't cut because again it's not rounded but basically that's the idea and I'll show you on the side here I know this is a no-no but it takes out normally that would be the back of the cigar in and what you do is you just hit the button be better prepared for this just hit the button and in a little a little plug just pops out by far for for any kind of like rounded cigars the the punch the punch is my favorite it works very well makes a nice round hole every time and I like the points these are like six bucks everywhere I have different colors to come in like five six different colors and next up is this guy right here it's for its these are by yeah by Cuban crafter cigars that has there's a whole bunch of blades that cuts there's reviews on this well I'm not gonna go into detail this is just my what my favorite cigar cutter is there's plenty of reviews on this one and other ones that's going to detail on the cons and the pros and these things but but as far as this one goes it you have to do is Swift don't go slow just kind of go like a swift it doesn't okay job but since the the blades are you know they're a little loose and the thickness of the blade causes this not to be even so when you see it's not it doesn't give you an even straight cut so although it's it's star tricky and looks like the enterprise and it looks cool and and and and it looks cool and and futuristic I don't like it it's nice when you pop it out in front of your friends yes you pop it out in front of your friends that's right but I don't like it next up is these guys these are all these three are by the Cuban crafters by the way this one this one is is very good as far as my number two favorite what it is it has instead of having a hole all the way through it has a little backing and then there's though there's a small hole in there which your cigar this this would be good for a torpedo cigars but it also works with other kinds they kind of your cigar kind of rests on in the hole so it doesn't move so you kind of get a sorry kind of get to gives you a good cut this cigar is a little dry but on a little bit moister cigars it would it would work so this one this one out of all the these kind of sliding guillotine cigar cutters these are these are these are the best I think in my opinion they have different this is the cheapest one is plastic but they also have a bit stainless steel or aluminum tubing crafter's not bad by far my favorite are the scissors scissors work well and they cut nicely every time first like I said two cigars is dry but you get a nice clean cut every time so scissors by far work best and if the cigars is moist and it's hydrated and it cuts the cigar as dry as you can see it's I call shattering everywhere but leave work scissors in my opinion are my favorite and work the best plus you have more control okay so I'm gonna have to clean it up yeah the cigars well there you go my favorite by far the scissors oh I hope that was helpful to somebody out there and thank you for watching", "7oll_f1DIjA": "hello this is brooks whittington with halfwheel.com today we're taking a look at the donatus big cut a pair of cigar scissors made in the town of sulligan germany now sulligan is known as the city of blades due to the large number of manufacturers who produce knives swords razors that kind of thing it's been around since medieval times donatus not a lot of information and history about the brand but we do know that it has been producing cutters since at least the 1950s very different cutters very a lot smaller cutters obviously since the ring gauges have have increased in size dramatically since the 1950s so as i mentioned before this cutter is a pair of cigar scissors named the big cut the measurements it's about 6.1 inches long by 2.25 inches wide and to give you an idea on what that means we have here a standard u.s bill and you can see that the actual size is about the exact same length as the bill itself almost exactly it weighs about 2.9 ounces and the entire cutter is made of surgical steel except for this little bump here as you can see that bump right there is actually made of rubber to make sure that the pieces don't the sides don't click together so there's six different versions of this cutter that are being sold ranging in price from about 160 to 205 dollars depending on the conversion rate from euros there's the big cut polished which this one specifically is the big cut satin big cut gold plated which as you can imagine is plated in gold a big cut ceramic polished big cut ceramic mat and the big cut shot blasted all right so let's cut some cigars as i mentioned before the big cut is basically just a large pair of scissors with a with rounded uh blades and so in order to cut a cigar it is a fairly simple process although there are some things that you can do to make it more manageable and the holes are actually built specifically for specific fingers and so you have your pinky finger your ring finger and middle finger go in the larger hole and your thumb goes in the smaller hole when you're holding it you want to make sure that the logo is down towards the cap you open it up by you know doing this uh here like like a normal scissors would and you take the cap of the cigar and put it into the opening making sure the logo is towards the cap now you can make sure exactly how much you're cutting off very cool thing about this specific cutter is you can see exactly how much you want to cut off and so you put it into the opening and what i found is that if you actually push against that cap just a little bit as you're cutting you get a much cleaner cut not too much because you'll you'll bust the wrapper but it just a little bit as you're cutting through so you put it in make sure you have just exactly how much you want and then you cut through all right so i thought we'd go through some quick um ideas about whether this is a portable cigar cutter or not and while i was able to carry it around in my pockets um three of them my front pocket my back pocket uh and my i wear cargo shorts a lot so uh my side pockets um it's definitely something that's fairly uncomfortable when you're walking around you don't um there's never a time in whence you don't really know that it's not there it's definitely heavier than your normal um you know smaller cuddle cutter for sure and also obviously with the footprint it's obviously a little bit more uh problematic in terms of carrying it around with your front pocket especially i put it in my back pocket a lot with my phone and there was no issue there until i sat down somewhere i had to take it out and put it into another pocket because it's just uncomfortable um but you really it's definitely portable you can definitely carry it around but in terms of having a bag or a travel humidor of some sort um you can definitely use that um to your advantage having that that extra space your advantage to be able to carry this around for the most part i carried around this this around in my bag uh with my computer camera and that kind of thing and it worked like a charm never had any issues whatsoever easy to take out and easy to find so there's that it is light uh it is um definitely thin but in terms of a portable cutter i definitely would not buy this as a just as a cigar cutter either going to carry around um for no other reason than to carry it around your pocket so i thought we'd go through some good things and some bad things about the donetsys big cut cutter it's definitely got some really really great advantages and after using it for about a month on every cigar that i reviewed um i can tell you that um there's definitely some some great things about it and some things that i wish were not you know were not necessarily the case uh real quick the first really great thing is the fact that it works like a charm and it's easy to use so when you're actually picking it up and using it it works just like a pair of scissors as we mentioned before and so if you can use a pair of scissors you can use this cutter the blades are sharp the blades you know 95 of the time i had no issues with um with cuts on cigars it definitely cuts torpedoes a little bit better in terms of how you're actually cutting it and how how the cuts come out uh but in terms of you know any any anything that i threw at it it basically was able to handle with no problems whatsoever um the balance on this is excellent um when you first time you pick it up you really realize that um it's very very well balanced it's not going to go forward on you or anything or back on you depending on where you're holding it and that really helps when you're actually cutting cigars to make sure that the you know where you want to put it is actually where it goes it's definitely well designed i love the look of it i love you know how it feels in your hand when you're actually using it and that goes along with the actual uh design of the finger holes as well you have no idea no problem knowing exactly where to put them and how to use it you pick it up you cut a cigar you put it down it really is very user friendly also the actual price of the cutter comes with this nice leather sheath that fits the actual blade blades cutter uh like a glove it basically fits in there it is not any more thick than the actual cutter itself no more thicker than it has to be they could have used this they could have made this quite a bit thicker and they didn't so it's very nice in terms of that very easy to carry around very high quality and it really protects the cutter very very well also you can actually put this in either way and it fits one way fits better but you can actually put it in either way so you don't have to worry about when you put it in which way you put it in necessarily now some not so great things about it number one is obviously the price um 162 is a lot of money and um definitely it's it's it's worth that in terms of what you're getting with the quality of the materials and how easy it is to use and the you know the the craftsmanship um but it's definitely still a lot of money especially for a cutter that you're not necessarily going to carry around as much as a smaller cutter and that's the second thing that i wish wasn't necessarily the case is the fact that it's just not easy to carry around last thing that i really wish was not the case is the fact that it's really easy to it's really it's a dust magnet it's a it's a magnet for um fingerprints things of that nature and so when you're looking at it you can absolutely see how the dust and everything settles on there and it's very easy to see you know fingerprints uh it's easy to wipe off as well and this probably is only for um i would imagine only for uh finishes like this one the the actual um uh mirror finish um but it's very very obvious when you pick it up that the dust is all over it um you can clean it off very easily but just be aware of that uh if you're showing it off or something that maybe you want to wipe it down first so after all of this everything is said can i recommend the donatus big cut cigar scissors the answer is yes it looks great it works great it cuts cigars very very well it's sharp it definitely is built to last made of quality materials um there are a few issues number one the price and number two uh it's not easy to carry around but in terms of how it looks how it works and whether it actually will cut cigars well over and over again the answer is absolutely this is a perfect cutter for something like a table or or something like uh you know when you have a group of friends around and or even a store of some sort um although i definitely chained it to make sure it didn't walk away but in terms of the actual um value for the money i would say that it's definitely there if you're looking for a pair of cigar scissors that are well built sharp and actually cut cigars very very well and is easy to use i would say that you just can't go wrong with this one so for

[Music] yes people it's finally time again for a review video about an accessory it's been a while this time is very very special sorry for the noise very special cutter you've never seen something like this before but it's now my daily use cutter and just so people don't think I'm when it's positive about it I'm not promoting it because I'm not selling it at the store nothing like that this is just my honest opinion about discover I wanted to do a video way earlier so it would have been the first time using the cutter in this video but okay the guys no because of buying the store moving everything it's it just didn't happen but I started to use the cutter so this video will be my really honest opinion about this cutter using it in real life they in day out ok let me show you the cutter tell you a little bit more about the brand heads up I can't pronounce the name of the brand so that would be interesting ok let me show you the cutter so here it is as you can see this is a very very strange design don't think I've seen it before you can see the marks because I truly use the cutter so it's like a scissor but differently you can see when you open it it opens like this so even the the form gets even stranger no as you can see of course you can put a cigar here and because of this yeah very fluent motion sideways it sort of cuts it like a knife as you can see the good thing about this well I think so I don't know for sure that's the reason they did it but because I haven't really spoken to the guys it's just me and the cutter I think it's because in this way of cutting us you're not really putting pressure on the cigar because let's be honest with a normal straight cutter or with a fika there's always that that strong pressure point and you smash the cutter down you've got the cigar in this case that doesn't work if you cut it really fast you you will actually damage the cigar so in this case you can it's better if you cut it very slow because it really yeah it goes in like a knife okay let me show you what I mean by cutting this part goes the for my excuse the paragraphs maduro number one okay let me see to do is in front of the camera because I'll probably screw it up looking through the visor as you can see very nice straight clean cuts let's be honest guys this is a very nice very nice cut you see I cut off a little bit too much that was my problem was my fault because I was looking for the the camera but as you can see very very nice clean cut and this is a good thing about it if you really if you really smash it down you will definitely hurt the cigar and I think so if I look at all the screws here you can take it off you can sharpen it very easy if you have to write to the two threads because with most of the other cutters you can't just open it up a lot of the colors have Springs how it works and this is simple as can be there are no Springs or no mechanism nothing at all just three screws and that's it so I think it's very very easy to maintain to sharpen if this works so I used it in la casa I used to cut the cigars for a lot of the customers so I've already I added a couple of weeks I think I've done over a couple of hundred to three hundred cigars with it yes it's losing a little bit of the sharpness I'm noticing that but as I said if you're handy you can definitely sharpen yourself I can't so I've looked for so many but if you're a little bit any this will work seriously this will work so the brand name is dude duccini duccini like I said I'm probably pronouncing this completely wrong it's an Italian company it's a like a very old company from 1896 they make knives all knives and I believe some very sharp scissors a couple of three years ago or I'm not sure about that date but it's been took over by Fox the Fox so a while back Fox knives has bought the name of this company I believe they still make these cigars in Italy nothing has changed about that cigars discusses most of the things that they do are nice I will put their name and everything in the link in my bio so you can check them out like I said it's not sponsored it's not something I sell here in the store it's an honest opinion like I always do the price well the price is around the 55 euros so that's I think personally a very very decent price for this cutter it works well it looks looks strange it's a good conversation piece we go to a cigar lounge trust me everybody wants to see it they put in very nice the number on it you can even put your logo I've seen one on Instagram of somebody with this with this Instagram profile picture thing logo put on the knife saw this on the cutter knife cutter yeah so they do the extra mouth it's very nice to see this and I will probably contact the people because cut like this I personally want to sell it here in the store I think it's a very good product I believe in it I've used it as you can see very nice clean cuts no problem at all this is this is a good this is a good article price money the the price quality wise very good very good yeah that's it I would say to the guys who make this keep on making them very nice product and let me know let me know the next product you want me to review I've got some special DuPont things here I got a lot of stuff and the really stuff a lot of stick totally agree let me know one of the brands that you really want me to make a video about and now all I will do that thank you very much [ __ ] and smoke on don't forget to Like and subscribe smoke on people", "BP2tKpLzAwA": "hello and welcome to my channel my name is usman today I'm gonna be talking about V cutters for cigars and why I'm not particularly a fan now I know that a lot of cigar smokers love V cutters a lot of cigar smokers swear by them that's the only kind of cutter that they want to use but personally I'm not found in fact I really really dislike V cutters now I bought my V cutter I've got the colibri one which I bought from the seagulls website I saved up like a bunch of point and then I decided to buy one of these because I wanted to see what it was all about and honestly I'm just not getting on with it I mean don't get me wrong it's not anything to do with Calibri themselves I mean I think clearly make fantastic products it's just this style of cutter I'm not a fan of and in this video I'm gonna give three reasons why I want to say I hate I hate V cutters so the first reason is the draw now I've been using this for a couple of months now and I've been using it on every other cigar I smoked quite regularly so that's a lot of cigars and honestly every time I use this V cutter the draw is never quite as comfortable as what I get with a straight cutter I enjoy the draw that I get with the straight cutting it just feels more comfortable feels more free this it just feels a bit restrictive and if I've only done a single cut then the edges a little bit sharp so it doesn't feel that comfortable in the mouth and if you do like multiple cuts on a cigar then it feels a bit bumpy it's just overall not a great experience and the draw is Network it Mike spins anyway it's just never comfortable and it's just never as free as walk a straight cutter ease so that is quite a big reason for me obviously you want a good draw from your cigar and if your cut is not doing it for you then the cut is not the one for you the second reason is that this really isn't a flexible cutter now if you've got a standard cylindrical pair a whole shape cigar then this might be OK for you however if you've got any other shape like a pyramid or a Figueredo order or a solid moans or a deer Dharma then this really isn't that great I mean sure you can use it on a Figueredo order you know pyramid shape cigar and you can get away with it but honestly it's not ideal a straight cutter just does a much better job of being a more flexible cutter across the board and this you know when you if you got anything other than a prayer hole then it's not that great and I really enjoy Purim eat cigars a lot of my cigars are not standard pray hole shaped cigars a lot of my cigars are pyramids and Solomon's and deer Dharma so this isn't really ideal for the kind of cigars that I generally enjoy and the final reason why I don't like VIII cutters is admittedly quite silly like it's pretty silly but when you use a V cutter on a heavy ring gauge cigar or heavier I should say like this Trinidad v here it's got a ring gauge of 54 I mean this is already pretty phallic in shape and size and when you put a v cut on the top of it what does that look like I mean it's time to look pretty one eyes doesn't do and honestly I really don't want to put that in my mouth I know that's childish I know that's really silly but that's just that's just what it is you know that's how I feel I'm being completely immature about it I get it but those are three reasons or two reasons and one very same reason as to why I don't like using v cutters so there you have it I mean I'm not gonna return this I'm probably gonna keep it in fact actually I'm not gonna keep it what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do a giveaway so I'll leave some instructions below in my description or something I'll come up with some way or some reason how people can can enter but yeah I'll give this V cutter away so hopefully someone can use it and make use

Colibri Slice Double Blade Cigar Cutter", "x8_HHPD8-E8": "okay Tony was illegal cigar aficionados here again you know after I put the little blurb on YouTube about the the guillotine and logistical you know just a little joke thing and I put out there I got overwhelmed with with probably 40 to 50 emails asking me questions about the guillotine you know where could this be bought you know how to make one etc etc so well so what I decided to do is just take another video out here and let you see that here you know because some questions were were given to me about different cigar cutters you know what's the best one to use you know what price ranges except except their number one I'm not an expert when I need expert advice I call it my friend or go see my friend Billy O'Hare at Jack Swartz importers in Chicago on the first floor of the Chicago Board of Trade Billy is my Yoda my cigar Yoda he knows everything cigar period so he's my go-to guy maybe you have one okay but this is what I can quickly tell you about cigar cutters quick history you don't hear about them or read about them in history till about 1859 when a guy in Germany named Frederick Wilhelm Fair art wrote about one that he had seen he was a hobbyist of cigars and he saw one that was shaped like a knife and on the end of the knife it had a spring loaded I am assuming a punch or maybe Abby's shape type I don't know but before that there is no history at all you know and before that people either cut it with a knife you know a nice straight bladed knife like this one right here probably not as fancy as this one here but a sharp knife will cut you a nice opening and you can smoke through cigar yeah and before the using knives people just been a month because they didn't have the pretty wrapper on the outside the torch the doors of the day especially the ones in Cuba called this wrapper just a dress on a pretty pretty woman or maybe another woman depending on the cigar okay or maybe depending on your taste for women okay so anyway after that came along the guillotine style and they come in different shapes and sizes you know this one here is a double bladed guillotine that you come in single this is about a 52 gauge and it's made out of stainless steel you know it's a very good one and then there's this type here with the back on it for people that are kind of stupid and want to run their cigars all the way through the type I just showed you it's got to stop in it so you can't mess up your cigar and then there's ones like this that are like the biggest waste of money in the world this has three blades and operate like a camera aperture an iris right it just shuts all at one time and it's supposed to give you the perfect cut for me this was the biggest waste of money that I'd ever spent on anything cigar related first of all it doesn't cut very good it always leaves ragged edges or pieces of the cigar get caught up in it you got to pull away not you're unwrapping your cigar the other thing is is if you got hands like mine this size right here it tears up my hands every time I use it I can I thought I'm gonna come again so this is a terrible waste of 30 bucks or whatever it is I paid for it all right and then there's punches you know people use the punches on the end on there I don't use punches and I don't use the B type either so I can't say much about them because I don't like the concentration of tar and nicotine and the hot smoke coming all down to me because it gets all gooey on the end that's like this is nasty to me you know I don't enjoy and if I can't enjoy it I don't want to smoke it no back to your main question after I said all that I'm gonna bring this out here to you this is what the superstar of this video is about right here is this this guillotine this is not a toy I don't know where you can buy it right off the bat I'll just tell you a quick history on how it came in my possession I have a friend that has a cigar shop somebody walked into his place the manufacturer or the designer the inventor of this thing walked in his shop about 30 to 35 years ago and wanted to leave it there as a display for people to take orders and he took him I think he made like four or five from what I understand took him to different parts around the country left him there unfortunately for the guy he couldn't get anybody to underwrite his insurance because of a liability issue and this will kind of give you an idea why it's a liability it's serious it's not a toy for real and it will cut off a finger as a matter of fact someone understand my buddy had it there is a shop somebody almost cut their finger and it's a liability issues he took it down 30 years ago and stuck it in the back of his shop and I was very very said one day to walk in when he was cleaning things out and said hey that probably looked good on your bar so I was fortunate I don't know what it cost back then but with the engineering that is in this thing I'm gonna try to get you to see it but I mean the Loretto the Oak Park isn't would be the easiest part at least for me but the brass mechanisms that are inside of this these things are all machine and there are several components that come together like a puzzle to make this thing work the reliefs here the spring-loaded release is is awesome it's getting back inside of here and it's just it's just a great piece of engineering I am guessing I am guessing that if you had to buy this today it probably cost you around anywhere from 800 maybe up to $1100 for something like this because once again it's not a toy it it gives it a great cut I don't use it everyday you know because I got to pull it out to do it and it's not really messy per se but unlike a cutter you can hold it over an ashtray you've got to be able to you know clean up your mess and so I try to get away from it I have no idea where you can find it I don't even know if any more of these exist maybe if you do you can email me or put something out here on YouTube telling other people were to find these at but if for nothing else it's it's it's pretty cool you know but I love it and especially when we have our Liga cigar fishing parties you know people come out and they use this thing so if you can find one let me know where you can get it at if you'd like to have some pictures just email me I'd be happy to send you pictures I'll take it as detail you want to try to put one together but until then you just keep smoking", "5E8C9vzesCU": "Single Blade V Cutter.

It provides the ultimate in degree of control over the blades\nand a nice clean cut if you know how to do it. I personally use a scissors\nto trim my cigar or even cut off the end if I'm going inside. You know\nif you live in the north or any other cold climate like I do, sometimes you\ndon't have enough time to finish that entire cigar before you\nhave to go back inside. The trick to using a scissors is to\npress down on the cigar as you're cutting with the scissor. So you press this\ndirection as you cut. And the reason for that is the scissor action wants\nto move the blades away from that the material you're cutting, and by\npressing down, you get a nice clean cut. The other reason one might use a scissor\nis to clean their cut. I have a little lip of cap right there and\nit's very easy to clean that away with a scissors, or to recut it altogether. Remember,\nI'm pressing down slightly as I cut and it gives me a nice clean cut. Then finally, remembering that I live\nin Kansas and it's cold in the winter, I'm outdoors smoking my cigar.\nTime to go in for dinner. I can use the scissors to cut off the\nend of a cigar that I may not want to throw out and thus I have a nice\nclean cut for when I'm ready to pick it back up later.

100 today we have two stainless steel wool scarf cutter a guillotine style made by maksim so these are stainless steel double guillotine cutter blades says they're perfect for robusto and churchill cigars so I think that I have a few stars here and I think up to maybe a 40 or 50 games about is going to be the limitations of these cutters out of 60 so if you're spending 40 to 40 to 50 range I should just find when you order to say they will come with two of these guillotine style cutters so that's one for you one for a friend or I have some cutters that I keep around the house you can never have enough one in the car and one in the house one in the office one of the golf bag so by a few July him these automatic thing was still a pretty good weight not the heaviest but definitely not the lightest you know the action and opening the cutter to it searchers ago are pretty food action good enough weight where it doesn't buckle all the pressure and we will find out how sharp they are here in a few seconds when they're right I cut this cigar but likely there are two because there was no you lose one but you have one a fallback on the construction all needed is that it's pretty good the stainless steel the sliding action or gets to open for deity and close it it's fairly smooth okay so now the moment you've been waiting for why because I'm a serious reviewer and I take pride my work I'm going to sacrifice one of my very own studies this one's hand rolled I'm going to use said cutter and we're going to go ahead and show you how this cuts and then I'd like you to show you how I smoke it that's a whole nother review wink wink wink anyways here we go so I said accidents pretty smooth you'll insert cigar and we'll see how drive it cigar is not dry at all very good cut you see this very smooth on the side clean-cut put this down and we have the other end so for all you cigar connoisseurs out there typically if your cigars dry that's what it cracked or your cutters interior you'd have breaking in the leaf so we have none of that so I would say that this cutter does pass the test gets my seal of approval I highly recommend you get a few like we see like this

know to that yeah the V Cano has been a kind of speeding around for a very long time and the inexpensive ones mike do you hear that do the v code on the Torp you okay my tell them if you want to off-camera why why it is that Mike seriously has kind of revolutionized the V cutter in terms of promoting it we had a V cutter here that was like on the table that was a table v cutter that they literally literally got worn down I mean to the nub almost it was so overused people really love it Mike's gonna bring in right now this is one of our this is one of our earliest cutters that we ever had here this is from a company called Boston cigar cutter company I believe they're still in existence they are not cheap this unit itself runs probably the five hundred dollar range four to five hundred dollars or even more now how much more would you say 15 750 the thing about this cutter I'll take it apart so you can see it as well it has a very nice that's pretty clean from last Sunday it has a nice nice mechanism in it that when you put the cigar on the top all you do is simply push it down and drag the wheel to not drag gently pull the wheel down and it cuts this v cut out but this thing is remarkable i mean this thing its domain in in West Newbury Massachusetts they're still made here in the United States I'm not sure what the wood is it probably is like a walnut or something like that but they do make a pocket one I remember when we had that the last time it was about a hundred eighty dollars which was too pricey for the style of cutter that they had at that time but when I go to the retail show in July it's one of those things I'm always interested in looking at it what are some new cutters but might literally kind of you know promoted single-handedly promoted the V cutter to wear a lot of people use it now and might tell them why it is that you like the because you're really a big fan of it I've only used a few times but why is it what do you like about the be cut compared to straight or bullet when I was in at the kamacho factory I was smoking a villa cosa or torpedo and I was using a guilty right in one of the master rollers down there actually pulled out his be cutter and showed me his Vika and explain why he uses a vegan of belicoso because all cigars are roll with a center flute and if you cut too far down on a belicoso you can brush that flute but if you use a v cut it opens up the flu so that you have a better draw and what do you mean by a center flute all cigars basically have a center flute so like a center core center cookin like a strong in the right basically which helps funnel the heat smoke up and down and most people on a guilty cut the tip too far down so they crushed that flute and the only other way to smoke a bellicose Oh is on the flat surface to do a bullet cut right but most people can't stick the cigar at that far into their mouth in its a variant for me a very unusual and uncomfortable way to smoke it it gives the smoke directly goes in different palate and some cigars are very spicy and it gets a little hot interesting now that so what you would recommend is doing we've got a cigar here it's the Florida Oliva and but Mike is saying is normally and the way that I've seen people do it incorrectly is where they'll take a straight cut like this when I cut a you know back in the day I remember we said guys come in here and they do lectures and say oh you should cut it like at a 45 degree angle or on the bias with the x axis and the Z and then calibrated ratio to the Sun and the thing is ninety-nine percent of your guys are going to come in here they're not interested in even listening to that let alone doing it so what I always tell guys is start and cut as little as possible right but most people cut it down they I have a guy that comes in at least one once it once a week I can I think you know I'm not going to say his name but i think you know his cigar i'm just gonna say he smokes Maduro caos and I will watch him cut it and he will cut the cigar right here every time and I look at and I think to myself why are you even buying a belicoso at that point you're completely defeating the purpose the idea of having that pyramid like shape or we're going into a cone is that you are like as my excited you're funneling more of the smoke the flavor into a narrower area area and people ask me when when they look at cigars as an example like I'll just take a Liva the aleve of V has I don't know how many different sizes in that range we say eight different ones at least something like that eight to ten eight to ten and people look at I said it's the same tobacco all the way through but the amount of tobacco that they put in lengthwise and the amount of tobacco that they bundle will give each cigar a unique taste and yeah I know you and I always talk about the illusion we like the 68 in the 88 which is one of the first things we talked about same tobacco but we just like a different size so let's go ahead why don't you do the honors of cutting it with the V cutter I'm kind of showing everybody what that looks like firstly as I said you put the tip to you can't put it in any further cut it off and the thing that's really cool is it's almost like it's I don't wanna say it's idiot-proof because anything and you have can get crushed but the thing is with any cutter doing something some people try to go really really slow some people try to go too fast and then kind of jerk it it's somewhere in between it's a positive clip and it's just one of those things with time people get used to it they know how to do it it does a really good job I mean it's one of those things this is by the way the psyche are one I believe it's just the Luminum I don't think it's titanium I think it's aluminum but they come in it's really cool their anodized they have all different colors this is an anodized blue I think we have a black I know that there's a silver gun metal they make a great product and this one is pretty reasonable too i want to say it's something about what thirty dollars something like that it's on there I don't think this one someone's lacks a price but they're not expensive and they like everything else it's got that lifetime warranty so it's a really cool product I don't know if we have any other of the other v's but it's one of those other cut it's just a great cutter I think the other one since you kind of touched on if you want to do bullet cuts right now i'll show you one of the earliest bullet cuts that i ever saw this literally is a bullet and the company making it they made this a long time ago i don't know if it has this actually just as forming 244 Remington mag so it is from a you know real shell casing if you will obviously it's you know not a real bullet but this one the idea was that you would take the cigar and well here I'll do it on the one that hasn't been cut here so you'll take it and as you put it to the cigar you would twist it the problem with this old one is and you can't see it but is a role piece of metal so it's not a single piece I mean it's a single piece but there is an edge the problem was if you did it the wrong way it would catch and tear the cigar so you always had look at it and kind of make sure that you weren't tearing into the cigar and as you did it you had to turn it one way and eventually you could pull it out and it would take a plug out of the scarf the problem with this was is that then after you cut several cigars how do you get the tobacco out the only way you could do was to stick something like a pencil in there or you go old school style pull the whole thing out dump it squeeze the unit back and then make sure it went in place without cutting yourself again and if you push it on a table enough time it would get dull this was this was back in the day when you could carry these on the airplane you can imagine this day and age carrying this on an airplane would not good yeah he's got a connect sagging that you tackled the strip search but that was really the first one that we had here in the shop John have you ever had an expert do you like the bullet cut at all I never use them now we're done I don't know only because that reason I mentioned before is the tower buildup and that's just a personal preference that I have no I don't really use bullet cut the full of punches at all but they do have their place in and people are using that's all I use them for is just to every cigar they spoke and always do a bullet punch but personally it's not my sort of thing but very popular this was another one that we carried years ago to this one kind of took care of the idea of having it but it had some other drawbacks too and I'll just cut the same thing same kind of idea but a big a bigger bullet cut you push it in and it takes a bigger chunk out and then kind of crack cuz I've already cut it once and then it had this extractor the problem with this one was that it had this well if you put it in your pocket the cap would inevitably fall off you I mean if this one is so weak this has got to be 15 plus years old it's very very old this is kind of one Mike brought this up this is a disposable one this has a very tiny hole so if you're doing something like a ring gauge that's under 40 this would work and they're not very expensive this one is essentially disposable you're not going to sharp it up again but that those are kind of cool then ah though came out with one of the kind of the top-of-the-line ones where it was a very smooth operation this one has been you know it was in my pocket for years and they they came in a gold and a silver and a kind of a gunmetal a great cutter though the thing is still super sharp and all I'll do is just I'm going to cut into the side here which obviously you would never do unless you're making a flute but you cut in here to the side and you can see when you cut in here I don't know if it'll come out because it's not really the cap but it does the same thing where it pulls a little plug out and then the extractor is just you twisting and it pops right out I've never had any issue with this thing opening in my pocket some of the lesser quality ones people would have an issue where they put in their pocket and over time it would kind of unscrew and it would be rubbing against metal in the pocket that wasn't a very good idea since then other companies have come out with some really nice ones like zai car of course as we keep going back to we like their product because they they work this is 30 bucks but this one is just a beast you pull it out and it has a very large ring gauge and then you can close it simply by pushing it together and it extracts the bit of tobacco there and then this is one of the newer ones and this one's kind of interesting this has a twist punch is what they call this this one is huge but it has almost like a set of ball bearings that when you click it kind of clicked something yeah ratchet is a perfect way to describe it it's got a huge hooters yeah like a lipstick it's got a huge hug but this thing it feel how heavy that is now that is sala de I really shoe heavy for me I would not carry that in my pocket only because it is so heavy but it would be cool to put that on a golf bag cause it's got the key ring some place where you're not going to lose all it is quite heavy i just want to i want to give a bit of a plug for psycho as well i think we're pretty lucky to have a company like this I car is very committed to cigar smoking and their products the R&D department really do a great job that it's it's engineered very well the quality and plus their lifetime warranty it's a it's a relief to have a company whose very committed because we've had sometimes been in the past we've had a lot of products come in and out and but we've never had a company just really over engineered their products and took care of you if it did happen to have apparently it's so we're very proud to be a stockist of zokar also while we do carry a lot of the range that they do make here in the store but there is a lot of products that we cannot carry every product but we can order any product of that you wish from zaika and have it in the shop here to limit so you're very pretty happy with these products I think it goes right there there you go are you out Joe all right all right Yankee Joe's out of the house oh that's what I was going to do next that's my next show my personal one well that takes us to we've covered the straight cut we've covered you your bullet cuts weave cover you know the psyche are the newer style of cutters but what we haven't done is covered the scissor cut listen this is a cut but you think that's right where do we have bounces yeah you have that says what I've noticed this the scissor cut here is more what you see in somebody's den or some restaurant yeah or a restaurant or you would have a cutter at a say restaurant where you can smoke and the waiter would cut your cigar for you and you sir that would carry one of these because they're very elegant it's quite a good-looking car demand and this cut quite well the reason I like these they give you a lot of control especially if you were a newer person people are like John said you're not going to carry this in your pocket because it is so unwieldy but it does allow you to have tremendous amount of control you can go slower with it it will still cut very well if they make an excellent product and yeah we can show with this particular cigar so if you cut with it you can see how you can just get right where you will need it to cut your hands not going to shake as much as if you're using something like as I car works like a spring-loaded device and it allows you to just remove the cap and it really does it does do a good job I've not familiar with this particular one where do we get that one from the one I really like is no it's sounds like we're companies I car but we are this is my personal one with a little pickpocket device here as they call we're just hangs on your pocket the reason I like this one though it is folding to collapsible one and I carried this for many years in my in my pocket but the thing that's nice about this one it also comes with some tools which a lot of people look and they're not really sure what they are they come with things like a little flathead it comes with this little point where people say oh is that for your cigar to poke a hole and I said you could use it but typically what this is for is to drain out your lighter that's one of the things that people don't normally do we'll talk about that when we get to lighters but every so often you'll get a bubble in your lighter line and it will cause the lighter to sputter by draining it out then refilling it with your butane it allowed to perform a lot better it also comes with some other little tools as well like a little bottle opener this little kind of Dimmick device but this is a full-size scissors you can see the difference between this one and the other one this one opens up to a much larger ring gauge and even though it doesn't seem like it would be as large as that when my fingers fit a lot nicer a lot easier into this unit and let's see so we'll use this one right here and you can see it's the same kind of idea I have more control over this because it's my own personal one and it just cuts off just the cap as you can see that's all you want to cut off is the cap that's on the top of the cigar you don't want to cut too far down the big cardinal sin as we as we saw before are these people who do this incorrect cut which is sacrilege I'm going to do it here and they'll do this and they'll cut not only you can see a couple things that just occurred one the cigar exploded to its starting to unravel because I've cut too far down and that's the danger when cutting any cigar typically being a belicoso being a pyramid be it something that's like a straight you know Churchill size cigar it's one of those things where people will get overly ambitious in their cigar cutting but the scissor cutter can take care of that these are great and I think they're I think they're $30 something like that and they are a great unit once you learn how to work with them they are they disappear in the pocket because even though they look larger they're very they're flat they don't take a lot of space up and it's a great product I really like it i've turned people kind of onto it the way i discovered we weren't carrying them in the store I wanted to check one out so I ordered one from a company and it came in and I've been a fan ever since might just hand me this one this is kind of the extreme version this is something from zai car this is they're really expensive I think that's probably one of their top of the line units here it's about three hundred fifty dollars like why is it so expensive what item is it it's a silver wanna see a titanium metal silver it and it's the same price point as your cutter that you got at 250 so the price has gone up oh my gosh so mind is no longer 250 its 350 I guess I got in that the ground floor while the gettin was good so I think that pretty much covers it but if you do have any questions of course you can send us an email at info at Liberty tobacco calm you can address it to either myself Ben or two Aussie John or to Mike Gallagher here at the shop and any of us can answer a question if it's on facebook which is really easy way you can of course leave comments down below I'm post it up there or messages you can also i'll put it up on the liberty page Liberty tobacco on YouTube you don't have a lot of people go to go to our youtube site for liberty tobacco as compared to our Facebook page people really like the Facebook page because we'll do things like run special Facebook only offers and so I encourage people to go out there and like our page and if you can you check out our website it's not a full website that you would expect from a store like you know juniors tobacco or something like that we are a we're too small shops here in San Diego up in the North County and down where we are in the kearny mesa area but I think what people if you've watched the other videos you know that this is a shop that is like cheers where you know it's very personal people know you so people have a question about cutters and lighters almost anybody in the shop being a customer or any one of the employees would be happy of course to answer the questions quite been great segment and we learn quite a lot of doubts cutters and well what we think and thanks for watching and keep this a ghastly keep the shiny side up and as I say yeah I guess that's it so thank you once again for watching", "dawDEDaeG1U": "hello this is Brooks Whittington with half wheel comm today we're taking a look at the Palio tabletop cutter now this is a retail cutter made for retails shops that has four different blades in it four different cutters and it's two straight into V cuts of different sizes this was introduced at the 2017 IPC PR show but did not actually ship to retailers until 2018 only comes in this one matte black color which has a little bit of a minor issue but we get to in a minute but it costs one hundred and fifty dollars retail and it is a three point six pound cutter very very heavy the idea on this is that you do have these options here these four options to cut cigars and so you can have all of the different people who come in here and want two different sizes and different cuts and different depths can actually have what they want in one different cutter now I'm in one same cutter now I have used this cutter for a little more than a month on every review that I did and I can tell you safely that this is essentially one of the best retail cutters that I've ever seen and ever used it's heavy its well-made it's extremely easy to use you just push down on this lever here and cut the cigars there are some issues we'll get to in a minute but first I want to show you that another advantages that this cutter specifically this huge reservoir in the back here and the bottom sorry that actually cook it carries all of it all of the debris very easy to clean out you just dump it out and very very very large which means you don't have to clean it out every 15 minutes it's going to last for a little while also these little nubs here they have rubber on them and it means that that combined with the 3.6 pound weight means that if you try to push on it it actually is very difficult to actually push it's not going to go anywhere unless somebody picks it up basically so wonderful wonderful cutter advantages to this cutter are numerous the biggest one is the really great options that you have the number of options you have there's four cutters on here the two straight cuts the largest cut is a sixty ring gauge and the smallest cut is a fifty-two ring gauge while the largest V cut on this is a 58 and the smallest is at 52 and basically what it means is that you can get any number of depths or sizes or amounts that you want to cut off on this width just by using the different ones you wanted a little bit of a deeper cut for the V cut you go with the largest one you want to go a little bit deeper or cut on the straight cut you go with the largest one or you know vice versa so you want something that's a little bit more shallow on both of those you go with this [ __ ] more you know more shallow the more the smaller cuts on both of those this works extremely well and is very very very good it does have some minor issues that we'll get to but for the most part this thing is built like a tank the blades are sharp I had no issues using it whatsoever except for the fact that I had to carry it around which you won't be doing most likely so let's get to some cigars cut and let's see how it works as I mentioned you basically just cut you just push down on this lever here it's a very simple process it does take a little bit of getting used to because it is you're pushing for four blades down but in terms of actually using it it's very very simple you can have any number of different options when it comes to cutting cigars one of the major major great things about this cigar advantages about this cutter is the idea that you have all of these options so let's say you have a sixty ring gage here and you want to cut this thing a straight cut okay well you can basically put this in the largest straight cut you push down firmly cuts through and you have yourself a very very nice straight cut that you can see no issues whatsoever on that very easy to get a very nice cut let's say you want to torpedo I prefer my torpedoes typically to be a V cut but I prefer a little bit of a deeper cut so let's put this in the largest V cut push down firmly come out and you have yourself the same straight ez cut that is easy to see that you have no issues there when it comes to actually having a very very nice clean blade cut so you have that let's say you have something smaller though you want something a little bit smaller how about a basically a 40 let's call it a 44 ring gauge you'd go with a little bit smaller one let's do the straight cut on that little straight cut on the small and we push down and you have yourself a relatively clean cut and you can easily see that there's no issues with any of that and then when you want to clean it out you just turn it over pull this thing out dump it you do have to go straight down pretty much straight up and down and you have yourself all of that which you get rid of very easily push this back and then put it back down and you have yourself it's ready to go again easy to use very very very clean cuts for the most part there are a couple of disadvantages a couple of problems very minor in this grand scheme of things one of them is the fact that this this does not have a an attachment of any sort so that a chain can be attached to it for a retail shop it really should have one so people don't just walk off with it it is heavy but you just never know and it really should have something if it's a retail cutter which it is built for retail then it should have something like that the other minor issue is the fact that this matte black color definitely shows fingerprints and things of that nature and it's something that is not it's not chipping or anything the paint's not coming off but it definitely shows a little bit of the the marks and imperfections in that when you you know scratch it up a little bit it'll it'll definitely show other than that this is essentially one of the best retail cutters that I've seen and used and any retail shop would would probably love to have it and if you have a retail shop and you need a cutter like this this is probably the one that you want to buy so for half wheel comm any other reviews news for cigars related go to half wheel calm and check it out you", "xARiChdjYwM": "today at Tru tobacco calm we're going to talk about something most cigar smokers forget about cigar cutter maintenance I cut a lot of cigars at the office between the cigars I enjoy on a regular basis and all the samples I'm expected to smoke my cutter as I car xi2 gets quite a workout I like this I car in particular because of its hard ultra sharp blades they cut clean and it takes a long time for them to dull about two weeks ago though I noticed the heads on my cigars seem to be shredded a little more than usual after clipping I also noticed an excessive amount of tar on the cutter blades some of the oils from the tobacco's are left behind on your cutter each time you cut a cigar therefore if you use the same cutter day after day as I do with my office cigar cutter eventually the oils begin to build up and stain the cutter it's a telltale sign that your cutter needs to be cleaned regardless of how sharp the blades are any additional interference is bound to hamper the neatness of the cut the solution is simple rubbing alcohol cuts through tobacco oils like a hot knife through butter all you need is a cotton ball or swab dogged with rubbing alcohol apply it to the stains and they rub off like magic after doing this with my cutter voila it was cutting cleanly again regardless of what cigar cutter you use whether it costs 250 or 25 dollars you should clean your cutter at least once a month if you're a heavy cigar smoker cleaning it once every two weeks might be in order it becomes even more vital if you're a chewer and cut your cigars down as they get mushy the same rule applies if you use cigar scissors or a punch cutter regarding the ladder because punch cutters have a circular blade a buildup of tars on the edge may prevent you from making a clean punch and can even run the head altogether no matter how well you maintain your cutter eventually the blades are going to dull but for now don't be lazy and don't throw out your cutter just yet clean your cutter regularly and you'll find that it has a lot of life left in it remember at true tobacco calm you can get all your cigars and accessories at up to 80% off retail prices fast shipping and guaranteed satisfaction come with every order", "ZGqIisCbEeA":

couple minute review right in my shortest video I've ever made [Music] all right the other day I was on the cigar cartel which is a Facebook page someone had posted that they got a brand new cool cigar cutter cutter from napa auto parts and I had to have that so it gave me a part number I called my local napa they said they can get them in I'm in Northport Florida about an hour south of Tampa they're Atlanta hub had them and I ordered one in how cool is that looking like a couple of nuts nice Crow great great action I lit this cigar we're actually just finished up a cigar in the Month Club unboxing so I used it on this cigar and I just I put the cigar in there and just barely closed it it just just cut like a laser beam I love that you can spin it and then just a case you're wondering I do what everybody else does when they have a cutter like this you put your finger into it and then you give it a little bit of pressure you just want to see how that cuts will it cut me I don't think it will it will if I pressed any harder so yes I do that along with everybody else now I also found out that if you're a cool guy like me or you work at a shop and you have a tool guy Matt go Matt go tool makes one it's the exact same thing but it's branded Matt go Matt go also has a one of those cigar are those rocks glasses with a cigar notch built into it and they have a cigar ash tray as well so if you're digging on this one which you want like a hole Matt go matching set definitely look up the Matt go on I will leave in the show notes down below the description this isn't the show part number NCI GCT 20 this one cost me 20 $1.99 they charged me 9 99 to ship it and then there was a $2.00 and 23 cent tax which was 34 21 now someone did post up that they called their local napa and this is somewhere New Hampshire Maine wherever and they're no local Napa had them in stock so he was gonna run down after work and pick one up so he wouldn't have had to pay shipping he had just had to pay his tax so a great item I said not sponsored from Napa this is just a another great cutter that I am gonna put up here with all of the rest of my cutters and I need a new hook for it and super awesome super heavy solid metal it's probably one of the heaviest cutters that I have and I absolutely love it the features custom Napa heck shape chrome plated stainless steel length four by all right 28 was it 25 two and a half by I don't know tiny letters one-handed cutting function hits cigars up to sixty ring gauge so kind of weird NAPA Auto Parts has a cigar cutter especially in this day and age when it just seems like everybody's moving away from anything branded with smoking paraphernalia I remember way back in the day used to get the tires the rubber tires with the ashtray in it and everybody had everything for never cigars they were always cigarette uh paraphernalia so kind of cool props to Napa alright that's all I got it's a fantastic cutter if your deer head like me if you're a tool guy you've definitely got to pick one up I don't know if you can get them at Napa comm like I said I called I'll look it up but I said in the description I'll leave the part number if I I'll look up that part number if I can find the link like like Napa I'll put the direct link which will take you to the other part unfortunately the one thing I people did say when they Google that part a picture doesn't come up so I don't know if that's Google messing with smokers but whatever it's definitely cool you definitely gotta have one for this price if you're female watching this and you want to get it for your husband because he's a gearhead or if you're a dude watching this and we have several lady mechanics is that I feel like I feel like I shouldn't have said that I feel like someone's in its 20 20 someone's gonna call me out for saying lady mechanic and I'm mechanic say what I want I don't care Kevin from scar prop just buy this lighter and make sure you give your cigars

was so critical of it that I was asked not to air the video I'm not going to be anywhere is critical I like this cigar cutter this new cut this new cutter however is nothing like that color cutter and I really like this product the body is anodized aluminum the double blades are stainless steel the first thing that I like about this cutter is the design in reference to how its held and the grip it will not slip out of your hand and it's the perfect way to utilize this colored press the button and deploy and open it up the name mag pulse comes from how this cutter pops open it's not it there's no spring energy being released but the same poles of a magnet is pressed upon each other then pressing the button it bursts open the mag pulse has a four total these magnets are set to degrade at one percent every 100 years science big question is how does it cut again science so I have three different rain gauges starting out we have a 48 ring gauge we have 52 ring gauge give it another try there right one more try shaving a little bit off every time and that's good it's just difficult to do this behind the camera that's all alright let's look at that cut for good now the 54 ring gauge again it's not the cutter it's me being behind the camera it's kind of difficult and the cut is a little too deep my angles a little bit off however let's look at how good the cut is great cut right there smooth it's not raggedy excellent cut the price is around 150 dollars retail however you can find it now for 99.95 for some this may be pricey however this is the right price point with the quality that you're getting in materials used it has an original design and is a functional conversation piece thanks to scientists I'm Charles Wallingford and the mag pulse cigar cutter by screw pop is how I

What this hole does is allow just enough of\nthe cigar to fit inside so when you close it you get a perfect cut each time.

This is the Cuban Crafters Perfecto Cigar\nCutter in Black.", "ilNwGqhq7HA": "hey guys ed with redhorse knife works here for those of you don't know I am a knife maker by trade I've been doing it for seven years and we just released our new product seen here disassembled the BMF cutter I'm making this little video to kind of explain some terminology and manufacturing processes that warrant the cost of the BMF cutter versus the other cutters in the industry I know a lot of cigar fanatics aren't necessarily knife fanatics so again this is more of educational video on what makes the differences between the five-dollar gas station cutter the popular branded more expensive cutter which ranges from about fifty to three hundred fifty dollars to our cutter which is two hundred sixty-five dollars so I want to explain to you why that cost two hundred sixty five dollars and why you're getting a better cutter with the BMF cutter so first thing I want to talk about is steel obviously that's the heart and soul of the cutter and that's going to make all the difference in the world when you're cutting a cigar okay now on the $5 l Crapo free cutter this steel is probably it's definitely stamped and you can tell it's stamped because there's a rolled edge on one side and a sharp jagged edge on the other side if you could tell there it's very thin steel as well makes it easier to stamp easier and cheaper okay this steel from the manufacturer they claim is 440c steel a great steel in 1995 but over the years they have kind of developed better steels now this steel is bohler m390 main germany m390 this steel was specifically designed for the knife industry it's very expensive steel it's considered one of the most premium Steel's you could get in the market and has the best balance between corrosion resistance edge retention edge ability and toughness okay those are the aspects that you have to look at when you're looking for a knife blade okay so the other thing about Steel is the heat treat the heat treat is very important on steel you could have fantastic steel [ __ ] up the heat treat and it'll be worthless okay so we measure how hard a steel is and how successful the heat treat was by something called a rockwell hardness scale okay I have a rockwell hardness testing machine that is that doohickey there and that measures how hard a plate is goes on a hunter point scale so it's pretty easy to figure out now when I tested el cheapo I got a 40 rockwell which I'm actually surprised it actually was that high I was expecting low 20s maybe 30s because that's typically where the 400 series stainless is 40 rockwell not bad for $5 cutter on the $75 cutter which is what I paid for this cutter they claimed the factory claimed it was 57 Rockwell hardness now right then and there I'm not impressed 57 if any of my knives left the shop at 57 Rockwell I'd be embarrassed I would never release a knife from our shop at 57 Rockwell it's just not hard enough our blades are 60 Rockwell now I know what you guys are saying oh it's only a you know three point difference on a 60 point scale you know what's the big deal three points is a lot when you're talking about steel hardens okay that three points is the difference between lasting holding an edge for three to six months to holding an edge for ten years it's a massive difference three three points now that is if this cutter was truly 57 Rockwell now when I tested it the highest I got after three tests was 53 Rockwell that's that's preposterous that is unbelievably soft for a blade used to cut material and for what you pay for this cutter that is way below standard and and they keep advertising that it's 57 Rockwell which I wouldn't even be advertising that but they do anyway this was 53 that is a totally unacceptable I would never let anything other than maybe an axe or some sort of tool that takes high impact because you don't want that to be brittle I would never let anything like that leave the shop at 53 Rockwell poor quality control on these I tested ten of these and out of the 10 there was less than a half point deviation and that half point was only higher so we went from 60 Rockwell to 60 and a half Rockwell that is amazing accuracy for these blades so the heat treat is very important the next important thing about the cigar cutters and how they're going to perform is the blade grind okay if you look at the two blade grinds our cutter has a much larger or longer blade grind now the reason why we do that is because the steeper the angle is from here to here from the back of the bevel to the edge of the bevel the more resistance it's going to put up against your cigar tip and you're gonna end up deforming your cigar okay on a forty dollar cigar you do not want that tip [ __ ] up I'd be pissed okay now if you look at our cutter the distance between the final edge and the very back of the bevel is much larger that's because we use a much lower angle and that puts less resistance and less pressure up against your expensive cigar and that's also why we only need one blade these multi bladed cutters are just trying to compensate for crap design that's it it's just like the shaving razors that have like nine blades on it's because those blades are [ __ ] if you get a good straight razor or a good safety razor they all have one thing in common they have one blade and if you've ever shaved with a straight razor or ever shaved with a safety razor they cut much better because he use higher quality steel at a much better design so that is why we only have an only need one blade okay next thing I want to talk about is fit and finish and action is that is the next variant that determines how good your cigar cutter is going to work and also justifies what you're paying for so this cutter was a huge disappointment this was actually shipped to me with all the screws stripped out all the heads of the screws were stripped off I could not do I wanted to disassemble this knife for the video I could not every single one of them was stripped direct from the factory and the most important part which is the pivot right here that's just a rivet probably an aluminum rivet so I would have to drill that out andrey rivet it if I wanted to symbol this knife or this cutter very disappointing for $75 you should have some sort of pivot mechanism that is much stronger than rivet because eventually over time this rivet will loosen up with no way of you tighten it unless you peen it very cheap very quick way to have a center action now if you look at the BMF cutter we use a precision machined 416 stainless pivot now this also has a deetle milled into it very difficult to do on a small part let's see if I can get this [ __ ] to focus see that flat on there that locks into a flat and milled into the pivot hole so every time you assemble disassemble reassemble this cutter it locks in a place every single time and the screw doesn't just sit in there and spin so you could get everything tight and up to tolerance if you look at my base it's also shouldered see that shoulder in there again that's so these titanium body pieces line up in the exact same place every single time it's the details that make the cutter okay and the higher the details the better this is gonna function take these bearings for example these bearings are very expensive when I put them on my knives they cost me about seven bucks for a set of bearings okay does it seem like a lot but when you're talking about each individual piece the price starts to add up these are the highest quality ceramic bearings you get the bearings act as buffer or lubricant points between the metal parts so you have that smooth gliding action and the ceramic detent which holds the blade in snaps that blade close and holds it in there tight unless you want it's open up these two cutters don't have any sort of action buffer there are literally just metal riding on metal which will eventually mess up your tolerances okay and that's why they need a spring in here for the action is because there's so much friction they need that spring to force the blades out sure it looks cool when you open it up like a switchblade but in reality it's a much inferior way to do things okay with my cutter you don't need that sort of thing are screws which don't strip out are also four sixteen stainless very high-quality stainless and they're machined for us for this cutter specifically there's hardened washers in the bearing pockets hardened steel washers those are so the hard ceramic doesn't wear a race inside the softer titanium okay and that just adds a little bit longer years to your cutters life okay this cutter that I built I wanted it to be an heirloom piece okay so when you buy this cutter you could get many many years out of the use as well as hand it down to your son so he could get many many years of use okay so when you're spending that money on a higher-end cutter you're buying that cutter for life that is the difference between something that's just an off-the-shelf versus something that I put my time and effort into designing to the best of my ability as of right now I'm not saying I won't come out with a better cutter I'm just saying as of right now this is the best cut or design that I could think of with all the details thought about as much as possible all right so that's kind of the breakdown if I forgot anything or didn't explain anything well enough if you all had any questions just email me info at red horse knife forks comm I could break down or explain anything else you guys have questions on thanks for watching and enjoy those cigars", "EQolQJ6gMQM": "when I go to Kelly's in Dixieland oh bring me in it's horse spray my opinion

yeah you believe so thank you happy holidays do you do", "8WDu7o8X15k": "[Music] hi I'm Andrew Nagy associate editor of Cigar Aficionado magazine and I'm here to show you how to properly cut a sir [Music] this is a V cutter also known as wedge cutter this is good for bigger ring gauge cigar z' usually like 55 ring gauge or more it gives a nice clean cut and it will really open up the draw up a cigar bring in that smoke the only drawback is is that if you cut too deep your cigar has a chance to unravel cutting with a V cutters pretty simple pop it open insert the cigar into the opening make sure it's centered nice and straight and then with a quick swift motion lop it off these are cigar scissors the most elegant way to cut a cigar they cut very swiftly clean they can be used for nearly any cigar rado pick Arado thick cigar thin cigar the only drawback about cigar scissors they can be hard to master and they're not exactly the most portable tool the key to getting a swift cut with the pair of cigar scissors as one focus the blade slightly above the shoulder and as you cut and want to rotate through that cut in wipe away any bits this is a double guillotine cutter it's extremely versatile can be used to cut all cigars we use it in our cigar aficionado tastings it's also portable and you can usually find it for a relatively inexpensive price open up the opening slightly insert the cigar in there so excited about the shoulder and in one swift motion [Music] this is a punch cutter it's good because it focuses the smoke and keeps the cigars cap relatively intact the only downside is is that there might be a little bit of tar build-up after you cut your cigar and it really is only used on Pareto's when you're using a punch cutter you want to make sure that the cutter is centered on the head of the cigar keep it straight and gently twist and push in and pop it out real quick [Music]", "xOZ0kPpLc3k": "hey this is Stacey B with a red one for three and I have another video review for you today this one's gonna be a little bit different this is on the DOS kabaah loose cigars products and what these are is these are cigar cutters and I'm gonna do this a little bit differently today because there are three shades so I'm going to do one video to show you all three got these for my grandfather because he loves them so here's what we have there's also a lifetime warranty with these products you have to go on to register your products but they have a lifetime warranty for all of these so what we have here is the gold gold standard we have a silver you see the silver there that's really nice and we have a basic black so I will show you what these do go with the golden here you'll see they have a real nice logo embellished on them right here just real real nice and if you notice with the gold one the cutter portion is still silver which is the same way on all of them and all you have to do is you open them up not very far to open I'm gonna open this wide put your cigar in there no I'm not keeping my finger in there because that would be a guillotine and pull together and that cuts so cut really nice they're very nice and hefty go you know they're plated certainly I believe the silver one is is in its natural state the other two are plated so there's the gold one they also come with a cleaning brush just a nice little cleaning brush there to get any extraneous stuff off of them come in great little case this thing is wonderful very nice and soft and squishy which is cool and the silver one again you have here everything is silver this I believe again is its natural state still has the logo up here on the top only on one side and you can see that would be the back again doesn't open very wide sounds great just the cutting noise sounds really nice again comes with the cleaner and fits nicely into presentation box which looks really sharp and when they get it you get their lifetime warranty card on there and you get it's a really nice presentation box that you give these for gifts the black again this is not in its natural state I think the silver one is the only one that is still has the really nice love oh and printed on there still sounds really good really easy to use it's nicely in the presentation box and again comes with the little cleaner so this is my review of the dos Carlos cigars and if I am pronouncing that incorrectly I do apologize do you not speak Spanish and gold silver and black so thank you again for watching and I will put a link to all three at the bottom of this video so if you want to go onto

can review this slice this lasers yeah Benjamin has a new cigar cutter out which is one of the trio they've three yeah this is the first of the trio oh they're making three and make yes so this would be the second of four first of three I think I don't think that's true they might not count it but I mean it's kind of they made this is last year this is this year I'm making three this year three this year this is like the first of a trio I think I could be wrong you'll have to ask calendar did I I thought that this was we're gonna have to see if we can get our cigar shop to get a bench made dealer license well last year they made the Gold Class cigar cutter which I think was carbon fiber it was our first it was our first product review is good cigar cutter it's got carbon fiber sapphires access walk Mokey's tie on the back spacer anti screws s 90 in a jar in tungsten coated dlc something whatever blade the details have escaped me holy crap that's a clean is it look out look out look out Finlay I sliced the cap on that thing there's the tip yeah it's a 1500 that's 1500 there's 19 one disorder happiness 1,500 oh wow and you get through this bullet already this is a 1518 - so what's the big difference between last year's in this year's price yeah this is eight are you 58 pickets 450 so this is like a bronze black resin proprietary or something or other they're both I should get the sheet its parent parent is okay and provides guarantor baron starts with the de ferran no it was fair wind noble the K is silent heroine noble anyways okay some proprietary resin like the bronze thank you Michael oh look it's Karen Samsonite yeah I mean the time is right slippy for me this once wants it wants doctor no brass and bronze mesh president composite handle skills you tend

that's well the shops carbon fiber is not a [ __ ] cheap material to work with I'm looking at that and I'm thinking that is upper management this is middle management no rhinestones you're not going to scratch stones there Karen stones for sapphires Karen tonnes suffer Oh let's see how it gets and molds in there it's the same let's see here let's see if I can nip the tip here Jesus Christ that sure you seal I know they're both amazing bars easy but to be sharpened yes are you pulled oh we can get this apart oh for sure if it's disassembled you can sharpen it although it's s90 on cigars I can't imagine how long it would take to dull it forever I mean for cigars a day for a decade how many people are gonna try to cut their finger and they actually will on accident chicken bones does that an automatic knife or is illegal ignored you brought this up last time to hey officer oh oh that one's bigger the new ones a beta ring gauge no one's a bigger ring gauge Oh says there's a good reason to buy the new one right there and it's more accessible maybe they don't know is that way 50 yes together yeah thank you I mean they are gated the cigar cutter game so they might not I mean you know it's not the size of matters why not have all that information yet it's the motion of the action motion of the ocean [Applause] so my first impressions our first impression is didn't drop it in the woods yeah don't take a campout I meant first impressions about my cigar huh what are we smoking no I'm glad I have rum because Joe Turner oh is this our first crossover episode yes we've smoked cigars in other night reviews yeah but we never made him in front of a feature like that before that's not right into cigars but except for there you go it doesn't get any fluid if you hold it the other angle holy crap you're gonna burn the [ __ ] out of that excuse me she said as a cutter I think it functions well has a web admin well but as a cutter obviously Laurie had a problem with the size of your cigar with the original wolf you know I mean this is a cigar go three hundred and forty dollars for you know yeah however much they are something that's gonna be able to make it well for 50 gets you the bigger gauge it is not I think that's similar around 60 ring gauge to so did you so that I mean that's gonna be about the biggest most people are gonna be buying 10 so if you have bigger than that I mean yeah I mean if you used to smaller cigar okay I don't need something that's that baby needed water to put mr. William I take what I can get what does it take what you can get leave nothing behind it's nice I like it it's not as flashy as no so that with no one but you know you don't necessarily mean less flashy I'm disappointed there's no jewels in it the thing about you is born this is truly gold class and then my series there's a trilogy of this photo so there's this is the first of three this is the cheapest of three and I might be mistaken that this is a top tier and this the bottom but there are three gold class cigar cutters they're good that go up in price from just over yes remember if this is the top one the carbon fiber one or the in this I know this is the bottom but I don't know if that is one of the higher and I don't think it is that could be that's what you do it's gotta go to actually save it the only issue I mean you get basically the same cigar cutter except this one's got more utility to it slightly bigger bigger inking but not quite as nice the only issue I have with this composite material is that I can see the inner mechanism and self-exams is it yeah you can hear stress and stuff right the only issue I have with that is I just remember being a kid and like always the janky electronics receiver it just convinced oh okay I see all right I don't know like I equate see through stuff with cheapness yeah but you never bought like a an n64 controller that was longer later boys yeah Mad Catz they broke the one they didn't they were awesome yeah I think you need to stop throwing your controllers at the TV because if you break in controllers apparently I don't so it should just get better at Goldeneye I thought we got this sensei here Sifu sorry I don't want to have to brag but if you gonna force me into it", "E1tFLmDD1DE": "hey what's going on guys so today's video is going to be how to sharpen or maintain a nice sharp edge on your punch cutters or round blades this is a cigar punch cutter okay specifically a Calibri I've actually had a lot of compliments on this over the years it's super super smooth I love this mechanism it kind of sucks in at the very end pops back in I've used this for years now and what a punch cutter does is just what you might assume it makes a little plug cut okay so it's a circular blade it's literally a full circle okay this sharpens on the very edge and for the the case of a cigar you would put pressure forward and twist and it would cut in and when you pull out it takes a little plug of tobacco out okay that's to cut the cap of a cigar so that you can smoke it that's the purpose of this specific tool but I'm sure there are you know different similar sized blades that are just circular for all different purposes so today I just want to talk briefly on how to sharpen this or maintain it now the key to this is not to have to sharpen it at all just like knives I much prefer using strops to maintain an already sharp edge as opposed to letting it gets so dull that you need to sharpen it if you're actually just sharpen this 99 out of 100 times you're gonna be much better off just buying a new one okay most punch cutters are pretty inexpensive you can get super super cheap ones I mean I've seen ones that are a dollar okay all the way up to maybe more fancy ones or like twenty or thirty dollars so this is just representing any old strop with compound on here just have some white compound this is the pocket strop but you can use obviously anything and then more specifically in the back here I have one of my favorite strop so I got this from a viewer who I talked to on Instagram a very very nice guy and he gifted this to me this is a horsehide strop and I don't use any pace on this ok the horse side is just a lot tougher and just it really does something special for all you guys out there who do stropping and you're super into sharpening and stuff definitely do some research and look into horse side really really amazing stuff but this is representing a strop or a piece of leather that has no compound on it okay just a leather that's like next-level once used of compounds this is like the superfine so if it's getting to where it's almost dull where it's kind struggling to cut a little bit I would definitely do a strop of the compound what type of compound you know that's up to you the different colors represent different grits some are finer than others is one of those things but more times than I wouldn't even bother with this I would just use bare leather okay it's gonna be available to most people most people out there have a belt or know someone who has a belt that's raw leather all right so that's probably going to be easiest now in this particular case it's a little bit hard to access the top of that and this specific design so I'm gonna just unscrew this just to to get down to where I have a lower angle you might not have to do this it just depends on whatever punch cutter you have this one has a little spring mechanism and a collar so I'm basically taking it apart to expose more of the tube now this is a very very simple process actually in the zoom in you can get a better idea that way now this is a circular blade what you want to do is your same stopping method where you have it on an angle here okay because I don't know if you could tell but towards the tip here how this is cut it's just very very lightly angled right at their very edge you might be able to see that line there and it just continues all the way around in a circle okay so you want to kind of match that angle a little bit and just drag away like you're stopping now what I'm doing different though is as I'm pulling away I'm also rotating it okay so every time I pull away I'm turning it just a tiny bit so I'm going around and around and around obviously getting the entire edge okay so pull away and turn away and turn away and turn and you continue to do that and it's going to maintain a very razor's edge just happens to be a circular pattern but you're treating like any other knife blade now in the case that it's so dull you have to sharpen it again my suggestion is just buying a new one but it has some kind of sentimental value or something you can use a tapered stone this was one I just a previous video and this has happened to break but this is representing a taper stone you would come in on the inside here okay and you would sharpen the inside appropriately okay back and forth all around the edge until you created somewhat of a sharp edge and then you would go back to the stropping method alright so pretty straightforward pretty simple and again I mean these little punch cutters there they've been a favorite of mine for many many years I when I first got into cigars all I did was a punch cut because I always had cheaper you know guillotine cutters and all different styles never liked any of them and eventually end up getting a Cuban crafter's perfecto cutter which I use for all my cigars I just happen to love that but maybe once in a blue moon I'll kind of revisit this actually what sparked this idea was my my buddy Corey who I talked to all time on Instagram he just got into using a punch cutter on cigars and I said you know what I should do a video talking about how to maintain it and sharpen them but again the idea with all blades is to not have to sharpen them after Auto handful uses could be once a month could be once a year doesn't really matter it depends on how much you smoke after a few cigars if you just take some weather and just do this simple stropping method pullback as you twist you will maintain that edge so it does not get dull that's the idea and the same goes for all blades if you can keep it sharp you don't have to sharpen it does that make sense stropping maintains the edge sharpening changes it so hopefully this video was helpful for the people out there who do use punch cutters and if you don't you just punch Carter hopefully there's a little educational thanks for watching hope you guys have a wonderful day and I'll see you tomorrow with another video take care", "R2eqct-UU7o": "it's a high-tech conversation on the low tech topic live on the world wide web via soon bench talk 101 welcome everybody to this um episode of uh blitztalk 101 um i have the uh great pleasure of introducing our guest speaker um ethan uh aka the the kilted woodworker tonight um some of you know ethan through his social media channels um others through his written skills having been published in magazines such as quercus and and some of you well um you're his friends um but uh did any of you know that ethan um loves the superhero wolverine from marvel and that his hobbies range from hiking barn restoration leather work and we can wonder what that leather work might be um volunteering in 19th century period woodworking uh shop at the daniel boone home which is like a historic site in uh missouri in the in the states um and like most of us uh he loves his mum's cooking he wanted me to put that one out for you um especially her homemade chili i think she's maybe gonna be watching this one later no it's my chili my chili is better than hers oh there we go but uh loves his mum um there we are um so uh and obviously uh his most important hobby is woodworking um which he embarked on back in 2004 which is uh some 17 years ago um during the time that shernick was still wearing nappies um but uh ethan's first project was to make a carving mallet um out of osage orange he says learning to turn with osage orange is like learning how to drive a stick on a 64b tool you learn on that you can turn nearly anything however he still loves it and still has it today he says he has better mallets but he's uh it's the first thing he's ever made so he's never going to get rid of it i think we can all recognize that trait uh with all of our firsts uh whatever those firsts might be um so ethan's day job for the last six years is a senior user experience analyst for a software company sounds technical um and he's been with the company for for 19 years but if he could have his dream job he would be a regular contributor to a woodworking magazine wait a minute that uh sounds like he's already done that uh his dream job has been achieved already um but so his next dream job would be to work as an r d so research and development for someone like lee nelson or lee valley um and help figure out what new tools that could be made or more specifically what old tools that are no longer being made could be revived um sounds like a great job there um so ethan said that if he had all the money in the world he would make himself a bow child style nine feet nine to ten feet long french oak rubo workbench with bench crafted hardware um and i think uh i think that's maybe another workbench there so maybe he's done a lot of his stuff already but today we the community of bench talk 101 have the pleasure of hearing ethan talk to us about his cigar shaves so guys pour yourselves a bench beverage sit back and enjoy ethan thank you jeffrey appreciate it um so let's see how to uh introduce the cigars names um i guess for starters uh if anybody reads uh quercus magazine and you've made it all the way to the back of the last issue then you've seen my article that i wrote on on the uh miller falls uh cigar spokeshave so um one of the nice things about writing for quercus is that uh nick pretty much gives me free reign to write whatever whatever i want i mean i throw some ideas at him and we talk about him but for the most part i get to write about things that interest me and i'm one of those guys that uh that when i like pick up a thread of uh of something that that's kind of interesting and then i just start pulling on it until the the sweater comes undone and so i'll keep at it for a while um like the first article that i wrote for corkus was on um a uh the the depth stop for for a um for a chamfering bit for a brazen bit and you know it's something that doesn't even have a number id in the the stanley catalogs so that was a lot of fun to go diving into that um but uh so the reason i decided to write about the um the millers falls number one cigar shave is because well i picked mine up this is this is mine right here uh i picked mine up about i've had it for about eight years now i guess and um i bought it and brought it home cleaned it up and i looked at the blade for a little bit and kind of figured it out and sharpened it and put it back in and started using it and i never had any problems with it at all and i didn't think anything of it but over the years i would say the last eight years or so that i've been paying attention it seems like anytime i bring up my miller falls spokeshave the cigar um the response is always or almost always yeah i have one of those uh and i've tried to use it a couple times and it never works for me so i chuck it back in the tool chest and pull it out a couple years later and i give it a try again and it never seems to to work right so um i thought that maybe what i could do is use my platform at quercus to um write a little bit about it and see if i can't uh demystify some of it and make it so that for some of you guys at home that might have one of these you could try to give it a tune up and and see if you can get it back to work because it really is one of the best spokeshaves that i've ever used i don't know how many i have i'm not a collector so i only have about eight or nine i think actually so in preparation for this article so i had mine and my my idea my brilliant idea was to um to buy another one and then um disassemble it and and clean it up and reassemble it and sharpen the blade and and tune it and then uh you know document that whole process and then uh i would have something written for the article uh and then when when that next one showed up this one right here so let me show you there we go i need a pointer if we can use a pointer use a pointer bug oak um so right right there that is the um that's basically the the soul of the plane if we treat this like a plane and so this is uh it's about two inches long and a quarter of an inch deep i guess is what you would call it so when i got this next one and see if i can get the glare and you can see there that it actually has another facet there so the one of the previous owners of this took a file and i guess opened up the mouth of the of the tool well i couldn't exactly disassemble this one and restore it and then explain to everybody how to do it because it's been modified so then i had to buy another one that was a little a little more like than normal so you can see there there's the the normal soul that it's supposed to have and and then also in doing my research which was very extensive um because like i said i find that thread and i start pulling on it and one thing one little piece of thread that i pulled was from a it was a british woodworking it was archived material but it was from about 2004 or 2003 so this is going back pretty far and i was reading through uh somebody was discussing the the miller falls number one spokeshave and i found one it was like a throwaway line a throwaway sentence that somebody said hey you know i i think that um i i think that moore and wright uh had a version of this as well and then nobody said anything about it and they just went on with their discussion um well of course i started looking for a moore and wright cigar spokeshave out of sheffield and i was i didn't know if i was going to show this to you guys tonight because because i because it i bought it from england i bought it from uh ebay uk and i kind of sneaked it out of there uh so i apologize for that but so this is uh and i don't know if you can i don't know if cameras are good enough here yeah you can start to see a little bit of the the uh signature on there but uh believe me it says more and right so the miller falls uh spokeshave was was made from the late 19th century to about 1910 or so um and i believe the more and right ones started around 1900 uh and went on to maybe about 1915 or so but really none of them were made past that so i'm not a collector and yet somehow i have four of these spokeshaves so i'm definitely going to get rid of a couple of them at least one i'm going to get rid of one of them i think pretty sure so i ended up now with enough that i can disassemble and fix a couple of them up and in the process learn more about them and how they work and uh yeah that might have been andy and jim um actually it was i don't think jim was on there i think it was it was earlier than that i'll have to try and dig it up again um the problem with some of the rabbit holes i go down is that i it's hard to repeat them it's hard to to to go back and and and find that rabbit hole again so um anyway that was that was the onus for the article um and uh how i uh got to where we are so um some of the problems i guess that's something we could talk about uh some of the problems that i came across as we were as i was researching these and when i would get them and look at them one one problem one common problem is that uh the blade would be in backwards so you'd have the cutting edge over here i'm not sure how anybody would ever get that to work but so that was the so that was the first the first concern the next one is that they just have it adjusted wrong and the third one though is the the blade and they have it sharpened incorrectly so here's the blade and see if i can capture that on here you see there's a bevel right there on that blade so the problem with that is the blade for one of these tools is you have to treat this like any other woodworking plane um so it has a face and it has uh a bevel side an edge um and this this right here is the the face of the plane or the flat of the plane blade so this is supposed to be perfectly flat this is like flattening the back of your of your plane iron so when somebody puts a bevel on it like that um it's like putting that big of a bevel on on the back of your plane blade so it's you're going to struggle to get that to engage properly that's going to take some work to to get that out of there so the bevel on the plane is actually on the uh the inside right there and you know if you can see it in the light it's it is difficult to show there it is there so it is just the tiniest little bevel there and honestly i don't think the angle on that matters a whole lot uh i've put it on there in a couple different ways it's not an easy thing to duplicate i think the idea though is to just get some of that edge there polished so that you you end up with the two planes joining together at a as fine angle as you can get it as final point as you can get it so i think sharpening the blade is probably one of the most difficult things and it's probably the one where people mess it up because they would put that bevel on there thinking that they're doing something right or improving on it or whatever um but with each one of these that i tuned up uh i was able to get a nice nice bevel on there nice bevel on there and so um i did a lot of work with the three of these just to uh to see if i could figure out how to improve upon or how to describe a way of assembling it and i think i'm going to try to come around here so that i can show you guys a little better so you have your blade sharpened and there you go when you have your plane sharpened and put it here on the on the body and again here's the the sole of the plane and so we're going to put the basically what we're doing is we're getting these two planes here plane meaning the flatness in line so get it just about right there yeah and then you want the opening there you're going to see like a little black line there the more narrow that line is the tighter the opening is on this so i'm wrapped around my visor um so what i found was that that is basically the opening of the the mouth of the plane and we can get that really tight really fine and we can produce nice fine shavings so there you can see that that is fairly fine it's about as fine as i can get it adjusted by hand and then if we go to the next one and you can see there so it's easy to tell if you know what to look for we're looking for the flat of this space right here and so that opening right there a little bit wider on this one and then when we get to the one that was modified you can see that so here's the flat and there's the flat so that opening is is much wider you can in fact you can see you can see me through it there because that's so wide open opening uh in fact i was able to take a measured um 16th of an inch uh shaving off of this um this largest opening which i thought was pretty good and it was a clean shaving nice and sharp clean shaving the other thing that that i believe i was able to [Music] to figure out a reason for so um i also when i refinish these i i repainted the inside of the i guess it's the throat of the of the spokeshave red that miller falls uh red i don't know if you guys can you know capture it here on and it won't but so that edge right there on the inside that that 90 degree turn in there is is painted red um and i can see it in person and you can't see it on on the camera but um i was wondering if maybe that was one of the reasons why they have that painted is so that when you're setting this up um the way i was looking for uh adjusting the the opening on here was by the amount of red that i could see and if i set it up so i could barely see any red at all or almost no red that is the the tightest mouth that i can achieve um or when i open it up and i can see a bit more red then that's the the wider of the mouth that i can achieve um and so uh all of that is documented though in in the article that i wrote um if you have one of these and you have not been able to get it to work properly i would highly recommend getting the issue five of quercus magazine so that you can um kind of read through that and and try to uh hopefully though i was able to show you a visual of what i was talking about in the article it's a little bit harder to describe pictures with with words but i think i did a pretty good job so that was one of the things i wanted to talk about was the tuning up these for use in the shop the topic that i really wanted to go into but a i didn't have enough information and b i didn't have enough page uh space is a as a type study to see how many different versions there are of this tool so the uh when i can't remember his name there is a a spokeshave book that came out is his last name larson awesome i'm sure somebody's gonna know it um but it is a it's a thick book it's about this big on spokeshaves and he has this in there um but he only has uh yeah that's it lemon yeah um he he has uh it's just a couple paragraphs on the miller's falls number one cigar shave and he says that there's really only about two types and the main difference is so this is an earlier version and in the the metal part of the body there's a little groove in there this is a later version and there's no groove in there and he said that's really one of the one of the main differences well um maybe not though because uh for starters i'll take the handle off of this one that has a really long post i believe these are all original i haven't seen anything to indicate otherwise so on this first one here the the post is threaded and it's um attached to the body and honestly that that doesn't make it as useful as it could be because if you're taking the the arm off to get into a tighter space well i'm not getting i'm only getting this much extra space because i still have the post there right so i believe this is the earliest uh type and when i get to the one that was heavily modified uh we had the same thing which when you can duplicate something like that then that that tells me that yes i'm looking at the original design of how it was it's not something that was modified um when we look at the newer one though we see that they made a change that the threaded rod is is on the handle not on the body so now when when i do need to get into a tighter space with this i actually can um because when i remove the the arm i'm actually removing that much of the of the the tool so that i can get into a tighter space and so yeah technically i guess you could remove both of these arms and you would have this tiny little tool that would be a little bit more difficult to use so there's a different threading issue there if we again look at my original and then the one that was heavily modified you can see that there's some minor differences there in the the length of the body if we look at the the different handles there's there's different uh shapes to the handles i keep wanting to pull up the uh the more and right one which is obviously going to be different not the same type and then there's one other thing that came up and this is something that um i actually had a couple uh woodworkers to who messaged me about this and that is that if we look at this we have the the two screws that hold the blade in place by the way these screws are a quarter quarter by 28 fine machine screws and they have uh it's kind of a an oval head with you can see there yeah kind of an angle there that's what captures the blade um and i have i believe i have pretty good uh google foo i can i can find things online uh i cannot find half inch uh quarter by 28 oval headed slotted screws so i have actually i was i was checking the door earlier because it's supposed to arrive today i do have from mcmaster car they have some uh just some some flat top and i was gonna see how how much space i had there if i could do a little bit of doming on it to to give it the oval shape and still make it a replacement for these so that is something i'm going to play around with a little bit but the thing that i'm going to show you on this one is so here's the the two um screw holes that we have the same as on this one here and if we rotate it a little bit more there's two more and i really honestly haven't been able to figure out what these are for i don't know if it's well so on this one what i thought was the case was so here's the the normal soul and the flat of the blade we rotate it and look at that there's another sole here on this side so what i was doing playing around with this one i figured out that if i flip the blade around and move the screws to the other holes that um i had a different opening here than than on the first one so the first one has uh the sole is again two inches by a quarter of an inch uh the sole on the other side was two inches by an eighth of an inch so it was giving you a little bit more of an opening so if you wanted to do some rougher work flip it around move the screws and and this one tool provided both things but as i was examining it more closely i don't know if we can capture that on here you can see that there's some machining marks i think probably from a file um over here on this side uh it's not straight it's not straight in line with this is hard to do with a camera in reverse it's not straight in line with the main opening i believe somebody filed that in afterwards because i've seen other examples with the four screw holes that don't have that flat on there so it's going to take some extra work i think to try and figure that out i i don't know what the reason was for it but i think that the woodworking community in general might benefit from an actual type study of this and so that's something that i was going to work on doing but just picking up an extra three of these spokeshaves was um was a bit costly and i don't know how many i'd have to buy to to do a proper type study i suspect i'd have to get upwards of uh you know 20 or 25 to get a good sample of the information and i don't have that kind of money so what i was thinking that i might do is offer some type of i say offer but really i mean you know it's a paid service so where if you have one of these spokeshaves and you've tried it a couple times to get it to work and even after reading even after reading my article you still can't get it to work we can figure something out where you ship it to me and i'll get it tuned up and if you want we can do a full restoration on it polish the steel and give it that nice red clean up the handles a little bit more and sharpen up the blade and get it into a good usable condition and while i have your spokeshave here with me i can disassemble it and document it and record that information for for a type study and then if we get enough of those then i can help fund more of my woodworking which is always good and you get a usable tool and then i also get information for my type study so that's something that i i will probably post a little bit more information about that um instagram obviously is my uh social media of choice lately uh i have a blog and instagram is so easy that um that i neglect my blog um and i i shouldn't do that because i like to write and i love typing more than typing with two thumbs um so that's one thing that talks about instagram so anyway um i think that's about all that i wanted to cover tonight uh i could go on for a while i think but i i don't i don't want to um unless you guys want me to no i i didn't um but uh i think i touched on a couple of the things so two of the things that i wanted to discuss was the type study and the the how i wanted to go about trying to do that um those are things that i couldn't go into in the article um so again if you haven't yet purchased it or picked it up then what i would highly recommend is getting that quercus issue five um and not just because it's filled with great articles by great writers but because there's some information in there for uh for the millage falls uh number one spokeshave and what i'd like to see is is a lot more people putting it to use in their workshops um it was really uh it was really amazing to me to how many times i heard i could say probably 20 times over over the last eight or nine years that i've had somebody uh say to me oh yeah i have one of those and i have i can't figure out how to get it to work you know it was enough people that i thought i needed to figure out how to do something about this because i mean i got mine working pretty easily so i don't know if there's anything else that you guys want me to discuss if you want me to to i with just a little bit of motion here whoops hold on there's nothing wrong on your side i no you okay no i'm good no there's nothing wrong on your side i uh flipped i flipped my my screen to a different window um would you like us to go to questions ethan well i was going to say yes i can um i can also with a little bit of movement here uh where's my we can get a bit of video can we there we go yeah my vice is right here whoa my headphones are around the vise um my vise is right there and um i love i mean if you don't have a benchcraft advice and if you've never tried a benchcraft device i mean look at this you know i that is just unreal anyway here's the the one that's wide open i mean that's a shaving you know that is and how much effort did i put into that nothing and oops pop the blade out um but uh might maybe take a little too much but that was um it's really not that difficult to put it back in uh you do have to use a milital screwdriver when you're working with miller's files tools so again what i'm doing is when i'm lining this up is i'm looking straight down onto the sole and then also straight down onto the and by light reflection i can tell when they're in the same plane and that tells me when i have a good setting there i'll tighten this one down a little bit more this time so if you're doing table legs and you're trying to plane down some and look this is and look how smooth that is can you see how smooth that is can you feel that i can feel it it's smooth it's smooth um and we go from that to let's go to mine which has the fine settings on it and i can do finer because i have mine as set where um i can do a heavier cut over here and a finer cut over there um so you know that's a huge difference there um but i hope that shows you guys just a little bit of how great this tool is and you could probably whittle away all day long couldn't you i mean i could yeah looks uh looks looks rather nice uh so let's go into a few questions um uh ethan thank you very much for for your showing us uh you know the difference between the models of uh metaphors that you've got there um i noticed the wood um is the word um uh is it a rosewood or is it an ebony or uh it's rosewood on the millridge falls i don't know um i'm thinking almost a mahogany on the on the mourn right i don't know i'll have to clean it up and look a little more carefully but it is definitely um different than the yeah but yes this is a rosewood on the on the millage falls lovely right so first question is going up to mitch have i allowed mitch to unmute himself yes mitch are you there good question mitch um so what i say it sorry he didn't really ask a question i thought maybe it was my internet playing up on i thought oh what's going on here no it's starting it can you hear us mitch oh we we had this a couple of weeks ago where he um he went again oh no you're on you're on you're in yeah hi ethan good to speak to you again yeah how are you keeping doing pretty good how you doing sir yeah good thank you that was an excellent talk i really enjoyed that thank you thank you and i bet uh all the auction sites are going to be buzzing with people trying to buy that was my other concern with doing something like this i should have tried to buy a couple more before i did that yeah well i'm certainly going to be looking out for one and i'll be coming back to this video to help me tune it up okay appreciate what you've shared there and of course picking up quirkers i i was just wondering about the the real origin of this tool and whether you take it back uh to beyond miller's falls bringing out one is there anything that you've heard of um i haven't so in my research the only four [Music] the only four designs of this that that i could find were the millionaires falls the more and right i don't have one but there was a a guy and i guess it was about he started in the maybe 2005 or 2006 or so and he i think he stopped in about 2016 and it was called um uh kelly tool perks and every now and then you'll find a couple of them show up uh he made a couple different tools but every now and then one of his um one of his uh cigar shaves will show up on ebay and man they go for there was one on a couple weeks ago and i think the final price on it was uh 235 or uh 245 something like that so i mean that was you know a good four times what what i normally pay for for one of these uh miller falls versions um and then there is um a fourth uh tool out there that um i would say it's confirmed i've been trying to get a hold of them they're they're notoriously difficult to get a hold of if if you spend a lot of time on ebay like i do you know that there's a company out there called the st james bay tool company and it's an american company i believe they're out of utah that provides they do like small batch runs of copies of other planes um so right now and they sell on ebay so right now they'll have like um 10 bronze little mini router planes um and they sometimes they'll sell them rough cast so where you clean it up and sometimes they'll sell them uh already cleaned up and polished and it comes with the the screw that you need and it's already tapped or it comes without it and it's not tapped and you can do it and so that they offer different prices and um you know it gives people who are starting to try to get into tool making the opportunity to to do it in smaller steps but they also even sell kits for for making uh dovetailed um in-field planes but on their website they have a listing there for a copy of the miller falls number one spokeshave so i've never seen it for sale on ebay so i was going to try to get a hold of them and find out if if they if they still had some or if they um ever do a run of them and i tried calling the phone numbers on the website and they were both out of use um so i messaged them on ebay and he got back to me and said that there is a um an email type form on their website that works so after i get done with this tonight i'm going to send them a message and find out because they also offered the blades for these and that is one of the hardest things to find so on the three that i have i don't know how easily i can show this but we'll try um well this blade is is um about half of what is left of these two so and this is the guy that that opened the mouth up on this um he used the crap out of this uh because he has sharpened down half of of this of this blade um i just think that's amazing um in fact he also used it so much that the yeah it's upside down the the patent information which is right there is almost completely worn away on this so he really used this this tool a lot um i'm always interested in in trying to figure out what that person was or what they did and i always want to thank a chairmaker because of the tool but anyway um finding the blade is is very difficult i believe that's probably one of the reasons why that um or that kelly tool works one went for such a high price is because it had a spare blade with it and so with that you can get on ebay and every now and then you'll find um just the body um with no blade uh for sale and and that's practically useless because we're gonna get a blade for it so if you can get it from so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna try to contact st james bay tool company and see if they have a number of the blades and if they do then i will acquire them and that can be a part of the restoration that i offer is as a new blade you're up next hi ethan thanks for the talk sure paul uh just a quick one you know that you were talking about using it without the handles i wondered whether you'd thought about putting mechanism handles which when it started like 45 degrees you need a bit like a draw knife handle to actually screw into the sides huh you know that might be easier to do with um with one of these where it's in the body right because that well i was thinking you could literally on the other one where it where it was in the actual handles yeah just make some little handles and then you could have a screw coming in sideways well that's true you could do that too um again i guess the only thing with that is that when you're you want to set them both in the body first before you glue the handle on because you want to be able to to get it set up so that they're facing the same way yeah sure um yeah i don't know i never thought about that no also though um i have i don't know where it is right now i mean i do have a fairly small draw knife already oh that's pretty yeah whose is that um it's ethan's it's mine i don't i don't remember it's not marked i think that's used to be available from lee valley [Music] it's like a crap oh it's company no this is peckster really peck strikes the major useful tool wow these things are really horrible for trying to get a close-up of that take my word on that that's fine so yeah so that's a peck show you can i see these everywhere in the states at tool auctions so i don't know i've never thought about doing that just because i already have a small um draw knife sure but um this it's it's an interesting idea something to think about okay well thank you anyway sure thanks paul jim over to you hello hey hey ethan how are you man oh hey jim how's it going not too bad and not too bad uh yeah i got a million wouldn't i i mean i must i must i can't even see you i've got jeffrey what have i got jeffrey has he pinned himself no i don't know i've got i'm spotlighted now yeah i've got a couple of things right first of all for you uh the original was goodall uh who worked at miller's falls albert gibbel giddle goddale yeah and he um his plate number if you want to write down uh is two nine three six five one so it's the u.s patent you can get it from the patent office and it actually shows this one as the original but i don't know maybe that's a speculation but i haven't got the paint because i just went and started uh playing with it when i got mine if you remember back you mentioned the uk w4 andy and i were talking about it because again in the uk people had these and these are very rare in the uk because obviously it's an american tool originally even though you're more than right uh might might be interesting to research how uh and when that was made because it's definitely a copy i would have thought it was a copy and andy's put the patent up on the screen there for us but um yeah so uh just um just going about your talking about your uh concept of um taking them in and restoring them yeah um and and i really do a reflection here on what i uh do with when people ask me the same about uh in-field planes uh there are some key things that that that i believe um if you're going to go for a originality or or fineness if you like like you were talking about your fine one this one incidentally has a kelly blade on it yeah which i think was about 80 quid landed to the uk so but as as you pointed out um it's it has the um perfect face to it yeah there you go let me see whether i can tilt that slowly there you go um and if there's a back burble on that you know as well as i do how much work you've got to have to flatten that whole thing and that's like saying to somebody you get an infield playing with the blade in it ironing it and you've got to flatten the whole back because that's what you have to do to get that that back to a cutting edge um so that's point one so that's why when my what one i bought on ebay arrived it had exactly the same verbal as yours that the the bad one of yours it's like an eighth of an inch yeah well no this one was way back halfway across and completely 20 degrees you know so it was and it was no way that that so when i found out you you could buy these and we were very lucky we got two of them me and toby got two of them he he imported it and we split the cost of it but even then it was expensive um so that was that but with with your one that the sole plate here it's been beveled as well i think that's a write-off unless you're going to go for you know like you said chair making and you're going to cut big shavings because there's no way you can't flatten that anymore because if you flatten it you reduce its up height relative to the cutting edge of the rotating edge so that that was the point there but i actually think that this part uh the body here is eminently copyable it's it's simply just a piece of steel bar full steel car would be fine and you know anybody with the minor milling capabilities could mill a mouth of those angles and cut two holes that that's all really what it is but as you said it's the it's the actual cutter that's an issue and i looked into that back in 2016 and um i didn't realize james company was was doing it um but it really is just a tube a tube of tall steel yeah and then you take the tube cut it to lengthen the thirds i think and and then you cut a piece out of it and you put a bevel on it and so on and so but i think it's feasible if you have potentially if you have you know um complex milling or cnc equipment so i think that's the route to go but i i think these are like rocking horse poop right now and that's the the critical bit as you say um there was another thing i was going to mention to you um and i've completely forgotten it but uh yeah so the good old patents there it's actually written that the thing here established 1884 which is on the patent here um and it looks like it went until about 1910 at which point i think most people said i have no idea what to do with it and that that they haven't you know went out fashion really so i don't know if any of that is of any help to you uh yeah um yeah that'll be interesting to look up that that good old patent information um what is your the one that you're holding there is that a good old or is that milwaukee's faults it's a miller's fault but they're all a good old work family yeah he worked for military before yeah good old yeah so they put they put his uh the reason why i think this is original it's got the original paint number on it um and it actually matches the picture i've got of the actual excerpt from the paid patent with the price and everything um but later yours has the patent number on it it's got it's like yours it's rubbed at that point uh it's got the remnants of the patent number and i i believe it's the end of the paint number but it's it's so tiny uh it's so tiny and uh so rubbed and i hadn't actually bothered to look at that sort of detail until you mentioned it but um this one it's actually fairly legible nine two two six nine two nine three six one um yeah so mine's not showing that mine shows the patent date 1884 yeah yeah i don't i don't know i mean clearly the original patent here which is drawing from original patent shows the short stump screw that one yeah um which is the one with the screws in the handle and it also shows the two ridges on the on the handle itself which i don't think the one you had with the screw in the body has ridges on the handle has it yeah no so which one is that that's the right what's that okay so this one which is the same as yours except this is the one that has four holes yeah mine only has two holes and this isn't this is also something that i've seen on on many uh for sale on ebay is the four holes and so i know that's not just something that when one person did okay i can't see on any of the ones on here on the patent information no but it does say early and actually one of the early ones it's there are no ridges on the handle so it looks like there could be quite a few permutations yeah um so like you said research really oh and also um you have yours as well if you i've got all three of you on spotlight so andy brown if you put yours up as well which one you just quoted that you've got on yours you've got the um your shows the date yeah i was going to say mine just has on one of these just has the date it doesn't say and then one of them says mfco miller's falls massachusetts and then it has the date so there's i mean just right here we have three versions it's it says patent february 19 1884 yeah right this one doesn't have february on it i think yours is is it definitely because my half my february in 1884 is missing yeah that's the trouble you see as as ethan said earlier on oh yeah february 19 1884 yup it does yeah it's a top half mission jim what top half no um some of them only have the patent date and it doesn't say the it doesn't have miller's falls on it um this one mine is one where ethan said his was worn where because it's next to the mouth here right when you when you do the action like that yeah roll i i've learned to sort of almost roll with it especially if you're doing curve work incidentally that's the point i was going to make that you didn't uh touch upon what it's good if you want to do an inner curve there is no spokeshave apart from this one that will do that now sean if you put yours back up again sure show the date on it very clearly i actually took a photograph of my phone and then blew it up and if i can get this close enough to the screen the right angle for you guys yours is very posh yours is yours is unworn isn't it it's uh it's in pretty good shape that's the actual shape there but it says um i'll read it off for you it's uh mfco miller's false yeah february 19 1884 and it's if you get a photo of it you can read it quite easily now there's a picture oh no hang on yeah they're all say miller's falls yeah so i don't i don't know which one came first with you know or whether there was various iterations of it but clearly there's uh there's been some sort of inverted commas development over that period of what is it 16 26 years that it was in operation yeah i have something to add to that whole topic there jeffrey when when we're when you're ready yeah would you want to go ahead i think i think the um well i didn't i thought maybe somebody else was in line before my question so taking the look at that see i can that was that's a nice nice stamp so but that is just the patent date without miller's fools without millage falls yeah chester you're up next anyway for the question so if you want to ask your question now chester okay mine uh mine is is more of a statement than a question in the 1894 miller's fall catalog they show they showed this uh number one spoke shave with the four holes in 1894. wow in the catalog which is the 1915 catalog it changes to the two hole only so uh between those two those years so four is earlier the four hole is earlier and that's interesting on mine the four hole the opposite side was not flat beveled like yours is yeah but it's just round and the reason for that is to get into a tighter curve so the blade goes up to the actual body of the cigar shape and gives you a shaving that you can go into a three-quarter inch or one-inch hole and just turn it and shave the inside of a hole where you can't do it with the flat yeah right truster like this one and we were all thinking that if you had one of these that you had the ultimate and now we've got the ultimate of one of six variations and now we're gonna have to go and look for those other ones thanks very much for that chess you're welcome yes but like i say the four hole is the earlier and that would be interesting to look on your study and see what patent dates are on those pieces themselves and then also in the earlier catalog i'll show you see if i can show you this picture you may have to spotlight this um but you you'll see this is the earlier catalog and i can't see myself so let's see all right um let me get where it is so this finger okay now you see the separation there see how they're showing an opening in order to unscrew that they're giving an example of how it unscrews um the bead on the wood almost looks like it has a piece of metal and so it's metal to metal so i'm wondering if you're actually separating it at the right point when you're pulling off the handle and that there isn't a fine line you're missing i don't know patent that's what it shows on the patent the fine line that there's metal on this side and metal on this side well it's it's a it's a it's a it's a push me pull you it's the same it's the same right my mind doesn't undo on both sides that shows two handles and actually says undoes both sides to get into cramped spaces exactly now my mine only undoes on one side on the newer catalog it no longer shows that now the wood goes all the way up to the metal there and this only has the single bead if you can see on mine there is a line right there in the middle yeah i don't have a line in my metal um so here yeah that that's not on the one i've got i don't know if you can see right and that's and that's further that's on the two hole correct ethan right right there no this is this is a one hole or okay ooh not four hole yeah i see that line i can see that tiny line and i'm wondering if you unscrewed it from there you do not actually take the screw out of at the right rod exactly and instead of leaving the long rod that's in the wood yeah you would think that's good the short one which is what you should do yeah i reckon that's i reckon that's actually corroded into there yep it's not coming out no i think you you're gonna have to put that in a chuck i have to soak it yeah yeah but i hope that helps ethan no that's a thank you very much that is very helpful right there and that makes a lot more sense the thing is it was very strange that because and i think one of mine is jammed on this side i think my mine has got the same sort of age corrosion in that side because i think they're both supposed to come chester on your later one on the later catalogue does it still say both handles or the handle um so should we ball i'll have to find that page again i only made cramped spaces on one side well because you you change your direction you can you want it on both sides because oh yeah the direction of shaving would actually change has none of them the markings on the metal tube and i can unscrew both handles yeah i'm going to cut myself to oblivion here because yes it's as sharp as grab it tight yeah actually shit's not very sharp there we go this one is this one has none of those fine lines on the metal it's just a plain tube yeah and yeah that's the that's exactly the same exactly the same as mine probably because they had problems with the the two metal pieces corroding together and sean you don't have any metal it's not a metal face on your handle right no just just with it anything else yeah there's no metal space on this the rod yeah in the um on the 1915 catalog it refers to the wood as a rare tropical wood handles as opposed to cocobolo it's cocobolo oh yeah the original the original one either handle and it's just still does say either handle removable for working in cramped quarters like schrennick's little workshop that's that's what it says verbatim i don't know how they know that in the patent the early versions of the spokeshaves the handles are made of cocobolo and either side can be detached for working situations in figure five you see the red portion of the throat so some of them had red some of them didn't um yeah so basically yeah that was the the very early versions of coco bolo this one there is um this is um a tb rail tv rails catalog yeah and they've got that down at rosewood by catalog number 42 um they no longer sell spokeshaves yeah they're gone and that's uh um that's interesting that it went away i guess there were no more cramped quarters to work in so let's uh let's let some other people um ask some questions and we've got richard hughes um up next okay um all right i think i think i may be out of turn i think shawn is listed before me is he i was gonna let some other people talk my question is it's probably been been sort of answered already by yourself ethan and jim but in the uk these these things are quite rare i've never i've never seen one in there in reality um and um was kind of attracted by the idea of of making one or making something similar and i was i wanted to to ask if you were aware of any individual tool makers who'd succeeded in making such things um well kelly told works i think was was probably a small shop that you know he just made he had a very small selection of of tools and i believe was mostly spokeshaves different kinds of smoke shapes so certainly uh he's he's done that um and then i would say uh st james bay uh tool company also has done that and i know they're a pretty small operation too just a couple guys yeah so um certainly possible um and like jim said you know it's just um it's just a piece of uh tool steel that that has uh you know it's two threaded holes on the on the outside and uh um two sections of of of steel removed from here and here and the hard part then would be making the blade yeah yeah okay well i i kind of like a challenge so so maybe you know if anybody's going to make what it's you richard that's a 100 i'm sorry yeah okay that was my question thank you for sure um jeremy over to you all right ethan uh first of all good talk uh although i was in and out because of the uh weather moving to the midwest right now uh we uh i've lost power in the internet but i'm on a second becca backup device um so my question and or a couple couple thoughts one is the difference between your um your handle attachments to me from an engineering perspective the the one with the threaded rod in the handle seems like a least a less expensive version to manufacture um a because you can chuck the handle up and and lathe it from right from that post as well as obviously you have a shorter length of of rod for the main body since it's fully machined that would be my supposition from that but the real thing i wanted to talk about was um was i have another maker that i don't i didn't hear you talk about uh it this is um ct co which i believe from my research was uh a cincinnati tool company yeah um i picked this up i don't know if you've come across this one before i've seen it before yeah okay okay so um but i picked this one up at uh handworks and and um a couple a couple times ago and uh patrick leach had like a bucket full of these so um and this could very well be uh the reason why people have a problem with the cigar shaves because um this one is not to the same level as your miller's falls i can assure that in fact i did not realize that the handles were removable until you were showing that your handles were removable so i started pulling and twisting on this one and i found that this one comes out as a casting um i mean it's all one but it's a casting not a foiling machine part and that probably leads to what some of the problems uh most notably when i was setting it up there are these two adjustment grub screws back here that uh twist and shape the bed as well as uh this uh hold down whatever you want to call that lever cap whatever we want to call that thing that also provides the kind of the tension a really good spot for uh chips to get and under unless you treat that correctly and shape it just correctly so is the blade curved on that it is curved it it i don't know if you can see that there but the blade does curve it starts right here and then it goes out there so it is a like a cigar shave not just a round bottom shape but uh this thing was a bear to get set up in fact i'm afraid to take it apart because and i hardly ever use it um and mostly because any of my tight curves i've switched to um well this is just not reliable uh but also that i have the little caleb james round shave which is very very good at uh internal curves um i haven't compared it because i really don't have a gold standard on the cigar shape to do but i think i would like to try the miller's falls version that looks like a much more refined version of this and i assume this is a knock off they're a later knockoff of that uh this looks like i don't know like early 20th century so one thing that i do anytime i get a new tool in my shop and you know i do it whether it's a um ball brag whether it's a fantastic tool like um like my uh sour and steiner um smoothing plane or if it's just something that i pick up that i need to refurbish once i get it assembled and get it working then i immediately take it all apart again and redo it and i'll do that about five or six times at least until i'm comfortable with you know with doing that so and i didn't do that when i first got this this one and so uh you know i got it set up and i was like okay don't touch it you know use it but don't touch the setting on it um and then once i figured out the idea the technique or the the methodology of assemble and reassemble and reassemble until you understand the tool much more fully um so now you know i i'm totally comfortable with with taking any one of these apart and getting it put back together properly and um i think that's something it looks like those do not have any it looks like those don't have any real adjustment right i mean the the body is machined like yes a single feature correct so i guess it's kind of like an infill plane where you have like no adjustment on them on the throat or anything it's all baked in but it's like very well done whereas it's like a bailey plane where you got to kind of fiddle with the make sure the frog set correctly and could don't have a chip in between there or something like that it could be causing some chatter but i think giving you the difference getting the blade set up is still takes some some some work and um you know because also you're dealing with you're dealing with two screws here and so uh well in fact on mine i don't know if you can see that one of those is a little bit higher than the other so i probably need to adjust that a little bit but you can um you know you can you can kind of shift the blade to the left or the right a little bit uh depending on how you tighten these and and loosen them up you can even put a little bit of a of a can't c-a-n-t right on um the blades yeah yeah so that you end up like like mine is where um it's i can do a heavier shaving on one side and a lighter shaving on the other side so there's some some good adjustability on that uh now you i just keep bleeding these around and now i just want to get that that handle removed at the seam careful they may not actually remember [Laughter] jeremy just so you know your spoke shave is from around 1923 later okay um and it's a har grave made by cincinnati tool company um so the the millis falls is an earlier version that's what i suspected thanks yeah lovely um right so back back to the questions and so we've got um sean did you want to ask another question or have you have you asked it already i've mostly covered it but i'll just say a quick thank you because while i have this i haven't really used it very much because mine came working on arrival and i've been too scared to sharpen them because of everything i've heard and the other thing i want to say thank you to is uh this is a little sample of ethan's work i have this beautiful little oiler think of many paul sellers uh raggedy han only this is a tartan and a stick um and it's fantastic when i first got it i was like i don't think i'm gonna like it i think it's too small um but in actual fact that's the beauty of it it just sits in my tool well anytime i want to put a little chameleon oil on something it's just a grab away i've always loved it thank you very much ethan it was a great you're welcome that's my that is my so when you start getting into tools and you do research and you you figure about you know you're researching the types of different tools when you start making something then you type your own tools so that's my type two this is this is my type one um and this is a boxwood that lee valley had these for sale for a really good price and but i guess the seller is this small company in france and they will not sell anything less than like i don't know ten thousand or something like that is their minimum order and still lee valley was like screw that we're not gonna buy anymore i was like no because i need these um so i can't get them anymore uh and i can't get the company in france to even return an email or a phone call so this is type one uh you showed type two but i'm working on tape three we have it in a nice walnut but that's not the what's the one that i want to show you guys is it this one nope oh okay so there we're getting now i'm getting fancy and i'm doing some some metal inlay on the inside or the end um and then here this is cherry but look at that we're getting we're getting very fancy we're getting very fancy here so um this is just me trying to figure out a new way to do this because um because the idiots in front of those were old threads or those like like like a like a light bulb thread or is that those are cut like a sharp thread they i cut them i have uh i have a pipe vise and um and one of these and i cut them all on a variety of things actually i cut them on a copper pipe i cut them on aluminum pipe i cut them on um it's electrical piping but it's actually like a it's a like a fiber it's a like a hard like a mdf kind of thing but harder even and there's a couple different varieties of that and that's actually what this is on the walnut one here is that its electrical um pipe oh i thought that was wood at first once it it is wood it's wooden glue um but or else it's fibery lash it's fiberglass that's what it is sorry not wooden glue so anyway this is type three and that's what i'm working on uh if i can stop uh saying yes to so many other things that i'm working on and i can sit down and and actually get those going um that's what i would like to do because i really enjoyed making those oilers and so i want to get back to you right yeah well thank you very much oh sure i appreciate it now i appreciate it brilliant we've got we've got two questions left then we've got one from andy and then we've got one from hank and then that's the we will call it a a bench talk finish then so uh andy andy brown do you want to ask yours there you go and moved it cheers ethan thanks a lot for the talk absolutely really nice sir going back to um your your heavily reworked one where you've got um the double bevel and then you've got the single bevel on the on the radius so if you just hold yours up a bit closer to the camera so that's you you go to really wide mouth yeah yeah so when you revolve revolve it round because this is the one no it's not which is the other one with the two scrolls then okay yeah that's it yeah so when you take it round you see you've got that flat bevel there yeah does that bevel go right to the edge of the radius of the of the body yeah so we've got the radius of the body and then the bevel goes to a further edge right up onto the onto the radius is so is that exactly the same height as the radius not ground down below the radius the out the outer circumference because i'm thinking that what you've got there is the original and then on the back which should be round yeah somebody ground out because that's where you use it when you're taking a more radius shave that it should actually not be ground away right so the guy who mullered it didn't move it that much because it was the same he's kept the original and taken it off the other side so i think the difference on this one is uh there's the original yes speak again um there's the original um and if you look at the other one here uh that's the one he added and this is only an eighth of an inch where that is a quarter of an inch and so what you end up with is a wider mouth um so it actually is for doing um a thicker shaving than a thinner shaving yeah yeah oh inside there there's i've got two different sizes of flat when you go inside there's um those two flats there are different sizes i didn't know whether you would actually different ones um just under half an inch a sixteenth uh seven sixteenths and the other one is uh closer to three i didn't know whether that would indicate which was the right way around well um on the on the later ones i think it has to be the there's only really one way to set it up uh because you can't reverse the blade on the later ones uh it's not there's not enough blade on it to do that it'd be interesting to see if they changed the body shape yeah along with losing the holes [Music] or or did did the holes come afterwards for a while i think the holes are first yeah or the holes came and then they dropped them again yeah yeah but um but no i was just thinking that that that radius there where it's not ground away at all could be could work where you're saying you grind you honed the inside yeah the guide edge of the cutter yeah um i'm just looking at this one's been honed as well a little bit but um i think you have to do it just a tiny bit just to to get a you know to get the perfect a good edge the other thing as well is he's getting this angle yeah to the radiator i've looked at my finger now so getting that that flat either there sorry oh let's get some straight so that's that's how it is at the minute yeah i mean on the miller's falls and that um kelly you've just showed it sits quite back like that so it gives a lot longer grind as such um andy you're talking about grinding it on the outside and he's suggesting that it should not be ground on the outside only on the inside um [Music] no you can't you can't grind on the inside that's where you sharpen it is on the inside not on the outside but that's just honing well i think what andy's saying is that that flat which is the face or the back of an i look at it as a plane iron that flat is ground flat and on my one it's really wide yeah yours is much narrower and i think it's ground back at an angle that's slightly but that angle doesn't matter because you just rotate it a bit more so that it's flat with the with the sole yeah i mean when you're just proud of the salt on the patent drawing um that that flat when it's set up is actually completely flat to the the flap that's on there yeah that's set in there right um now when i put mine around to that flat mine would actually pass a shaving below it you have to back it you have to back it off to open the mouth don't you so but no but but my my i've got that tiny tiny line across the top there that that doesn't show on the patent drawing on the patent drawer and it shows that that grind is below the radius sorry the circumference of the body this one's not this one's actually part of the succumbers of the body um oh i see yeah i see what you're saying now no this has not been altered at all do you think that's that grind there is what effectively is aware on a plane not not the wear but a wear you know you know when you have the front mouth you have the wear right which the black with the shaving runs up and and if you grind a a tiny bubble on that effectively it becomes a way if you just imagine the whole thing is flat instead of circular it makes a lot more sense i think that's the point so if you take that as the sole which you're pointing towards the camera now that tiny bevel that you've got there is effectively aware in the throat so therefore when you bring the iron up to it you're bringing the face of the iron up to it with the bevel above so it's a beveled down plane yeah and the the actual micro bevel on the inside of the cutter becomes the bevel up iron does that make sense and so therefore you're coming you'll cut it pretend it's a miter plane so you're bringing it round and the flat edge is the face of an iron that's in the miter plane and it's coming round and it's approaching the mouth and that gap that you've got there with the bevel on the body not the main bevel the little bevel is effectively the mouth inside does that make sense if you describe it like that so you've got to flat basically take the whole cylinder and flatten it out including the iron and then it makes sense and and again that's the way you sharpen it because you sharpen the face and i you know i don't know he said i wouldn't put any i mean i've not put any back bevel on that that face at all no i wouldn't put any bevel on on that no no no not so so it's just a micro bevel on the inner side of that cylinder and that effectively becomes a bevel up iron in what is effectively a miter plane isn't it yes yeah yeah yeah i would agree yep interesting yeah yeah i'm just intrigued that that my grind that flat grind isn't going on the patent drawing the patent drawing specifically shows it dipping under i mean maybe they just didn't ground yours enough well i'm thinking this could be why some people have so much trouble with it maybe it was a poor i'm just going to pick you up and but with yours andy the temptation is to rotate the iron or the cutter around so that it appears at the back of that sole right yeah you said it is sticking proud it is sticking proud isn't figure 2 in the patent drawing isn't figure 2 showing what you're showing us right now andy figure 2 yeah there you go figure 2 shows a different grind on one side and and less less width now compare figure two to figure one you see there's the your your round grind and then if you go up you see that's a larger and deeper yeah you've turned it that blade's been turned round no that's no that's not that's that's the that's the back of the blade and the the that's the back of the blade but you see the uh the uh inset uh bevel on the tube oh i see yeah yeah i agree i understand now sorry i thought that was a face that where the c is right i thought that was a face no it's not correct below this and the line's down below the c on that block which is marked x right that is that is red and is the thread yeah and is the throat of the mouth it's the front of the mouth then if you go down to figure two you'll see that that that flat portion is smaller go go you go yeah yeah it is you see but go to figure four where you've got a cross-sectional and you'll see that the iron comes round and is proud of where they're showing the sole plate so it's further out of the radius and so x is your soul and zed or z if you happen to be a rebel um is the point is the edge of the cutter and therefore you see down from zed you see it's completely flat and there's a micro bevel where the z is pointing there yeah yeah and there's nothing on the back of that uh cutter that cutter is just the end it's like the back end of an iron it's like the face of an iron yeah and there's nothing on the throat where next to to the left of the x yeah there's the x on the right hand side above the floor is x one and then just x yeah sorry so x1 is the bed x1 is the sole uh and then you can see if you look at the top of the x1 you can see a tiny tiny little indent when it goes across horizontally and that shows a tiny little wear so you've got if you imagine that as being a plain mouth you've got the edge the sole and the wear all three of them which allows the shaving to curl up around the cutter and then out of the throat where x is yeah and that's it the bit where my cursor is there now yeah that's the way it doesn't dip under it stays at the same circumference so it meets the edge of the cutter yeah before it actually it is now without putting that micro bevel on the inside edge there like easy i think you need to do that yeah you will need to have a micro bevel there because that is effectively the cutting edge otherwise you don't have a primary bevel the whole of the inside of the cutter is a primary bevel if you like but it like on any iron that's beveled up the primary bevel show presents no cutting surface at all it's just when you hone the edge to the primary bevel that you get the cutting edge where it meets the face or the back if you're american and and that's where the point of zed is that's back on the face yeah oh you've got well done i think that's okay yeah i've read the um the actual accompaniment to this and at no point does he mention having to put that uh micro bevel on um do i mean where do you when you buy a miter plate does it say you need to put a bevel on it it doesn't say you know it's you just do it because that's what you know i definitely think it's needed because otherwise that inner of the tube if you think of the cutter as a tube the inner surface is rough as the casting isn't it it has no cutting edge at all and you need two cutting edges of um flat that meets in a in a point of infinite infinity nothing yeah if you look also at figure one at the inside of the handle you'll see also that um that what we were saying is that the double ended uh rod you shouldn't be unscrewing the wood from the rod but the internal piece yeah it also shows a lot longer sorry it shows it a lot shorter than ethan's very very long one which would go deeper into the handle wouldn't it that's why he wears a kilt of course yeah well that that that makes sense because if you're trying to unscrew that handle from there every time and you've only got that short amount of thread it's going to it well the wood's going to give easier than the the tightness of the metal yeah they've extended the the thread further up the handle to obviously try and give some resistance because especially if it's gone when you take the threaded portion up of the rod you end the thread stops and then those threads sorry the the the part that's not threaded um becomes the compression fit across the top of all the threads that have gone before it it's only there it'll rust at point a one and that's why that's stuck and that's why mine's stuck which is not going to be by tomorrow i can assure you anyone oh um if anybody else has got um the the same thing where where i've got no no step between the outer circumference oh the gap a gap you're talking about oh right sorry yes yeah i've got a gap yeah it's that x1 from the circumference there's a tiny little gap yeah oh sorry i didn't see what you meant yeah that's do you put a marker above look where zedd is then what i do with mine i don't know if ethan does the same is i take the whole thing get a get a i've got a shapton stone and i just put the whole thing that way down so the the bevel inside face down on it tilt it slightly and just run it backwards and forwards sliding it on the bench so you're actually holding it at an angle on the chapter but you're moving the whole tube up and down the bench yeah yeah so you're just basically honing a micro bevel and and as ethan says it we're not talking about an inch you know you're only talking about i know it's a couple of microns you know so you're only honing the inside of the cutter where the face is already home lovely what one last question um hank has been hanging on for quite a while so hank over to you oh i'll attempt to be quick knowing that it's almost tomorrow for you guys i did post a worth point thing to the kelly version um that's in the chat um ethan did you ever compare these to the stanley 67s it was quite different uh no okay um yeah it's it's different because i think that's a flat blade yeah shave yeah so um and i was curious on your damaged version do you think that that's repairable or usable or is it just shot because they ruined that i mean it's completely usable as uh as a wider mouth version i mean that's where i was you know i was using that one to get these okay that was that one yeah um i don't have mine yet and if you guys snipe me on ebay i'm gonna shoot you all um where where are you riding the bevel are you riding the flat on this on the blade or are you riding on the barrel of the okay on there gotcha and so the angle of approach to the wood doesn't necessarily change because it's from that point on the barrel of the tool to the thickness setting of the blade to that gap that you're getting that thickness you can't really change the thickness of the of the shaving so to speak significantly um i think you can you can if you just by by rolling the blade back okay from the opening you can create a wider opening okay um but the problem is if you go back too far you'll get chatter yeah um so you know so there's tight you can roll it back okay and open it up a bit um but like i said if you go too far it'll be ugly cool well thanks this was really very enlightening but it's got a larger diameter so it can't get into the spaces that the cigar gets into brilliant and i just can i just quickly say jeffrey before i go there you go now somebody owes me a favor because somebody should have said the other handle is left hand thread so i've been tightening up for the last five years you didn't hear oh thanks very much mate appreciate it we thought you knew that oh jesus and uh so on that note i would like to say thank you very much to ethan uh the kilted uh woodworker for for entertaining us for for the best part of um well actually for some of us three hours um because great eric the americans were here uh uh early because of their spring forward um but ethan thank you very very much and if i could ask everybody to unmute themselves and to to raise their bench beverages and to uh the toaster ethan and the bench well done well thank you guys for having me i sure enjoyed it and i appreciate it it's a high-tech conversation on the low-tech topic live on the world wide web via soon bench talk 101", "ME8TzIP_BQY": "you know the site cigarpage.com tim here with you duck goose and an unaccessorizing uh unboxing of an accessory zycar zycar is a brand that you know i've talked about a lot and for good reason they're probably the best uh cigar accessory company out there they have a unheard of lifetime guarantee on their products that right there is awesome but then you know you don't even need to use it because all their stuff is so good lighters cutters multi-tools you name it they make it lots of different uh you know makes and models and colors and and versions so it's just it's a great company they make great stuff um and this is uh no exception let's take a look at the mtx multi-tool this is a little different than you know what you normally see you normally see like you know cutters lighters you know things like that this is kind of taking all the different accessories and putting them all into one one item minus the lighter of course but you see here it is uh pretty compact so can easily fit in your pocket whether that be shirt or pant or jacket but very very convenient and to use it you just have to unfold it like so so each each arm kind of bends out now when you first get one of these these folding points can be pretty tight in fact when it's when you first get it and it's fully closed like this it might seem almost impossible to open it it's not trust me it just might take a little you know little elbow grease a little muscle having one of these um pliers because i know tools really well uh pliers would help just you know get it get a little more uh leverage on it so this is not by xikar we don't sell this so but this is uh we do have it and the mtx multi-tool is uh pretty darn cool so you have it you uh you open it up and you see the main function of it is a cigar scissor cigar scissors are nice because it kind of gives you a little more um range of cutting you know with a standard cutter it's kind of you know you might not have for example let's say you have a really you know big torpedo 56 maybe even a 60 or engaged torpedo some cutters you might just feel like you you can't get as much of the torpedo tip off as you want i feel like with the scissor you just have a little more flexibility in how big of a cut you're gonna get so it's just different it's nice to have a little bit of a variety with how you're gonna cut the uh cut the cigars so you got that and then what makes it a multi-tool is these other little features here so i don't know if you can see this but you have a bottle opener always comes in handy a little um i guess that would be like a screwdriver item there or it could probably be used as uh like to tamp if you're a pipe smoker you can kind of push the tobacco down a little bit when you're smoking your pipe and then on the other arm you have another looks like different size screwdriver type tool and finally a little nice poker device there now i would suggest with this it's good for like you know um you can bleed your lighter with that that would be a nice uh use um you can also punch a hole in the capacit of the cigar if you don't want to cut it for whatever reason um and you can you know some lighters have like a little adjustable thing for the flame you can either use one of these or that but between you and i this is the one i'm going to be using the most of the bottle opener thank you very much i really like that function so there you have it you have the zykar mtx multi-tool cigar scissor little tool thingies foldable put it in your pocket take it with you show it off to your friends but uh really cool item and uh just another great product from xycar so there you have it i'm going to put this back now and have a wonderful day", "5GHhF7qMecA": "everybody mark from sticker view calm and tonight we bring you another cigar accessory review this one's another great product by our friends at sidecar this one's actually something a little different those of you that are familiar with sidecar know that we're big fans of their lighters and their cutters and they're pretty much well known for their teardrops tape cutter the the ones that everyone sees out there but I actually have a few other cutters out there as well as punches of course and this one is an ultra slim cutter it's called the x1 ultra slim and it comes in their traditional xikar boxers you can see here with instructions and information but take a look at this thing it is super thin it's probably about the size of that maybe like two credit cards it's that thin I'm you could see in my hand it is super super thin but you're getting a sidecar quality out of it this one in particular is the the gunmetal version there's retails for $49.99 as I cars website and we're gonna go ahead and give you a look at the front and the back this is a sixty-four ring gauge and it's literally three point five millimeters thinnest and that's roughly the size of two credit cards in your wallet so this is great it actually we've just recently reviews they're a loom lighter which are really smaller than their what they were used to this is another one this is for if you're dressing up you throw it in your suit pocket for work or you're out to dinner whatnot you'll never even know what's in there you'll always have yours like our quality cutter we're gonna go ahead and just give you a look in a second here so you can see right there you've got your guillotine cut and you've got the quality of the xikar lifetime warranty but the biggest thing with this that I've tried it's extremely lightweight this is gonna be super for portability and something you just throw in your bag and you don't worry about it the next day the size is about two and a half inches it's probably total weights about 1.5 ounces so again this is a great product that maybe some of you guys aren't familiar with but it's something I think everyone should have in their cigar accessory aisle because you don't always want to have the heavy bulky cutter this is something you can literally you can probably put it in your wallet if you want I'm not gonna say they're reinforcing that but it's a literally that thinner and I know while I have I can put five or six of our five or six credit cards in one spot so this is probably only your demas slide in your wall slide in your back pocket and it's really not going to have any influence on anything and it's clean it's discreet nothing pops out so it's perfect for a businessman or just even if only just an everyday cutter if you don't want to carry something heavy around they have different designs they have a gold one they have a silver one this one particular is in gunmetal and then you can even ramp it up and get one that is a carbon fiber and then you can even pair it up with a combination of a lighter so thanks for checking out stick review.com again this is the xikar ultra slim cutter available at Cybercom that's checking out stick review com", "GchCnXIgGUk": "alright guys today we got a dremel project so let's get started on it alright guys Tucker here that's nice nothing today we're gonna have a dremel project what we're going to be doing is we're going to take a bullet casing shell like this oh my 3030 Winchester rifle we're gonna turn it into a cigar punch kind of like this what it is it's a kind of like works like a little bit of a cookie cutter you put it into the back of the cigar and it punches a hole and that's what you can use to get smoke out of whenever you hit it now we're gonna be using today for the tools is the dermal we've looked at in the past couple videos and a small drill press vise but you don't need it this just makes it a little easier so let's get started on the case alright guys so we got our bullet our dremel here so first thing we're gonna do is we're going to put the Dremel in the vise here just that wait stationary kind of like a miniature bench grinder and we're gonna try to put a little bit of a edge on the on the bullet casing here just to give it a little sharpness that way digs in a bit better and cuts so let's get started on that alright guys we got the thing set up in the vise here so now we're just going to turn on set to 15 [Music] [Music] all right we got our bevel ground in here but I'm just gonna refine it a bit more and then move on to the next part [Music] alright guys I've switched to a little sander here so just to clean up [Music] [Music] [Music] all right she's cleaned up a bit they see dinner so next part we're gonna do here is we're going to cut out a channel probably right about there the bottom so that way once we get the slug punched in they can fall down there and you can get them out and then we're gonna go ahead and uh polish the whole thing and do some last bit refining on the edge we got up here alright so I'll switch out the bits and go alright guys now we're just gonna use that cutoff wheel here and start watching out our plug [Applause] [Applause] [Music] alright there's a plug cut out I'm just gonna refine shape [Music] [Applause] our Channel there's been ground in so what's gonna happen is whenever you punch it the plug will fall down in here and then you'll be able to just dump it out so there's a bit of a burr so we're gonna clean that up and then finish sharpening up our end here now I know this is brass so it's nothing to be super sharp but it's just gonna pretty much cut a leaf you know it doesn't have to be nothing super SuperDuper nice or anything like that so we're gonna head and get a small bit and clean up the inside here and then get to work on polishing everything up alright so I got a nice little stone bit here to get inside our hole here clean it up clean up any burr on the inside of this and then I think we'll be good alright let's get working on alright guys a sweet shout-out goes to yell mess at Island metal forge you guys probably heard of him he's channels grows pretty quick go check him he does some live streams and got some pretty cool work he's a nice guy go check him out guys show him some love let's get back at it all right now then find the edge of it I got a scotch-brite wheel here and we're just gonna do like we did before with the other two things and we're gonna take the scotch-brite over our hole here try to clean it up some and then try to clean up so many big scratches or anything we put in it and then I have a finer little felt abrasive wheel here that we'll use before we go to polish [Music] [Music] all right nice smooth created a small bird but we'll clean that up in a minute once we get past the felt wheel and then she'll be done right up till polish [Music] all right there we go nice thinned-out catches your finger a bit this is nice and smooth yeah next thing we're just gonna do is hook up the Polish wheel all right we got our polishing compound here we're just gonna turn this on [Music] Walter bullet here I got alright guys she's all cleaned up and polished and looking pretty nice so all that's left to do is a take her inside make sure I get all the buffing compound washed off of it you know in the inside spots where it might be rubbed into and then test her out all right see you guys in a second all righty guys she's all cleaned up nice and pretty nice shiny the sharp is you really get brass to me so let's bust out a cigar here see if she'll cut all right now oh this should work is we take this and we'll just punch a little hole in it right like that okay and then I shot some stuff here and our little little piece of cigar came out right here I'm right out the bottom like this supposed to there's our nice guy hole then crack it didn't crack the wrapper or anything made a nice bit plug one slider and enjoy the evening Hey say good cigar alright guys thanks for watching everybody here's

projects and like said this whole thing was done with the Dremel and it turned out really nice so like I said I recommend you guys go out get one guys", "wNNWwd8jkhU": "hey everybody I'm Tim and it's time to get cutting you're watching cigars daily [Music] in this video I'm enjoying a wet Wednesday the wise man from foundation cigars and it's just one of a bunch of great foundation sticks that you can find on cigars daily calm most cigar lovers have got a favorite cigar accessory to cut their sticks with and for you it might be a straight cutter or a V cutter or some kind of punch but eventually you're gonna sit down to smoke a good stick reach for your pockets and discover that you don't have the thing that you need to get into the amazing tasty flavor and for that reason it's good to have a couple of other items in your arsenal that you can reach for so you can still get into the thing and and still enjoy it and so I wanted to take you through some of the non-traditional ways of cutting into a cigar there's more than one of these and there's one thing that I know for sure a lot of you have got great ways of cracking open the cap without destroying this stick so I want to prompt you now drop a comment down below with your most most unorthodox cigar cutting techniques and if you guys are looking for some great other items to use in a cutter you can check there first but here are a few of the things that I've heard most people use as they found themselves without a cutter as you start looking around for something to use to cut into amazing flavor the first thing you got to know is what is the goal of cutting a cigar and maybe you're answering my rhetorical question by saying well Tim the goal is to cut the dang thing and you'd be a hundred percent right about that but there are things to know about cutting into a stick that'll make your experience a lot better and mostly it has to do with where you're gonna cut into the top of this thing I bring this up because I see this more often than not when people especially just getting into cigars tend to take a little bit too much off the top but when you're cutting a cigar a big and important thing to know is that the goal is just to remove the cap you can see right here that there's a little piece of leaf that is just draped over the top of the cigar and that little piece is what we call the cap now that is the part that you want to remove from the cigar and you don't want to cut beyond that because when you cut deeper and deeper eventually you're gonna risk the whole thing unwrapped and even if just the wrapper leaf on the outside comes off of your cigar it's going to completely change the flavor on the thing so as we talk about some of these things today these are ways to cut into a cigar without a cutter that also don't take way too much off the top the first and most logical place to look for an alternative to a cigar cutter is probably around your house somewhere in a junk drawer or in the garage you're gonna find opportunities to just get past the cap on your cigar create airflow so you can light the thing up and enjoy it but for me household items break down into basically two categories the first one is things that have blades on them like this knife right here I pulled this one out of the kitchen here at the cigars daily HQ but these things are great for cutting into a cigar and they're actually incredibly easy to use you'll see here that taking this knife you can just simply go around the cap of the cigar and that will allow you to accomplish the goal of just removing the lid basically from the stick and once you pull that singular piece of tobacco away you'll see that it looks basically like you've made a straight cut with an actual cutter it's gonna give you all the airflow you need and you won't have chopped your fingers off and you won't have ruined the stick now maybe you find yourself in a position where you don't have access to a knife or some kind of blade and if that happens to you I'll tell you this you should definitely make sure you've got access to a knife or some kind of a blade they've got like a nearly limitless number of uses and it's just a good idea to have one but if you don't then you're not completely sunk because there's other ways to break into amazing flavor without breaking a stick and not all of them involve removing the cap from a cigar if you're the type of person that likes using a cigar punch you already just puncture a hole in the cap and remove a piece of the leaf but there's other things around your house that'll do the same thing here I'm gonna use a finishing nail to just start pushing little holes through the cap of the cigar as you can see here I'm pushing more than one hole through it because the things a little bit smaller than a cigar punch but as you push sometimes three four or five holes into the top of a cigar you'll get all of the airflow to the stick to offer get an amazing drop be lining up and enjoying the flavor and never even know that you were missing your cigar cutter now let's talk worst-case scenarios let's imagine you don't have your cutter and you don't have any kind of blade or anything that you would like puncture the cap of a cigar with this would be the type of situation where you're like marooned on a desert island or at a Dave Matthews concert surrounded by Millennials that only have weed and vape mods if you're in this position you're still not sunk because you can cut your cigar the way that a lot of people who work in factories making cigars cut theirs and that's with your fingernails I'll show you the way that I do it here I'm sure there's other ways to go about this but typically when I don't have a cutter around I will just go around the cap of the cigar creating small incisions until I can pull the cap off and what I end up with is pretty much a straight cut just like if you used a cutter this is the kind of thing that I actually do with some kind of regularity because it's convenient because my hands are always on my body but it takes a little bit of practice and as you get better at it you'll find that you'd probably pretty comfortable way to go about it and you might even leave your cutter at home from time to time now I can already hear fingers tapping and formulating comments to say Tim I bite my fingernails and they're never long enough to actually cut a cigar with and if it's the case for you I'll tell you you shouldn't bite your fingernails I'm told that's a really good way to get a horrible virus but if your fingernails are too short to cut a cigar you're still in the clear because you can use one thing that most people have and that's your teeth and this is the kind of thing that you see in old western movies a lot where the the stalwart cowboy comes into town and bites the end of his cigar off but you don't want to do it in the old western style and use your molars to rip the end of the stick off it's just a good way to fill your mouth with loose tobacco and it's really gross instead use your front teeth and just make the similar little incisions to what I showed with the finger nail exercise just to pull that cap piece of tobacco off the stick and I just slobber on the thing it'll inevitably soften up make it a little bit easier and if you're looking for more ways to do this I want prompt you to check out the comments below where other people are gonna put some of their creative ways of doing this maybe you've used a bullet casing or some other clever thing you find around the house all of us have got junk drawers filled with amazing stuff and while you're at it check out cigars daily calm because we've got great deals on cigars and accessories and subscribe right here

line this is their rodeo cutter and their New York lighter hi I'm Brian Glen of cigar obsession calm let's start out with the rodeo cutter this is a very basic unit it is a double guillotine like you've seen a million times what sets us apart is the solid metal construction it's extra thick and of course it has this beautiful ink elect design on both sides and it actually carries over a little bit onto the thicker profile sides there's not much to say about it as far as operation it simply works as it should and there's no better compliment I can give to lawyer nothing sticks out the holes are large enough for my large fingers on par with the original Cuban crafters perfect cutter the blades are as sharp as any cutter I've ever seen absolutely easy resistant lists butter cuts as small and as straight as you want absolutely perfect cuts obviously it is a completely open design so you do have to know exactly where you want to cut it but these come in very handy for cutting cigars in half or cutting off parts that you want to save for later or cutting off parts that tunnelled etc etc etc great lighter cutter sorry it does work very nicely it is very smooth there's no binding but there's no slop that's it it works if you're looking for this type of design if you want something that stands out if you have larger fingers if you're not a fan of the Cuban crafters where it has the back on it this is a great option this fits me the best of any normal open guillotine lighter and I prefer this over teardrop shaped or pinched type guillotine cutters primarily because they don't fit my hands as well you know they're they're tiny in my hands and trying to pinch one side and the other evenly this just works so much easier for me complete personal preference obviously it's a design based purchase option all right on to the lighter I just realized I probably could have used that cigar to shade the lighting but this will work okay the New York later obviously an iconic design you've probably seen this or the dozens of copies of it over the years this guy is the original very simple lightweight low-cost pocketable lighter design it has some good features though it's not just your basic 295 Walmart special where I've seen pretty much most of these in the like the 19th aisle where the tobacco is you know you see these copies behind there it's got a manual flip up lid but it has a mirror for those of you that want to check your cherry while you're lighting it I don't personally use that I just you know turn it around and give it a blow like you don't say it like you see in my videos but it's there okay doesn't have a manual release or anything and it doesn't lock but there's no big edge to catch yeah it might flip open in your pocket I suppose but this button has a lot of resistance actually ignite so you'll have to worry about it doing anything bad in your pocket another joke there I know does have a little loop here to attach to a keyring on the bottom basic controls just a tiny little adjustment screw but it does have a few window and it does have a decent size reservoir it's not just the bare minimum so I like that bigger the reservoir that you can cram into any lighter the better because pre filling so far nobody likes doing this is just the spring actuator for the flip top now the cool part is the way it looks you do have quad torches they are a nice tall design I'll show you in a second it's a softish flame you can toast with this so it's not a direct hard touch up only or massive burning flame but the cool thing is it does have colored burner plates so you get a nice sweet yellow and then red flame but you can see the nice soft tail I kind of wave it around it looks a lot like my prometheus that I love so if you're into toasting cigars and you do have the option I just run out of fuel yep yep okay it's running out real quick but here's my point I was gonna make you can't toast with it however big caveat oh come on alright stand by I get a refill to show you this okay so there's the ultimate test of the reservoir I got about a dozen cigars out of that fill and that's with my toasting 2030 seconds so that's about it anyway not much wind resistance blows right out so if you're in really any kind of breeze not a great option you're gonna have to you know go for cover so there's that I was really hoping when I saw those color plates that it would be very wind resistant because usually they kind of double duty they give you a cool little color thing which okay it's just for looks but sometimes they will hold the ignition flame down there close to the burner and stop it from going out so it doesn't just know that going in there just for looks but if you're looking for something primarily indoor or calm air and you want something relatively inexpensive that's gonna work every time very solid construction but lightweight decent-sized reservoir and a cool red flame this might be an option for you so there you go there's your new Uruk lighter and that's really cool double guillotine ah cutter thank you very much to jet lines for sending both of these guys in greatly appreciate it stay tuned for more

great new product for cigar city humidors that is made by our sister company Park Lane this is a stainless steel cigar retractable blade cigar punch cutter with a keyring or tracks with the push of a button and cuts to a perfect quarter inch cut my favorite personal my favorite cut we generally had cigar soda humidors won't sell any products that we wouldn't use ourselves and I absolutely love this cutter it's a little heavier than you think it would be it's comparable to some of the more famous brands of cigar cutters but without the more famous price as they retract button right on the

happy to take care of it for you but that's pretty great a little heavy duty cigar cutter retractable button you press the button on the front here to pop the blade back in and then you just simply

Park Lane", "o4i_huRx4-8": "[Music] evening guys now if you've been watching over the past few days you've seen me tease some new lighters and cutters that have come in I've been testing today is a day for getting them reviewed he also saw me tease them with a little more detail in the seal fans group these are some pretty cool stuff they are fairly specialized and there are a couple industry firsts here to show you they're all from Calibri brand new batch of stuff coming out so let's get into it I first want to say that this is almost 2018 right now 60 ring gauge is very much a standard size nothing produced new should not work perfectly with a 60 so I will be testing the cutters with a 60 now you may have seen in Wednesday's video when I last used this one this is called the SV cut and it is simply a two and one cutter few very unique features about it first of all you have a V cutter on one side a regular guillotine cutter on the other side however it's not just a straight-through cutter it is like a perfect cutter from Cuban crafters that you've seen me cut thousands of cigars with does have a little bit of a backing so you put your cigar in to the guillotine side and it stops right at the perfect depth and then you can make your plunge cut v cutters they have that built in it's part of the design of being a V cutter so your cigar fits 60 fits in absolutely fine and you make your cut now before I get to the actual cut which is the most important thing heavy cutter in my opinion go through the cutter itself number one heavy this thing is heavy and a lot heavier than it looks when you go to pick it up you have I don't want to say rubber but they are coated they feel like a very thin rubber like paint material on the ends here so you can set it down on a table and not have to about scratching it's not just bare-metal does have a little bit of a protective coating on it everything is riveted together solid Center is metal let's got some knurling on it other than that it looks like two distinct cutters that have been pressed together even has a little bit of a seam line down the center you've got a single spring action button slash lever that pops it open very solid action stays up just up there with any other Calibri very nice spring action no creaks just a little bit of tension on it and it goes all the way through to the cut without any resistance and then just simply latches in place barely any effort required I don't have any worries about this type of design coming open in my pocket there are some out there that have side pinches or a press down button to pop it open I'm not a fan of those but these on the colibri or the zai cars as most people are familiar with never a problem it's it's just not gonna catch anything even pressing hard you do actually have to give it a little bit of an oomph it is a small sized button I do prefer the larger ones because I have big hands and they just feel better it it's not a negative nothing to take away from the cutter but just note it alright so the actual test let's go ahead and try the V cutter first V cutters are extremely popular even though you don't see me do it too much I don't have any fault with it usually they perform absolutely flawlessly to me I just prefer the open draw it's personal preference put it in quick cut absolutely no effort I can't even feel it cutting and that's the best thing you can say about a cutter there we go that is beautiful no stragglers scooped it out like an ice-cream cone perfect nothing bad to say now it does capture it in the center here just pop it open to clean it let's go and try the guillotine side with a fresh cigar got a bunch of them here cuz we're gonna be doing a bunch of tests so like I said it hasn't stopped put it in same thing absolutely no resistance it did kind of swoop it up a little bit I'm gonna do another one just to check maybe I need to put a little bit more pressure on the cigar itself but it was an effortless clean cut that's most important that's gonna make sure that you're not damaging your cigar it's not pinching it it's not gonna try to crack it or unravel it I can live with a little bit of a flare in the cut it doesn't do anything let me try just because it's a weird angle here I'm not actually doing it like I normally would cut a cigar it's usually down here towards my lap but so you guys can see it's up here so I'll put a little bit more pressure as a cut now it's still there so it is a feature of the way it cuts it we'll leave that a little bit of a lip on the one side it's kind of a ramp up in the tobacco so I guess that's the only negative thing you could say but like I said it doesn't actually affect anything so don't really care that much but if you're looking for a combo cutter certainly something with very nice design this one is definitely something to could at least consider this is the new Daytona single jet lighter very simple design reminiscent of many you've seen throughout the years comes in many different colors this one is obviously the green pretty much like a Kawasaki green many of you are bike guys does have a couple cool features number one to actuate it you just press on one side excuse me a little frog in my throat the other side even though it kind of looks like the same button it's a huge fuel window love fuel windows I can see it bobbing right there just about the middle mark decent storage tank on it it doesn't hold as much as you think fills up in about a second but enough to go through at least half a box of gars I filled this up I've lit maybe seven or eight cigars and you know we're about halfway down so about there and I've been playing with it here and there don't say it that's what she said ah so when he pressed the button it opens the window at the top for protection and you have a very precise single jet very good win for protection on this up there with the best of them this is not gonna go out in any kind of natural wind and it takes quite a bit of puff to actually blow it out does have a half safety feature this will not protect you from accidentally squeeze get somehow in your pocket I'm not a fan of that I prefer something with a separate cover where the button doesn't actuate the cover and the flame just my personal preference but it does have a ball safety valve so if it's added any kind of an angle there's a little ball inside a little ball bearing that rolls into place and prevents it from being squeezed so if it's in anything but the up side or right side up position it's protected in your pocket but if it's like this and somehow you managed to squeeze it it will like just be aware it's very lightweight it is all metal except for these sides no other features about it and just have a nice big thumb wheel for the adjustability and that's it it is a very basic single point jet lighter that's not gonna be for everybody single lighter single jet lighters are great for touch-ups anywhere you need precise flame they're great for on the smaller side of things but once you get into the big ring gauge cigar I'm not a fan of the single or even most dual jet lighters they just take too long and you don't end up toasting the whole cigar at a time you're doing it in stages and it's just not great compared to a triple or quad any of the larger flames those are what you want for the larger size cigars now conversely those aren't great for touch-ups because you just end up you know touching the whole thing up and maybe just wanted a little spot on a side that was burning wonky so their pros and cons to both ways but very lightweight very compact no problems fitting in your pocket so this guy might be the most exciting to some of you this is called the quasar tune one table lighter obviously meant to be on a table it is quite hefty it feels like it weighs a good three pounds a lot of solid metal here you have I don't even know what you would call this kind of design it's it's a cube but it's got pyramid points on all sides the bottom is rubber so it is going to stay put where if you put it on your table and you've got a big unscrew vil bottom here where you can clean everything out because it does capture everything cut internally making sure I still don't are meeting in there so very much like the other two and one I just showed you this one has a guillotine and a V cutter built in and you just press it it's spring-loaded and as it sits on the table that's all you have to do it'll capture itself when it comes down just like the handheld very cool design so let's give it a test here I'll tell you I'm much more a fan of these types of normal cutters where it's a normal guillotine or normally cut built into something rather than the typical quintessential shop or upper level home table cutter where you might have seen it with the lever action and the three or four different types of scoop blades that went I hate those things nine times out of 10 they're just gonna rip and tear the cigar sometimes correct to shoulder their nasty they're disgusting nobody ever cleans them you see a lot of guys going mmm like ah don't want to see that I'm just not a fan of the way they cut my cigars if I have to use one of those I only use the smallest v cutter that seems to give the cleanest or best odds at least of not destroying your cigar so let's give this guy a shot checking the size it is identical to the handheld unit and you do have the same stops it seriously the construction looks identical the only difference is the housing it's in and the weight so let's try the guillotine first I have no doubts as to what it's going to do effortless cut now this one interestingly does not have the shelf I don't know if it's the extra poof that you have to give it or if it's just the inertia and it's not moving at all and the other one maybe right at the end where the blades clipped together it kicks out a little bit and this one doesn't I don't know but this one gives an absolutely flat cut perfect effortless you don't feel like cutting whatsoever all you feel is the spring you can't say anything better about it don't put it back up you just give it a pop I don't know if it'll come back out and up it does fully capture everything so let's go and try the v-cut and yes I've been using all this stuff I know how it performs so I have no worries about it fits right in effortless straight as an arrow it looks like the cigar was molded with the v cut again that's the best you can say about any cutter so there you go this is the new Lotus t5g in grey and black this is a large pocket lighter very reminiscent at least size-wise and performance wise of the Prometheus triple T that you guys have seen me again make thousands of cigar lights with over the years this one is very simple in design but it does have some cool built-in features number one it's heavy it is actually a little heavier than the prometheus even though it's just slightly smaller we have all-metal design except for this little bit of trim here which is plastic and the button itself I'll get to that in a second it's a very simple actuation you just press the button and you have your gate at the top and then a very nice burn with excellent wind protection just like the Prometheus it extends up I'm looking here against a dark background about three inches so not quite as big as a Prometheus but certainly more than big enough to slow toast any cigar no matter what the ring gauge lights very easily it's very comfortable in the hand even though these edges may look sharp they do have a nice contour to them feels good in my hand I don't have anything poking in the corners as sometimes happens now on the bottom we do have a couple different punches love to see that you've got a standard size and then a slightly larger one for some box presses single caps delicate wrappers or very large ring gauges that maybe you don't have a cutter that will produce a nice clean cut with punches are great that's about the only time I use them and usually I'll do like a cloverleaf and make it into a normal cut just using the punch they are very sharp [Music] when it Springs open here just stays up the top and then flips back down there's no button to press cuts through like butter and there you got your flat works as designed nothing you can say about that other than good on you works as designed you also have a fuel window it is small but it is functional it'll let you know basically when it's nearing the end of its range a little hard to see because it's just flat on the side I do prefer them to see I do prefer them actually on the side of the unit where it can catch a little bit more light and it's easier to see the fluid or where they're colored so you get a bright red color to the actual butane but it works no complaints there you have your intake vent here on the back and it's got a nice steel mesh now the only two things I'm not too fond of about it number one there's no protection whatsoever from going off in your pocket and this one would actually go off fairly easy easier than the previous lighter I showed you where you have to pinch the side this can be upside down now protection wise this does also have a ball bail protector you cannot ignite it or squeeze it when it's in the upside down position it does allow the butane to come out but it doesn't click to actually ignite the flame so there's that just reaching the point here where it'll fire off right there it's about a 45 degree angle tilt it up anyway that's when it will trip the only negative thing I have to say about it is the actual button it feels great it looks great it's a decal and it's the thick kind of almost springy vinyl where it's got a real big thick pad of clear vinyl over top of the design so it feels very nice to push but some of you have already seen it the dang assembled it crooked the actual decal is just off it's an attention to detail kind of thing no it's not any big game you could take this off in two seconds just peel it off with a razor use some kind of adhesive and stick it back on but come on it should have been done right from the factory especially it's it's the label it's the company logo should be perfect it's the first thing your eye goes to I don't maybe it's photographer I'm being over critical but when something like that is off come on I gotta mention it but like I said nothing against the lighter itself right after this review I'm gonna go ahead and peel it off and fix it just so I don't have to look at it because that every time I look at it that's what I see anyway beautifly tur great results actually lighting a cigar got flame up to about here it's like I said not quite as big a flame as a Prometheus but it's darn close and it is very comfortable in the hand I will say it's not quite as comfortable for a very long duration as a side button like the prometheus especially I feel like me with big hands because it's easier to grip it like a pistol grip than to use my thumb and pressure it that way it doesn't take a lot of pressure but over 3040 seconds you at least notice it I could hold the prometheus for 10 minutes and it's like holding a beer you know it nothing so I do prefer the sides but it toasts just fine does its job a little bit of a hissing there that smells good [Music] thank you very much - lighter usa.com for sending these in for review greatly appreciate it and to show their appreciation

V Cano has been a kind of speeding around for a very long time and the inexpensive ones mike do you hear that do the v code on the Torp you okay my tell them if you want to off-camera why why it is that Mike seriously has kind of revolutionized the V cutter in terms of promoting it we had a V cutter here that was like on the table that was a table v cutter that they literally literally got worn down I mean to the nub almost it was so overused people really love it Mike's gonna bring in right now this is one of our this is one of our earliest cutters that we ever had here this is from a company called Boston cigar cutter company I believe they're still in existence they are not cheap this unit itself runs probably the five hundred dollar range four to five hundred dollars or even more now how much more would you say 15 750 the thing about this cutter I'll take it apart so you can see it as well it has a very nice that's pretty clean from last Sunday it has a nice nice mechanism in it that when you put the cigar on the top all you do is simply push it down and drag the wheel to not drag gently pull the wheel down and it cuts this v cut out but this thing is remarkable i mean this thing its domain in in West Newbury Massachusetts they're still made here in the United States I'm not sure what the wood is it probably is like a walnut or something like that but they do make a pocket one I remember when we had that the last time it was about a hundred eighty dollars which was too pricey for the style of cutter that they had at that time but when I go to the retail show in July it's one of those things I'm always interested in looking at it what are some new cutters but might literally kind of you know promoted single-handedly promoted the V cutter to wear a lot of people use it now and might tell them why it is that you like the because you're really a big fan of it I've only used a few times but why is it what do you like about the be cut compared to straight or bullet when I was in at the kamacho factory I was smoking a villa cosa or torpedo and I was using a guilty right in one of the master rollers down there actually pulled out his be cutter and showed me his Vika and explain why he uses a vegan of belicoso because all cigars are roll with a center flute and if you cut too far down on a belicoso you can brush that flute but if you use a v cut it opens up the flu so that you have a better draw and what do you mean by a center flute all cigars basically have a center flute so like a center core center cookin like a strong in the right basically which helps funnel the heat smoke up and down and most people on a guilty cut the tip too far down so they crushed that flute and the only other way to smoke a bellicose Oh is on the flat surface to do a bullet cut right but most people can't stick the cigar at that far into their mouth in its a variant for me a very unusual and uncomfortable way to smoke it it gives the smoke directly goes in different palate and some cigars are very spicy and it gets a little hot interesting now that so what you would recommend is doing we've got a cigar here it's the Florida Oliva and but Mike is saying is normally and the way that I've seen people do it incorrectly is where they'll take a straight cut like this when I cut a you know back in the day I remember we said guys come in here and they do lectures and say oh you should cut it like at a 45 degree angle or on the bias with the x axis and the Z and then calibrated ratio to the Sun and the thing is ninety-nine percent of your guys are going to come in here they're not interested in even listening to that let alone doing it so what I always tell guys is start and cut as little as possible right but most people cut it down they I have a guy that comes in at least one once it once a week I can I think you know I'm not going to say his name but i think you know his cigar i'm just gonna say he smokes Maduro caos and I will watch him cut it and he will cut the cigar right here every time and I look at and I think to myself why are you even buying a belicoso at that point you're completely defeating the purpose the idea of having that pyramid like shape or we're going into a cone is that you are like as my excited you're funneling more of the smoke the flavor into a narrower area area and people ask me when when they look at cigars as an example like I'll just take a Liva the aleve of V has I don't know how many different sizes in that range we say eight different ones at least something like that eight to ten eight to ten and people look at I said it's the same tobacco all the way through but the amount of tobacco that they put in lengthwise and the amount of tobacco that they bundle will give each cigar a unique taste and yeah I know you and I always talk about the illusion we like the 68 in the 88 which is one of the first things we talked about same tobacco but we just like a different size so let's go ahead why don't you do the honors of cutting it with the V cutter I'm kind of showing everybody what that looks like firstly as I said you put the tip to you can't put it in any further cut it off and the thing that's really cool is it's almost like it's I don't wanna say it's idiot-proof because anything and you have can get crushed but the thing is with any cutter doing something some people try to go really really slow some people try to go too fast and then kind of jerk it it's somewhere in between it's a positive clip and it's just one of those things with time people get used to it they know how to do it it does a really good job I mean it's one of those things this is by the way the psyche are one I believe it's just the Luminum I don't think it's titanium I think it's aluminum but they come in it's really cool their anodized they have all different colors this is an anodized blue I think we have a black I know that there's a silver gun metal they make a great product and this one is pretty reasonable too i want to say it's something about what thirty dollars something like that it's on there I don't think this one someone's lacks a price but they're not expensive and they like everything else it's got that lifetime warranty so it's a really cool product I don't know if we have any other of the other v's but it's one of those other cut it's just a great cutter I think the other one since you kind of touched on if you want to do bullet cuts right now i'll show you one of the earliest bullet cuts that i ever saw this literally is a bullet and the company making it they made this a long time ago i don't know if it has this actually just as forming 244 Remington mag so it is from a you know real shell casing if you will obviously it's you know not a real bullet but this one the idea was that you would take the cigar and well here I'll do it on the one that hasn't been cut here so you'll take it and as you put it to the cigar you would twist it the problem with this old one is and you can't see it but is a role piece of metal so it's not a single piece I mean it's a single piece but there is an edge the problem was if you did it the wrong way it would catch and tear the cigar so you always had look at it and kind of make sure that you weren't tearing into the cigar and as you did it you had to turn it one way and eventually you could pull it out and it would take a plug out of the scarf the problem with this was is that then after you cut several cigars how do you get the tobacco out the only way you could do was to stick something like a pencil in there or you go old school style pull the whole thing out dump it squeeze the unit back and then make sure it went in place without cutting yourself again and if you push it on a table enough time it would get dull this was this was back in the day when you could carry these on the airplane you can imagine this day and age carrying this on an airplane would not good yeah he's got a connect sagging that you tackled the strip search but that was really the first one that we had here in the shop John have you ever had an expert do you like the bullet cut at all I never use them now we're done I don't know only because that reason I mentioned before is the tower buildup and that's just a personal preference that I have no I don't really use bullet cut the full of punches at all but they do have their place in and people are using that's all I use them for is just to every cigar they spoke and always do a bullet punch but personally it's not my sort of thing but very popular this was another one that we carried years ago to this one kind of took care of the idea of having it but it had some other drawbacks too and I'll just cut the same thing same kind of idea but a big a bigger bullet cut you push it in and it takes a bigger chunk out and then kind of crack cuz I've already cut it once and then it had this extractor the problem with this one was that it had this well if you put it in your pocket the cap would inevitably fall off you I mean if this one is so weak this has got to be 15 plus years old it's very very old this is kind of one Mike brought this up this is a disposable one this has a very tiny hole so if you're doing something like a ring gauge that's under 40 this would work and they're not very expensive this one is essentially disposable you're not going to sharp it up again but that those are kind of cool then ah though came out with one of the kind of the top-of-the-line ones where it was a very smooth operation this one has been you know it was in my pocket for years and they they came in a gold and a silver and a kind of a gunmetal a great cutter though the thing is still super sharp and all I'll do is just I'm going to cut into the side here which obviously you would never do unless you're making a flute but you cut in here to the side and you can see when you cut in here I don't know if it'll come out because it's not really the cap but it does the same thing where it pulls a little plug out and then the extractor is just you twisting and it pops right out I've never had any issue with this thing opening in my pocket some of the lesser quality ones people would have an issue where they put in their pocket and over time it would kind of unscrew and it would be rubbing against metal in the pocket that wasn't a very good idea since then other companies have come out with some really nice ones like zai car of course as we keep going back to we like their product because they they work this is 30 bucks but this one is just a beast you pull it out and it has a very large ring gauge and then you can close it simply by pushing it together and it extracts the bit of tobacco there and then this is one of the newer ones and this one's kind of interesting this has a twist punch is what they call this this one is huge but it has almost like a set of ball bearings that when you click it kind of clicked something yeah ratchet is a perfect way to describe it it's got a huge hooters yeah like a lipstick it's got a huge hug but this thing it feel how heavy that is now that is sala de I really shoe heavy for me I would not carry that in my pocket only because it is so heavy but it would be cool to put that on a golf bag cause it's got the key ring some place where you're not going to lose all it is quite heavy i just want to i want to give a bit of a plug for psycho as well i think we're pretty lucky to have a company like this I car is very committed to cigar smoking and their products the R&D department really do a great job that it's it's engineered very well the quality and plus their lifetime warranty it's a it's a relief to have a company whose very committed because we've had sometimes been in the past we've had a lot of products come in and out and but we've never had a company just really over engineered their products and took care of you if it did happen to have apparently it's so we're very proud to be a stockist of zokar also while we do carry a lot of the range that they do make here in the store but there is a lot of products that we cannot carry every product but we can order any product of that you wish from zaika and have it in the shop here to limit so you're very pretty happy with these products I think it goes right there there you go are you out Joe all right all right Yankee Joe's out of the house oh that's what I was going to do next that's my next show my personal one well that takes us to we've covered the straight cut we've covered you your bullet cuts weave cover you know the psyche are the newer style of cutters but what we haven't done is covered the scissor cut listen this is a cut but you think that's right where do we have bounces yeah you have that says what I've noticed this the scissor cut here is more what you see in somebody's den or some restaurant yeah or a restaurant or you would have a cutter at a say restaurant where you can smoke and the waiter would cut your cigar for you and you sir that would carry one of these because they're very elegant it's quite a good-looking car demand and this cut quite well the reason I like these they give you a lot of control especially if you were a newer person people are like John said you're not going to carry this in your pocket because it is so unwieldy but it does allow you to have tremendous amount of control you can go slower with it it will still cut very well if they make an excellent product and yeah we can show with this particular cigar so if you cut with it you can see how you can just get right where you will need it to cut your hands not going to shake as much as if you're using something like as I car works like a spring-loaded device and it allows you to just remove the cap and it really does it does do a good job I've not familiar with this particular one where do we get that one from the one I really like is no it's sounds like we're companies I car but we are this is my personal one with a little pickpocket device here as they call we're just hangs on your pocket the reason I like this one though it is folding to collapsible one and I carried this for many years in my in my pocket but the thing that's nice about this one it also comes with some tools which a lot of people look and they're not really sure what they are they come with things like a little flathead it comes with this little point where people say oh is that for your cigar to poke a hole and I said you could use it but typically what this is for is to drain out your lighter that's one of the things that people don't normally do we'll talk about that when we get to lighters but every so often you'll get a bubble in your lighter line and it will cause the lighter to sputter by draining it out then refilling it with your butane it allowed to perform a lot better it also comes with some other little tools as well like a little bottle opener this little kind of Dimmick device but this is a full-size scissors you can see the difference between this one and the other one this one opens up to a much larger ring gauge and even though it doesn't seem like it would be as large as that when my fingers fit a lot nicer a lot easier into this unit and let's see so we'll use this one right here and you can see it's the same kind of idea I have more control over this because it's my own personal one and it just cuts off just the cap as you can see that's all you want to cut off is the cap that's on the top of the cigar you don't want to cut too far down the big cardinal sin as we as we saw before are these people who do this incorrect cut which is sacrilege I'm going to do it here and they'll do this and they'll cut not only you can see a couple things that just occurred one the cigar exploded to its starting to unravel because I've cut too far down and that's the danger when cutting any cigar typically being a belicoso being a pyramid be it something that's like a straight you know Churchill size cigar it's one of those things where people will get overly ambitious in their cigar cutting but the scissor cutter can take care of that these are great and I think they're I think they're $30 something like that and they are a great unit once you learn how to work with them they are they disappear in the pocket because even though they look larger they're very they're flat they don't take a lot of space up and it's a great product I really like it i've turned people kind of onto it the way i discovered we weren't carrying them in the store I wanted to check one out so I ordered one from a company and it came in and I've been a fan ever since might just hand me this one this is kind of the extreme version this is something from zai car this is they're really expensive I think that's probably one of their top of the line units here it's about three hundred fifty dollars like why is it so expensive what item is it it's a silver wanna see a titanium metal silver it and it's the same price point as your cutter that you got at 250 so the price has gone up oh my gosh so mind is no longer 250 its 350 I guess I got in that the ground floor while the gettin was good so I think that pretty much covers it but if you do have any questions of course you can send us an email at info at Liberty tobacco calm you can address it to either myself Ben or two Aussie John or to Mike Gallagher here at the shop and any of us can answer a question if it's on facebook which is really easy way

millimeter cigar cutter Swiss Army knife and I can tell you right now although this particular Swiss Army knife has seen a bit of use and taking a bit of abuse I like the stainless steel scales a lot they look really neat I thought they'd look real cool like unstuffed as well they kind of need looking in for quick comparison I mean I just like looking at stainless steel I don't know if I like to look at the stainless steel enough to give up my my pin and tweezers and toothpick etc and stick pin but I like looking scales you know it this one has a corkscrew and it's got an it's got no on the flip side you pick up can't open it and then when your bottle opener you got small it's small nail file and cleaner large knife blade and then you get the the cigar cutter scissor things the actual cigar cutter I still kind of feel like a James Bond villain with this something it's kind of a neat knife and I like the same let's just scales as you can tell though no toothpick no tweezers it's it's it's fairly heavy I mean it's it's it's what it's on the heavier side for the size of the knife it is because I'm assuming the scales these look nice now I'm gonna link in the description for the Swiss Army knife wiki page for this also Victorinox has a cigar cutter knife as part of the one in the some of the knives they brought over from winger I'll include a link for that as well I think it's the cigar 79 it's the one it matches this one I'll include a link I'll put a link in the description for it if you want to check that one out but yeah it's cool look at knife I don't know if it's worth what you lose the stainless steel but you also like this knife right here there's nothing that should break I mean like there's no like I can tell from my every day carry knife like I've taken tips out of the scales I've taken you know this isn't one actually it's kind of miraculous this isn't one that I've accidentally super glued to my hands that's happened a few times I have a at least two different Swiss Army knives where I was I was doing some something with superglue and I was holding the knife and my my fingers got super good to do the scales yeah anyway the solution by the way is just to pull it off you leave a bit of your fingerprints on him but you know such is life anyway so it just seems like this would be an extra tough knife don't you think if you're a pro or anti stainless steel scales I me know in the comments and if you've enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and hope you all have an excellent day", "mR_AARRGpnM": "hello and welcome to white glove reviews in this video we're gonna be taking a look at the Victorinox cigar cutter or cigar knife and this is the silver Alex won actually I don't think there's a nun Alex won okay this one is the silver Alex won and this is a 74 millimeter one kind of the same it's in the same size category as like the executive so it's bigger than the classic smaller than the traditional ninety-one millimeter kind of a nifty looking life now I consulted a friend of mine who is a cigar aficionado for some of the specifics about this knife and he has one of these and I can tell you that his only complaint about a knife was the lack of a keyring and I don't really understand the premise behind not having a keyring but I haven't run across a cigar related knife yet that has one and if I'm wrong let me know in the comments cuz I've been looking at him like even the old winger ones and I haven't seen a cigar knife that has a keyring and I think my friend would like one if they exist so I'm you know keeping that out for so this one has the the usual pin blade it's pretty long I mean it's it's longer than the 58 millimeter classic size so you need some a teeny bit longer it has the nail file it has the nail file same size as the classic and it has a pair of scissors and one of the kind of funny things about the 78 I'm 74 millimeter Swiss Army knives is they kind of elongated the scissors there they're the same kind of the blades are the same size as the classic but it's like it's stretched out and just for you know size comparison I'll show you the scissors the scissors on the 91 millimeter are obviously just in every way bigger and dirtier the in every way bigger but compared to the classic they just kind of got stretched out now the thing that makes this this knife kind of interesting is it has a cigar punch and it's listed as a cigar cutter but I consulted an expert my friend and he explained to me the purpose for this and so what it is is you want to cut the ends of your cigars off so you can inhale better puff better you're not supposed to inhale or get in here in lungs wherever you're kind of supposed to puff out them anyway island but what it is is you have three different sizes and he said the different sizes correspond to different types of cigars or the six cigars and cigarillos and he said something else anyway I don't I don't smoke cigars so I'm just kind of repeating what he said but what it is is the different sizes he said are very useful because you can minimize what you cut off depending upon the size of your cigar or cigarette or whatever and it's kind of neat but so he has one of these and he said that his chief complaint and the only thing that he doesn't like about it is the lack of keyring because he wanted to carry it he would want to carry it on his keys so apparently it's pretty useful and I don't know what the verb is to to cigar it's pretty useful as a cigar Aang but it does need a keyring apparently and I mean I can see it because it's it's a decent weight it's not super heavy but the aluminum scales and just the amount of metal in the knife itself make it it make it substantial enough that it's I mean you can notice the weight it doesn't feel super light it's probably like maybe three ounces something like that not super heavy but it's kind of cool-looking knife it sort of resembles the money clips anyway if any of y'all are cigar aficionados and you've tried this and you like it or dislike it or you like one of the other ones better let me know in the comments and if there's a cigar knife with a keyring that you know I've also let me know because I try to find one of those for that friend of mine anyway if you've enjoyed this video please like Oh before I forget these are currently available they sell them I'll put a link in the description if you want to check them out these these aren't discontinued you can pick them up nowadays assuming the video is you know you're not seeing the video five years in the future or something you know there'll be a link in the description and if you've enjoyed this video please like and subscribe and I hope you all have an excellent day", "tpmorRjAq3Y": "hey fam I'm Bob the cigar guy this Travelers Rest South Carolina on the back porch a door and you are awesome in today's quick topic is how to cut a cigar with a guillotine cutter now

gonna cut it just right now the first thing is we're going to do is we gonna cut our cap we gonna make sure our cap is nice and nice and deep so we've got no problems because we don't want to cut too much of the cap we cut too much of the cap then it starts unravel it doesn't make it unsmoked bow but it does make it less fun and we're here to enjoy our Seaguar so why not do it the easy way so when you cut your cap you want to take off as little as you can number one for the unraveling I was talking about number two everything you cut off you can't smoke right right okay so I'm using the the jmv cigar and my Calibra cutter now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna line this thing up right on the edge nice and party and get a nice little simple cut all right now with the serrated cut it's really nice because this this cutter ain't gonna go nowhere this thing ain't gonna leave and ain't gonna fall off and hang anything but I'm gonna line it up nice and pretty and I'm gonna give me a nice little shot she'll take you right off nice little haircut now when you cut it you really just want a little t9c a little bitty old piece right so where you tried to throw it up against the wall wooden throwing if you dropped on the floor you really couldn't here and that's where we're at with that now you want to pull a draw on it make sure that that the smoke is able to come through so it's not too tight of a draw because if it is you want to cut down just a little bit more good drop now if your barn somebody else's cutter don't slobber on your Seaguar and then go to cut it again because nobody wants your slobber on a cutter that's just nasty alright so if you got slobber on your stuff get your own cutter so I'm saying don't borrow mine because I want to slobber on the cutter now this is a different type of cigar tip right here this right here could either be in a torpedo a pyramid or perfecta or something like that and when you're cutting with this what all the efficient otters do is they cut on a slight bias now you can cut it three or four times if you have to so my suggestion is you're gonna cut it a little less than what you think you're gonna need so you can cut a little bit more so I got it a little bias the a little little angle right there I'm gonna give a nice little shot right look at that right there now give it a draw draws fine so there we go all we got to do now is we got toast it smoking and enjoy our day family that's it now if you need a good cutter you need good cleaver cutter alright go to cleaver calm got all free shipping all day on everything um get you one if you use Kobe TCG which stands for Bob scar guy I send you something for free Calibri is giving me gifts to send to you to say thank you for watching our show so thank you very much so

finding a lighter to what your cigars not going to be a problem any regular drill may have one so this video is gonna serve you four tips and tricks how to get your cigar cut without having a cutter in your pocket so we have a ton of great new videos coming your way every single Monday on Mondays with Marteau click on that subscribe button because every subscription makes a difference thanks for the support so I can't tell you enough how many times I showed up with cigar my hand but no cutter to be found and I've damaged cigars many different ways of trying to cut this thing but throughout the years I have learned couple tips which I'm going to share with you how to get this cigar cut without a cut around all right so we're gonna get MacGyver on this one of my first tips is going to be look at your environment if you had a bar or you had a restaurant majority these establishments usually have wooden matches and if that's the case that's what you want to do is you want to ask for wooden matches simply you just take out a wooden match hopefully it's a long stick match so therefore what you're gonna do is going to take this batboy and this is called puncturing the cigar which kind of mimics punching a cigar as well so I'm going to wet the cap of the cigar a little bit just so I don't crack it so that'll be my first tip I just go ahead and use my tongue let the tip of my finger and right there I'm just making a little circles to get it a little bit moist and now I'm going to take the if you want to bring the camera a little bit closer I'm going to show you guys how this works I'll approach it and then now I wet dry it off a little bit and now I'm going to puncture it very delicately without cracking it I let off a little bit twist it and look at that and take it out again put it back in and I can tell that I'm making very good progress and there we go I feel it we just went into it so I already went about a half inch there you are you got a nice little puncture you give it a test pretty good drop a very very good job now if that doesn't satisfy my cold drop I can go ahead and put it back and reinsert it in the same exact spot and go a little bit further Oh even better of a draw so therefore now I have a cigar that's ready to smoke I punctured it as a matter of fact I can use the same exact match to light up the cigar and I'm rockin and rollin baby so that's tip number one take your time doing this and that's tip number one alright so tip number two is going to be very convenient for majority of the guys that are sales rep and on the road a lot being that you may have a paper clip in your car somewhere in your briefcase or if you work in a office environment this is not going to be too difficult to find and you can get a paper clip in this case I'm using a purple one just so you guys can get a good visual of the paper clip if I use a stainless steel color paper clip we may not be able to see it on their video so there we go and what I can do is I can use the edge of any kind of straight edge to just give it a good straight lead right there so we're gonna bring the camera again a little bit closer now a paper clip is gonna be a lot easier for us to puncture this cigar because it's slimmer it's sharper so therefore we can do multiple punctures on the cap and again I'm going to wet the tip of my finger get a little wet so it does not crack or give it any chance of that happening since I have a paper clip I'm gonna go ahead and give myself the ability to do multiple holes in the cigar so I can definitely get a better jaw and now I'm going to continue that I can go all the way around the outer perimeter and then do a couple in the middle for the sake of the video I'm just going to do two on the outer that perimeter just to show you guys that it can be very easily done there we go easy as that you guys and let's see if this hub is jaws as it called jaw hmm very very good job that's tip number two using a paper clip is very very effective and a cool thing about it since it's so slim you can do multiple punctures throughout the whole entire cap of the cigar so we'll get into step three now alright tip number three is going to be very convenient for you outdoorsy kind of guy the guys that always have pocket knives now be very very careful so what we want to do is we want to make sure that it's a pretty sharp blade this one's very very sharp and what I'm going to do is I'm going to peel off a little bit of the tip excuse me the cap of the cigar now the trick here is is to start off your little tiny layers there's no reason for you to rush and have like a big old chunk of the cigar so we're gonna approach the camera or we're gonna have the camera approach us and I'm going to show you guys how we're going to do little tiny layers just to make sure that first off maybe it's not a very sharp blade and as you can see right there it's kind of binding so I'm going to let off a little bit and huh look at that I just barely nicked it and a little bit of the cap already came off now again take your time don't be such a hurry because you don't want to ruin this cigar you will eventually get this going if you just give yourself a little patience so let's see there we go now that's a full draw that definitely took a lot longer then using a paper clip or a match I really thought the laia is going to be the one that's gonna be the most helpful having a pocketknife I'm really small anyway tip number four coming your way right after this okay so tip number four I call it the good old Dominican trick now I'm not sure if that's what it's called but when I was down in Dominican Republic that's how I learned how to do this trick which is using your thumb nail majority of cigar smokers down there don't use a cutter a lot of pride down there and they use their thumb nail so I learned how to do this and I'll share this with you guys before I go ahead and hack the cigar with my thumb nail what I do is first off I dig my thumb just a little bit on the outer edge of the captive feel if there's any softness so therefore I can I guess you'd call it make your purchase point I know we're not you know forcing a door or forcing a car door here and not using a set of you know irons or a jumbo bar or you know a big piece of metal but as you can see I'm twisting I'm trying to find a good spot if anything I'm making good incisions in the cap of the cigar that you can see there's some lines right there that are not perfect round but as I'm doing that I'm getting see look at that you guys it's easy - coming up on its own already because I gave it some good outline over our one of the cut so you can see by just digging in my nail that's already coming apart on its own so again I've said it before patience patience patience in this video just go really slow my gosh look how beautiful that looks by just using my thumbnail I don't have very long thumbnails this as long as my thumbnail gets so if you have a longer thumbnail even better for you so now let's check the drawn this Nam lucky this cigar has a very good job very good construction so I didn't have to do a whole lot sure just to prove to you guys am I like this up and smoker right here and show you guys how good of a draw I get out of it I'm having fun doing this video maybe next video I'll show you guys how to use sticks and stones how to get fired just kidding why are you guys using the thumbnail worked very well very lucky and hope this serves you guys right other than that let me know in the comments down below what kind of tips you guys use what kind of tricks you have to cut your cigar if you don't have a cutter maybe you guys have other things that I haven't touched upon so let me know alright so thanks for watching this video follow us on Instagram like us on Facebook and of course subscribe to our You Tube channel and I'll see you guys next Monday [Music]", "WmP7HHXsmvo": "hi guys and thank you for tuning in to check out the uh video review um i just picked up uh xiphae cigar cutter uh this cutter is similar in design and workmanship as that of the xy cars icar makes one that looks just like this um i was shopping around to get a new cutter uh this is a big cutter by the way and i saw this one on amazon actually zyfe makes two different types of cutters one of them being a rectangular shaped one which i have seen maybe two reviews on but nobody has a review out there for this one uh it's same thing same concept different uh design so i wanted to go ahead and make a review so you guys get a chance to see this one uh by the way i picked this up on amazon i'm gonna put a link for it on the description below uh so that you can go ahead and buy one if you wish to i did not get this for free i'm basically being an honest review about this so uh my review is uh you know unbiased so uh of course take out the outer sleeve uh first of all i'm a big fan of the orange color so not that this matters this is just packaging but i think the color combination is really nice it really it grabs you know grabs your eyes so uh so we're gonna go ahead and open this up when you open it up there's the cutter right there but before i show you the cutter on the back side of the cover there's a little soft velvety like pouch so that you can carry your cutter in it to keep it you know preserved so let's put that to the side again this is the bottom of the box the lighter is nicely placed the lighter the cutter is nicely placed inside a foam cutout so we take this out and take it out a little plastic pouch and there it is guys that is very very nice uh it says i don't know if you can see it on there but it's has the name sci-fi like printed right here on the little button um i gotta say this is quite heavy this is definitely not cheap this is it's got some serious weight to it um from what i've read in the description this is a stainless steel it has a stainless steel german blade um they give you a six month warranty on workmanship uh but i did read uh from the manufacturer that if you ever have any trouble with the blade itself or you don't feel like it's you know cutting sharply or whatever the case you can contact the manufacturer and they'll go ahead and send you a replacement blade and a tool to go ahead and open it up right there and replace the blade they say it's very easy to do but either the case i i kind of expect this to last a long time um one of the great things i like about this is not just a v cutter which uh i'm gonna say this probably can cut up to a 60 gauge uh cigar um but uh it's also a hole puncher now if you see on the bottom here what looks like an adjustment knob is actually a hole puncher so i'm going to go ahead and take that out so you guys can see it there i go dropped it so let me grab that and there it is so here's the hole puncher so you can see right through it okay um this i have to say it's a nice large size hole puncher so you're not you're not having to you know draw through a tiny hole um and of course uh the bottom of the cutter itself you see it's got that that little piece there that helps when you put this back in the cap that's stuck in there sometimes the cap gets stuck in there when you cut it gets pushed out automatically as you put this back in screw it back in and there you go so now let's see the real deal here this has spring loaded you press that button and it pops up and you place your cigar on there simply and cut it the section of the cap that cuts off just pops out through the back and i want to show you guys i'm going to go ahead and cut a cigar right now just to give you an idea how sharp this blade is so i have here a factory smokes from drew estate if you haven't had the factory smokes uh you should know it's they're not very expensive but they are awesome cigars i think in general that just about any cigar through a steak mix is a great cigar so um if you've never had one definitely try them out factory smokes all right so here i go it's got a nice fresh cigar how to cut it yet pop this open i'm just gonna go ahead and center it right there hold it tight nice clean cut look at that cut nice and sharp all right now i know some guys like myself like to make the cross cut so i'm going to go ahead and put a cross cut on this now and see see how well that comes out and make sure i get it nice and straight and and there we go oh well it wasn't perfect you really got to line it up but i'll tell you it is a very sharp cut so there you go you got yourself a nice cross cut and i gotta admit it cuts through it with these with ease so uh this is like i mentioned earlier a little cheaper in price than the xy car but i think why the heck not save a few bucks um you know it's gonna do the job and uh i like the fact that it comes with this little pouch to protect it because if you carry it in your pocket then you have to worry about you know scratching the finish you know some guys you know they like like myself i like to keep my stuff looking new all the time so but that's it man i i hope you like this review i hope that you know you consider buying it save yourself a couple of bucks if you're thinking about buying one i think it's awesome i'm gonna definitely see myself using that very many times for a long time to come and uh i will add once again add that description below so if you're interested check out my description click on the link i don't get any perks from this i'm simply giving you my honest review so you know i i hope it's helpful thanks for watching have a great one and keep it smoky my friends", "D7GBRRY-EPM": "this is a demo of two vintage auto saxophones summer cigar cutter from the 30s con 6m

keep it in this orientation or you can place your cigar in and keep it in this orientation also in the bottom of this cigar lighter you flip this out and pull it out you have this aeration tool so if your cigars are packed too tight or you want to get a better draw you can use this small device to aerate it and open it up a little bit better in addition on the bottom of the lighter is your adjustment knob so you turn that with a screwdriver or a small coin and that adjust the height of your flame coming out of the lighter this is also where you would refill the lighter with more fuel so you would just take can of butane turn it upside down put it in and press down and that's how you refill the lighter on the back of the lighter you have this small window so you can see exactly how much of the butane fuel you have remaining overall the functionality on this lighter is a you have nice strong wind proof flame you have to punch on the bottom the aeration tool and the stand to hold

loving members of your family or friends", "ikRKY--Nt64": "okay folks what we have here today is a early summer 1931 14,000 serial number categorized as a cigar cutter because of the famous thumb rest thing here and anyhow in pretty nice shape very very very straight almost every sex saw and I seen come through the bottoms have been smashed and this one is in really nice shape big huge guard on it the front of the bells are usually smashed in and again the bells real good shape or they've been real a curt and this one's got nice original lacquer you can see all the engravings pretty crisp out there inaudible patina for horn getting on almost 100 years old I don't think it's happening it is these days everybody's you know cramming down the necks so the next in really good shape never been pulled down then entirely I don't see any dents in it it was overhauled not too long ago by one of the top guys up in San Francisco and with silver style metal domed resonators you see the pads are in a great shape just went through it and tuned everything up and pretty clean actually for a word of this age just some normal wear on the sides here you can see just a little lacquer ware through nothing what I call honest wear and this is crazy where there's there's actually a little wear on the Bell from people's fingers playing which is just nuts that they have that poor technique where they're actually scratching the backside of the bell with their fingernails but again pads are a real nice shape a little different organ aam --ax instead of going down you're going across got a little button for the G sharp and this music medic I Kurt Ultra is actually taking these off and putting a flat piece here and and upgrading these updating of so you can get from the g-sharp over here a little easier but you just play it I mean what you get used to it is just fine again I'm not totally used to a since it's not the style or an eye you normally play but again not all basically factory original except for pads have been replaced so it's got another couple generations left in it but very very straight body I mean I see horns a lot newer than this that are in just terrible shape so the main thing the whole thing of those things the sound [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the rest what I've been doing probably take this off and put an adjustable newer style or I've been using again the music medic ones where it supports your finger more and it comes across this way and got the little if you do pay at the same time but it's a pretty big bore horn it takes a lot of hair I think it's a lot of sound first up from on the air you have to put through up so it sits [Applause] [Music] [Music] very nice protec berkeley brand-new protect excel case takes the excel because of the keys on the opposite side [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] all right these always tend to go on too long so counteracts plays great 104 sound and so so great sax if you're looking for a nice vintage early summer can't get plays very straight body and again just minimal lacquerware from the normal normal playing stuff Sonia sign it off just another one hit the road so yeah hasta luego stay safe", "sdnL7Pmk-J4": "never used to really think that much about the device the tool I'd used to light a cigar or pipe [Music] but the more you do it the more you realize having a decent a decent method of doing it it's kind of important and kind of nice it becomes a part of the whole experience you know you what you get a good cigar you really want to enjoy it's nice to have a a nice slider that you enjoy lighting it with lighters I found though can get crazy expensive I was at a tobacco shop yesterday I'm sure they go away more than this of course but they got one for $100 and you might be like that's cheap you look at a hundred dollar lighter and you thought it was expensive you shouldn't smoke a cigar you idiot I don't know that steam pricey to me when you look at like how cheap you know they can they can be so I've used quite a few different lighters over the years cheap ones expensive ones torch lighters matches pipeline like I've had a lot of different kinds of lighters and I don't really know much about a lighter but I do know that I needed one recently because the last one I had broke it was kind of cheap and I've known just from different lighters I've used I really like torch lighters obviously for cigars but I like them for pipes too even though you're not supposed to use them who says that anyways everybody but I don't listen I like the torch lighter so I got one for Christmas and it's so far been my favorite lighter I really like it and it's very a worry very affordable oh no Jimmy come here come here here sit good girl Oh luckily she didn't bite the she's got the bag so things are too expensive anyways this is it this is the lighter that I'm using right now a big fan of it it's very affordable and it works so stinkin well and I will say the design of it saw my favorite looking pipe it's not a pipe that's why it's not my favorite looking lighter I mean it's cool it's this classic style I think has a little hole punch a little donut donut hole creator a little nostril enhancer I don't know I'm talking about anyways it has one of these and everything about it's just simple straightforward and also look here look how big the adjustment thread deal is like pretty good size and I've had so many lighters where you have to get such a tiny little device or something to adjust the flames intensity but this is nice and large you can use your finger to get to that the flame I will tell you this when I first lift this thing up the adjustments for the flame intensity was up pretty high this thing it's like a little flamethrower I don't know why you'd ever want the flame that high but it was coming out like - there I was and I couldn't when I first got it I was like how do you adjust this thing and I was just good to hold good to hold it like way back here it's an it's this thing's powerful packs a punch but you adjust it and it's just it works perfectly it's very like urgh anomic ly comfortable it's I like the little button it's solid you know it's a big solid easy to use very uh sink very tough to I mean it seems like indestructible everything about it is fantastic and it's cheap I mean relatively cheap I don't know how much it is anyways if you like this thing I'll put a link to the where you can buy this thing on Amazon and a couple other lighters I'll put a couple other links to lighters that have had in the past that I liked a lot but this is my favorite one so you wanna pick it up on Amazon click

me know and subscribe to the channel if you like this kind of thing", "EZBApSKDF8U": "everybody welcome back to the review and this review we're going should be doing a accessory review and for this review I'm arguing the colibri because now as you see here this is a definitely a beefy V cut here it's all metal construction and goes all the way through you see it as you take it apart and clean as you want to it's a really nice deep v cut you pull this little button here and it actually extends out spring-operated so a really nice operations with very very smooth action I like it a lot you see it's kind of the actual to be cut is actually inverted doesn't have a sharp point it has the V so which actually a port a much better because a lesson it's crushing a cigar when you try to cut it these blades are very very sharp so whatever it does make a cut it actually does a really fine job of that like I said it's really a beefy egg cutter quite peppy but what's good about that is is the reason is so beefy is because the actually cutting blade is a pretty wide cutting blade you can see it's designed in London made with 420 stainless steel I'm guessing it's 420 j2 stainless steel which is a pretty decent field use a lot of a medical equipment - scalpels and one night use for 20 that's a rose gold rose gold and black color and I've used this quite a bit in exceed those bead of dirty but nonetheless this has been a really good for me now I want to go ahead and I'm going to cut this be cut here or because the cigar and we'll show you how deep the v-cut is so Moy it down see it's pretty that's a pretty good chunk and as you can see it takes a wide cut on this V could a really really good job on this on the cutting here now what I like about this video is that it does cut such a deep groove that you get a whole lot of area for the smoke to come out of the cigar but you still have you know the nice rounded edge on the cap or whatever to kind of keep this lagarde kind of clean you know I don't get a whole lot of you know little pieces of tobacco a mouth and all that so you know it just makes it to meet a nice cleaner smoking experience does a really really good job the retail for I think around between 30 and 35 dollars which i think is a really good deal they also make a vase edible companion lighter score but they also make a standard guillotine cutter that's probably it's not a stick but it's pretty it's pretty stout ething cutter and it's all right I believe it costs around the same same price but it has the same thing it has where you pull pull this lever out in the guillotine shoots out but all in all I'm very impressed with cutters I've actually just returned for the Dominican Republic from touring general cigars facilities down there and as several friends of mine that were on the trip and they use us because quite a bit and some of them really hated Evita they didn't like it at all but after using this down there for about a week they were pretty impressed with it everybody would really really liked this big header stuff did an amazing job and like that one friend of mine that was you know Adam did not like because not summer to music it's now looking to get one of these so overall you know just a real good job from Calibri really impressive this cutter so you know the v-cut something you think you're going to try out devil give this one a shot I really do like this one and I've carried this for over probably three months now you see it still looks in really good condition none of the paint's coming off okay it's a little stuff there but you can see there's the tobacco from the cigar pretty good chunk it takes out there but you know all in all I really do like this cutter and it's well worth the money I definitely should check it out a little bit in the market for another cutter check this out", "NJm9-zdEST4": "Hello my friends! Nick Libretti here for JRCIGARS.COM and today i'm talking about my top five favorite lighters. So again these are just my choices. These are lighters I use in my everyday life, or I have used. They are reliable price points are going to vary but they're also all available at JRCIGARS.COM. First up, this is probably one of the coolest lighters I've ever owned. This is the Lotus Orion in the red color. Why do i like? It looks like it, if you're in a Ferrari and you hit a button this comes out. It has a push-button start right here, I love the red and then like the silver kind of dotted pattern around it. And awesome two flames that come into one, it makes a union. So you still get the power of multiple flames, but the precision of a single flame, get around that edge. Awesome, awesome lighter. Hey! Let's say you're a smoker on budget, but you still want a great lighter to carry around but if it breaks it's not that expensive. Vertigo Cyclone. This is probably one of the most popular lighters we've ever sold in the history of anything. It's like not even nine bucks, plastic but it comes clear so you can see how much fluid in there. Triple flame. Boom! And they're actually, like i don't think i've ever had one break on me. They're super reliable lighters, excellent, excellent everyday, economical lighter from Vertigo. Now, you wana get a little fancy. This is similar in color, I mean most of these are red cuz I really like red on my lighters. This one is the Bolero from Jetline. I like it. It sounds Italian. It sounds like you're you know you go to a Piazza and get the Bolero lighter. But, it has a nice little punch in the bottom. You gotta open it. Look at that! Look at those! Its like three machine guns on like a World War 2 plane. Three totally straight, separate flames. This is great on when I smoke something with a bigger ring gauge. Anything with a sixty or above, I usually break this bad boy out give it a nice little turn right there. Now it's time to go to the boss! This is the Colibri Boss. It's a triple flame lighter, but its got functionality to it. Its functional in other areas besides lighting your cigar. Right in the back, pop out your little finger, you got a cutter. You can cut your cigar and light it with one easy-to-use accoutrement. You don't need a whole bunch of accessories hanging out of your pockets. Open the top, beautiful three flames coming into one. Precision, but also power. This one I use if I don't want to carry a lot of my pockets. If i'm wearing suit or anything, this one really comes in handy. Last, but not least, we have the Black Label, that's the name of the company. This is the Dictator. That's a boss name. Why is it a boss name? Well its a boss lighter. Pick up your little thing there and it's got like a thin flat, you gotta look at it close, Its got a thin flat flame to it. This is like luxury. You almost wave the flame onto the cigar. It's really thin and like wavy. I'll do this for something really high-end that I don't want to, I don't want to risk getting any burn marks around the wrapper. I just want to like that interior. So yeah, its like a painter with his brush. Like a Davinci or a Michaelangelo if you will softly paint the fire on the cigar. So, full range of lighters here. Most of them are a little high end but there's great things like the Cyclone or even the Bolero you can get them for a really great price. They're all available in a ton of different colors right here at JRCIGARS.COM. Why don't you comment below. What are some of your favorite lighters? You tell me what they are and maybe I've had them in the past.

to the cigars London youtube channel today I've got a little unboxing for you and today it's the colibri Vita I've already had a look at this off camera and if this thing looks like a beast first of all I wanted to give a huge shout out to where's thanks to you this video was made possible for sending me this awesome cutter first things first comes in a really nice little gift box underneath the first lid you get to see the V cutter itself and within here there is a little box inside and I suppose you could use this for like display purposes or something but personally I'll throw everything away and I have to cut straight in my pocket so inside obviously UV cutter and it does come with a two-year warranty the thing feels really really solid it's made of stainless steel and it is spring-loaded as well the nicest things about this I think is that noise it makes there's something about it a filterable confidence this thing just feels like it's built to last now these putters can take up to a 60 ring gauge cigar and on their website actually says 60 plus haven't tested that myself these cutters cut up to seven millimeters into the cap of the cigar and I do actually have one here to test out let's just have a little go with the Gurkha as you can probably see it does a very very nice job I was playing around on this cutter earlier on and I tried to create a star I've seen some people doing this on Instagram so that came out quite well I don't think this has any real benefit behind the smoke of the cigar bar it just looks quite fancy these V cutters also work on torpedo cigars and they come in a variety of colors which is really nice personally for me I really enjoy this black version the the stainless steel at the bottom here and the top is pure black and then the body is kind of looking off black almost like a dark dark grey but I think that looks super smart I'm not sure how this is gonna wear in terms of the paint but time will tell with this in my pocket overall this feels like a beast of a cutter and I'm really looking forward to trying this out on some different size we engage cigars and generally just see how it wears over a few years and yeah that's about it so I hope you enjoyed the video don't forget to comment like and subscribe below if you do have one of these cutters and a few years old let me know I'd be really interested to know how its worn how sharp the blades have stayed over the years and yeah again I'm looking forward to using them until next time stay safe and I'll see you very soon Cheers", "o53vKJZ_Xvc": "hi it's Teresa with smoking-hot cigar chick comm today I want to share with you five accessories that I think are fantastic for any cigar smoker whether it's a gift for yourself or a gift for a friend the fourth part of my series right now is this is what my favorite cutter is this is a bee cutter from citecar that the first time I used to be cutter many years ago they weren't that many options available and I remember it's just kind of like an expensive easy cutter in a shop and the first time I used it I fell in love with it it was just a great draw the cigar gave you a different experience and I fell in love with it until about you know a few cigars later the cutter would get dull very quickly and I found that it would start tearing the tobacco and I got to a point where got terrified of music so I don't want to destroy my cigars so I didn't use a bee cutter for three years this particular B cutter it's been on the market for about maybe two years now maybe less but the design of this is fantastic you can see all the the blade here you've got this this kind of v-shape here uh often the the previous ones would have this is an inverted blade so where your blades would originally kind of come in here now it's like this it it keeps the blade from being dull it keeps a very sharp very sturdy blade and just it feels like air when you're cutting the cigar you don't even feel it it's fantastic and I've used this you know since it came out it's a sharpest it was the first day so I am absolutely in love with this and I think this is also a great gift especially for a cigar smoker who might have fall in love with the beat cut years ago and kind of lost hope on it I think this is a great way to bring kind of like an old friend back and women will stay for a white pipes for so many years to come but you definitely try it out if you haven't and I've never had a v-cut cigar before it's something to experiment with as well it'll definitely change the draw of a cigar which as you know will change the flavor the way taking the the smoke and the flavor that the wrapper around your as well I said let me know at your thoughts if you have one already and Uslan please share in the comments with your opinions if you have it definitely grab one and let me know what you think I'll be speaking with you soon take care bye", "t-rfZiUwtHs": "hi I wanted to show you the results of my shirking scar cutter um I just got back from walking about Oh a little less than a half mile and as you can see my cigar has produced a wonderful ash this particular cigar is nothing all that special no offense to the maker but it's a Carrillo and you know it's a pretty decent cigar and that's a real expensive but one of the nice things about the about the shuriken is that it puts six little slits on the end so as you can see the cap looks like it's in place but you can also see that the smoke draws through the slits and it really pulls a lot more flavor through the cigar and the ash tends to really build a long good ash now I've had other cigars with this scar cutter that were equally as long of an ash and it just really it really improves the overall experience of the cigar besides you do get the flavor more of the wrapper flavor so it's a little bit more of an intense taste or a fuller taste for your medium to mild or whatever cigar really because you're drawing all that smoke through the wrapper where most of the flavor is it's a very easy device to use and it has become my new go-to cigar cutter", "IqxjEakI8Lo": "and now for another cigar 101 choosing the right cutter with any task you tackle you need the right tools for the job and cigar smoking is no different the truth i mean have you ever tried to cut a scar with one of these bad boys [Music] it ain't pretty cigar cutters come in a variety of styles and each one can create a different smoke experience the most common cutter you'll find being passed around the lounge is the guillotine cutter guillotine cutters come in two basic styles the single blade and the double blade while both versions are easy to use the double blade will give you a cleaner more consistent cut because it features blades on both sides of the scar rather than the dull cutting chamber the single blade presses your cigar against regardless of whether you're reaching for a torpedo or a 60 ring gauge beast the guillotine cutter is versatile enough to handle just about any stick on the market looking for an open draw but with less loose tobacco give the v-cut cutter a try a v-cut cutter creates a nice notched hole in the head of your cigar that will give you a good draw without exposing your tongue to all that loose tobacco the v-cut cutter is easy to use just insert the head of your cigar into the opening hold steady and then snip the v-cut's a good option for small ring gauge cigars but be careful not to cut too deep or you'll end up with a draw that's so open your cigar will smoke way too hot a punch cutter is a simple circular razor blade that you gently plunge into the head of the cigar to create a nice focused opening they're typically pretty small and since many of them function as key chains the punch will work well if you're in a pinch and left all your gear at home the downside to the punch you can't use them with torpedoes and they might be too big for some small ring gauge cigars looking for a stylish cutter cigar scissors are just about as sleek as it gets no not those scissors cigar scissors are made of surgical grade stainless steel and are specifically designed for snipping cigars a high quality pair will give you a swift and precise cut every time just be careful because dull low quality scissors can do more damage than they're worth looking to set up a lounge or planning on hosting a large herf it might be time to get yourself a tabletop cutter designed to offer two size options for both straight and v-cuts and featuring a massive reservoir to catch severed caps tabletop cutters are great for taking the hassle out of your herf and they're simple to use just stick your cigar in the opening pull the lever and bingo bango bongo you got a perfect cut

quick product review for something I've been very happy with the most recent purchase it's a Calibri Vica cigar cutter and let me ask you this question how many times have you gone to try to have a wonderful cigar and you try to get that perfect cut but sometimes you just can't get it right there's nothing more frustrating than that so that is why I was in search for a good cutter and not only did I find a good cutter but I found a great cutter so this definitely retreat or receives it a great rating from us one of the things I liked about this the most compared to other V cuts that I had seen is how deep this one will actually go so this one the way that this bowl is designed you put the cap of the cigar in there and you get a perfect cut every single time you see that is spring-loaded here is a very high quality product the way that it works is once you put the cap of the cigar in there again you don't have to fidget around was trying to you know size it up yourself you just put it in there cut the cap will you know be caught here in the back and all that you simply do is hit the release button and then you know the your cut will just fall into the ashtray or to the table there but you have a very clean cut every time it's nice and deep so you get a nice clean draw and like I said you never have to worry about ruining a good cigar because you don't have a good cut or a perfect cut so by purchasing this I've been happy with every cigar that I've had since then at least cut wise maybe can't say the same for you know flavor wise on a cigar but I've always been satisfied with the cuts that's for sure and again the most reason why is because see how deep that bowl is give me the perfect cut do you have that perfect draw and very nice-looking sturdy product so highly recommend this this is the Colibri Vica cigar cutter and for those of you that are local here in San Antonio I purchased this one at the humidor Club humidor over there on on he burner and it only cost me 39 bucks so Calibri Vica cigar cutter very happy with this product so if you get go ahead and pick one up alright thanks for watching and I'll keep you posted on any other updates", "9-tVPFTjzso": "you have bullet catches we have stickers we have guillotine and this is another bullet catch on a chain which is as it should be because it should always be with you thank you have a great day okay from here we're going to be going to be showing you how to use some of the cutters I'm using them on some Pavan yo naked dogs these are available from bar cigars and brew or own company and they're about two dollars and fifty cents apiece and they are fabulous they're naked they have no labels check them out and now we'll do some close-ups on how each cutter works and about the price range okay we're going to take out the cigar and show you how these punches work there's a key chain this one opens up like this there's a sharp edge right here mhmmm you can just cut it in there and you get a nice hole for smoking throat this way mm-hmm okay and then you just punch out that and screw it back together easy as that very easy these all of these cutters and punches run anywhere from 495 up to about 20 bucks and they're all on the bar cigars and brew website this is the one that I use this is in my car at all times very simple one you just screw it up electric guitar okay push it through and then you can just screw and push out that little piece easy as that cutters and then we'll use these are the plastic ones work just as well as these fancy a little bit more expensive ones just they just cost a little less this is stainless steel made a little bit better now what you want to do is you just want to cut off a little bit of the tip that's almost too much you just want to don't you know cut off the whole end otherwise you get really sloppy and when you're when you're smoking a cigar but that won't work pretty well this is one of a little bit more expensive this one's about 25 or 30 bucks this one cuts off the same way and they come in a couple of different colors we have in this and then you also have a pair of scissors cutter again you only want to cut off just a little bit of the tip and after using your wonderful cutter purchased from bars cigars and brew calm which has lots more than just cutters it's time to enjoy your cigar so

381 all a few may and just so you know just got released I'm excited to bring it to you this is the box it comes in we're gonna put this off to the side and we're gonna take a peek at what comes inside now inside you get your standard microfiber pouch that the knife comes in I will put that up there as well and then in this one you get a extra set of screws and we'll kind of cover what those are for here in just a minute you also get a little instruction manual on how the warranty works and stuff but this is the knife itself this is the 381 all-day fiume I'll let you take it all in there for a second and then let's open it up it is a friction folder and you may have seen this one looks very familiar they have a similar model the 380 all a so there's a couple differences and I'll show that off here in a minute but just want to go over this one and show you what the details are I do like the coloring I do like the handles as well or the scales as well as you know the pin of color and the spacers there so this is a rich light material if the reason for the scales and then you'll notice right here it's not made for your thumbs or fingers it's made for cigars it's made to be a cigar cutter so this would come down cigar cutter now you've seen the cigar cutters they have very ornate very detailed and elaborate and they work fantastic I have one of them if you haven't seen my review on that they'll link it below but yeah so I'm excited to try this one out I'll be another there will be another video comparing those cigar cutters and this one as well but this one does have you know the standard six tools on it so it's got your it's a 56 gauge ringg cigar cutter it has a bottle opener that's on the back side of the blade so we'll get the fingers out of the way and close it so you do have your bottle opener there you do have a screwdriver on this end you also have your pride tip in a bit for micro slots I think those are the quarter inch size your scales are that kind of a they call it a chocolate brown red layered rich light and this is a pocket clip on here as well as a money clip and you are able to take this off and then use these screws here take the spacers out or you can go without it and just put the screws in there so that's kind of a neat option as well but yeah so let's look at the blade really quick we'll go over some stats as well we'll get this opened up so you kind of with me I have to like put my ring finger here and then just kind of use it to pry open right there now like I said it is a friction folder it is international friendly so you can take this in many countries pack it in your checked luggage only obviously can't carry it on the plane with you but the designers behind this that bench made originally teamed up with a380 as you can see there we'll get a close-up of their logos so you have Patrick famine and Eric de Munck Ave and their art of France and so this one obviously inspired you have the fiume on the title the 3d one all that fiume a few main is smoked in French so that's what it kind of stands for so in their language so it's kind of cool that this is kind of your cigar cutter a que going for the smoke on the female portion so I do how you know like how this has a little cutout for like a finger choil somewhat right here so it kind of keeps the blade in place you do have also a little bit of jet being added to this one so it's kind of nice you can kind of get a double if your cut through some stuff or you can keep your thumb back here does have a sharpening trail as well and the blade itself hopefully you can see that but it's a guillotine it's a guillotine style blade let's see if we get that shown in there it's probably the most difficult one to show there you go she can see how the blade comes down that's made for cutting when it comes through here so one of the things that we'll be testing out is you get your typical cigar something like this you know you're gonna stick I'm not I'm not that in but go stick this in here and then just close it up and then enjoy your fine cigar so looking forward to that I will be testing it out on a couple of the cigar cutters but I needed to kind of employ some friends to help test those cigars out once they're cut so we will be doing that and it also has a space for lanyards so lanyard fans you could reunite let me know what you guys think of this one the quick stats on it we read it off my little machine here but the blade length one point six inches long overall open four point four inches close three point three inches and a weight of one point six ounces so MSRP is gonna be 160 several retailers you can find it for much less than that so I think this is a pretty good win and especially for the cigar cutter option so I'm guessing where you're gonna be coming down through and then you can use this as some of your pressure as well to help just make that cut nice and clean so I'll be testing that out in the next video let's look at it compared to the 380 I'll lay it real quick this is a 380 one I like the bloom black combo with the g10 on this one but there's the two of them together what do you guys think you guys like that which one do you prefer added cigar cutter now they have the same cuts on the blade they're both the guillotine style and you can kind of see that one but yeah let me know what your guys thoughts are let me know which one you guys would get and then just a size comparison just got a bench mate bug out so we'll put the benchmate bug out out there you can kind of see just overall comparison it does rest on this pocket clip money clip combo right here so that's why it's kind of off centered but that's what it is size difference comparison wise but yeah so just a nice small something you carry in your pocket with your money or you can take it off and just let it rest in the bottom of your pocket it's got some great little tools on it and now it's cigar cutter so I'm excited for the cigar cutter and excited to get that tested out here in the next day and then get that video out to you guys so you can see in use what this 3d one all I fiume does put to the test so

been using them over the past week and today i'm going to do my official review over them take them out of the box and I had some viewers asked thera plastic these are solid stainless steel cigar cutters patented lifetime warranty so they're good for life folks I know there's some reviews on YouTube about these not wanting to cut straight or perfect they cut good enough for me and I'll show you this is a ruined Alec Bradley cigar with a wrapper on it was violently tossed around in the bag so I'm just going to slice through it as you can see with minimal effort it's really gone through these cigars it doesn't really take all that much to to get through it and like I said doesn't take much and this is a toronto which i'll probably smoke either later tonight or tomorrow i'm just going to show you what a nice cut it gives off the back you can see that's a pretty darn straight cut it's a nice cut off the back when you see friggin really good nice do that let me see you can get a good side view it's really a nice even cut i mean other than just just a wee bit of that you see that low of the little hair sticking up there other than that emits really just make some beautiful cut on

what's unique about this cutter is on the backside it's not opened up all the way like a traditional guilting cuddle cutter there's a small little hole what this does it allows you to put your cigar in and it will give a perfect cut every single time the hole is there if you have I told pedo shaped cigar so the end can fit in there and you just get just the perfect cut to use you just open up the

so what we're gonna talk about this week real quickly is cutters everyone's always got an opinion on the cutter everyone's always got an idea which one's better which one's this which ones that I'm just gonna show you a few quick samples on some cutters how they work different variations of the cutter how to properly use them where to find your cap on your cigar everything like that so featured here I've got our cylinders I car quick release our quick release there you go buddy v cut and then the always popular handmade scissors everyone so with the cutters laid out here what we're gonna do is we've got three different two guys here I've got a double perfecto shag a lancero and then your typical row bluestone barber pole so with the each different each different cutter really it's all a matter of preference but when it comes to it what you want to be careful of is when you're cutting you're always checking where your cap line is you can see this line right here on top of every single you look at that's your cap so if you're going with a straight cut like this quick release here you're gonna bring that guy right down to where that blade comes right above that cap right above the cap that's all that comes off that cigar that's it no that's cigar breeze perfectly you can actually see the opening inside there now with the v cut when you have a torpedo of this size any torpedo really when it comes to a point this way what you have to be sure of is again you're following that cap line the v cut does allow you to get down into the binder so it's not too stressful but set it here right that cap line sorry set it here right your cap line and well uh right through the cap binders nice and open everything breathes well in there now the scissors these are overall favorite of mine honestly this can be used on anything same technology is used in any of these your stainless steel blades but it gives you the hand controlling power on the cigar so with this lancero where that cap is we're gonna bring these blades right above that cap snip like paper that's all that comes off that cigar and again it breathes perfectly so when it comes to cutters the way I'm going to wrap this out it's all personal personal preference you know cutters now we're all zoomed in there made cool and you can do pretty much anything you want with them but no matter what you do find the cutter you like the style you like and cut your cigar with it", "POzu_7PbS4o": "I'm insomniac and this is the VX 2v cutter from xikar [Music] okay it's the VX 2v cutter from xikar and I never start with the finishes I usually throw that in somewhere towards the end of the review but being this is so damn shiny you can barely see it on camera I'll point out this is the gunmetal finish if you're looking for a stealthy yet flashy at the same time gunmetal is the way to go this is a big significant cutter what I mean by that is it is fairly large you can see compared to the size of my hand and it is fairly heavy which also kind of indicates good build quality all metal design the blades are stainless steel by the way that's pretty cool you have these buttons on the side those are your triggers for opening the cutter and on the top and bottom you have these kind of neural Zoar grips they're actually very grippy actually work very well which of course comes in handy when you're cutting a cigar which we will do later on camera now the only - to this finish this particular finish anyway is I don't know if you can see it - while they're on camera but it gets fingerprints so easily a finger pencil now the vx2 boasts some innovation here with the inverted shape of the blade that you see in there apparently what this inverted shape does and their particular shape and depth of the cut is it creates a good v-shaped cut but apparently this particular shape in depth that they made their blades they're engineered to not put any unnecessary pressure on the outer edges of the cap therefore not cracking the cigar and I have to say so far I've had this for a little while I've been using it and I haven't actually split one cigar cap or wrapper with this cutter yet so it does do what they say it does they also boast a great depth with this cutter which gives you more smoke output that's also true too shallow of a V and you won't get as much smoke I'm not comparing it to any other V cutters necessarily but what I am saying is that I get great smoke output with the cuts that I get with this V cutter I want an interesting thing that I actually love about this cutter is not the cut at all it's actually this recess right here where the cigar goes in no matter what ring gauge or shaped cigar you put in there it makes it effortless to line this up for the cut it's almost like that recess just kind of sucks the head of the cigar right to where it's supposed to be and then you clip the cap and that's that and like I said that's the shape of the recess there really just makes cutting any type of cigar real simple I don't find myself you know being real careful about where I line it up and then pressing it it's almost like you just stick the cigar in you press this down boom it's over boom it's over so as opposed to a couple of their other cutters which require a little bit of practice this one is pretty foolproof you just hold it in that recess and you cut speaking of cutting let's do that here are those triggers again on the sides you press that that pops up you stick the cigar in and then you like I said you have that grip to top and bottom what you come in handy and press down simple as that Wow and there you see you have a nice V cut it looks a little sloppy but that's actually not from the cut that's this crappy cigar that I pulled out at the bottom of the humidor for the demonstration but as you see there it is a clean V cut even on a brutal crappy cigar from the bottom of the humidor you don't see any cracks in the end cap you don't see any issues with the wrapper just a nice clean cut and I will show you another cut in a minute skaar sharp and quick and precise and it works every time you want primo slicing action now another really cool thing about the VX 2 V cutter is that even if you have a cigar like this that has a pigtailed endcap or you are cutting something like a torpedo those all work the same in here they cut just as well they fit right into the recess and the width of the v-shape in the recess is big enough to get just about any torpedo in there that I've cut and just about any pigtail fits in there just fine so as an example here you go let's cut this got the pigtail in there you can see it through the other end let's see there it is there you go simple nice and easy good cut in terms of the quality of the piece itself like I mentioned earlier in the video it is pretty large it is pretty heavy but that does give you a kind of confident real good solid build quality feel tolerances are really tight you don't have a bunch of wiggle and slop you really don't hear any kind of like loose metal sounds when you shake it around it all just looks and feels very high quality really if I had one negative at all to even point out about the VX 2 V cutter it's the size overall of the cutter and the thickness and not in terms of practical application in terms of practical application it feels great in the hand it's easy enough to operate and it does fit in your pocket I'm not sitting here saying that this thing is gigantic it's not like trying to stick a grapefruit in your pocket but as compared to most other standard style cutters like their X I want any standard type of guillotine cutter which is nice and flat and you barely know that it's there this has enough weight and thickness to it that it does protrude a little bit again just another really little detail not a huge deal if you have large pockets or you're not even putting this in your pocket it doesn't matter and again even if you are sticking this in your pocket it does fit but other than that I really have no negatives to point out about this cutter it's been great this is a solid unit and on top of that as opposed to a couple of the other cutters from them that I've reviewed recently which I thought were worth the money a little bit expensive there are four finishes available for the VX - V cutter as of the time of this video and all of them are $49.99 that's cheap how well this works how solid it's built and even just how high-quality it looks it's actually undervalued in my opinion that it's definitely worth the money so definitely a cutter I could recommend good stuff if you have the VX - cutter leave a comment let me know what you think about it of course you could check out the line of VX - V cutters and other xikar products at xikar comm and if you want to see a lot more videos like this you want a lot more accessory reviews you want a lot more content in general plus one week early access to all of my reviews and exclusive access to my giveaways which do include accessories and cigars get the link at the top of the video description sign up at the patreon page I certainly use the support and that will help push everything along a lot further and a lot faster maybe I meant a lot faster not a lot further anyway enough of all that VX - V cutter from sidecar kick-ass accessory go pick one up pick two up I mean who can't use more cutters right see you in the next one [Music]", "4GQ76Q1bm5I": "this is our precise cut mistake-free cigar cutter it has an anodized aluminum body and it is a twin blade guillotine cutter with stainless steel blades what makes this cutter unique is the backstop or real wall that prevents you from cutting off too much of your cigar the backstop allows you to cut off just one-eighth of an inch at a time you make one cut and then if you need a little more taken off your cigar then you make the second cut there is also a small hole in the rear of the cutter to help cut to a pedo shapes of gauze this cutter works as well as other cigar cutters selling for much more money and now a second cut", "Vvqtp9cviVk": "hey guys this is Nick for JR cigar today we're giving you another quick tip in this sub 2 minute video on how to properly cut your cigar using your basic everyday that will bladed guillotine cutter so the thing you have to know about your cigar first is any pareho or rounded shape cigar has what's called the cap it's basically a separate piece of tobacco that the roller puts on top and they hammer it in with a little device you're actually going to see a line that separates the cap from the rest of the cigar because it is a separate piece of tobacco you want to take your cutter and you want to place it just above that line just above the cap so you want to go just like that and then you're gonna give it a quick snip another quick and easy way is taking your guillotine cutter placing it on a flat surface as so putting your cigar upside down and give it a quick snip it's that easy perfectly cut beautiful look and smoke guys thank you for watching and stay tuned for a lot more of Nick's quick tips", "RmHBYkUEKYA": "all right so check this out this is the saddleback leather business card holder that i have turned into or your my two cigar cutters that i'm typically going to carry it's a clear s cut black and chrome and this one is this was a freebie from cigars international it was called the rockwell hangout cigar cutter used to be a piece over here it annoyed me so i ground it off but this thing cuts like a freaking laser it's the uh the same thing it cuts the same if not better than the the xikar one this one pretty much the same thing and it was a freebie and i absolutely love it it has a huge ring gauge so if you get a cigar that's tunneling or you have to cut a piece off for some reason very easy to get it in there and it is a razor blade scalpel sharp but check out the uh the impressions i've been able to make into the leather look how nice it's forming to that this one too i don't know if you can pick it up but you can actually see the uh rivet marks to the leather saddleback leather",

here's your hosts jim person and bob the knife junkie demarco hello knife junkies and welcome to episode number 123 of the knife junkie podcast i'm jim person and i'm bob demarco welcome to the show the knife junkie podcast is the place for knife newbies like me and knife junkies like you to learn everything about knives and knife collecting and it's our midweek supplemental show where we dive deep into the weeds if you will and talk knives first off we're going to kind of cover several different subjects of course this past sunday was father's day so we have to learn what maybe bob got or bob gave for father's day to his dad we'll talk about that also uh bob not only does videos and audio but he can write as well so we're going to talk about a bob demarco article also coming up in knife life news we want to talk about the new giant mouse ace grand is that what it's called that's right it's the age grant you had me a giant mouse i was like okay still will back in the news we're gonna talk about that as well as zt their new zero seven zero seven as well as uh tops we're also going to kind of touch on a little something with tops and the knife life news and of course in bob's state of the collection we're going to talk about some borrowed knives this week that uh maybe we'll see reviews on and commentary about so episode number 123 a lot of knife stuff to talk about bob we are still on a high man coming off this past saturdays which was june 20th knife town hall where you had two special uh guest interviews on the youtube channel yeah that's right we had andrew demko and we had greg lightfoot and it was about a two and a half hour show uh andrew demko came on first and he was on for about an hour and 15 minutes talking getting in the weeds and showing off the shark lock and really showing how it works and what i really loved was he showed off a bunch of prototypes a bunch of um failed designs if you will or designs that he created from yes exactly on the way to the the current shark lock which is his new and patented lock which is appearing on the ad20 his new custom model so it was really beautiful yeah what i loved and you you touched on it was he was showing all those knives the as you said the learning opportunities are the ones that were on the way just really you know right up on the camera you could see the detail and everything that's what makes these um like thursday night knives and these live knife town halls so special not only is that the audio and the conversation but the video just kind of pulling it all together yeah and for someone like that uh andrew demko he's a he's a legend in this industry because of his innovation four locks he's innovative four locks the ram safe the uh the legendary triad the scorpion lock that you see on the 8015 and now the shark lock and all patented which to me is also pretty cool it's not just uh you know so uh yeah great to great to have him on and great to really see inside the mind of an innovator like that and then to offer the opportunity for people to to speak up my my brother commented my brother's a big fan of andrew dunco and he got a chance to let him know that and then a lot of really great questions from uh from knife junkies who wanted to know specifics in particular right they were asking so many questions you couldn't get your questions in yeah he's like no wait i want to ask my question i have had my opportunities on two different podcasts and one of the one of the cool things that you saw through those different prototypes is something he's described in both of those interviews is this uh painstaking process like uh oh maybe i'll just take a tiny hair off of this piece of titanium and then he goes through the whole process and that tiny hair doesn't work and he needs to take a tiny hair more off and so you know the process continues so it was cool to see the evidence of that and then we had greg lightfoot and uh he was up for an hour or so also and again so we have a legend from this uh this industry someone who's been around for 30 years uh making folding tactical knives and bushcraft and all sorts of knives you know he's a man of adventure he makes knives for many different purposes but uh he's really known for his folders and uh they've gotten they've gone from the tactical practical uh cool in the early days to just beefy ornate gorgeous uh handmade works of you know usable art and the same thing we got uh commentary from from a lot of our our usual suspects our great friends of the show asking them questions about uh design choices asking them questions about process and historical results and materials yeah it was really these are questions i did not think to ask uh and that's why these kind of town hall formats or the thursday night knives format is so excellent because it's a collaborative process and yeah we get to find out the most information that way and if you uh ever see the town hall um you know advertisements things that we put out please do make your uh best effort to join us live because you get the chance to interact uh with the makers the manufacturers the viewers whoever the guests or

that they got for you for father's day or maybe you want to talk about maybe something you gave your dad for father's day i will indeed but also i have to extend a happy father's day to you you are also a father of two and uh men what a great day it is just to just to be lavished my kids carried me around in a palinkin all day and they were and they were they were fanning me with palm fronds and singing to me it was it was it was wonderful uh they did not however get me a knife but that's fine that's fine you know that's that's low-hanging fruit i i find it hard to believe that they actually carried you around well that okay okay all right a team they are little girls yes that is true okay they were not none of that happened right but it was a lovely day nonetheless but they did treat you right they did indeed uh and i treated my dad right uh i got him um i i just think this was perfect for him so my dad is the first one who got me enthusiastic about samurai swords because uh and and japanese blades i remember back in the 80s uh kind of pilfering his bookshelf and coming across a um he had a book from sotheby's the uh the the auction house in new york and it was full of uh japanese blades from various uh various time periods various uh shogunates i guess and uh so these were legit samurai swords that were tens and tens of thousands of dollars and uh he just kind of thought it would be cool to have i don't think he was seriously imagining you know purchasing these uh but i remember him showing these off to me and he's always had a thing for the for japanese blades and recently i've been getting him slip joints over the past few years and he loves that aesthetic too so what did i get a slip joint samurai no close i got the new benchmade tengu for my father which is the which is the traditional looking uh tanto flipper and uh it is just a beautiful looking thing it's it's a classy gentlemanly knife it doesn't have a clip it comes in a little leather pouch and everything uh but uh i right up my dad's alley and uh and i'm i'm i'm thinking he's digging it i'm sure we'll uh hear more when we get your dad back on the podcast for uh some of his uh knife stories we've done that i think once in the past and some folks commented that they really liked it so yeah get him back on and tell an inside story about going on a trip and looking for a knife for you or some other kind of inside inside scoop there you mentioned knives in the tengu of course one of the featured knives that we have on our knives for sale page that's at the knifejunkie.com knives the knifechunky.com knives we try to keep that page up to date with a lot of the newest things and some of the things on sale from some of the manufacturers that we have relationships with so the knifechunky.com knives kind of tease it at the beginning bob not only does audio and video but he writes as well and congratulations bob he had an article that is featured and knives illustrated yes my first uh article in knives illustrated very proud of it uh it's about the cold steel xl folders and uh the premises basically they might look big and ridiculous and they might look like big murdery weapons but they also uh happen to be actually very very practical and excellent knives for for real world use uh you know out outside of the of the knife fight if you will uh and uh i i think i'd make a good argument and uh have some pictures up there and and and it was run through the uh run through the the editing hands of brian ball you know miss lacey dicey on youtube he's the editor of knives illustrated and uh very grateful he brought me on to do that article and he's i've been i'm writing another one currently for the next issue so yeah it's it's really cool to go to knives illustrated and see my photograph not the photograph of me but that i took of my cold steel xl folders right on the right and then i saw my name in lights bob marco well it wasn't in lights but it was in right on my screen so that's right it was right there yeah that was kind of cool and what uh you know briefly looking at the article what i liked was the uh the picture of your uh case your uh like tool case but it was just a drawer full of all these knives right there together uh to me that was i i like that picture the best it's like a family portrait it's hard oh there you go that's heartwarming oh i have to take a moment and i lost my breath there but yeah visit our friends at knives illustrated if you will if you're not yet subscribed that's a great publication to uh to make sure that you are subscribed too so knives illustrated and not for nothing jim it'll be interesting to see the editorial shift it makes under slicey's uh with slicey at the helm interesting thought there yeah uh if you uh after you get that knives illustrated and you read that article if you have any thoughts you want to share with bob shoot him an email at bob at the knife junkie dot com or better yet call the listener line at just add 724-466-487-724-466-4877 commentary to the article we would definitely love to hear from you all right bob before we go to our knife life news segment where we kind of dive into some of the product drops and knives uh knife news in the news this week if i can speak uh we want to say thank you um we this past thursday night on thursday night knives uh we almost had a bidding war if you will folks supporting the youtube channel supporting you with super chats if you're not familiar with super chats that's the way you can give money through the youtube platform in the chat format you you give a certain amount of money and just had great support from the community and i want to say thank you yeah i was so um humbled and flattered and and excited uh you know when we're doing thursday night knives it my mood is elevated your mood is elevated anyway i was i'm so happy to just be doing overview exactly being yeah right right just just bloviating about knives and people listening and actually conversing with me about it i'm not just out in the dark babbling knives like usual uh and i was just so touched yeah touched lavender pants 86 slicey dicey alex's knife box ocd for edc james moore hilltop knives and gear they all gave in super chat and uh and and a couple of them multiple times lavender pants alex and uh ocd for edc yeah you know like i said they were started like you said they were starting to one-up one another and i'm like oh shucks guys not over me but uh you know if you must and uh yeah very excited very um very uh happy about that thank you yeah yeah no i i touch tumbled you know honored i think all those words you can't say enough it definitely was uh was that um you know i i know we put a lot of time and effort into the podcast thursday night knives the town halls you know a lot of personal expenses that we shell out of the pocket for web hosting and uh the tools we use to put on everything so it's it's nice to see i think for me that just knowing that people see value and appreciate it that they would exchange dollars for for what we're doing yeah that's exciting yeah yeah so definitely well speaking along that and i you know it i don't want to be slimy or you know self-promotey or whatever kind of coming off as a huckster or whatever but i i while we're talking about this i do want to mention you just created a patreon oh so come on that's not being sleazy okay yes i just created a patreon uh page and and you can support the podcast uh support thursday night knives or the channel

entertainment or joy that you get from this and you feel like it's worth worth paying a little bit every month or uh or if you can that would be awesome if not just keep listening that's cool yeah free of charge no no no requirement to pay but if you want to show some love hey well yeah be glad you can do it yeah yeah knifejunkie.comtheknifejunkie.com patreon the knife junkie dot com slash

to the knife junkie podcast and now here's the knife junkie with the knife life news so jim earlier you were a little vexed by the name giant mouse because when we think of mouse we think of a little creature but giant mouse is a company that's been around for i don't know maybe three or four years at this point and it's a joint venture between famed danish knife maker slash designers jens anzo and jesper voxnes we know him as vox and anzo and together well let's just say apart they're designing uh and knife making phenoms and together they are giant mouse and their their uh aesthetics blend together beautifully and i've never had a giant mouse um knife i have sort of appreciated them from afar but they're not wheel house knives for me i generally like a bigger knife but they have this new ace grand coming out and uh the ace moniker on a giant mouse knife i believe uh is a sort of regular production knife because they also do limited runs of various knives so this ace grand looks to me like the vox f3 i have the boker version of that it's a beautiful clip point blade and in this case in the case of the ace grand it's their largest knife i believe and uh it has a 3.4 inch blade it's got that sort of spyderco esque deep carry wire loop over clip it's got a gorgeous green micarta handle with with liner lock and just a very very attractive clip point blade now this is something that they're uh that they've created and are sort of marketing towards outdoors use uh you know something that's supposed to be used outdoors and kind of hard used a lot of the pictures you see of this you'll see leather gloved hands you know carving a steak with it or and i don't mean a meat steak i mean you know a tent steak and uh just a lot of sort of uh outdoorsy images that come with it so that's i think what they're intending this to be so it's lmax it's got a high saber grind and uh and it's got a quite a nice looking kind of stabby tip it's a looks a little bit nicer to me than the uh i shouldn't say nicer a little bit more acute than the f3 so it looks like a beautiful knife i see it is sold out at this point i think it's a it's something that people have gotten on pre-order and um you know so i think they're the first batch is all out but right they'll be back all those mises or mices are sold exactly you know what uh on on second thought you you sh you shouldn't go by that you should you should dig around i have not done extensive searching for it just some of the usual places right okay so giant mouse learned something here uh every day on the knife junkie podcast all right uh moving on is it real steel or still will oh actually which is it it is steel will okay okay sorry uh to to those who who um take exception to that i always mix them up i'm not calling them the same company but i always mix them up right and but they excite me about the same and and and i'll say that the steel will sedge which is a new one that they came out with to me it's their version of the uh native chief it looks just like a native chief it comes in a three and a half and four inch blade which i like i love that they're offering a full four inch blade i think everyone should uh but that's just me but i gotta say jim man this this knife it just looks just like the native chief to me and it's in that same d2 uh g10 format that is great and i mean they really steel wills really makes a good knife i'm not saying this is a bad knife i'm just saying it's a just kind of another design in that format that's not quite doing it for me to me they're hit and miss like the last one uh the last steel wheel that got a lot of press the cilla i thought was beautiful and really cool and innovative uh this one uh is just you know looks if you like the design no doubt it's gonna be a very good and usable knife well i interesting question uh you say it looks just like the cheese this spyderco you know i've been listening and you know working with you on this podcast for quite a while and the question that comes in my mind every once in a while is how many knife designs can you really have i know so you know is it a a is it not surprising that one life knife looks like another knife even though they're designed or manufactured by different companies a fair point you raise and i and i and i neglected to mention what the real inspiration for the design of this knife is uh it is not the native chief i think it it's incidental uh this uh sedge is a is a type of grass and so this blade a very leaf-shaped blade just like all spydercos and the native chief very leaf-shaped blade is actually um is is actually uh inspired by a blade of grass so i yeah i think maybe you're right maybe that's an unfair assessment we've been making knives for 40 000 years or something i don't know i'm no historian but we've been making them for a damn long time and at some point things will start to uh things will start to look similar i mean we mentioned this in a podcast recently about how uh it might not be derivative like i'm like i was kind of impugning this knife to be it might just be in the same on the same shelf in the same category long leaf shaped blade one other question before we carry on with the next uh story in knife life news gonna go down a rabbit hole here you mentioned blade length uh we've talked about blade length all the time and you're a you know certain blade length kind of guy that's uh in your collection um a real knife newbie question here is it just as simple of measuring the blade you know from the visible part of the blade that you can see that determines how long it is i think most people will will go from the tip of the blade to the most forward uh part of the handle so the visible part yes exactly where it attached to the handle exactly but the furthest out so sometimes you'll get on a really what i consider a really good design you'll have a longer cutting edge than blade length because of how the handle curves forward and how the blade sorry more blade blade coming up under the handle yes exactly okay so would you measure the blade length in from what the visible part of the blade is under that handle well now quite often yes you'll you'll see a blade length and then a cutting edge length in specs okay because they uh especially uh with choils you know you add a you add a uh you could have a four inch blade like my hinderer xm24 is but they both have finger choils which reduces the cutting edge to three and a half inches hmm or okay or something like that okay all right um but but uh just on a blade length thing it's it's interesting i was thinking about it four inches is what is is always my ideal folding blade length and why because my first folding tactical knives were the early cold steel knives and they were all four inch and i think it's sort of like you know um you grew up in the 80s like i was a teenager in the 80s and maybe some of my style is still stuck there you know or maybe i'm still wearing jeans like i did in my 30s but i'm in almost 50 you know so if not you know how you kind of get locked into a style i think maybe my four-inch thing is just that well i guess the the moral of the story there is uh be careful what knives you buy for your kid as he or she is growing up because that might be the uh blade shaper style that they want to collect as they grow older so don't buy them something goofy i okay i agree i cannot disagree let me put it that way but still buy them something and get them started exactly all right uh zt a new zero seven zero seven yes yes something about the getting rid of the uh lock bar lock up yeah yeah okay so lock bar lock up that's a term i'm giving it but i think people probably know what i'm talking about so this this new knife if you look at it it's beautiful it's kind of uh well it's long and slender it's sort of in the class i i would put it in the zt class with the with the long syncovitch knives the zero forty zero four fifties and the zero four sixty series it's sort of like that long and sort of uh uh thin it also has a blade shape much like all of the new uh recent um zt's and kershaws with the with the pronounced swedge and the sort of modern looking almost harpoon nature of it so this thing is long and slender uh and the problem i have and a lot of people have especially if their hands are are bigger than mine you know is uh when you have one of these slender knives but their flippers and their frame locks it's difficult to deploy them without adding pressure uh with your stabilizing fingers that is your your middle finger your ring finger and your pinky against that lock bar making it almost impossible to open because the detent is already tight and crisp so that when you flip the bar the the the knife rockets out right you have a slender knife you have very little room to keep your hands off of that lock so they become very hard to open the zero seven zero seven adds this uh adds this new mechanism it's a second detent they call it the tds the tuned detent system uh and and it it is supposed to eliminate that quirk of thin frame lock flippers and i'm not sure how it does it but it reduces the pressure on the main detent i guess it takes some of the pressure off of the main detent and allows you to still kind of uh be ham-fisted with it if you will and uh and hold that lock bar down but still be able to flip the thing open now i've seen a few videos so far and uh but i haven't heard much in the way of uh opinion on that uh on that tds but it's a very lightweight knife it's 2.3 ounces i mean that's that's that's really late and it's a three and a half inch blade uh 20 cv as as is their usual these days so interesting innovation we'll see how it works it'll be interesting for uh either someone from zt or some of our listeners and and viewers on thursday night knives that maybe have gotten one come on thursday night knives and show it off and uh tell us what you like about it and kind of give us a preview there in video form on thursday night knives yeah that'd be awesome yeah so if you're interested shoot bob an email at bob at the knife junkie.com or call the listener line at 724-466-4487 or what the heck just show up on the thursday night knives and join the conversation exactly and and let me know why i shouldn't buy the zero seven zero seven because man it does look tempting jim well isn't that kind of your standard line for any knife why i shouldn't buy it as opposed to why i should buy i think that i think that's what it should be yeah because let's just face it why shouldn't i buy it that's right coming off father's day this past weekend uh father's week as we like to say that that's what i try to get away with you know with my kids it's like you know well it's a week before father's day don't make me do that you know it's three days after father's day where's my you know my cake or whatever but uh tops has their highly anticipated cigar cutter which is kind of apropos for this time of year if you will thinking of yeah well i guess this this it's called the 208 clipper and and this little sucker has been has been really highly anticipated but it first came out in prototype i think it was at shot show january uh 2019 so it's been almost two years and people have been anticipating it what this thing looks like it looks like a tiny friction folder version of their very first knife the what was that called the eagle the eagle it it has that very um aggressive geometric handle and the super aggressive american tanto blade uh but what what is this this is a little two and a half inch friction folder and a friction folder stays open yes by friction they usually have an extended tang the blade has an extended tang and you sort of slowly sweep it open like you would a front flipper except you do it slowly and then that extended tang locks and nestles tightly between the two handle slabs and that's how it stays open that and the pressure you put downward with your thumb on that tang that's what keeps a friction folder open why is this thing a friction folder well you don't want to lock on it because it's a cigar cutter and you want it to be free in in the path so this uh this little tanto blade two and a half inch is chisel ground so that means one the one side has the bevel so you look at it and it looks like a tanato you flip it over and the blade is completely flat which you know just from listening i love that uh emerson likes to do that uh other companies like to do that but the reason this is flat and chisel ground is so that flat side of the blade marries up nicely to the flat side of the inside of the handle now the handle has a hole on it just big enough to put a cigar tip through and so you have a nice cleaning shearing kind of scissor-like action with the chisel blade against the flat handle scale so this little thing looks really super cool it's like a tiny little tactical cigar cutter you know and then and then when it's when it's what it is that's right when it's cooked but it looks so mean and aggressive and when it's closed uh the protruding tang has a uh has a a bottle opener you know cap lifter on it so man how can you go wrong yeah i'm looking at it here on the thompson hives website and the little geometric uh patterns on you know on the the handle and as you said the the bottle cap opener there on the end and according to their website uh at least as our time of our recording it was still available uh 184 dollars on the uh the tops knives website is is what the going rate is there yeah msrp you might be able to find it cheaper elsewhere but yeah no doubt yeah um but uh yeah a cool cool little little piece and so think about that for father's day next year yeah go ahead and get it now before they run out that's right and now that we're caught up with knife life news let's hear more of the knife junkie podcast all right back on the knife junkie podcast episode number 123 our midweek supplemental episode of the the podcast bob gets a chance to go a little deeper into his state of the collection what he's got what he's got coming those type of things but right now he's not really talking about any knives in his possession but yet they are in his air quote possession they're not his they're borrowed yes they're not in my collection but they are in my possessions yeah so i got my second pass around knife and and uh the first pass around knife i got was really cool it was the little finch runtly that little uh warren cliff flipper and i had it for a week and a half and and i hadn't made my video of it yet and i was growing kind of attached to the the thing and i was like this is cool man i don't you know i gotta send it off don't get too attached and then i get an email saying hey you you were the last person in the pass around group to get this and we did a drawing and he won the knife and i was so excited i was like here i got this little knife i got attached and i want it it's mine well the second one came and i'm growing attached and and i'm realizing as i'm i'm i'm growing to the end of my stay with this knife or vice versa that the chances are very slim that i'm going to win again and damn it i've grown attached to this knife it's beautiful this is the savey rustic gent oh my gosh man it's it's a little i mean this i see this is up your alley jim as you are a gent it's about a three inch bladed lock back clip point in the tradition say of just in the tradition of the buck 112 ranger kind of the same overall size okay but but much smaller in in all dimensions including what i mean by that is it's it's way less bulky it's way lighter and it's just like way lighter yeah but so this knife is uh is a bolstered um lock back clip point with carbon fiber at the bolster and beautiful carbon fiber you know i'm not a huge fan but i love this and the rest of the handle is this beautiful burlap micarta and then the blade itself which is super thin and slice slicey like the other cevivi i actually own is in damasteel and it's just beautiful yeah beautiful knife man i love this thing and then it comes in a leather slip joint with a pocket clip so it doesn't have to rattle around at the base of your pocket and go sideways and and be uncomfortable it can sit at the top of your pocket in the same orientation that you carry all your other knives just in a little pouch um so it is classy as as can be and it's made by savi which is the well we're calling it the budget brand of we but man they i've heard someone recently say and now now i can't remember who uh but it's more like we is the upscale brand of savi because savi is just knocking it out of the park and this thing is great so yeah uh long and short of it is i got another pass around knife and i've grown attached but this one i know i'm gonna have to send back out yeah you better get that video done quick i know i know otherwise it might oh i can't send it until i i've done this interview well you can look for that video whenever it is available on the knife junkies youtube channel at the knife junkie dot com slash youtube again the savey rustic gent and looks like a suggested manufactured suggested retail price around the 75 dollar mark so not terribly expensive for such a great looking little knife as well yep um your impressions bob talking about borrowed knives or knives not in your collection but in your possession i like that a couple of knives that uh youtube friend dirk warning sent you to take a look at high end custom direwear and a rare medford so which one do you want to tackle first well i i let's tackle dirk warning first oh okay dirk has a a relatively new channel but uh on youtube crushing it though but he is crushing it he's he's on the upward ascent uh we had him on thursday night knives a few weeks back and and uh he's just been kind of a friend of the show introduced to us through alex uh alex dasso of alex's night box their buddies they're both collectors of very high-end knives and i was drooling over dirk's direwear solo in one of his videos he did a video of a borrowed direwear and compared it to his uh if you're not familiar with direwear it's a custom knife company and i know very little bit i know very little about them except i think they're beautiful and i've i've reached out to them i'd love to have them on the podcast and find out more about them but they create these incredible overbuilt tactical knives up my daughter took a look at this and she said the first thing she said and it came right out of her mouth was it looks like an orca and yeah this uh the solo that i'm the shark uh no the the killer whale oh the whale whale yeah well yeah so i i'm really really um kind of blown away by two things first of all that dirk warning doesn't know me from a hilly beans except uh except on the podcast and on the website sent me uh this knife and another and they are very very expensive and beautiful custom pieces and and that is impressive and then i am also just blown away by the workmanship of this of this direwear it is uh um people just have to look it up dire wear solo i think this is a five it's with a recurve uh tanto blade it locks in the hand like a knuckle duster and but it's beautiful and refined and uh god it's making me feel like oh i need to start investigating this realm of the knife world but uh but this is how i can investigate it right now with good friends like derek who can can send me something so i i'm gonna offer to send him uh something of my collection uh that he can do reviews on right the other knife he sent me was this medford viper which is oh my god it is a uh it is a giant uh raven looking raven-like knife that uh my first reaction to this was um to swing it around it is it's got a blade that is sort of worn cliffy with a with a light belly that angles forward in your hand so it's very aggressive already it's already cutting something before your hand gets there and it's got this beautifully curved handle that fits nicely uh in hand it's somewhat neutral and to look at it i i gotta be honest i've said this before about medford's uh you know i'd look at him be like god that's an awkward design or or straight up ugly and then i get them in hand them i i can't believe what i'm holding uh so this this thing i'm gonna make a review of it and uh uh put it up show it off on on the channel but something i uh the really unique thing about this knife this medford is that it's a folder and the blade is a quarter inch thick a quarter inch thick like like it's a like like it's an outdoor like it's a survival knife you know slab of meat oh my good gravy and then uh and then the whole thing is like .9 inches thick it's almost an inch thick but i'll be damned if it doesn't feel incredible in hand it's also 12 ounces i think just kind of works for you yeah it works for me so dirk um thank you and uh if you weren't so cool you'll be getting your knives back sometime well he said take your time and i can't take my time that's the thing uh this week i'm gonna get them back out to you because if i take take my time with this um i just might get too comfortable well those videos again forthcoming on the knife junkies youtube channel at the

type of cigar you want done the quad cutter it's awesome", "7Uia2tpCm44": "you [Music] hi there I'm it's great view of Calibri and today I'm going to talk about why use the punch cut the punch cut is designed to cut a small round hole in the top of the cigar it's a clean cut and it doesn't shred the cigar to leave pieces in your mouth and also enhances your smoking experience today I'm going to talk about the colibri quasar punch quasar punch as part of our infamous line of quasar that we started out in 2016 with Daniel marshal the quasar punch has three different sized punches on it for every ring gauge sized cigar the quasar punch comes with a retractable mechanism that the blades sit inset inside the punch and when you pull it out they pop out for use and then when you punch it back in after cutting your cigar it pops the tobacco right out so you don't have any cleaning and it comes straight out I'm going to show you how to use this quasar punch using the smallest on my cigar as you can see just find the center and simply twist into it there you have it light up your cigar put down you put it down use it as a stand for the quasar punch in all of your Calibri accessory needs go to serious cigars calm you", "NtntLfcaE9Q": "hi everyone how's it going welcome back to a channel where we talked about various hop products in the market based on our own research

of the wood body I have been using this cutter on 54 and 56 Wingate's of gauze and it gives a nice deep clean v cut thanks for watching our video", "7f2fyXdr5NY": "hey everybody how's it going I am going to do a review today of the xikar MTX black cigar cutter it's a pretty handy little device and I like this thing a lot so let's go ahead and show you what you get when you open this thing up see here wrap and this is the guy right here so this is this is a very handy little device I mean I would almost keep this on my keychain it's it's it's pretty small I'll get some keys so here's my keychain this is about the size of it hope you can see that so yeah you can almost keep this on your keychain and it's a hammie little device so what it looks like when it's unfolded this thing is very very sharp I kind of tuned it up a little bit but it's extremely sharp and it also comes with a couple tools here this is a handy little bottle opener it's little but it does work and it's just kind of a nice thing this is like a little screwdriver guy here and on this side we've got looks like a smaller screwdriver maybe and then this looks like a lighter bleed tool right here which is handy I've already used that a couple times so the thing I like about this is that you can use it to actually cut cigars in half completely or cut the ash end off here's a cigar that I actually did that with and you can see the cut is completely clean I didn't want to smoke the whole cigar so I just cut it in half and this is the uncut half so yeah this thing actually works really well and I can show you how it actually cuts here what you're gonna do is I kind of had to read up on this little bit because you don't want to just chop it in half like that but you kind of want to do is you kind of go around a little bit and kind of ease into it kind of like that just kind of you know let it do that okay it wasn't really that great of a cup but then you kind of like trim it up a little bit and make it nicer kind of a thing so I'm kind of new with this thing so bear with me on the cat but yeah so gives you a kind of idea of what what you can do with this thing super handy I would definitely recommend it I paid about thirty one dollars for this on Amazon and yeah I really like it so I suggest you grab one if you you know need something to keep in your pocket cut cigars alright thanks bye", "XNpv13c9Dn4": "[Music] hey guys welcome to JK palm Jason on this channel I'd use 5-minute quickie reviews and some of the best stuff that I purchased on Amazon I happen to be a cigar smoker from time to time it'll tell my wife that's a whole nother story this is a pretty cool product that I purchased years ago I actually have a couple of these in different places what in my office one in my house and what's cool about this is you get a number of different cuts for your cigar and it's really heavy really durable and you know most people look at it in one go well you know which I get one of these is definitely a little bit different but it basically has to be cuts and a couple of guillotine cut spurts and different sizes it's roughly about 70 bucks on Amazon I'll put a link below very easy to clean the back pops out and remove whatever the breeze in it really well made I mean it's definitely not not going anywhere it's it's just nice to have something a little different than those little plastic throw aways and the blade on this thing is insane I mean you do want to keep it away from small children you will have a visit to the emergency room and you do get those friends of yours that will stick their fingers in there from time to time but hey it's just stupid enough to stick your finger in then and I say you deserve it but that's a whole nother story so this is a cigar cutter tabletop this one have to be made by somebody called scorpion and builder and they'll be a link below is great I love it very cool you know there's also a link below another another review I did on this jet line lighter which is pretty cool it kind of go shoulder to shoulder just something a little different that's unique for lighten cigars and we just cutter you know you're definitely definitely a little different so thanks for tubing in subscribe in the future for more cool stuff like this like comment whatever Jason here play hard", "cEqjxTDdXcw": "the Cuban crafters black perfect cutter hi I'm Brian Glen with cigar obsession calm today we're taking a look at this second version of the Cuban crafters perfect cutter comes in an attractive gift box inside you find a information and warranty card and it explains that if there's ever problem with it take advantage of the lifetime guarantee on it just return it with a self-addressed stamped envelope and they'll send you a new one inside you'll find the cutter in some foam and like the original version which I have here this has a backing plate so when you go to cut the cigar it always cuts the perfect amount off the cap you just stick it in and make your cut you don't have to adjust and find the seam lines and get it to the right spot it just cuts correctly every time now they've made a couple changes to the original design which you can find in my previous review one of which is they have enlarged the center opening hole which is very handy because today larger cigars are certainly getting more popular you can see that it's quite the difference it's about a four ring gauge difference now I never had any problems using the original up to about a sixty the sixty would kind of just trim the cap but that was fine for me they still worked without any problem this one is absolutely perfect for sixty they fit right in there they take off the perfect amount if you're looking for those if you're smoking those really weird above sixty rain gauges then you're probably going to want to use some type of other cutter probably scissors because a really earn any cutters out there designed for regular cutting above a sixty but this will do any normal production cigar out there like the original version it's very easy to use you simply put it in your fingers put the cigar in make your cut then it holds the cuttings inside and when you're ready you just open it up and dump it out which I'm not going to do here comes with stainless steel blades the actual body and handles is anodized aluminum there is smooth very durable I put this in my pocket and it doesn't get scratched but it does scratch other stuff so you have to watch your lighters you have to watch your phone probably don't care about your keys but whatever else you're putting in your pockets this is some hard stuff this is a very very durable coating which is good for the lighter bad for other stuff the blades are of course razor sharp cut through everything without any problem whatsoever and this happens to be my favorite cutter line I absolutely love my original probably gonna use this until the day I die unless sir really comes something revolutionary I don't tend to smoke the really large ring gauges so even though this is definitely a design improvement it's not something I need the other difference between the two is the size of the finger holes I got fat fingers the holes on the new design are a little smaller especially width wise than the new one and it's very noticeable on my thumb the original I can get really good grip action very easy if you're like me and you have really big hands you're probably going to want this original the new one it works it's not a problem but it's not quite as secure to me as original its original is just absolutely perfect for me love this thing but the new one definitely have some very good design improvements I like the anodization that's going to be a lot more durable doesn't scratch I love the bigger hole and it is actually a little lighter this one is solid steel I believe it's noticeably heavier this one is very light so give this a shot if you're looking for a new cutter this will definitely do the job for you this is the Cuban crafters black perfect cutter they're about 20 bucks go-to Cuban crafters calm and check it out", "SsyxcEsHajY": "hey there guys I'm Kota Mayo this is cigar TV on today's episode of Star TV I'm not doing a review on a cigar no but I am doing a review on a fancy litterer cigar gadget that I found the other day it's a cutter and just from what I've experienced from it myself I think it's worthy of a review just because it's so simple but it's also one of the best and how do I put this what is the best cheapest cutters I've ever used so yeah yeah yeah one of the cheapest cutters I've used and and it took a long time to get to this point because as you can clearly see I'm nothing but skin and bones I think there's like some type of snake going through me or some type of form something yeah so let's get into this fancy review kind of fancy but not really this guy right here is the latest black-market cigar giving it a try but I most likely do a review on this cigar in a later video so yeah so what is this cutter that I'm talking about well it is called the trigger cut and it's a really thin cutter you can basically put it in your wallet slide it into your pocket and pretty much forget that now it is just a simple design like a rectangle that comes in both green black and blue from what I saw it is a guillotine style blade and it has this switch right here that allows it to pop up very simple it has a few Springs on the inside and it almost looks like you can pop it apart to clean it out but it also has this lid on the bottom so say if anything did get trapped inside the bottom of it you should be able to get it out pretty easily so yeah very simple works very smoothly the only part that I would say that I don't really like is whenever you go to push it in the clip hair kind of catches on the top part there but that's just because it's sliding back into the clip holder you know it's pretty decent so let me see I'll just give an example of how well it works with this leftover a cigar but so like most cutters you put it in the hole like that and then watch how smoothly it cuts it there's like almost no resistance whenever you cut with this cutter and that's one thing I like about it because you'd think something that's only four dollars would uh be a little bit more difficult to cut with whenever you go to slice through a cigar but you know this one is pretty nice not said that the blade would probably not like dull after multiple uses if you're looking for something that is from what I've seen so far somewhat durable and if either going on like a trip or something and don't want to take one of your more expensive cutters just from life the fact that you could end up losing it like saying your luggage like you accidentally leave it at the motel when you stay there like a couple nights before or like you're on a boat on the lake and you accidentally drop your cutter into the water let's face it you're not gonna jump into that lake not knowing what's down there right so yes good cutter only four dollars I think it could go it could be a little less expensive I'd say pop like two to three dollars would be the best price point for one of these but uh yeah it's a nice cutter I like it personally because I do a lot of demanding work at work and stuff and I don't like taking my good cutters because this the amount of the type of stuff that I do I could ruin one of my cutters very easily so something like this this comes in quite handy so yeah get a close-up right there trigger cutter a trigger cut this is the actual name so yeah it's just some motive pieces of plastic with like razor blade put in and it's quite effective

utility knife slash cigar cutter I found on eBay it's a valet auto strop safety razor cigar cutter and there's about ten bucks anyway it's an older thing well the tape versus my gloves is not working out it's a little keychain device as you can see and it's got like a little little loop it should be attached to a keychain and that kind of thing and um oh I'll include a link in the description if you want to check evite for these this one ran about ten bucks and so they're not they're not super expensive if you look around for one just um try to find a nice one not one that's like all rusty and beat up alright so here's your no it's curious about I was curious if this is the kind of thing that will stay shut so let me fiddle with my gloves for a second and then we'll open this thing up and take a look at it wow it does not open easily I guess that's a good son oh yeah this thing will not come out of your pocket accidentally alright so there you go it's the you'll see that you'll see the writing the auto strop safety razor company New York London and Toronto and it looks like it takes don't want to pull it out and force anything but anyway so it's a cigar cutter as you can see you have a hole for your cigar or I guess if you're in some kind of movie and you need to torture an informant or something like that you know actually this kind of small for a finger but the way it was work if you just snip the end off like so this actually I was really concerned about if this kind of thing would accidentally come up open in your pocket and definitely no danger of this happening with this let's take a look all right so as you would expect from a razor blade it is pretty darn sharp it's kind of a neat little knife it definitely has a style to it I mean it looks has a bit of elegance to it and the kind of thing you could carry on your keychain um I think that if you want to carry one of these on your keychain though you need to make sure you have one that's like very tight like this because I wouldn't I wouldn't want to gamble like you accidentally like this actually comes open in your pocket and you reach in and you basically grab the razor blade in that I think would be not amazing so but yeah this one this one right here there is no danger of it coming up and on its own so just make sure if you're gonna cut one of these down you you if you carry it and make

we are the cigar ambassadors I'm one of your host Lewis star and as my partner Bob Bosma and we're just sitting here having a great discussion as we always do talking to you about all things related to cigars as we share and explore and our experiences and learning more about the cigar culture and everything related to such and today we got an episode that's quite interesting in its own right and we talked about lighters in one episode and today we're talking about cutters we just talking about cutters we had a lot of them here you know they're essentially three different types of cutters essentially you have you have your you can call it a butterfly cut a guillotine cut a straight cut however you want to cut call back right we're just cutting off that entire end of the cap right or you have a v cut and there are a lot of people partial to be cuts yeah I'm not one of them but we'll talk through why you want it why you might want to do that mm-hmm you have the punch cut and then you have one of our favorite toys which is the scissor which makes which makes just a straight cut yeah but you know they're to me they're a lot of fun they are a lot of fun gotta be careful using it though you do but there's let's let's start by talking about just the traditional straight cut and the options that you have and why you would want to do that now which cut do you prefer and why I'm a straight cut kind of guy but it depends on the cigar reengage that I'm smoking and how I want that stream of smoke to flow through the cigar that I am smoking so there are times where I might go to a punch which is a very traditional sharp reliable punch as you see here this is a sidecar punch I've had this for about 15 years now however you ask the question what's my go-to the butterfly if you will another xikar product very reliable and II just need to take care of it it's so easy to use and once you open it and get your cigar in it just right at the end of that cap and there you have it your cigars cut and it's a straight cut although you can do angle cuts with that I don't typically do an angle cut I just do a straight cut off the top of the cap and put fire to my cigar I'm ready to go what's yours it's it's a straight cut I I don't prefer the v cut because frankly I don't like the way the cigar feels in my mouth mmm less less so the punch but again when you start using v cuts and punch cuts down you're restricting the flow the airflow and there are different theories behind that right but I don't like I don't like increasing the difficulty of the draw okay with with the punch like I said with the v cut it's more I just don't like the way that feels in my mouth and frankly I don't like the aesthetics of it either so I use I use a straight cut you know it's funny because we have we have all of these you can see the variety here of different kinds of cutters to use straight cuts we'll talk about one of them here in a minute but I love I love calling it a guillotine cut and you know playing with beguine so that's this is this is one of my favorite cutters one of the most interesting I think and especially if you're a newer cigar smoker and you struggle with cutting off too much of the you you cut beyond the cow right and now your cigar starts to unravel you have you have these cutters that actually have a back to them right and so you'll press you put your cigar in there you'll cut it yeah and you in theory will not cut past the cap right that's not always true nope but it's that's the theory and generally it works one I had hoped to have now and I haven't received it yet but I ordered one is you'll have a again with this back but it'll have a hole in it right and it's designed to do the same thing with torpedoes and I think that's pretty cool it is pretty cool once you get into torpedoes now you can't really use a punch no you can't really use a v-cut well if you're careful enough but I recommend I'm not thank you so now you're now you're stuck using one of these right and when when you cut it you want to make sure you cut into that cap again the torpedo will restrict the flow there are people who this isn't a torpedo but I'll show will cut maybe up to a 45 degree angle yeah I have heard various explanations for that I don't believe any of them but you know if that's if that's the way you enjoy your cigar more power to you yeah I think it's just more of a fad than anything else we've had a lot of conversation about what that may or may not do for the cigar smoking experience and again we're not disparaging anyone's technique and how they want to cut a cigar if that's what you like to do have fun with it it's your cigar exactly now you have some fun cutters that we want ah yes I do let's let's play show intellibid what do I have in my surprise bag here well hi this wonderful key right here folks as you can see it's more than a key this looks beautiful is colored in gold it's a Monte Cristo special gift if you will you have to sign up to get this but it's a punch quite heavy hefty you know put in your pocket but you know it's there but I like this feature because as it closes once you've punched it that all that tobacco releases from this and it's a great little item you can put it on your keychain or put it in your backpack whatever you're carrying for your women out date and put it in your purse please put in your purse do so if I don't have my cut on your with me I want to know that you have something like that enjoy my cigar but I also have but Bob has the guillotine as a straight cut and I have the be cut guillotine this is a beautiful little item and if you like B cuts you know you have two different types you have the straight cut and you this because I need one of those just because I don't have one and it looks really good it's I love it and forgot I actually had it you know I got a box full of cutters folks and just like lighters I got more cutters and lighters than I can imagine but I have them all so the butterfly cut that Bob shows you a moment ago loved this as long as you maintain this keep it clean keep your blades clean put a little droplet of oil right here and you'll see that in the instructions when you buy this and it will last you a lifetime and if it doesn't what cycle might replace it I believe they are there they'll work on it and get it back to its original condition is send it right back to you and no cost to you other than shipping and handling that is generally what they have done there you go now we see there's a scissor here of sorts but I also have another one here this little dinghy right here is the switch with Swiss Army this is a Swiss Army knife no cigar cutters it has four separate tools to here that can help you adjust the flame on your lighter or use it as a tool if you have a screw or whatever they get out you being a Fathead or I tried it on the Phillips and it works long as you get into one of them you have a bottle opener but I have better bottle openers than that so I don't need that but this is my go-to tool for purging my cigar lighter I actually had to purge the lighter earlier today and we use that tool there you go and this is great another xikar product has a little ring so you can keep it on your keychain if you want to on another episode I demonstrated how to use this and on another one we'll do it again just to let folks know how to appropriately apply it enough pressure to the cigar to score and then simply cut off the cap the top of the cap and you're good to go but there's more if you order now No real quick if I fold all these little extra accessories together and fold this down this is all you have to carry around folks it compartmentalizes into something that's very light and convenient to carry put in your pocket you almost don't know that you even have it and that's another xikar product and then are we advertising for sidecar right now maybe I think so the exo from xikar this is a beauty right here it handles a 68 60 gauge the 60 ring gauge cigar I should say and if you're smoking something like that that's why I started starting because I usually don't smoke a 16 gauge but if you happen to have one this little thingy we get the trick done it's so easy to use but be careful folks there's this little tricky you hand it to somebody in there fumbling with it because they can't figure it out and then you have to show them it's just like that there's a little button right here that controls the mechanisms and once you open that up you get your cigar in there just right close it and it's a very unique quick cut I want to make comment on that which is shot it's not an inexpensive cutter I know and yet everyone I know who has ever bought that cutter has no regrets about know they love that cutter and I don't have the case in front of us right now they also will send you a beautiful case to put that in so you don't damage it but his for every guy that has his own little smoking room in mancave must have this device this right here folks you get four different type cuts two v cuts and two straight cuts do not put your fingers in there make sure you keep your fingers away from the hole spoiler alert I didn't once I was in a rush clipped off my fingernail thank God it wasn't my finger and I was like wow is this thing I was shocked but it's so easy to use you just put your cigar in there resting it rest it inside the slot that's there depress this down you're done you have a clean cut the blade stays sharp for they guaranteed for life but you know if it starts a good dog I think you can go to the manufacturer and get them neither change it out or sharpen it for you but there you have it there's so many options for you and I think we both have a more less expensive if you will travel punch okay well let me ask you a question now when we talked about lighters we said cost isn't a factor right I have my little I don't know I think I paid four bucks for this little cutter okay this price matter when it comes to cutters we said largely it doesn't when it comes to lighters however we said it and I'll say it again quality and a cutter matters because you want a good quality cut on your cigar and if you get a light a cutter that will rip your cigar apart you're gonna have an unraveling cigar you're gonna have a mouth closed loose tobacco and you're not going to enjoy that smoking experience I would add to that that many of these cutters you really can't sharpen the blades they're not they're not designed to have to have that done right really especially the straight cuts the V cuts as well right there's just no way to really sharpen that no xikar will disassemble this and sharpen the blades or send you a new one right and that's the reason I think you really want a quality cutter whereas you don't yeah you know we talked about you could spend $10 on the lighter and you'd be fine right but you know what this is my toy yeah to play with mm-hmm when I want a reliable cut this is this is what I go to it's as I cart yeah I think it runs about 40 bucks but it's it is reliable and this has served me probably for 10 years and it cuts as well as it did the day I bought it and again speaks to what we just said that if it should get dull on you z\u00e0i car will take care of repairing or replacing you and at a minimal cost and you have that cutter for a lifetime there are some cutters that have a claim and I won't say who that it's a self sharpening cutter well I happen to have one and this little thing right here which scares most people because it's so lightweight it looks like something that a moil will use but it is self sharpening it's very compact comes in this beautiful little red another case from Monte Cristo well their names on it anyway however I've had this for about eight years now and it still cuts like the first day I got it it's a samurai cutter is what they call it great little device and I guess the fact that they said it self shopping is proving itself to stay sharp for me and it all depends on what you're doing but you know what there's something else I've learned too and we want I don't want to leave this one out do you loan your cut it to anybody to cut a cigar uh in the shop I will loan my cutter to somebody to cut their cigar as long as they don't put their mouth on that cigar before they cut it there you have it and that's what I want to put out folks because whatever they put on their cigar be a saliva whatever have you that will transfer to your cutter and it can ruin your cutter also do you really want that transfer no no I don't know if there's anything else we can say about cut is when am i leaving anything you know I I just had a thought that this little Lotus cutter actually has serrated blades Wow and I think it does help with the cut yeah eventually these blades will become dull but I actually got it because of that and I found it worked quite effectively but I think well cooks there's a lot about cutters probably more than you want to know but you know the more you know the more you grow you want to thank you again put the tuning in

I don't know we should look at the camera we're talking directly but we're not talking to each other yeah we are talking to you right you want the information so yeah we are look at this information Gavin we're on like we're life oh yeah we're starting over okay how to cut a cigar or give you some information that you can use surrogate butchers tell your mom your aunt your niece I learned something today on the youtubes a lot of people buy a cigar and they're like terrified on how to cut a cigar because they're expensive I don't know it's a new hobby they've never tried before they don't want to cut it out but they often do crap enough there's two different kinds of basic cutters guillotine cutter xikar is a good brand if you're looking into specific brands for cutters they don't pay us we just like their product but if they wanted to hate I'll take their money I'll take it it's pretty straightforward it's two blades slicing base if you have a torpedo or perfecto you need a guillotine cutter because you're going to need to put it through some people they only smoke half and then they cut it off I wouldn't recommend that once you smoke a cigar you could light it back up but it's not going to taste very good skin a little dry when you cut with a guillotine it's a little bit tricky because you have to carefully cut off just the cap you don't want to cut below the cap it takes a little bit of time to find the right place to cut and then you want to cut it cleanly sometimes when you cut with a guillotine cutter you're going to get bits and pieces of tobacco in your mouth you have to spit it out like an [ __ ] so that's one thing that you don't really get much of with a punch cut have you ever seen like maybe a bond zone or something like that that are usually rocking the guillotine they're not really as much about the punches our next cutter real quick though mission impossible to villain cut off someone's ah what Vikki adhere it was like the shittiest of all the Mission Impossible videos a 90s axe genres heyday genre directed ellen also the female actress thoroughly underwhelming the next thing we get sidetracked all time the next thing that we move to Gavin favorite definitely one of my favorites would be the punch portable you can put it on your keychain yeah a lot of times when you're smoking a very delicious cigar you're going to get some saliva on your cigar might actually cause some like burn issues we find these plunge cuts keeps the moisture from getting deeper punch cut I feel like it's a cleaner cut and that's even with a really sharp guillotine cutter like the xikar is the good thing about the xikar is it's faster it's faster to gauge it and then snip as opposed to with a punch cut you have to kind of gently work it into the cap kind of roll it around you have to maybe twist maybe push a little bit and it takes a little bit longer not that much longer in my opinion my favorite cutter style is a punch cut but there are some times where you can't use a punch like a perfecto or torpedo a guillotine is a must it's a must-have sometimes it happens you punch a cigar and it's still too tight of a draw so what you can do is you can punch it multiple time bigger hole that'll get as much air flow through the cigars pause I think we can reiterate the the caps when you're looking to cut your cigar first select a cutting utensil we recommend the guillotine and the punch there's also a v cut we don't have one to show you but essentially it cuts like a groove we'll find a photo online we'll get that information to you Winston Churchill he never used a cutter he would just take the end of a match and punch the back of his cigars if you don't have a cutter I've used just a steak knife and I'll take the tip of the steak knife and I'll gently press it in and then press it in again and make an X and that works amazingly well if you don't have a cutter that's what I would do yeah derail me again good information just we should put that at the back end of what I was going to say too bad take your cutter then locate especially if it's a guillotine the different caps they're not there for shipping gigs they're there to hold the wrapper leaf in place whether there's one two or three caps because all of them off chances are that the wrapper leaf is going to start unraveling on you and you're going to look like a chameleon locate carefully the the top cap and then cut only that much off make sure you leave some of the second cap or some of the third cap still on if that's going to keep the wrapper leaf in place also when it comes to getting cutters it does pay to get a quality guillotine a crappy guillotine with dull blades you're going to find that it tears the caps off and then you're going to have the same unraveling issue which is no fun or you'll get more bits and pieces of tobacco in your mouth why not just skip that this guy had a really bad cutter for a long time where I had this one and you know he just wanted to walk in my shoes I mean it's understandable right it really pays really pays to get a quality punch like Gavin said you got to ease into it when a punch is dull you're going to be there all day you might be like squeezing you know the the back end of your cigar trying to just put pressure now you might crack the wrapper there and this is happening you can crack the wrapper just on the cap and then the capital the whole cap will fall off I have a sharp punch and have a sharp guillotine cutter it will last longer you get your money with the pros and the cons I think a guillotine looks cooler when you're in the process of cutting nice guillotine cutter and you have a nice cigar and you're in a public place they're just chicks look in that [ __ ] and you're just like oh hey girl and you wait out your up but what I got you without your awesome guillotine cutting machine and you slice it you know the girls can be like whoa that guy's live in life on the edge dangerous really really do smell cigars I like my fantasy my fantasies more fun it looks cooler when you're cutting and it's faster to cut and you need one regardless for torpedoes but it's bigger so that's one more thing taking up space and your tight fitted jeans we only endorse tight fitting Jean yeah as usually as you should be punchcards like a keychain so small and portable that's awesome second thing is that I think produces a cleaner cut which could you know produce a better smoking experience well you don't look as cool and it takes a little bit longer they both got their own you know time and place to use this is taking too long could we light up now yeah let's move it on to how to light a cigar check out our podcast it's a lot of fun we smoke

one you're looking forward to is ruined by a poor cigar cutter a subpar cutter can damage your cigar and thus your smoking experience to avoid this problem it's important to look into what best fits your needs to enjoy your experience to the fullest in this video we'll go through some of the varieties of cigar cutters so you know which one might work best for you guillotine cutter when you think of a standard cigar cutter a guillotine cutter is likely what comes to mind with a single blade the guillotine removes the entire circumference of the cigar tip also called the cap allowing a good amount of smoke to pass through guillotine cutters are typically the most common cutters because they include the most inexpensive design of cutters available the humble single blade guillotine while you can find some high-end single bladed cutters they have a mostly low to mid-range price v-shape cutter the v-shape cutter is a great option for the serious cigar smoker it's designed to take just the right amount of tobacco from the cap for an ideal draw because of the way it's designed the v-shaped cutter actually cuts more deeply and exposes as much or more tobacco as a standard guillotine cut and can be used in a variety of cigar shapes however it's important to consider this cutter and investment if you're going to buy a v-shape cutter opt for a pricier one as the cheaper models tend to go dull rather quickly and are virtually impossible for a normal person to resharpen punch kagra unlike other cigar cutters a punch cutter doesn't remove the entire surface area of a cigar instead it removes a small circle of the cigar cap wide enough to draw smoke through the punch uses a simple push and twist motion to cut through the cap this type of cutter is ideal for smaller or narrower cigars but some smokers like to use it for the wider gordo type cigars that have become popular as it offers a more restricted draw instead of the overly Airy draw that a guillotine might produce if a more open draw is desired it's a simple matter of punching more of the cap it is not however a particularly good tool for a tapered figure Auto such as a torpedo cigar scissors cigar scissors are a slightly old-school way to cut years ago with an elegant and sophisticated look you'll commonly find this variation among seasoned cigar aficionados these cutters often come with other cases or other traveling accessories that add to its appeal but with serious smokers like about it is that a good pair of cigar scissors can cut in much finer increments and angles than any other method allowing for

do unboxings on this is a special very special all-in accessory grip kit you got well i'll do the unboxing explain exactly what you get so the all all-in accessory grip kit you get a whole bunch of stuff oh my goodness it just keeps on coming yeah yeah so what we got here two four six seven total items in this all accessories or cigar related stuff i don't know how else to put it uh but let's uh let's take a look here at each item uh first you get a cigar cutter or scissor set i mean scissors it's plural but yet it's just one i don't quite get that but uh but this is uh from gurkha uh kind of cool you know logo there with the uh trying to make it look like i think like uh what do you call it like uh like bone or like mammoth tusk something you know what i'm talking about uh so yeah it looks kind of cool whoa big big big cutter scissor cutter i think this will handle like an 80 ring gauge and below probably so now cigar cutters or cigar cutter scissors they are a little more difficult in my opinion to use than regular cutters but they do give you a little bit more of a kind of you know cutting window if you will or or radius so there are some advantage advantages some customers swear by them i like them just to change it up a little bit and it's definitely a conversation piece but yeah very nice gurkha cutter scissor tool thingamajiggy oh and you can also there's a little belt clip here so if you want to be really cool you can just throw that onto your old belt and always be ready to cut your cigars so that's the first item here where are we at next some humidor humidification solution is propylene glycol oh i'm sorry so it's called toasty jones humidor juice or cigar juice and what it is it's just a propylene glycol mixture proper lean glycol is a inert chemical well it's not inert because it does something but it's a very common chemical that's used in foods and and you know different consumables but in the cigar world it has a very unique property where it's um i forget the exact term but it will release uh humidification into the air when it uh drops below about 70 humidity and it will actually kind of absorb humidification from the air when it goes above 70. so it's a it's a humidification stabilizer if you will and you can add this to your cigar humidification jars you can add it to sponges humidor sponges all different kinds of stuff but this is a really great tool to use in keeping your cigars at the right humidification and it's a great brand of cigar juice so you get a bottle of that it's a eight-ounce bottle by the way then you get a four ounce jar of cigar caddy crystal gel humidification and i'm not going to take it out of the uh the plastic wrap because i think you can still see everything pretty good but at the bottom of the jar here you have some unactivated gel crystals and that is also i believe a type of propylene what i call but it's in a different form and when you add either the juice which we suggest it works a little bit better you could use just distilled water as well but when you add that you add it up to that there's a fill line there i don't know if you can see that you want to put the water solution in there get it up to that fill line and these little tiny crystals that you don't think are going to do anything will fill up and they will grow and they will fill up this entire jar and then you put it in your you know you take the the lid off and you put it in your humidor or your case or whatever you're keeping your cigars in and these gel crystals will slowly release the humidification and it will give you a visual indicator of when you will need to add some more solution so as the days go by the little gel crystals will shrink in size as it they release their their water content into the air and you'll be like oh look i need to add some more solution so very very convenient very easy to use and they work great so you get one of those now on to let's talk about this real quick you get one of my favorite accessories cigar caddy cigar travel humidor case this is the 15 count but i say this all the time you can get more than 15 cigars in here it comes i'll open it up it comes with foam inserts to help protect the cigars so you know one of the uses one of the main uses of this caddy is to be able to transport your cigars whether it's on the golf course whether it's on vacation but you load it up with cigars and and you use these foam inserts to help you know separate the cigars from each other and in theory you know give them more protection but in my personal use of these i also use them as just in home humidification systems or devices i take out the foam inserts there's one on the bottom there but you can get about 25 to 30 cigars depending on the size in here and so a little bit more than a 15 count technically but these work great whether you whether whatever you're using them for if you're using them for travel great if you're using them for at home um storage fantastic as well and the secret is you know it has the uh humidification disc here that's great you know and you can add a little bit of toasty jones couple drops that's all it takes right there and that works fine but the real secret of this is the fact that it seals so tight when you snap these clips down this thing is airtight it's waterproof it's crush proof and really it is just locking in that air inside it's not letting dry air in it's not letting the you know humidification out it's really providing a very stable and um foolproof uh and trust me you know takes one to no one foolproof system for storing your cigars highly suggested not just for travel what else do you get in the all in accessory grip kit you may be asking i'll tell you you get two lighters you get a polio this is a triple torch lighter attractive white finish very clean looks nice you get the palio branding there you get a light above and like i said you get three flames so triple triple torch action um you want to put a little butane in here obviously so we can't ship lighters with butane in them um people often not often but every once in a while will ask you know how can we not ship them with butane we would if we could but we can't um but fill it up butane just a little bit will do you uh once you get that in there boom i'm talking three big old triple flame action um we'll let your cigars up real quick and uh that's a real nice one you get one more layer it's not just one letter you get two lighters you get this xycar dual flame torch and what i like about this is you know you get the double flame that's real nice it has a little bit more of like a like a sleek feel in the hand i mean this one's nice too but you know it's kind of like the way it's angled this is just it feels a little sleeker in the hand i guess is the term to use it's got a real clear window right there in the middle to be able to tell what your butane level is at and it also offers punch cut action built right in so you'll never be without some way to kind of punch or cut your cigar just pop that right on the foot take out the little cap hole here and you'll be good to go so you get two different lighters both serving their own special purposes mainly to light your cigar you know but uh finally there's one more thing let me just get this out of the way here okay uh one more thing you get another cutter you get a paleo cutter and this is a nice black matte finish um just a set size here so with a scissor you're getting a little bit of a bigger cut uh with this you're getting kind of just a standard cut it's going to handle up to a 54 56 ring gauge even a 60 and remember you don't have to take like more than just the cap off your cigars so even if you have a cigar that's that's larger than this you know this opening here um you're just trying to take that little bit of cap off so even with the bigger cigar this will still work it does max out at probably around like a 64 or so 60 is is probably the more realistic max out but i mean hey if you're smoking you know 64 plus you probably have like a chainsaw at home or something to cut your cigars with um one nice feature one another nice feature about the the palio is there's somewhere there's supposed to be like a uh holds here i guess this one this one doesn't have let me see if it uh i guess you could so pretend this is a cigar for a moment all right see smoking the cigar pretend it's a cigar you can kind of use this as like a cigar holder thing and just put your i guess you can really probably use any little device as a cigar holder huh so forget i said that it's just a great cutter and you get all this in the all in accessory grip kit this is really cool this is like the biggest accessory kit we've ever put together and um you know especially great for people looking for a gift if you know a cigar smoker in your life and you're like i don't know what brand he likes i don't know what cigars

out of a humidor that they've been in for over a month at seventy-three percent humidity first we're going to do these I car cutter you can see these have a little cap on them so we're going to go beyond the cap for all the cuttings nice clean cut nothing really shaking off you know nothing real shaggy sticking out to get caught in your mouth looks pretty good and that's these I car cutters these come with a lifetime warranty and they're not too bad usually twenty to thirty dollars and you can see that cap full cap came off nice and clean next we'll be doing the Colby colibri cutters these are the cigar international branded ones same cigar out of the same humidor again we're going to going past the cap and that one seemed to shatter a bit more rather than cut and also I noticed there's a little bit of a shadow right here and tear both will be a very smokable cut I just think you're going to be picking more tobacco out of your teeth so far with how this looks compared to those that car I do use both frequently on both brand and these cutters I picked up mostly just for if I needed to stop smoking my cigar breathily wanted to cut off a big chunk of it you know didn't want to worry about the cherry burning the plastics or the paint and some of these other ones just kind of cheap knock around one so same cigar out of the same humidor and again going just behind the cap and these just mangled the cigar you can notice its shapes changed a little bit oblong now and cracked the rap pretty bad I mean still very smokable cut but I'm definitely from the three that I sample here today I'd recommend these I car above all the rest thanks and hope this was useful to you and making a purchasing decision", "uMoSRjlAVM0": "jaqen devin here we're doing a little bit

you know some q-tips or calling things whatever you want to you know do a little bit of scrubbing with alright so we're gonna start this up you just pour a little bit in there see how that works a little bit of scrubbing yeah that's definitely taking aunt like all the yeah I see you can see all the stuff that's taken out are you going closer see all that gross stuff there right there yeah just

My name is Paul Anthony, CP: And I'm CP. Paul Anthony: And today we're gonna show you\nhow to cut a cigar. If you're in a rush, see the link above me,\nbecause we've got a super quick guide on how to do the perfect cigar cut. So guys, if you're here for the long haul\nand you really want to explore how to cut cigars, we've got everything from the guillotine\nstraight cut, the punch cut, the V cut, and we're gonna also talk about some other methodologies\nthat maybe are not ideal, such as using your teeth, a match, a pocket knife, et cetera. So, but let's get started with- CP: When you're in a pinch. Paul Anthony: Ha ha, when you're in an absolute\npinch, you could literally pinch it off the top. But we're gonna go with, if you have the correct\ntools in the arsenal, so, you know. Here we have a nice selection on the table\nof a couple of desktop ones. All of these will be in the links below for\nwhere to buy. We have this Colibri Quasar, which has a guillotine\ncut as well as a V cut. We have this desktop one here, which has different\nring gauges, and then we go ... I mean, most of you guys are going to have actually been\nintroduced to probably these, first. CP: Yeah, this is the standard, isn't it? Paul Anthony: Yeah, the kind of plastic- CP: Double guillotine. Paul Anthony: -ones that you get effectively\nfor free or a couple of dollars at a cigar lounge. But they're pretty flimsy. They definitely do the job, but you know,\nas budding cigar aficionados and people that want to potentially step up their cigar game,\nit's very stiff. It's ... sometimes you can risk just squishing\nthe cigar as opposed to cutting it. But that's probably where most of you guys\nhave started, so that's good to have on the table and show you. Then we step up to some of the better known\nbrands, such as Xikar and Colibri, and we even have the Xikar scissors, which are actually\nmy preferred method of cutting a cigar now. I just feel like there's a higher degree of\nprecision. CP: Oh yeah, these are fantastic. They're very precise, but they are quite difficult\nto master. They also come with a number of other little\nhandy tools in the back of the finger holes, which you can use for things like opening\nbottles or even as a cigar puck if you've got a tight draw. So they're very handy, and quite a premium\nchoice. Definitely one of the best. Paul Anthony: Yeah, definitely. Definitely. So let's get started. I think the number one one that we should\ndo is probably the straight guillotine cut. CP: Yeah, let's get started. Paul Anthony: This is definitely the most\npopular, so Charles, take it away. We have a Davidoff Late Hour here, pick your\nweapon of choice. Maybe the ... or maybe you want to explain\nactually where you want to cut the cigar. CP: Very important thing to remember is that\ncutting a cigar can make or break the smoking experience. So always take great care in doing this. Don't be indecisive though, don't be too hesitant,\nbecause that's also a recipe for disaster. As you'll see right here, there is ... or\nyou may see, or you may not, there is something called a cap. That is a bit of wrapper leaf we just stuck\nat the top. If you cut anywhere below this, you risk unraveling\nthe wrapper, and it will just fall to pieces as you smoke it. Instead, you want to cut above it, and I'm\ngonna display with these scissors. Right here, or here, but nothing lower. Also, the height that you cut; that will change\nthe draw on the cigar. The lower it is, the fuller draw you get,\nthe higher it is, the tighter the draw. So there is some personalization available. Paul Anthony: So Charles, do you want to maybe\nuse those scissors and show us how it's done? CP: I will show those scissors. Okay. I'm going to ... I'm right handed, so I'm\ngoing to like this. And we're going to first moisten the head. That doesn't mean, like, lick it all over\nand make out with it. Just put it in your mouth a little bit and\nlet some humidity be sucked into the cap, like so. This will make it less brittle, and easier\nto cut. It's not going to crush under your scissors,\nit's not going to fall to pieces, it's not going to take a chunk of flag leaf off, which\nis the cap, and then unravel in the process. Paul Anthony: I mean, I think that's a personal\npreference though. Because I know in the U.S a lot of cigar bars\nwill offer to cut your cigar for you, and there's not a guy out back licking the top\nof cigars. CP: Oh yeah, this is just for me. A personal thing that I like to do. Paul Anthony: Personal preference. CP: And a lot of people swear by it, some\npeople feel it's unnecessary if the cigars are properly stored. I like to err on the side of caution, because\nthere's nothing worse than a bad cut of a cigar and it unraveling while you're enjoying\nyour smoke, so. Paul Anthony: So it is a nice little insurance\npolicy- CP: Yeah, exactly. Paul Anthony: Yeah. So just to let you guys kind of be aware of\nthat. CP: So, I'm here right above the cap, I have\na little bit of flag leaf visible, and snip. There we go. Paul Anthony: And the really nice thing about\nscissors is, it gives you a lot of control, a lot of visual control over being able to\nkind of touch up an edge if it is a little bit scruffy. CP: So see here, it's a little bit bumpy,\nI could just snip away here and take a little bit off to make it perfectly flat. But I'm not gonna do that, because this for\nme, is perfect. Paul Anthony: Yeah. A lot of other people prefer the kind of guillotine\nmethod, because we have a butterfly one here by Colibri, we have a single blade movement\none here by Xikar, some people find these a lot easier to control, but I personally\nprefer the scissors. Anyway, moving on. We have the V cut. So Charles, what is the benefit and drawbacks\nof a V cut? CP: There are lots of different schools of\nthought regarding the V cut. It is really a polarizing cut. I personally really like it, but I am not\nvery good at mastering it, because it's very easy to screw up. One of the benefits is, by doing this V cut\nshape, which is a chunk, effectively, out of your cigar like so- Paul Anthony: I'll probably demonstrate it\nquick. So I have this desktop one, and this one's\nactually fairly easy. I won't lick it for purposes of demonstration,\nbut you can just see here that you just place the cigar in the hole and then you literally\npop down, and there you have a nice even cut through. I've even heard guys say they prefer the V\ncut, because they feel like they don't get a lot of loose tobacco, so you can see in\nthis ash tray here that there's like, a load of floaters that have kind of exploded out\nfrom when we've used the cutters, where this ... there's nothing. It's actually pretty clean, there's only a\nlittle bit of tobacco debris, and some guys don't like that. Also, it reduces ... a lot of the time You\nhave a guard on a V cutter such as this one, as where a guillotine you can go all the way\nthrough. You can chop as deep as you want, so. It kind of creates that perfect cut. It's actually ... I think most guys find it\nmore simple. CP: It is much simpler, but you just have\nto remember to press, otherwise you're just going to get a little dent. Another benefit is though, apparently on the\nsides here, that is the tar that builds up rather than smoking that, so you don't get\nthe bitterness, and you don't get also the buildup of tar when you're actually smoking\nyour cigar. Paul Anthony: I know our very own Trevor Guilday\nhere likes a double V cut. CP: Great Scott. Paul Anthony: So we're gonna see if we can\nmaster it without him here. So here we go. I'm lined up ... CP: If you find the V cut too tight, you can\nthen just double it up like this and you have a much looser draw. Now, some may argue that this is heresy. Paul Anthony: A bit extreme. But anyway, that is an option for you guys\nout there anyway. So anyway, we want to make this video half\nan hour, so we're going to carry on to probably the third most common method, which is the\npunch cut. So- CP: The punch cut is very simple and super\nconvenient. These things you can carry on a key chain,\nI've got one on my house keys for example, for whenever I go out, and somebody offers\nme a cigar, and I decide \u201coh, I'd like a cigar.\u201d I realize well, I've got a cutter on me, so\nit's absolutely fine. Paul Anthony: Well, it's simpler for me with\nthese scissors. I mean, I fold these up when I'm wearing a\nwaist coat, I actually use it on the double end of my Albert chain, and pop it in there. So I find these just as convenient, but what\nare the benefits to the draw, maybe accumulation of tar, if you could explain that to the viewers? CP: Well, just like the V cut, you do get\nthis accumulation of tar, which means that you don't take it in. Some say it increases bitterness, some say\nit decreases it. It's really difficult to say. So it's gonna be a question of personal preference. But one of the greatest benefits of this,\na sign of its convenience in just having it in your pocket all the time, is that it is\nsuper easy to do. You can do this on almost any ring gauge cigar. If your cigar is much too big to fit in a\nguillotine, you can just get one of these out and do several punches. So let's quickly- Paul Anthony: I know there are several companies,\nsuch as Davidoff, and who have like, a ring gauge punch with 3 different gauges, and I\nknow some of the Lotus jet flame lighters have a little pullout punch with 2 different\ngauges as well, so. We just have this Xikar one, which is one\nstandard kind of ring gauge or punch, but you can increase or decrease the whole size,\ndepending on what instrument you're going to be using here. CP: So all you do is apply a little bit of\npressure onto the center of the cap, and you twist until the punch sinks into the cigar's\nhead. And then you pull it out and you have the\ncap inside here, so you can flick that out when you close it, and you have a cut cigar. Paul Anthony: Nice. CP: Super ideal, and if it's too tight for\nyou, you just do another one on the side, on the side, just above, until you have the\nperfect draw. Paul Anthony: Yeah. I've even heard guys on kind of these Perfecto\nor Torpedo sized ones, instead of doing the punch directly on the end of the cigar, they\nactually end it to the side of the cigar. CP: Yeah. Paul Anthony: Which is kind of interesting. CP: It's crazy. Paul Anthony: Again. But moving onto odd shaped cigars, such as\nthis little Camacho Perfecto here, I mean, I would ... personally, I'm probably just\ngoing to \u201ctch\u201d, straight guillotine it, but I know Charles Philippe, you have your\nown method for cutting these kind of cigars. CP: Yeah. Well, I don't like the tight draw on Perfectos. When you cut ... either you cut too high and\nthe draw is way too tight, either you cut too low and the flag leaf normally, the cap\non this is quite low as well, because the makers are aware of this. But if you cut too low, then it's just too\nmuch of a draw. So what I like to do, is using a guillotine\ncut, rather than cut at a straight angle, I cut slightly at an angle like this. And then by snipping here, I have this at\na jolly angle. This opens up the draw, makes it slightly\neasier to smoke, and you have the best of both worlds. You don't have something that's too big on\na straight cut, or too low. And if you feel that it's too tight for any\nreason, you can just work your way up the cigar. Obviously be bearing in mind that you have\nsome cap, so you can't go too high, but you do have that freedom. Paul Anthony: I think what it basically boils\ndown to is a lot of personal preference. CP: Oh, yeah. Paul Anthony: In reality, we're talking about\ndraw of cigar, which is basically the amount of air you can pull through that cigar, which\nthe more air, typically the more smoke. Obviously that's going to affect the longevity\nor time of smoke as well. Sometimes it could be convenience of, you're\nobviously not going to put this in your pocket, where the scissors or the punch you may be\nable to. In a pinch, as we mentioned earlier, there\nare several other ways that you could potentially cut a cigar. I know you're in favor of the straight razor\ncut. CP: Yes. So ... we talk about DIY methods. You hear about people cutting them with their\nteeth. Now, there are some people who are able to\nmaster this perfectly, but normally, you end up having tobacco salad in your mouth. Paul Anthony: It's kind of seen as bad etiquette\nas well. CP: It is bad etiquette. Paul Anthony: I mean, in the good old days,\nWild West, chomping it off? No problem. But I mean, these are luxury items. We're talking 10, 20, 30 bucks, potentially,\nfor a cigar. You want to make ... that's why we want to\nalways cut above the cap. We don't want to have an unraveling event,\nand using your teeth is going to ... I suppose, pocket knives, you were saying earlier? CP: Pocket knives are never, or very rarely\nsharp enough to cut through a cigar. You end up crushing it more than anything\nelse, damaging the wrapper, the binder, and it will fall apart in your hands. But a straight razor, or a razor blade, if\nyou're very careful, you can sort of bread knife it through without putting too much\npressure, and you can have a really good cut with one of those. I mean, that's what I did, if you look here\nin the video of the biggest cigar that we've ever smoked- Paul Anthony: The Imperator! CP: Which was absolutely crazy, but there\nwas nothing I had in mind- Paul Anthony: Charles actually did get it\nthe right to vote, in the end. He petitioned in France, and you know what\nthose guys are like. Anyway. CP: Center of human rights. Paul Anthony: So yeah. I mean, there are different ways to do it. I mean, there's the match through the end,\nagain. That's kind of a quasi punch method. CP: And it's very ... the match is so tight,\nit can be quite painful. Paul Anthony: The draw is like, impossible. So you know, we definitely recommend getting\nthe right tool for the job, even if it's one of these couple of dollar cutters or for free\nat your cigar bar for a basic guillotine. I think this sort of thing is around a hundred. I mean, we have a Xikar lighter and cutter\ncombo, I think that's just over a hundred. We're looking at fifty bucks, probably forty\nbucks, forty, fifty bucks. I mean again, if you explore different methods\nand then maybe go for something a bit more. Say if your friend's got a V cutter, maybe\nask to borrow it, and then try a few cigars, see how you like the draw. Maybe you like, you know, a different kind\nof cut on a Perfecto or Torpedo than you do on a kind of regular shaped cigar. So just kind of experiment with it, this is\n... everyone experiences cigars differently, everyone enjoys them in different ways, different\nflavor profiles. Different times of day, you might want more\nsmoke, less smoke, who knows. So it's good to have a ... you know, here\nat the studio we have pretty much every option under the sun. On a standard Parejo cigar such as this, I'm\ntypically gonna favor the straight cut, personally. And if you want a what, is it Figurado type\nof cigar? One that domes in? I'm usually going to start with a straight\nguillotine cut and then maybe angle it like you do off the bat, with the guillotine. I've tried punch, I've tried V cut. Sometimes I just mess around with them just\nto see, especially a cigar I smoke often, just to see if it changes the flavor profile,\nbut that's the one that I'm going to typically rely on. Charles Philippe, what are your favorite cuts? CP: Well for me, it really depends on the\nVitola. So with a typically Parejo, I'm going to do\nprobably a straight cut. If I'm in the house, maybe a V cut, I really\nlike those. But if I'm out and about, I keep a punch cut\non me all the time when I'm walking the dogs for example, I'll just do a punch cut and\nmove on. But with a Figurado like this, I do like doing\nan angle and working my way up until I find that perfect draw. Unlike Paul, I like a little bit or like a\ndecent resistance when I take in the smoke, so we're very different in that respect. You like quite fuller smoke, and I like it\nto fight back. Paul Anthony: Which kind of ... I'm kind of\na new world smoke kind of guy. I just find the draw on old world Cubans,\nif you weren't aware, but we're talking about Cuban cigars. A lot of them have a very hard draw, and I\ndo definitely prefer ... especially with this Kimatra, they have this power band style. I don't want to push Kimatra too hard, but\nI do find the draw nice and light. I don't want to just suck it through like\nI'm just breathing, but. I do prefer a lighter draw. CP: Well, that cooking method is world renowned. It's very, very good. Paul Anthony: So anyway, we don't want to\ngo too far down rabbit holes here. So today, we covered the 3 main types of cuts. Guillotines, punch, and V cut. We also talked about some of the other types\nof cuts and how you may not want to use them, and how you should be careful, especially\nwith straight razors. You know, if any of the words or phrases we\nused in this video were unfamiliar to you guys, we have additional videos and references\nbelow on the cigar anatomy, such as head, cap, foot, Vitola, if we're talking about\ndifferent cigar sizes and shapes, all of those resources are below. We all have to start somewhere, and we're\nstill on our learning journey here at Bespoke Unit. So with that being said, if any of you seasoned\nexperts or even noobs out there have additional questions for us, please feel free to enter\nthem in the comments section below. We always love to see what you guys have to\nsay. Anything constructive is great. Trolls, we love ya, keep them coming. They always make us laugh at the office. So with that being said, my name is Paul Anthony. CP: I'm CP. Paul Anthony: And from all of us here at Bespoke\nUnit, we'll see you next time. CP: Take care.", "fB4ouI_z1_E": "hello my friends and hohoho to you from Nick libretti here at JR cigars calm very special top-5 we have during this holiday season now I created this pack and created

this is able folks for now is going to be part 45 my series of Cosmos cigar occupy 45 now we're covering cheap cutters cheap cigar cutters now a cheap cigar cutter in my opinion would be so dark cutter that's probably under ten dollars so most commonly we go to tobacconist or smoke shop whatever you will see these cheap cigar cutters near the counter that are plastic and they look like this I'm just covering up the information on this see this is a cheap cigar cutter this is this cost me I believe oh it's been so excited i bought the cigar kinda long i have a lot of these cigar cutters they're cheap and made our plastic right here they have a sharp enough blade to cut a cigar i even take these on vacation why mutt in like Vermont or Selena because they're on if I lose them as I big deal this is like two bucks I think you can get these really cheap cigar cutters these are plastic cutters for two dollars three dollars four dollars five dollars at tobacconist or smoke shop so they good in general they're fine there's nothing wrong with them just keep in mind some of the odd downsize the cigar cutters cheap cigar cutters are the blades are sharp and say as I car or um or these up like the perfect the perfect cuban crafters cutter the blade might not be as sharp also they don't cover lifetime warranty so if you do break it if you do damage it you are kind of out two dollars which is not a big deal really so the point I make is nothing wrong with them cheap cigar cutters are nice and general they are found under ten dollars back & S or smoke shop or online they're nice the only like I said the only downside is the blade is iron sharp it's probably cheaper material they're using for the blade the metal in the they don't electron warranty so if you break it the end of the was when price is if you break it you're out of cigar cutter you can't replace it you can't just call them up and say well I broke my cigar cutter I want a replacement so but really two dollars three dollars five dollars they're not they're not bad I mean for a beginner to our smoker who's just trying out two hours pretty nice to their Hut pretty nice cigar cutter I mean pretty nice there's no wrong with them they're nice they're um pretty cool they have the nameless through our store on number this one says watched a cigar and framingham massachusetts so they're nice as comparison to expensive cigar cutter you know at twenty dollar thirty dollars cigar cutter us if you $60 cigar cutter not nearly as good in the sense that they don't have a lifetime warranty in the sense of the blade is probably higher quality material also the material this is made out of this plastic so these the metal cigar cutters are probably more durable if you were to drop it if you were to damage it so that's the disadvantages but overall not bad if you're just looking for a starter cigar cutter key or wrong no anyway how it's going to first want to index where we have a pipe rack review by", "7Gl2YJGD8uk": "hello and thank you for joining me on another episode of rm cigars i'm your host ryan and today we're going to be looking at the latitude zero in toro size this is a cigar that's blended with all olivas tobacco and gets the name where uh the tobacco is grown latitude zero so it says i should get some some pepper some nuts some cream and some caramel out of it it is a nice label good uh good wrapper not very toothy very much looking forward to try this so all right let's get this cut up and toasted all right so within the first couple of puffs right at light up i'm getting a really nice um nutty flavor to it uh definitely getting a little bit of cream and caramel uh on the on the finish overall medium to full body is absolutely correct so all right we're off to a good start let me get firmly into the first third and we'll be back all right and we're back guys this has been a very fun first 10 minutes of a cigar i love oliva and the tobacco in this is just absolutely exquisite i am absolutely getting a little bit of a cream a little bit of a caramel a little bit of a nut the pepper on the retro hail is nice would really firmly suggest this cigar is in that full to or medium to full body like they claim the only issue i am having with it right now is i'm getting a little bit of a wonky burn uh however hopefully i won't have to correct it but may have to here in a minute or two um hopefully it catches up like i said though right off the bat in the first 10 minutes very happy very medium to full body my guess is as it burns along like a lot of medium to full bodies they do have the ability to go up more into that full flavor in that final third looking forward to seeing if that's a transition that comes up again first 10 minutes tasty nuts i am tasting a little cream and i am tasting some caramel so we'll go ahead and get through and a little bit deeper into the first third going into the second third and we'll be back all right guys we are back and i am through the first third uh coming into the second third still have a wonky burn i have had to fix the burn at least once i'm hoping uh that right now it'll start to fix itself a huge clump of ash fell off in one piece so so far as the construction is concerned it's playing out right it seems to be very well outside of the burn as far as the flavors are concerned still getting a little bit of a nuttiness uh still absolutely getting a little bit of a cream and a caramel note going into the second third i'm looking for a little bit more of a transition into a little bit more of a fuller body again it's still firmly a medium to full but i'd like to see it get a little bit more fuller again that's that's my flavor that's my preference the retro hail the pepper on it is actually really really nice and smooth not too aggressive which again i'm a big pepper on the retro hail guy so all right well through the first third off to a great start let's go ahead and check on the second third and we'll be back all right guys uh coming up to the halfway marker here firmly into the second third flavors so far are on pretty much unchanged from the beginning i still have the nut i still have the caramel i still have the cream i'm still getting a strong pepper on the retro hail still enjoying the smoke all the way through from light up so far no real big transition going into the second uh it is becoming a little bit more on the full body uh but not crazy amount yet again hoping that it'll pick up more into the final third as i get down to the nub so um like i said so far very enjoyable stick i love oliva and i love oliva tobacco and this is a very very high rate tobacco for sure very impressed with it as a boutique cigar never really smoked a boutique cigar before and usually stay away from them because they don't last a long time as far as the brand so you're usually always finding a new one once you like it it typically either gets bought up and put into production or goes under and they stop making it so over and all though for a boutique cigar i would absolutely recommend it at this point in time so let me go ahead and finish up with the going into the second or going into the final third and we'll be back start over all right guys coming into the middle of the stick still have a little bit of a wonky burn it's okay i've touched it up a few times i'll touch it up again if i have to don't want to try to touch it up too much and burn it but uh so far from light up very much enjoyed the stick i'm still getting the nuttiness i'm still getting the cream i'm still getting the caramel i'm still getting the pepper on the retro hail overall the stick has slightly moved up into a fuller body uh sticks still not very full but fuller than it was at light up good uh smoke output uh good smoke feel overall very happy with the latitude zero and uh you can't really beat a lead with tobacco so super happy about that for sure all right i will go ahead and be back when i go to take the label off and come into the final third stick around all right we are back and coming into the final third where i will be taking the label off wanted to show you getting a good construction the burn still a little wonky it's not affecting the flavor much uh speaking of flavor i'm still getting the nuttiness i'm still getting the cream still getting the caramel um coming back into the final third i am hoping for a little bit more of a fuller body transition still getting the pepper on the retro hail so let's go ahead and get into this and then we'll be back with my final thoughts all right guys coming safely into the final third right around the middle of the final third actually so there's been a little transition same all right guys coming safely in here to the middle of the final third and there's been a little transition i'm still getting the nuttiness i'm still getting a little bit of the caramel the cream has kind of disappeared a bit but the fullness of the body has absolutely picked up much more of a full body stick now the retro hail is definitely picking up a little bit more on the pepper than it was from light up so all the way through still very happy with it um it is a faster burning stick or else it's just a little cold out here in colorado and i'm smoking a little fast but i am right at around 50 minutes uh and i probably got about another 15 minutes left so i'm right around the right time for a toro about an hour and 10 hour in 15 minutes so all right well i'll be back with my final thoughts on this and uh hang tight all right guys coming up into the final hot nub here and this is where i'll call it quits but you do have some extra time on here if you want to get a toothpick or some sort of a holding device uh to finish it up i'm sure you could smoke it all the way down to the nub if you want overall stick was absolutely fantastic i i loved every bit of it i did have some burn issues i did have to touch up overall nothing that really affected the flavor as far as the flavor going all the way through from startup i it carried through the nuttiness it carried through the caramel i lost the cream going into the third final third into that transition however the overall body of the stick picked up to a solid full body going into the third the pepper is still there i'm loving every bit of it that actually picked up a little bit going into the third so i was happy about that overall the latitude zero and toro size was phenomenal uh i would absolutely recommend this stick if you i've never tried a boutique cigar this would be a good starting point this is a leave a tobacco so if you're familiar with aleva you're at least familiar with the flavor profiles that this should put out again very much enjoyed it i'm sitting right at around an hour so it did burn a little faster but that might have been because it is a little cold and i might be smoking a little faster so until next time thank you so much for watching rm cigars i'm your host ryan and uh till i see you again have a great rest of the week", "DET5dzhy7K8": "celebrating 100 years of collecting and

little gift box so nice for a gift and also they see just keep them just give me a second I'll open it up alright and here it is this is the new Emmy and this is the classic double guillotine cutter but they've basically done it over did a more refined feel and made it a little bit bigger so that it could accommodate up to a 70 ring gauge cigar which is really cool so I'm gonna go ahead and just take it out oh yeah and this has some nice weight to it as well much heavier than previous models which is kind of nice it has stainless steel bleeds as you can see and this particular one comes in I believe there's two different colors that it comes in the one we were sent as a sample this is the metal body cutter beep blast version there's another one that's slightly darker I don't know if it's exactly black or not if you get the newsletter from Zico you can go ahead and check out images of it in that but the new metal body basically it's just engineered to be a little more smoother and give you a little more action and obviously accommodate up to a 70 ring gauge the Sharps the stainless steel is 440 you're gonna get a nice cut every time and it's a bead blast is this one the other one is a gunmetal thing gunmetal finish it would look that out I do not yet have pricing on this but we'll be up on zygarde website starting in the next I'd say five or six days we're right now at the end of January but again for those of you the fans of xikar it's you know it's the same look and feel like you've won from them it's just a little bit heavier and the nice point is that it does accommodate up to the 70 ring gauge cigar so I want to thank the folks at sidecar for sending it over a sample will definitely give this some good use when we're in New York this February and thanks for checking

of the other issues is as you say close to my heart is something I call the sharp life and basically what that is is just enjoying your life with simple things and try to give you some simple tips so you can enjoy yourself a little bit and also not get ripped off which is a big deal to me some of you might be aware that i'm in a cigar and I recently decided to purchase another cigar cutter so I went to a local cigar shop and tried the different types out purchased a cigar just so i can test them there is the v type which shaped kind of like this and you have to hold it in a funky position almost like one of those wrists machines for building up your strength very clumsy you just beggin a cut your finger off then there's another one made by a colibri which kind of looks like this style right here but the problem with it is that it's metal all the way around and metal on metal without proper lubrication is is very difficult to use and they're selling this cutter for about fifty dollars just to cut a cigar and then I discovered this and i believe it's made by zai car and it's very similar and if you can see right here it's actually plastic the blade is quality and they offer a lifetime guarantee and instead of paying fifty dollars for a clear a you could for twenty dollars get this not only that because it's plastic it operates very easy so it's tight it's easy to control and when you put the cigar in it you're not using a lot of strength to have to open up the cigar cutter and when you have to force something you have a greater risk that you'll slip and cut your finger and you don't want to do that because there's not much coming back from this so my recommendation is the zai car plastic on the outside so go could a lifetime warranty and if for some reason something goes wrong with it you just bring it back and get a new one so that's my tip for you I'll eventually get into issues such as scotch cigars how to set up your humidor and a whole slew of other things to help you live the sharp life take care", "WdFmAx03XFY": "it's your guy insomniac here with another accessory review this is something that was sent in by Nick Lewis thank you very much it is called the shuriken maybe that's how you say it here it is you're probably thinking if you haven't actually seen this already on the Internet what the hell are you showing us that does not look like any type of scar accessory I have seen it is a cigar cutter at least it's supposed to be and to be honest I had to go online and figure out what the hell this was or how it was supposed to work when I got it - and as you know I have a cigar channel so I should know how to use most cigar accessories but this thing this is not your traditional cigar cutter and I'm gonna warn you ahead of time there aren't too many good things to say about it first of all let's start with the basics online somewhere I had seen a version of this that I think was metal but this one's not this is some kind of cheap crappy plastic it really it kind of feels like those eggs that you used to get out of the gumball machine years ago - head little prizes in them that's basically what this feels and looks like and the shape of it is just stupid it really wouldn't go in a pocket very well I guess it could go in a cigar travel humidor case decently cuz it's basically I mean it's round enough I guess it could be like a 70 ring gauge type of cigar maybe you would fit in there but it would look ridiculous in your pocket and I have to tell you even something as simple as flattening the ends they did a terrible job with that because you see some scratch marks on here on camera that is because this has fallen off the desk behind me probably about thirty seven times since I've owned it over the course of about a week and that's because it just does not sit totally flat on anything you have to like not move or it falls over and then once it does that the rest of its round so it rolls and that's definitely not the worst thing about this cutter I don't even know if I could say that this is a cutter it doesn't exactly cut the cigar basically you pull the top off and in here you're gonna see what looks like a basket and some blades see if I can get that on camera for you decently there you go you can see it looks like razor blades stuck in a basket and I'm guessing most of you could probably see where that's going this doesn't actually cut us to garbage is why I was confused at first it makes six slits in the end cap of the cigar and that's their version of cutting the cigar now the one really good thing I could say about this design is because it is this kind of angled shape that comes to a point there you can basically I tried this with quite a few different end cap shapes torpedos a couple of Bella koszos regular robust those stuff like that really all of them will go in there and get slit by the six razor blades and I don't know if I'll be able to get this for you on camera but those really aren't completely fixed see if I could there we go now you can see that those are actually flexible so it can accommodate you know larger end cap size cigar going in there but I'm gonna demo it here on camera for you it's just terrible I tell you what it takes some giant grapefruits to be able to put these claims on the actual cutter itself it says clean cut smoother flavor I draw first of all you're not cutting in this cigar so what do you mean by clean cut smoother flavor how in the hell do you get that from the cutter yeah forget the blend or anything about the cigar itself this thing is gonna definitely make sure you have a smoother flavor although it could be considered smoother in one respect I will get to that once I actually cut one on screen for you but it's not necessarily a positive type of smoother again I'll explain that and then I draw I didn't go reading about this thing online so I don't know what the hell that's supposed to mean but everything everybody just puts I - something at this point on their products and they think that that's gonna sell something because wow yeah that sounds kind of like iPod and iPad and I home and everything else that has I this is a piece of plastic with six razor blades in it so anyway how you use it as super simple you actually just take a cigar take the end cap of the cigar and you basically just shove it up in there where those razor blades are you line it up you press it against the razor blade things and then you push that's it you push that's it that's as far as it'll go you pull it back out and then here is your cut cigar now you're probably thinking what cuts cigar exactly hole end cap is still there but you could probably see if you look real closely there are now six slits in the end cap see if I'm trying to get them there as best I can they're so fine that you can barely see them but you could probably see one there another one there and here's another one yes so six slits in the end cap now if you're thinking that doesn't seem like a very good idea for actually getting any type of draw out of the cigar you're a hundred percent right you can't experience this through the camera but I'm telling you that's basically me sucking on the end cap when you hear me in some of my cigar reviews say that the draws is tight as trying to suck a golf ball through a garden hose that type of thing that's this and out this particular cigar I would never test this for the first time on camera and tell you all the draw sucks I use this shuriken or whatever the hell it's called with about like I said probably I don't know 15 or so cigars and sadly I never really got past the first quarter of an inch of trying to choke smoke through it before I then had to grab a regular cutter and cut the end cap off which by the way is a terrible idea not that you'd ever want to try to cut a cigar twice anyway but when you put six slits into the end cap of the cigar they go down towards the end cap seam on all sides so then when you try to actually cut it with a regular cutter you wind up having pieces of the wrapper start to peel it's a giant mess just let me try lighting this and try to show you what kind of smoke output that I get or don't get you can see right there as I was trying to light it you noticed that I didn't light it then you saw me sucking on the damn thing I can't get any smoke through here now with that said I will tell you that quite a few of the cigars that I cut with this shuriken thing if that's how I don't know how you say it I don't really care either because it's so terrible but a lot of those cigars I was able to get some type of smoke through but I mean I was like blue in the face trying to get the smoke through there I don't know maybe you gotta like do this squeeze it now I kinda have something it's just not happening basically this product is a complete and total failure and I never say this on this channel but I'm just gonna throw this out there cuz aI don't care and B this channel is all about being blunt and honest anybody you see review this on YouTube and they say oh it's great no yeah you get definitely get that smoother flavor which by the way I was joking about the smoother flavor because if you're really not getting any smoke through there you really can't have too much of a harsh or overbearing flavor because you're not really getting any flavor well like I was saying anybody you see reviewing this on youtube any of these other cigar reviewers or channels and they're like oh yeah this is great know what a revolutionary new way to cut a cigar and this and that they're bullshitting you and this company probably paid them to do that review and give them a bit of promo and shine so anyway I tried to review this sadly you always see me in cigar cutter and lighter review smoking a cigar at the end of the review telling you to check out patreon and all this [ __ ] well you don't see me smoking anything in this one because this didn't cut it literally this is one of the dumbest and worst ideas I have seen in the cigar industry in the six plus years that I've had this channel going this is absolutely a failure very very long version of terrible doesn't work don't even think about buying one and yeah if you want to see a lot more reviews like this patreon link top of the video description and I will see you all next time [Music]", "UY1n718wwcQ": "what's going on guys today I'm gonna do another cigar review for something that's been sitting in my humidor for over a year now and that is this very interesting cigar with the metal bands is a Macanudo vintage Maduro and this one's the 97 vintage and believe there's a bunch of different in these variants from different years and stuff so this wrapper leaf was cultivated in 1997 ah smells great it smells really good it's most kind of a like herbaceous yeah just smells kind of Irby and woody but yeah the big the big deal about this one is this right here this is the metal bands which I'm going to slide off carefully and that is solid metal so it's a very cool collectible this cigar sells anywhere from like ten to twelve dollars depending on where you get it might even get a little bit cheaper like I said just depends I got this from a local BM or brick and mortar which I like the support I don't I don't buy any cigars online from actually buying cigars I'm not doing any kind of trades I'm buying from a local source and this particular guys a little bit pricey but like I said I don't mind I think I paid twelve or thirteen dollars for this but expect to pay about ten bucks but yeah so I'm gonna take the band off right right out of the gate here just to keep it aside cuz I wanna tear the wrapper but yeah it's a nice thick heavy metal bands it's cool you can put other cigars in here you display this somewhere if you wanted to pretty interesting but yeah it just says Macanudo vintage Maduro on it and of course our foot bands which I'm gonna take off right now says vintage 1997 so oh man yeah it smells it Irby Herbie okay got my cutter here let's get a nice cut on this hmm and that's a really unique flavor interesting oh man just pulled off one of the caps and hopefully that does not do any damage I'll keep an eye on that make sure doesn't unravel on me yeah should be right anyway okay so let's get this lit up using my table lighter here well I'll use it up in the air so you guys can see the lighting of this and a second here I'm going to read all about this cigar because I want to know I don't know offhand what tobacco's are used to read the little blurb on a cigar dealer site what did they say about this cigar all right pull it up actually let's pop this back on for a second see what it'd be like to smoke it with the band different feels weird when I used to holding metal I'm smoking a cigar so imma take it back off but you can certainly smoke it with on there if you like hmm well alright so initial impressions it's a little bit on the sweet side it does have kind of an I don't even know if it I wouldn't say Irby I would say more spice spice like hmmm it tastes a little bit like you ever have a close cigarette it tastes a little bit like that but it's not like a strong clove waiver just has something similar to that going on some kind of a spice going on there definitely a little bit of wood enos as well pretty good though I like it it's got a deep dark flavor so anyway I'm with this rest for a second let's read some of this hype alright this is off of a cigars internationals website but pretty sure it's the same most places so introducing the first Maduro within the highly regarded Macanudo vintage series this limited production handmade employees the very best Connecticut broadleaf wrapper leaves from a small crop called of a 1997 and selected at an extra fermented to perfection this dark and oily leaf conceal conceals they carefully blend the recipe of Nicaraguan Brazilian and dominican long fillers okay so there's Nicaraguan Brazilian and Dominican for the filler lost my spot the result is a deep rich flavor that's truly Macanudo smooth and consists in each Macanudo vintage Maduro 1997 produces a dork Maduro flavor with ample flavor ample flavor and soothingly sweet aftertaste yes it's a metal band blah blah blah alright so there we go I think there's two different sizes for this cigar this is the row busto five and a half by 50 I believe they also make one that's a little bit longer I think it's a taper torpedo or something like that so yeah it's off to a really good start I like it I tend to like nice dark cigars and this one is certainly on the dark side not quite black just a really deep rich brown it's good it's got a lot of flavor but I don't feel I really don't feel a lot of strength at all so we'll see but anyway yeah just gonna smoke on this for a little while sit back and dry myself relax enjoy this beautiful weather and I'll see you guys soon with an update all right just a quick tidbit I have a cigar ring gauge app and I was using this to see exactly you know what size this ring gauge is for the the bands and it is exactly a size 56 like on the nose the inner diameter here now this is supposed to be a 50 ring gauge cigar you can see that it does you know it's not it's not really tight on here like I don't feel like I'm gonna damage the wrapper you know I can go through the whole cigar for one or two but you know it's not so loose it's falling off so maybe I mean that's saying a 56 maybe 54 56 to give you a reference my wedding band is a size 12 and if it's my finger pretty much the same as a wedding band so I want to say a size 12 ring like an actual ring gauge but as far as the cigar ring gauge 5456 something like that case you're wondering you know some people want to might want to get the cigar literally to where this is a ring you know and one of the fingers who knows it doesn't fit my fat thumb but uh yeah interesting I'm sure you can come up with a way to use that for something but anyway that's pretty much all I wanted to say another quick update nothing change with the flavor anything but I was reading something interesting about Macanudo because I was pretty sure Macanudos were made in Jamaica and they used to be originally from Jamaica but now it's owned by where's a general general cigar company which owns a bunch of different brands and they're currently made in the Dominican Republic I'm trying to figure out when when that happened cars cuz these leaves were harvested in 97 right so let's read a little history about Macanudo I was wondering if these were visited original Jamaican grown leaf and then has you know current fillers Macanudo was originally a name of a front mark produced in Guatemala by the makers of the Cuban brand of Punch interesting in 1971 general cigar which had acquired rights to the name outside of Cuba introduced a completely distinct Macanudo as a brand until itself unto itself developed in Jamaica under leadership of Ramon Sifuentes a veteran of Cuban cigar maker Porteous production the Macanudo line under general cigar shifted from Jamaica to the Dominican Republic in October 2000 so interesting so general cigar what own instance 71 but they switched over in 2002 Dominican Republic so I'm assuming maybe that yeah the the wrapper on this one is from Jamaica grown in Jamaica anyway and then the all the filler and stuff was done in Dominican Republic it's interesting just like any other industry like I related to knives obviously because I know a lot about the knife industry but there's just so many ties between companies and stuff people don't even know there's this brand and this brand this brand but this person owns these three brands and well this person is making these knives for this person same thing with cigars there's a lot a lot of intermingling you know what I mean a lot of stuff cross cross I don't know ownership and company and a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff essentially what I'm trying to get at here but it's all really interesting if you like cigars you know the whole hobby of cigars and getting into different brands and stuff it's good to educate yourself and be knowledgeable about what you're smoking where it came from you know who owns it what else they do if you like a cigar maybe you try another one from their sister company or another one from that company I think that's generally what people do when you're especially when you're getting into cigars for the first time some people tried a bunch of cigars found when they like and that's all they smoke that's one type of cigar smoker and then there's me and some of you guys watching it is the cigar smoker that loves just trying yourself all the time I'm constantly trying your cigars is there's a bunch that I really really enjoy but I like the journey I like trying new things you know so that's why I try different ones almost every time I smoke but yeah if I like a certain cigar then I'll be interested in that particular brand or I'll look it up and say okay well that company owns this brand too maybe I'll like those cigars maybe it has some of the same tobacco in it you know it's just interesting to me maybe not to everyone but hey if you're watching cigar Review it's probably interesting to you too all right guys I'm back almost done with this I'm gonna put this out soon cuz it starting to get really hot and the flavors are getting lost you know once you get towards the end of smoking cigar and everything starts tasting like an ashtray you're done with it you don't have to smoke it to that like you know if you're smoking a cigar with a roach clip here you're more about getting your best bang for the buck and you're probably better off with buying a big ol bundle of $1.00 cigars but anyway my idea is once you're not enjoying it anymore get rid of it I don't care if you smokes you know five minutes if you're not enjoying that cigar put it out what's the point right I don't see it as a waste of money or a wasted cigar the whole point is actually enjoy it and once that stops you're done smoking but anyway for me it's this point it's starting to get too warm where the flavors like I said they're just totally lost and just kind of tastes like a shiness so I'm think one more puff and actually let this rest and go out by itself so yeah flavors throughout the whole thing it's been pretty much the same there's that little bit of underlining spice mostly a sweeter wood flavor not sweet like candy or anything and not sweet like fake sugary sweet just like a natural sweet you know kind of thing going on with the wood flavor so it's predominantly wood there is something special in there though that I can't quite put my finger on it the best way to describe it is somewhat floral if you ever drank rose water you know it tastes how flowers smell you know I mean it doesn't doesn't taste like I'm smoking flowers but it's subtle it's in there a little bit so I think that's an underlying flavor here is kind of a floral thing going on but yeah it was a really good steak it did need a touch-up I probably should have filmed it but it started canoeing a little bit so I did have to touch it up a little bit on the one side but then after that kind of self corrected in his fine but yeah it was a really enjoyable cigar I did learn a little bit more I was tempted to turn the camera back on but I promised I wouldn't tell it's done the band besides being cool and catching your eye at the smoke shop it does serve a purpose and it's there to be a built-in humidifying device not to humidify but a humidifying checker let's just say now the idea behind this is that when you get these cigars the ring should be able to just barely move back and forth okay not super tight not super loose if the humidity in your humidor is too low and your cigars start drying out you will find that your band gets a lot looser okay I like that hey you do and vice versa if your amenity is too high and the cigars actually swell up because they're too moist it will be really really tight you won't be able to move it so it's kind of cool to have one of these in your humidor and every now and again check you know and see if you find it's getting loose your cigars are probably drying out and shrinking a little bit and like I said vice versa if you can't move this thing won't budge anywhere you might be swelling up your cigars but too much humidity now I wouldn't just rely on this solely obviously you want a hygrometer which checks the humidity in your humidor Digital definitely preferred those the ones that come with your humidors they usually stink they're not very accurate so I would highly recommend getting investing in a digital one if you do have some decent cigars in there and you don't want to go bad or anything but yeah pretty interesting I like that pretty cool so that is pretty much it I am at a coffee and now done with the cigar I think I'm gonna go back to some night testing and some other stuff play with gust for a little bit though cuz uh you just woke up from his nap but you know just wanna thank you guys for watching I appreciate it if you've had this cigar let me know you think down below in the comment section Oh ease up for cigar suggestions however I'm probably not gonna buy any for a pretty long time I have plenty alright so before I go we're gonna take a look at this band one more time and I will say that this is definitely without a doubt a gimmick however it's a gimmick that worked I went in this cigar shop when I bought this and I had nothing specific in mind I just wanted to browse just wanted to see what he had and this thing stood out and I had to get it so it worked caught my eye as it was supposed to and I'm glad I tried it but honestly without the metal bands I may not have even picked this cigar I would have picked something else so it does work as a gimmick but I'm glad I tried it because it is a pretty darn good cigar so I would recommend it so you go thanks for watching hope you guys have a wonderful day and I'll see you soon take care", "qN7nxbwzEeM": "[Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so [Music] you", "8R2ADVvaHUg": "this is a close-up of a Fidel Oh cut cigar and as you can see there are slits their razor thin that are cut around the outer circumference of the cap and typically whenever I smoke a cigar with the Fidel oh cut I like to start off and really get the cigar ramped up so I'll tend to put some pressure by biting down at the beginning and if you notice I'm putting a little pressure on here and the slits kind of open up a little bit and what that does is it allows the draw the draw to speed up and it gets the cigar a little hotter quicker but not too hot you can control it and that ramps the flavor up a little bit faster when you just start smoking a cigar", "o_vV3AVZmiM": "[Music] you", "X-zCUr8W0OI": "hi folks how's it going I had engraved a cigar cutter you can see it right here so what you do is you make it work like this so you could just to go in and just snap it and cut it so so this is this is my design I just drew on it by freehand and then I cut a little bit of scrolls and wrote Cuba savanna on it this piece was originally um like it was pure pure blank so not nothing was on it I did I did the scribe the border around and I did the leaf border on the inside the same on the other side so and Di's some you can see I've cut the background out on all four sides painted it black and it's pretty much it and on the other side it's basically the same except it's got little tiny backbones and here scroll backbones and the same leaf border on the outside so I have to I painted it so I have to expand it a little bit because I still got some some paint like paint build up on some areas but yeah pretty happy with it this is stainless steel so it was it was a bit harder to cut but no problem for carbide drivers and bit of pressure so I used like half a bar or 0.6 of bars or something like that use the bit more air pressure to cut this stainless steel but anyway it's no problem I wish I could show you the progress but I just figured that since I don't have a microscope it's it's it's a real hassle for me to use the camera and try to show you how I engrave it because I can mess up things and you get the idea so hopefully with time I can invest in some microscope and maybe I can show you a bit better but anyway anyway if I don't know that's just to set up I have for now so everybody thanks for watching hope you enjoyed the video and I'll keep you posted on some more work that I do in the future so thanks for watching and Cheers", "rCb3R363rMc": "okay yeah hi this is Jordyn customs back right here a look at the tip on the back you can see the construction there's a cap that's rolled on separately you don't want to cut too much and cut down there won't draw properly we'll start getting to back on your mouth you cut there you won't take up enough so you want to kind of beam right there so you just have a little bit sticking out slowly and you snip it and that is how you say recording town hi this is Jordan from crusty tobacco and today I'm going to show you how to put a cigar with the metal cheaper so just like our unreliable plastic version caps Nystrom metal version features essentially the same thing just a little bit better construction ask you longer a few extra bucks and it's better so I have here a custom cigar or ym Associates we can make custom system or for you same way so you want to aim for your tip right there you want to just take off the cap not too much not too little you cut it there that's too much you cut it there that's too little so you want to just kind of aim get it just right snip the tip and that is how you cut a smart with a metal you", "0qELE7BD8MI": "hello everybody back here again for a little view I guess I'd say unboxing but this was really not in a box per se it's just a little red box was shipped in it came in a multiple different items i received it as a gift so not exactly certain a lot of the behind-the-scenes information about this i guess one thing i do know about it is the fact that it was made in england i've got a cold close up pictures i'm going to show you I'll clip in here probably four and after this video this is a vintage lowest hold old stock still new in a warehouse was found it savvy cutter for cigars and basically it's just a real simple little design I had a really crappy exits right here I had a really crappy plastic one was not a fan of it all actually stopped using it because I disliked it so much and i pretty much only used the B cutter when I was at a buddy mines place and that's who gave me this V cutter so basically I don't know if he's telling me he's tired of loaned me his when I was up there or if he wanted me to have a v cut her when I was at home so I was kinda always looking forward to that why would his place kind of a little tight over so now I have one here and I'm also kind of glad of that because I won't have to feel the need to use a beat cutter every time it his place cuz son cigars you don't need the V cutter as much so and for my first cut on this little thing here I just got a tiny little short fence ayka cigar really small one um this I don't think would handle a giant like 60 gauge like that but I'm gonna do a couple more cuts on it with some bigger cigars I've got some stuff laying around and I'll if I don't get it up in the video I'll at least put a comment down below how it works on larger ring cigars also so pretty much we want to do when you're cutting a veto cigar is obviously it's super simple it's not lining up at the regular cut off and cut stuff because you're you have it divot I'm not sure you notice they'll be some pictures up on here that dent you just put the cigar in there about as far as you can you don't push it hard wait this late in there and then just squeeze down with your fingers and you get a nice little V cut and I don't know if this is going to show up here or not I'll get a couple pictures of it to show you it done a really great job completely happy with the result also this here is super easy to clean out some get a little hard to clean out in there this one's not bad at all just a little simple blow on it and knocks all the tobacco out of there so definitely a fan of this super small super easy if the guy want to throw it in there who Fodor through their pocket and like that um it's actually small enough I would like to see some kind of ring or something on it so a guy could make that into a keychain I might have to look into it there's actually a set screw on the back here that allowed this top part to come off when it was put together I might turn actually drill a hole in that thing and turn us into a keychain um don't we know why so don't usually carry a big key chain around but be something kind of need to eliminate what I have all right now and replace it with this is it be something kind of some kind of different maybe conversation starter people see your keys that kind of thing so pretty much that's what we got here um it's an Orlok brand oh r l ike a great little product out of you know mayo is made in England so super heavy super sturdy and great little cut thanks for watching hope you enjoy this have yourself a city for a wonderful day and I'll see you later", "GgA1ncvzCuU": "everybody mark from stick review.com here and today we're bringing you another accessory review this is brought to us by our friends at psycorps and actually had posted a

definitely dig different one-on-ones thanks for checking out stick review calm you", "qSl7SyVsD0A": "hey everybody its Andy hope everyone is doing well gonna add another video to the maybe a little bit educational or informative series here about cigars this one's gonna be very basic as I'm sure you can tell already talk about the different ways to cut a cigar or in other words get it ready to be able to smoke now this is aimed at the brand new cigar smoker or maybe somebody who hasn't even smoked cigars yet just think about getting into the hobby it can be very intimidating with all the different equipment that you can buy you don't have to buy it but where do you start is it something you want to invest in so we'll take a look here so our goal with cutting the cigar when you buy any kind of premium cigar you're gonna have one end that's the foot that's open we can see the tobacco leaves rolled in there it's got a binder which would be very similar to this outside leaf and then the wrapper which is the outside leaf that's a single leaf and we'll see we can there we go there's the scene so it's rolled around here's the seam when the wrapper just gets rolled around itself around the cigar and it needs something to keep it there something to hold it in place while you smoke so that it doesn't start to unravel that's going to be the cap or any number of caps the cap can be one two three sometimes a specialty I don't want a novelty cigar but maybe a special edition cigar will have more than three three is usually the limit and the cap is just an extra piece of tobacco or multiple pieces of tobacco that has the cigar glue that they stick on so as we can see on this example it's a double cap you can see the edge there right at the top of my fingernail there's one circular piece of tobacco put right on top and then underneath this this has a double cap I think you can see that next edge there's another larger piece that's wrapped around it as well now no matter what the quality of cigar no matter how many caps the point of the cap is to keep the wrapper from unwinding that's the only point of the cap a lot people when they see videos like this because I am gonna go through and cut a bunch of cigars say oh my gosh you've ruined the cigars it'll dry out now cap was never intended to keep the cigar from drying out that's what your humidor is for hmm a cigar in a humidor whether it has a cap or whether it's pre-cut is going to be in the exact same humidity conditions as if I would have left it alone again that's up to my humidor and my skills at keeping my humidor anyway all right just have some fun so let's go ahead and get into it we've got the cutters laid out air roughly by style we're gonna look at the guillotine cutters all kinds of different shapes and sizes we're gonna look at the V cutters again a couple different shapes and sizes too to look into got a punch I've got some scissors and maybe some non-traditional items here in case you just don't have the money for accessories you're not sure if cigar smoking is for you you just want to spend a couple bucks on a cigar and see if you like it we'll cover that too so I'm gonna go ahead and get things cleared out and we'll start taking a look alright so we're gonna start with the guillotine cutter these are by far the most common design and the ones that you're gonna find most often you can get anywhere from a really cheap I think this was $2.00 in a cigar shop when when my daughter was born had an emergency c-section didn't have a lot of time to grab things I just went to basically it was a little liquor store that happened to have a humidor inside and this is what they had available they're cheap they are not going to last very long it's not going to be something that you own to get looks but it will open your cigar if you're careful then there's also some styles that have a closed back so these are really nice just for quick easy if you're new it takes a lot of pressure off of you or at least potentially a lot of pressure off of you or if you're experienced it's just nice not to have to think about it if you're in a cigar lounge that doesn't have a lot of bright light it's nice to have well let's go ahead so we've got and these are just a few examples there's way more cutters than this that you can get across but they're all going to work the same way now our goal with this type of cutter we want to find again in this case our double cap we want to cut it to where we it we didn't want to leave we need to leave at least a little bit of whatever the lowest cap is with more than two caps you have a little more wiggle room this bottom cap does happen to be relatively large so that's nice because it gives us a lot of a lot of room to play with we don't want to cut any further in this case what would be down from the head to the foot of the cigar we don't want to cut any further down then wherever that bottom cap is if I could want to start a little higher up if we can just in case we've got to make an additional cut for any reason so I'm gonna start just with the cheapy here just to show it can be done but potentially there could be damaged so what I'm gonna do and doing us through the viewfinder is a little rough but basically gonna take a look line up my cigar to cut just that first cap off and we'll see if we can focus there we go so underneath it you see that we've got the bottom cap plenty of space there I'm pretty much right on the top of the cap right what a lot of people will say is right here kind of where the cigar starts to straighten out not at the very top that's called the shoulder shoulder is usually a good spot to aim for because generally that's going to be where the first cap stops so if you aim for the shoulder and I'm gonna look a little underneath my viewfinder here we line it up we get it ready to go I'm not putting a lot of pressure on the cigar at this moment just holding it in there and with if possible one clean fluid stroke we're gonna come right down alright cheap cigar cutter let's see what that did to the cigar as we can see that lower cap that's gone as you can see from the table watch the tobacco flying everywhere that's not terrible now the risk that we have you can certainly smoke this there's nothing wrong with smoking this cigar at all the risk that you run into is where that seam is and again through the viewfinder on some but broke as you smoke it you run the risk of having that leaf the wrapper leaf start to unroll on you now again you can still smoke it you can hold it in place it's a pain to have to do but technically still smokeable let's take a look at a little nicer only grab another cigar here we'll take a look at another nicer cutter let's use this one you've probably seen this one in a lot of videos from other people the nice thing about having the back is that even through the viewfinder I can see it it's always going to stop my cigar right there I've never come across a cigar where that's too deep there are cigars where you'll have to do multiple cuts just simply because you can't get it any further back but I'd rather do more cuts than cut too deep so here we go we get it lined up and again same idea a fluid stroke as you can see that cut much nicer let me clear that out let's take a look so there we have it we can see our bottom cap is completely intact no cracks we didn't have this is all inside the cutter it at that when it cut all of our tobacco is contained instead of exploding we've got a nice clean clean ish cut at the top that's just cosmetic at that point but that cigars ready to go so all of these are going to work the same with the ones that are closed simple you just press the cigar firmly against the back not with a lot of pressure but firmly give it a little clip with these guys these are the pretty common xikar style you do have to place the cigar in eyeball it up and same idea one clip then you're done and this guy is as far as cutting cigar exactly the same it's a double guillotine cutter this one just happens to be designed a little different take a look at this it's exactly the same as far as how it cuts the cigar just sold in a different package alright so there we go we've got the guillotine cutter cutter excuse me which will give you what's called a straight cut for hopefully obvious obvious reasons go ahead and move on alright next we're going to take a look at a V cutter and I actually only own these two V cutters I don't prefer a V cut but I'll explain that as we get into it so as we can tell the blade itself is in the shape of a V the cigar is going to come in to this side and as it cuts it's obviously going to cut that shape we're going to end up with a V cut in the cigar now the nice thing about V cuts are they are basically automatically built with a stopper they don't work unless they're this relative shape you can't go too far now the bad side is that if you do need to go further in because of maybe a little knot or something at the end or maybe you've got one of those cigars that builds a lot of tar at the at the head there you can't go in and clip it back any further this one cut is as deep as this cutter will ever go it won't go any deeper so again we've got a real cheap one now this one I just recently bought this is one of the newer Calibri it actually does have a straight cut on this side we take a look there's that guillotine action that we saw earlier this one does have two blades but one is stationary yeah there's some debate on the effectiveness of that not what we're going to get into but a little different if we take a look at the design its flipped around upside down compare so here on my left the tip of the blade is coming in first here on my right the edges of the blade are coming in first again these are the only two I own what a lot of people who do like a V cut and have used a lot of V cutters say is this style is potentially a lot less damaging to your cigar than missed having that tip come down first can put a little too much pressure and if that blade isn't super sharp it can cause some damage we'll see if it's as much damage as what we saw earlier with that first cheap guillotine cutter so let's take a look again same type of cigar got that double cap we're gonna place it in and same mechanism as far as making it work oh boy that bounced right off I could even feel it yeah look at that again cheap because get that out of there so no damage I would say we are going to have to cut this again if I were to smoke it right now but I think you can see where the intent to be a V is like I said I could feel the cigar bounce off of that blade it's so dull this one I've found this I can't even remember where I got it or why I got it it I didn't pay for it I know that much maybe one of my buddies gave it to me let's get this out of the way and get a new cigar in so he were gonna go with the colibri so same idea I don't know if you can see it's got the I don't know what you'd call that the little containment area it can only go down so far but same idea we're gonna place it in and much nicer now this is what IV cut is supposed to look like as you can see we've still got the bottom cap together no cracks no damage and then we get a much more distinct V now the reason I don't like the V cut is in my experience with the cigars I smoked and the way I smoked them a v cut tends to get a lot more moisture and tars built up kind of at these fins I guess I don't know what else to call them and I just don't like that it's not necessarily that it hurts the cigar or ruins the experience I just don't like to have that happen now another advantage of a V cut is some of the very large ring cigars this you know even though it's only specific is these can actually cut quite a wide range of shapes from very well maybe not very small with a be cut but up to very large torpedo shapes where the head is comes to a taper very flexible as far as what Dale cut and with some of the very large ring now it's pointless to do on this but what a lot of people who like to smoke the very large ring cigars will do is they'll take their V cut it was in like that give it a turn and do another cut and we've got I believe I've heard this called a cross cut or an X cut with again what this cigar it it's pointless there's no reason to do that but with some of the very large ring cigars that might be what you need to do in order to get enough airflow for the cigar to burn properly so there we go there's a quick look at the V cut we'll go ahead and move on all right and next up we've got a punch so all kinds of different packaging for a punch cut a lot of the bigger tabletop lighters especially will have at least one size of punch built right in and basically all it is is a sharpened metal tube sometimes they'll have a little plunger action to push the little bit to the cap that it keeps in there to push that out to keep it clean sometimes it won't and to use it it's pretty straightforward I think you can probably even if you've never seen a punch cutter before guess what we're doing we're going to take a look at our cap we're gonna line it up and I'm going to look underneath the viewfinder here we're going to line it up at the tip of the cigar give a little twist as we go in and you don't have to go in real far with it and out there we've got it we've removed a section of the cap it's now in there and we'll see if this one lets it come out very good yeah a little bit or not there we go so that's what it punches out so that cigar is ready to smoke now the disadvantage with a punch and why I tend not to I like them as you can see with a regular straight cut we'd be cutting right about here and so all of this would be open and able to draw the air through with our punch and mine is not terribly sharp so we do have a little damage to the cap however we take a look at that second cap again and completely fine so no harm with this so we have a much smaller area to be pulling the smoke through with a very large ring cigar again that's going to cause a lot of burn issues that's gonna be very restrictive again any moisture and stuff is going to start building up at the at that very small opening now again what you can do is you can go in and start coming around and making multiple punches some people have a preferred style they like they'll do like a three leaf clover looking thing you can go for it again the potential advantage to something like this is for a for lack of a better term normal top of a cigar or in other words one that's rounded and then straight sides per a hoe it works for any size one size fits all the only difference would be the bigger the cigar the more punches you may have to make downside is again we've talked about anything with a tapered head not going to work at all for a tapered head or at least be very difficult to make work effectively so again a little bit of give and take punches tend to be even a more expensive punch seems to be slightly less expensive then maybe what would be a comparable price range of another type of cutter because as you can see they are pretty basic you know with punch though I tend not to use one I do have them just you gotta try it right this one was pretty cheap and yeah there you go we've got the punch let's move on to our scissors alright so moving on to the scissors now there's not as many cigar scissors out there as we've seen with the rest not as many companies make them or at least have their name printed on them um the style is going to be mostly the same there are some different styles compared to this but this is probably the most common style of cigar scissors are you going to find these ones fold up to make them a little bit more portable a little safer to throw in your pocket for example and there we have it the blades probably look very familiar from our guillotine cutters and kind of anything is not that I really use these very often but this one has some different kind of tools that fold out from inside the handle which you may or may not ever need to use the idea though is the same as what we've seen so far what these ones we are going to line up the scissors with that first cap we want to make sure again in this case that the second cap that we're clear of the bottom now with the scissors we're going to have a little more controlled action we don't want to quite do the snap as the other ones that we've seen that'll be more prone to damage there's a lot more movement on this I don't know would this be a lever of some sort but more risk for damage so these ones the scissors you do have to use a little more controlled now these scissors are really dull they are not a good quality pair of scissors at all not to say that this brand is bad but this particular pair has seen a lot of use and has become very dull even with the dull pair you can still open the cigar you got to modify your technique a little bit having said that though in my experience this is going to be your most successful option anyway so what we're gonna do is to kind of line up our cigar you can see where we're at there and what well well clear of the bottom of our bottom cap and right now I'm just going to put a little pressure and gently twist and kind of go up twist go up twist what I'm looking to do right now I'm not looking to cut through the cigar I want to basically just score and be able to remove the cap and you can see that's coming off pretty nice as we speak I'm trying to do it through the viewfinder so it's a little wonky but there we go now once we have that cap scored there's less risk of damage then we can come all the way through hello again do the dullness of it this doesn't leave very pretty cut there is gonna be a lot of tobacco flaking off in your mouth if you cut it if you start smoking it straight from here but the key again our main function we've removed the cap we're going to allow airflow and we've not damaged the bottom caps so this cigar is good to smoke even if it doesn't look very nice scissors for me they're more of a novelty cutter I don't travel with them I don't use them very often it's just what I feel like something different I have to be in the mood very specifically to use the scissors which honestly I'm not very often in that mood but there you go cigar scissors now we've gone through most of the I guess what I would call traditional ways to open it let's take a look at some other options if you just don't have access to a cutter and you need to open that cigar now finally now just a quick look at - yeah somewhat non-traditional methods these are not going to win you any points at the local cigar club but they're going to get you to where you can open a cigar golf tee a lot of folks in the pipe community recognize this as a pipe tamper it's multifunctional let's go ahead and add another function so maybe you're out playing golf you didn't bring any cigars but a buddy did and he thought you were bringing the cutter well you can still get into it now this you do want to be careful you want to use a relatively new tee or as long as it has a sharp point now we are going to pierce rather than do a clean cut we are going to kind of punch our way through so we do want to be careful but you can get in and basically chip your way around we're going to make basically our duo makeshift punch here so we're just going to chip our way around getting underneath or not underneath but through maybe I should watch more Sesame Street getting through the cap and gently pull out the material now this is going to take a while you do have a higher risk of damaging the cigar like this honestly if this were my only choice I'd probably decide I didn't need to smoke that cigar that bad look at that I almost pulled it out there's a little vein in there that's not wanting to cut clean there we go so oh I was probably out of frame there as you can see we're on our way to a smokeable cigar again this is not going to look nice it's not going to impress anybody but you're going to be able to smoke your cigar prolly getting a bunch of tobacco in your mouth as well now with a knife a story goes the same for everything we've looked at you do need to have a sharp knife if you have a dull butter knife this isn't going to work now the way I recommend to do it rather than just cutting straight down like that is we're gonna do I don't know in cooking would this be a paring motion you know I'm going to be looking under the viewfinder so sorry but I'm gonna treat this basically the same is how I treat the scissors I'm gonna come through and just start to score the cap your mother idea here is I want to make sure to prevent damage I want to be gentle with it I want to be in control see how we're doing on this side just about to meet up and there we go so I've got the cap off now again at this point looks pretty ugly we got a bunch of tobacco if I did want to come down now and try to straighten out you know I want to be very careful very gentle the way I like to do it and I have done this a few times depending on my needs is just I don't know if you're able to see that while I'm cutting I'm only coming down maybe halfway out of time and then give this cigar a little roll to the side and start cutting down some more just to make that cut a little bit smoother it'll look a little nicer it's not going to necessarily improve the cigar but it's also gonna help to keep the little tobacco bits out of your mouth and there we go if my cigar buddies didn't see me doing that they probably wouldn't notice from a normal smoking distance that I used my knife nothing wrong with it but again pull out a knife at a cigar bar you're probably gonna get some funny looks nobody's gonna want to walk over and say whoa Wow where'd you get that yeah probably just the opposite they'll probably look at you and think you're a turkey but hey you're gonna be able to enjoy your cigar well there we have it those are just some of the different ways to cut a cigar to be able to make it smoke we've got our regular straight guillotine cut we've got our failed me cut so sad we got our fancy I think some people call that a necks cut I've never actually smoked one that I cut like that I guess this will be the first we've got our punch this one is our scissors our raggedy dull scissors and they started with our golf tee and finished with our knife so if you're just looking into getting cigars you don't know what style to pick up I would recommend again finding something double guillotine with a back just to make it a little easier these particular Cuban crafters are pretty cheap and they work again their high recommendations from a lot of different people I would say start there don't go and buy something like this because you will be either replacing it you will be replacing cigars and most likely you're going to be replacing both yeah and everything up so hopefully you found something at least interesting you not know if this taught anybody anything but hopefully you found it interesting let me know if you like this type of video I'd love to keep making more if there's something you'd like to know about or at least know my opinions about feel free to

we're going to go over operation of the BPM when we designed it we designed it to basically strip away everything that you need to know about accessory in order to use them so when you pick up the BTX you can just pull apart to open it up you can also do this one-handed we have some covert handles built into the body here on each side you'll see that there's there's a handle gear and a handle gear upper holding of the BT X is anytime you have the finger grooves lined up with the bottom there's an angle holding pattern and a natural holding pattern zone so and opening it with one hand we actually keep our thumb and forefingers in line and pull up with our next finger the magnets themselves don't act like a spring or spring replacement they only have two modes the magnets are meant to keep it propped open while you position a cut and to lock it closed so it won't open up in your pocket you'll notice with the cutter open that as you move your hand regardless of your holding pattern the cutter wants to move with your hand it's not pushing against your hand like you will notice with some other devices additionally if you're left-handed I have no open the left-handed with my middle finger pressing against floor and my thumb racing the top so I just push it out like so do that one more time for you darling selves so left-handed or right-handed I've also seen some right-handed individuals do Alexa with the index finger pushing down [Music] you [Music]", "2eIIwLcJwuo": "[Music] so [Music] you", "3GLRFlE3X7A": "[Music] hey there here's a pretty unusual and innovative Swiss Army knife this is a Wenger 19th hole cigar cutter it's a retired model as I guess all winger's are now but its model number one six eight eight seven and it's 85 millimeter knife it's like the golf pro but instead of having a little combo tool you know that has the screwdriver cap lift or can opener it has a cigar cutter and so if you are a golfer who likes to smoke cigars this is your Swiss Army knife this actually is not my knife I'm helping a fellow collector and a pen pal who lives outside of the US get this knife so he can give it as a gift to a friend and a fellow golfer so I think this will make a very nice gift so here's the cigar cutter if you've not seen one of these before Wenger made a really effective cigar cutter it's large so it can take off the entire cap of the cigar without just punching a little hole in it or cutting a groove it you can take off the entire cap that's sharpened from both sides and sadly I do not have a cigar today to show you how it works or to smoke I like a good cigar I wish I had one to pop out here and show you how this works I've never tried one myself but I can just tell it's a very effective looking you cannot well you can get this tool still on a Victorinox on one of their evolution knives it's called the cigar 79 it's not a very sexy name but it's like the Evo 14 but it's got the cigar cutter and so you can still get that tool in one Victorinox knife but in addition to that great cigar cutter this being the 19th hole cigar cutter this knife has a lot of specialized golf tools and the first one we'll look at is the cleat tool so the idea here is you could slip this over the base of your golf cleat and tighten it or loosen it and then here we have a divot repair tool now admittedly I am NOT a golfer and I'm a little perplexed by this I don't know how this helps you repair a divot but I think the idea is you stab the the piece of turf and you can put it back with your shoe maybe and not get your hands dirty that's probably the idea or not get your gloves dirty and then the other specialized golf tool on this model is here on the back instead of a corkscrew or a Phillips driver we have a clubface cleaner and the idea here is that on the you know this goes a goes in the grooves of the face of your woods or your irons to clean them out pretty cool and then a couple standard tools that you find on all these 85 millimeter wingers or most of them anyway here's a nail file nail cleaner and then the main blade the main blade on this one is particularly nice I think the buyer will be happy with that so here on the front you see there's a couple of crossed golf clubs those are not inlaid there are silk-screened on there and you could get this I think it normally came in red but obviously you could get it in green and it also came in black and blue there was also like a executive version that was stainless quite rare so you have a stainless 19th hole cigar cutter so that's just a really cool knife Wenger did a really good job of putting specialized tools on their different knives to appeal to different hobbyists and sportsmen I mean some of them that come to mind I know they had one for bicyclists they had one with a choke tube tool for shotgunners they had one for snowboarders one for skiers fishermen golfers they even had one for roller bladers and they've got some for sailors as well and I'm sure that I could go on I'm sure I'm missing several there but they had a lot about cool ideas there for specialized tools so this is a knife I'm glad I had a chance to take a look at it and thank you to the buyer for letting me make a video of it and I'm sure your friend will really really appreciate this this will make a fantastic gift but the 19th hole cigar cutter without a cap lifter or a corkscrew hmm yeah I guess so I guess you can always get your waitress to open your beer or uncork your wine bottle but you know you're not letting her touch your Davidoff or your Monte Cristo thanks for watching and have fun collecting [Music]", "TWdFhHQ9M7o": "i'm insomniac and this is the calibri sv cut two in one cigar cutter who are you for those of you who have a humidor but would like to give your cigars the fine care they deserve the oshkosh premier humidifier is the best no refilling for months as it holds about 10 ounces of water it'll last about 20 times longer than foam sponge in a box humidifiers no chemicals need to be added and because the cellular material is consistently moist it'll last many times longer than other humidifiers with the oshkosh premiere humidifier every opening of your humidor is a symphony of aroma where you're well cared for cigars feel in light just like you're in havana okay first of all anybody who has seen my recent talking cigars video on calibri versus xy car uh probably finds it really ridiculous that i am reviewing a calibri product right now the long story short though is one of the viewers his name is caleb big shout out to caleb he runs the [ __ ] i smoked this group on facebook by the way so uh get down i put it in the video description if you'd like to join that facebook group there's a lot of really cool people there but he said that he had one of these and that it's interesting wanted to know if i wanted to review it so he sent it in i'm going to review it and i'm going to send it back that's also why you will notice here in the close-up that there are some scratches a little bit of dust it's in good shape but it's not brand new so that's why it is like that this is actually his personal piece and it is used but uh here's a close look on camera so like i said really there's no motivation behind this other than the fact that it is interesting he owns one he asked if i wanted to review it so i said sure why the hell not because it actually is pretty interesting that it is a two in one cutter on this side you have a v cutter and on this side you have a regular guillotine style cutter so for those of you who are just plain indecisive it could work and for those of you who like to cut certain head shapes of cigars a certain way it could also work for you so a couple things i noticed before even cutting anything with it it's very heavy it's very thick it's very bulky not very heavy like you can't carry it i mean you can stick this in your pocket but it is going to be a hell of a bulge because being that this is two cigar cutters it is as thick as two cigar cutters it is a very hefty piece i mean if you threw this at somebody at the cigar lounge you could probably knock them out so maybe that's an added benefit to one of these anyway so the mechanism is very simple for this it's one button for both sides at the same time and i'm not 100 sure how i feel about that yet maybe i will have a little bit more insight as to my opinion on that as we get further into the review but you have this metal calibri uh switch so you pull down on that and it springs the whole thing open as you can see you can see through there so there is your v-cut side and on the other side is your guillotine cut side but like i said that one switch opens both sides you cannot operate them independently once it's open one thing that i did notice is that the tolerances are extremely tight you don't have any wiggle can't hear any metal shaking or any type of it's pretty tightly put together well put together definitely well made that's for sure and in terms of the blades i'm going to cut some things for you there on camera but i actually do like the fact that this is a used product only because he's obviously cut a bunch of cigars with this and now i'm gonna cut cigars with it so instead of showing you brand new fresh blades that might wind up dull after 20 cigars you're gonna see one that's already broken in and see how that works now when i first got this in the mail i think it was my brother who actually pointed out when i showed it to him uh he actually said uh that's a terrible design and i'm like why and he brought up the point that no matter which one of these two cutters you're using you're putting the head into the cutter but then as you cut the head it's closing and there's a set of blades on either side that is now blocking whatever bit of end cap you just cut off so it would be stuck inside the cutter now i'm assuming and we're gonna test this here on camera that all you do is open it back up and it will fall out because what i have noticed is that it's not like it's going to get lost in the body of the cutter somewhere i'll see how well i can show this to you on camera but there is a solid bottom in there and in at the top as well so it's not hollow where the blades come down you can see that inside there is a solid piece right down there so it should just trap whatever end caps in there and that's that now personally i'd prefer something with an open back so you could cut it and you don't have end cap left in the cutter but to play devil's advocate here i guess that could also be a plus if you're at a lounge or a friend's house or something like that and you don't want to just clip the cap and have it either fly out of the ashtray or be on the floor or something like that i'm assuming that the end cap would wind up in here that would be pretty neat and then you can put it over the ashtray open it up and discard the extra tobacco so that's a plus or a minus depending on how you look at it so anyway let's test this we'll do guillotine side first i have some kind of random cigar here that i pulled out of the bottom of the humidor well i just found problem number one lining it up is awkward you can't really see it through the other side because as you are trying to come closed on it the blades for the v-cut are in your way of seeing where the end cap seam is and from this side it yes that's actually pretty deep in there so that's a pain in the ass although you do have those kind of you see those two like black walls in there those i suppose could act as some kind of a guide because i noticed that the end cap here hits that but how do you know that that's exactly where you want the cut to be so that's minus number one so far i see this here but i'm just going to use that as a guide because honestly once you put the cigar in there i don't know if you could tell but you can't really see what's going on anymore as to where the end cap is there's just too much stuff going on it's too thick and like i said you can't see through the other side so let's trust that that guide is where this is supposed to be cut and let's line it up okay now the end cap does get trapped in there let's see how easy it is to get it out that's it you open it it falls out so that i do like what i don't like is using those two black walls in there as a guide because this cut the cigar way too far down you can see here i always preach about when you're cutting a cigar you have to cut the cigar slightly smaller than the actual diameter of the cigar itself and you can see here that this basically just chopped it off somewhere between an eighth and a quarter of an inch down and what we have here is a completely straight cut it definitely cut way too far down in fact i don't see any end cap seam at all this cut below the end cap so it cut pretty well it's fairly sharp definitely not the most buttery smooth blades i've used but not bad but the fact that you really can't line up exactly where you want it on the end cap seam so far the guillotine side for me is not very useful so now we'll try the side that most people are probably more excited about because it seems that people love the calibri v cuts now this one i don't believe is going to be an issue whatsoever because the v cut you just stick into the recess and you press the button it's as simple as that there's no lining up the end cap exactly the way you want it so this should be a breeze you just line it up in the recess and let's cut the v-cut sides way way better than the guillotine side and again just as easy you open the cutter back up it does not leave any debris inside not only is the cut good and where i would want it if i were using a v-cutter but the v-cut side just cuts better it's definitely a smoother operation and i'm not talking about the mechanical operation obviously it's the same operation on both sides i'm guessing that the blades for the v cut side regardless of whether or not it's the same steel maybe it's the shape of them are just better because that was a really easy cut just using the top of my finger there as where the guillotine side again wasn't bad but it required a little bit more pressure and it took in a little bit more of the cigar so the v cut side is definitely better and the guillotine side i'm assuming if you cut more than a couple cigars with it you're going to get used to being able to line up the end cap a little bit better i just don't like it though so so far i see the value in the v-cut side but for me that would just equal get a calibri v-cutter another thing i will comment on though is the ergonomics of the curves at the top and bottom here you can see that my fingers fit in there very nicely that is not just for style that works really really well when actually using the cutter your fingers fit exactly where they need to you have a good grip on it and you're able to cut the cigar i think i'll give you one more sample on camera we'll use the v cut side being that this cigar i'm actually going to be smoking and i don't want to screw it up there you go nice cut and this is something that calibri is known for in terms of the v cut that's why a lot of people like calibri v cutters you do get a really deep v if you do like v cuts that is a really nice deep cut and like i said in terms of this particular cutter it is buttery smooth it works very well okay so what do i think of the sv two and one cigar cutter well in terms of value now here's the thing the internet's the internet so i always talk about a price and then you get 15 people i think they're smart in the comments and they say i saw it on this site for five bucks i caught it on cigar bid for 19 okay that's great you can catch a lot of deals on everything from amazon to ebay to i'm talking about the prices that cigar retail sites sell these things for because that's where a lot of people are picking them up and that is basically the asking price for these new so before you leave in the comments oh i got mine a lot cheaper i saw it a lot cheaper i saw these cheaper than the price i'm about to quote and that i probably already put in the spec screen in the beginning as well but the last couple cigar retail sites that i went to were selling this exact model for 75 bucks now 75 dollars seems a bit steep for a cigar cutter but this is two cigar cutters now the problem there is that i don't like one of the two cigar cutters but the good thing about this channel for those of you who've been watching for more than just this one video is that i'm very objective about my conclusions i'm not gonna make a recommendation based on whether or not i like it personally i wouldn't want a giant chunky two-sided cutter but that's just me personally and i don't like the guillotine side here but i'm assuming that if you use it for more time you can become a little bit more comfortable with lining up the end cap seam exactly where you want it although i still mentally kind of take points off on this side because i've used a ton of cigar cutters i smoke a lot of cigars it's not hard for me to cut a cigar this one isn't very helpful in terms of being easy for lining up the end cap seam on the guillotine side so basically this is all a long version of 75 bucks that's a little steep in my opinion for a cutter but when you add in the fact that you're literally getting two cigar cutters and in my opinion this is very handsomely finished you can't feel it obviously through the camera but it is definitely well made heavy really good tolerances i don't think it's a bad value even at 75 bucks so if you own an sv cut two in one cigar cutter definitely feel free to leave some comments down below and let everybody know what you think of yours in the meantime for those of you watching this who are not patreon members this video actually came out a week ago if you'd like early access

the link at the top of the video description alright again big shout out to caleb for sending this in it was an interesting experience and i'll see you all the next review", "Sx-Yx6WraHM": "hey friends it's ryan from rocky mountain cigar show here today we review the kristoff connecticut this is a six and a half by 56 closed foot cigar should be right in that mild to medium and hosts a ecuadorian wrapper a nicaraguan habano seed binder and a quad dominican habano seed filler so again this should be right at around a mild to medium so looking forward to it it does support a nice little uh pigtail on the tip so we're going to go ahead and v-cut that like normal and again it does also have a closed foot so i'm not going to be doing any sort of toasting i'm just going to go ahead right in and light this is i want to taste that wrapper so hang tight and let's get this cut lit okay well right off the bat i'm getting a beautiful cedar note um it's a very beautiful cedar note with a with a nice cream undertone oh man that cedar note is very predominant actually it's right on the front of my mouth too the flavors are not lasting long they are dissipating fairly quick but that beautiful cream on the on the on the back of my throat's really really nice and then it all kind of finishes with a a little bit of a sweet nutty flavor so awesome absolutely no complaints so far to start the smoke itself is is not heavy it does fill the mouth but it certainly doesn't coat it in a way that the flavors last like i said they do dissipate fairly quick after you exhale the smoke but it is a nice nice smooth smoke that does get produced by the stick so overall right it light up very happy so stick around and i'll be back uh as i get a little closer to the or a little deeper into the first third hang right all right well i am at the 12 minute mark and this is actually burning a little fast um no complaints on it so far the construction is just fine uh everything's holding up great the draw is fantastic the smoke production is fantastic the smoke feel is nice and creamy and smooth in the mouth as far as the flavor notes that cedar is by far the most predominant note that i am getting hands down that cream does come out and stick its head out um about halfway through blowing that smoke out to be honest with you is when i really start tasting that cream and it's like in the middle to it's like in the middle to back of my tongue um and once you fully get all the smoke out of your mouth i i start to pick up a little bit of a sweet and nutty flavor at the end at the back of my mouth as well so again getting a strong cedar like super strong cedar no complaints about that at all i love that note um as well as getting that that that beautiful cream note coming through and then it finishes up with kind of a sweet nutty finish so overall the first third of this thing has been very enjoyable so we'll see if i can get any sort of transitions or anything else coming through i would absolutely uh put this in the firm mild category um there's very little to no pepper on the retro hail at all so again no complaints over that it is a connecticut it is what i was expecting but just uh let you guys know if you're looking for a connecticut that is a little bit more on the punchy side this definitely is not although this is still very good so hang tight let me get a little deeper into the first third going into the second and we'll be back all right well no complaints construction wise on this thing it is a solid razor sharp bird line uh and the ash construction that's been there from light up and i've been kind of sort of moving it around a little bit and it hasn't fallen off very happy with that as well the draw is just perfect on it the smoke consistency the smoke makeup is still very smooth and creamy coming through on the mouth feel as far as the flavor notes that cedar note is by far the most prevalent note that i'm getting but i'm also getting a cream note in there too that it's been very pleasant as well as at the very end once you blow all the smoke out i am getting a little bit of a of a sweet nuttiness to it but in the last about five minutes or so i've been able to pick up something new that stuck its head out to say hello a little bit of a vanilla note coming through that as well and again that's happened in about the last five minutes so i'm about 25 minutes into this thing and it is burning fairly fast however very enjoyable so far no complaints at all with the flavor with the construction really even with the burn time it's just burning a touch faster than i would like however let me get a little deeper into the second third chase this with some black coffee real quick hang on let me get a little deeper into the second third and uh we'll be back but i am going to go ahead and ask this because i don't want to wear it and i do think it is going to fall off anytime soon so one good shake away from wearing it so hang tight i'll be back and uh give you some more of my thoughts all right coming up to the band here i'm gonna go ahead and take this off as far as construction is concerned this thing's flawless it's performing beautiful the draw is flawless the build of the cigar seems to be very flawless the burn line is as good as i can ask for and the smoke in the mouth is still very smooth texture-wise and creamy on the mouth as well as far as the flavor notes are concerned that cedar is by far the most flavor i am receiving from this thing from light up with a little bit of a sweet nutty finish as well as that um that vanilla is actually coming through a little bit more from last check in and that cream is obviously still there as well i am about 45 minutes in so this thing did kind of slow down a little bit as far as speed of burn it should last me over an hour at this point for sure so no issues there as well again though those the flavor notes that i've been getting from light up really haven't changed it's just an addition to a beautiful vanilla that came in at about the beginning of the second third uh on the last check-in and has actually still remained now the pepper on the retro hill has picked up slightly now i typically can take a lot of pepper on the retro hail i like a lot of pepper on the retro hail so i'm just now starting to feel the pepper so for me the pepper is just starting to actually kind of peak its head out for other smokiness that might hit you a little differently but as far as my my palate my nose that pepper's just now starting to kind of pick up itself so overall going into this final third very happy with it so let me go ahead and get back to you when i get down to the nub and we'll give you my final thoughts stay around all right well we are back and um this thing is still very cool it's not even burning my fingers at all the draw was absolutely flawless the construction on this thing was flawless the burn line was absolutely fantastic the ash fell off in nice big chunks and the draw was just great no issues at all on the construction the flavor notes i'm getting here in the nub are still very much consistent from the beginning i'm getting that cedar note that cream note a little bit of a of a sweet nutty note as well and that vanilla that peaked its head out going into the second third has kind of dissipated a little bit but is still there it's just a little fainter than it was when it came in um no complaints on this thing at all this was very enjoyable very mild stick and the retro hail had a little bit of a pepper but not to anything too extreme at least not for me uh again i am just very impressed that i am still holding this thing right here and my fingers and my lips are not even getting heated up so um again this thing was absolutely fantastic performed great so if this sounds like something that you're interested in this was the kristoff connecticut in the toro size or what

no way you only caught one right and then Leo right over there he caught one too but none that you can keep but you know why he's having a hard time hey did you get a stick though hey whose cord is that oh this was yours right now throw the bag in its really nice out here though wrong camera go [Music]", "__4rkTllWEE": "hi I'm nada with smoking cigar girl and today I'm going to be reviewing the colibri slice cutter something I like about this cutter right off the bat is the packaging it's a very simple but elegant if is something you want to give to someone as a gift it's just something it's really nice to receive very well thought-out the box that the cutter comes in has a magnetic flat lit so if you want to store the cigar the cutter in the box while you're not using it keeps a cutter nice and safe even if the box takes a tumble the cutter itself has a beautiful pattern on it it's a very smooth finish so you don't feel it but it's something it's nice to take out of your pocket at a cigar bar just looks very sophisticated the casing of the cutter is made of stainless steel and has a high lacquer finish the cutter also has some rubber grips on the side to help pull the cutter while you are opening it up or cutting your cigar makes it less likely to drop it the cutter opens you a simple mechanism that's common to most cutters these days just press down on the button and something I like about this cutter I said you know I haven't found it to stick it all yet and the blades open very smoothly and closed very smoothly as well something is personally difficult for me about the style of cutter is just I find my finger gets in the way when I go to open it so I've gotta just make sure it's out of the way so I get that nice smooth open but that could just be me this cigar cuts up to a 64 ring gauge which is nice especially since I the trend is apparently for bigger ring gauge cigar these days but if you like something smaller like a corona or lancero or busto this will take care of that too obviously I unfortunately do not have a 64 ring gauge cigar to show this cutter on but I do have a six year engaged cigar so up the blades and you can do this one of several ways you know if you want to just visually estimate how much you want to cut off the cigar and really you just don't want to slice off more than the bare minimum to get the cap off you can do that or if you prefer to be on the safe side you can place the cigar down or the cutter down on the table place the cigar into the hole and just cut so looking at the the cut that the cutter made it's a little bit uneven you can tell that the side here is raised a little bit more than the side over here but there's not a lot of there's not a lot of loose tobacco on there that you know could could get in your mouth while you're trying to smoke a cigar it made a fairly clean cut that the blades are nice and sharp so that's a you know well well worth it cutter right there and I've got a 50 ring gauge to try out here and we'll cut it using the old fashioned method rather than putting it on the table and had the same issue a little bit uneven but again nothing is going to affect the smoking of the cigar it didn't rip the wrapper at all it made a nice smooth cut so there you have it it's the colibri slice cutter up to 64 ring gauge and overall just very easy to use and I hope hope you get to enjoy this cutter", "9PGUMrbu-GA": "hey guys welcome back to the old soul I am Lindsay and I'm Erin this tutorial was part of a series that we're doing to check out the other videos that we have look down in the description box down below this one is going to be all about cutters cutting a cigar yes there are many tools yeah let's start with the very basic ok teeth you have teeth you can cut a cigar you're really saying to you absolutely it can be done if you are in a pinch and you don't have a cutter with you and you are around no one that has a cutter and you really just want to have the cigar hopefully have a lighting mechanism you can just I guess you can rub two sticks together if you're using your teeth yeah so you can just with your teeth just take the cap off and you'll have no issue if you have fingernails you can also peel the cap off so you can do that but we're a civilized way to cut a cigar is to have a cutter it's the car accessory cigar accessory we have to have our accessories just don't get too crazy you can go nuts so there's a lot of different kinds the most let start with them is common first most common is going to be a plot you're gonna get this for free at an event or a shop owner will have it and maybe they have freebies but more than likely you'll pay five to ten dollars for a very simple plastic dual blade guillotine and it's called a guillotine because it acts like a guillotine I won't say if they're bad or good so you can get these for pretty cheap if you're gonna buy one I'll leave it at that other two other types this is my personal preference is a pair of scissors these are xikar and I don't know they're very very easy to use they're very sharp design car has lifetime warranty so if there ever if they go bad you can send them back to replace them no questions asked I like this one as well because it has various tools inside that's a bad way to show that and has various tools inside the handles so to bleed your butane or Sweden to bleed you or lighter you can use this tool this is a little flathead screwdriver that you can use to dial back your butane lighter has a little can opener type thingamajiggy and I have heard this one which I rarely use is used for cutting the cellophane off of cigar boxes anyways these scissors are pretty cool 50 bucks got these about five or six years ago they are still sharp and work very well for me today so scissors you can use these another very common one is a punch and I don't have one to show here but I'll have one like maybe right here or yeah well insert a photo right Lyndsey's face or something somewhere a punch is just a very simple circle that's a bleed and you'll just press it into the cap of the cigar twist it around and it'll cut a hole you pull it back and you'll have an opening to your cigar very small usually like on a keychain carry em around yeah and again they're pretty cheap now you could spend more but typically they're very cheap the thing to look out for with a punch cutter is if you're gonna if you're punching a larger cigar like this the hole is going to be a little too small why you can draw through just fine what's going to end up happening is you're gonna have a lot of buildup occur around the hole where the cut is and you're gonna get some tar which is a very bitter taste on the cigar so very grounds if you if you get a punch that has a larger cut size that's good to use on larger cigars if you have one that's smaller you can use it on smaller cigar so just make sure using the appropriate size based on the cigar that you're cutting can you use a punch on a torpedo yes you can actually yeah you can so what's some guys I don't know if we have a torpedo he'll open that this yeah the shitty cigar I don't plan on smoking it we'll take the band off I don't know what those are yeah so again shitty cigar wrappers coming off and everything but it'll prove that or act as an example here so this is a torpedo head what some guys will do is they'll punch in the side here I personally have never done it but you can once or one either side as many personal preference I mean how much do you want to do it or how much is necessary so yeah on a torpedo you can use a punch just punch them to the side of the head and that'll suffice oh my gosh but that being said with a torpedo a and that brings up another cutter a great cutter for a torpedo is av cut or a deep V and again I'll have a pitcher probably right there yeah showing what those look like it's in my experience very good on a torpedo you can use it to cut any type of cigar though this works out really well with the torpedo and and not ruining the wrapper and the cap so deep V or AV cut is good on torpedoes the deep V is my new favorite cut we have to get you one and I don't I just recently I always borrow em from guys that's a lounge or friends so I don't have one of my own yet but I never had an issue with draw when I have a deep V I don't know why maybe it's just a fluke but I feel like it's really easy to cut it's just my new for whatever reason that's my new favorite one and it's all personal preference because Aaron loves the scissors I hate the scissors to me it's hard to cut and if I never I don't know these maybe need to be sharpened as well but I don't think it's as crisp of a cut there's always little I say flutes but like struggle a bit so you got a brush-off at the end and I don't get I don't get that when I have a deep v cut I also I hate these ones in particular are terrible they were freebies but if you get a nice one these I think part of the issue with this is it's plastic it's really light you can get solid heavy ones yeah you see how this like it doesn't open properly if you get a nice one of these these are really good I think a lot of people use this they're just so easy to use on any type of any type of cigar yep and there's with all these cutters there's one for any budget so you can spend as little as you want or you can spend hundreds of dollars you don't need a $70 or $150 cutter to suit your teeth we use this one for a really long time and it's fine it's a little janky but it works and it's a very sharp sharp cut yep yep if there's any other I mean there's there's other gimmicky cutters out there but I've never personally used them I just keep it clean keep it simple straight cut most time is what I do straight cut is what you get with the guillotine or scissors deep-v if I have access to that with a torpedo I'll do a deep v cut on the torpedo but otherwise it's just straight cut across the top is all that I do keep it simple I think that's it that's it that's all I have for cutters okay not too complicated as usual talk to your tobacconists and they can make a good recommendation on brand and type mm-hmm again there's pretty much anything for any person budget size doesn't matter and at your local cigar shops they have the I don't even know what they're called there's like these real heavy cutters and you can test out what for three or four different they'll have cut types on there so if you just want to see which one you like best don't buy any cutters and just test them out right there in the shop yep those those have a V a DP and then two straight cuts depending on the size yeah so anyways cool all right yeah all right so if you guys found

verse its focus ii starts again for the let's see first restricted por suerte so what this is going to be the only visual you like usual it will be a pie chart review tomorrow so anyway this video will focus right now is going to be part 44 my series of high school cigar are 44 now we'll be covering expensive cigar cutters so we are nearing the end of talking about cigar cutters and we are talking about expensive cigar cutters today and tomorrow we will talk about cheap cigar cutters now expensive cigar cutters in my opinion they are cigar cutters that are probably above I would say say twenty to thirty dollars because a cigar cutter really shouldn't cost much that much money I'm you can get really nice to our cutters like I mean my cuban crafters perfect cutter cost me twenty dollars online on ebay it was as a lifetime warranty it was a beautiful cigar cutter with um great blade that's 200 hasta me twenty dollars online with shipping so the point I make is you don't spend a lot of money on cigar cutters a lot of people will look be like you know what I've smell money at the other end a cigar cutter I have to really get the best cigar cutter possible no you don't you can get a really nice cigar cutter for ten dollars now you can if you want to you shouldn't but um you can spend for the very nice I car cutters the very nice V cutters guillotine cutters you can't spend secure sixty dollars which is really ridiculous my book I mean those cigar cutters are nice they were they have a really nice sharp blade they cut really nicely and they probably have lifetime warranty but honestly I wouldn't spend if it's me myself i wouldn't spend much more than twenty dollars on a cigar cutter now you do have the cheaper ones which i'll discuss tomorrow which are the two cutters you can get a tobacconist flight 23 bucks five bucks and those are okay but in general cigar cutters really shouldn't cost much money these all you're doing with it is cutting a cigar so anyway yeah so my the point I make is cigar cutters should be cheap they really should be cheap easy or not it's on like a fancy lighter or a fancy humidor it's just a tool used to tie a cigar so you can get to our cutters they were very expensive that are fifty dollars $100 whatever they have like a stainless steel plat or the nuts you know what has a really fancy really really flashy cool with like silver on them or gold aitken karat gold whatever so but they're really not worth it that's a point I make is they're really not worth it because all you're doing with it is you are beyond i would say beyond $34 it's all for looks i mean some you would argue the sixty dollars like our fighters are really good they have a really sharp blade they have a lifetime warranty but honestly honestly they're not worth in my book I love my cuban crafters perfect cigar cutter has lifetime warranty very nice blade very sharp blade makes a perfect cut god for twenty dollars on ebay so what don't spend a lot of money I mean it's your choice everyone has their right to make their own choice in life but you really don't spend a lot of my answered archivers anyway carbons purpose want to invite"}
